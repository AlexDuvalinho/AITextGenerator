A SOUTH SEA BRIDAL.\n\n\nI saw that island first when it was neither night nor morning.  The moon\nwas to the west, setting, but still broad and bright.  To the east, and\nright amidships of the dawn, which was all pink, the daystar sparkled\nlike a diamond.  The land breeze blew in our faces, and smelt strong of\nwild lime and vanilla: other things besides, but these were the most\nplain; and the chill of it set me sneezing.  I should say I had been for\nyears on a low island near the line, living for the most part solitary\namong natives.  Here was a fresh experience: even the tongue would be\nquite strange to me; and the look of these woods and mountains, and the\nrare smell of them, renewed my blood.\n\nThe captain blew out the binnacle lamp.\n\n“There!” said he, “there goes a bit of smoke, Mr. Wiltshire, behind the\nbreak of the reef.  That’s Falesá, where your station is, the last\nvillage to the east; nobody lives to windward—I don’t know why.  Take my\nglass, and you can make the houses out.”\n\nI took the glass; and the shores leaped nearer, and I saw the tangle of\nthe woods and the breach of the surf, and the brown roofs and the black\ninsides of houses peeped among the trees.\n\n“Do you catch a bit of white there to the east’ard?” the captain\ncontinued.  “That’s your house.  Coral built, stands high, verandah you\ncould walk on three abreast; best station in the South Pacific.  When old\nAdams saw it, he took and shook me by the hand.  ‘I’ve dropped into a\nsoft thing here,’ says he.—‘So you have,’ says I, ‘and time too!’  Poor\nJohnny!  I never saw him again but the once, and then he had changed his\ntune—couldn’t get on with the natives, or the whites, or something; and\nthe next time we came round there he was dead and buried.  I took and put\nup a bit of a stick to him: ‘John Adams, _obit_ eighteen and sixty-eight.\nGo thou and do likewise.’  I missed that man.  I never could see much\nharm in Johnny.”\n\n“What did he die of?” I inquired.\n\n“Some kind of sickness,” says the captain.  “It appears it took him\nsudden.  Seems he got up in the night, and filled up on Pain-Killer and\nKennedy’s Discovery.  No go: he was booked beyond Kennedy.  Then he had\ntried to open a case of gin.  No go again: not strong enough.  Then he\nmust have turned to and run out on the verandah, and capsized over the\nrail.  When they found him, the next day, he was clean crazy—carried on\nall the time about somebody watering his copra.  Poor John!”\n\n“Was it thought to be the island?” I asked.\n\n“Well, it was thought to be the island, or the trouble, or something,” he\nreplied.  “I never could hear but what it was a healthy place.  Our last\nman, Vigours, never turned a hair.  He left because of the beach—said he\nwas afraid of Black Jack and Case and Whistling Jimmie, who was still\nalive at the time, but got drowned soon afterward when drunk.  As for old\nCaptain Randall, he’s been here any time since eighteen-forty,\nforty-five.  I never could see much harm in Billy, nor much change.\nSeems as if he might live to be Old Kafoozleum.  No, I guess it’s\nhealthy.”\n\n“There’s a boat coming now,” said I.  “She’s right in the pass; looks to\nbe a sixteen-foot whale; two white men in the stern sheets.”\n\n“That’s the boat that drowned Whistling Jimmie!” cried the Captain;\n“let’s see the glass.  Yes, that’s Case, sure enough, and the darkie.\nThey’ve got a gallows bad reputation, but you know what a place the beach\nis for talking.  My belief, that Whistling Jimmie was the worst of the\ntrouble; and he’s gone to glory, you see.  What’ll you bet they ain’t\nafter gin?  Lay you five to two they take six cases.”\n\nWhen these two traders came aboard I was pleased with the looks of them\nat once, or, rather, with the looks of both, and the speech of one.  I\nwas sick for white neighbours after my four years at the line, which I\nalways counted years of prison; getting tabooed, and going down to the\nSpeak House to see and get it taken off; buying gin and going on a break,\nand then repenting; sitting in the house at night with the lamp for\ncompany; or walking on the beach and wondering what kind of a fool to\ncall myself for being where I was.  There were no other whites upon my\nisland, and when I sailed to the next, rough customers made the most of\nthe society.  Now to see these two when they came aboard was a pleasure.\nOne was a negro, to be sure; but they were both rigged out smart in\nstriped pyjamas and straw hats, and Case would have passed muster in a\ncity.  He was yellow and smallish, had a hawk’s nose to his face, pale\neyes, and his beard trimmed with scissors.  No man knew his country,\nbeyond he was of English speech; and it was clear he came of a good\nfamily and was splendidly educated.  He was accomplished too; played the\naccordion first-rate; and give him a piece of string or a cork or a pack\nof cards, and he could show you tricks equal to any professional.  He\ncould speak, when he chose, fit for a drawing-room; and when he chose he\ncould blaspheme worse than a Yankee boatswain, and talk smart to sicken a\nKanaka.  The way he thought would pay best at the moment, that was Case’s\nway, and it always seemed to come natural, and like as if he was born to\nit.  He had the courage of a lion and the cunning of a rat; and if he’s\nnot in hell to-day, there’s no such place.  I know but one good point to\nthe man: that he was fond of his wife, and kind to her.  She was a Samoa\nwoman, and dyed her hair red, Samoa style; and when he came to die (as I\nhave to tell of) they found one strange thing—that he had made a will,\nlike a Christian, and the widow got the lot: all his, they said, and all\nBlack Jack’s, and the most of Billy Randall’s in the bargain, for it was\nCase that kept the books.  So she went off home in the schooner _Manu’a_,\nand does the lady to this day in her own place.\n\nBut of all this on that first morning I knew no more than a fly.  Case\nused me like a gentleman and like a friend, made me welcome to Falesá,\nand put his services at my disposal, which was the more helpful from my\nignorance of the native.  All the better part of the day we sat drinking\nbetter acquaintance in the cabin, and I never heard a man talk more to\nthe point.  There was no smarter trader, and none dodgier, in the\nislands.  I thought Falesá seemed to be the right kind of a place; and\nthe more I drank the lighter my heart.  Our last trader had fled the\nplace at half an hour’s notice, taking a chance passage in a labour ship\nfrom up west.  The captain, when he came, had found the station closed,\nthe keys left with the native pastor, and a letter from the runaway,\nconfessing he was fairly frightened of his life.  Since then the firm had\nnot been represented, and of course there was no cargo.  The wind,\nbesides, was fair, the captain hoped he could make his next island by\ndawn, with a good tide, and the business of landing my trade was gone\nabout lively.  There was no call for me to fool with it, Case said;\nnobody would touch my things, everyone was honest in Falesá, only about\nchickens or an odd knife or an odd stick of tobacco; and the best I could\ndo was to sit quiet till the vessel left, then come straight to his\nhouse, see old Captain Randall, the father of the beach, take pot-luck,\nand go home to sleep when it got dark.  So it was high noon, and the\nschooner was under way before I set my foot on shore at Falesá.\n\nI had a glass or two on board; I was just off a long cruise, and the\nground heaved under me like a ship’s deck.  The world was like all new\npainted; my foot went along to music; Falesá might have been Fiddler’s\nGreen, if there is such a place, and more’s the pity if there isn’t!  It\nwas good to foot the grass, to look aloft at the green mountains, to see\nthe men with their green wreaths and the women in their bright dresses,\nred and blue.  On we went, in the strong sun and the cool shadow, liking\nboth; and all the children in the town came trotting after with their\nshaven heads and their brown bodies, and raising a thin kind of a cheer\nin our wake, like crowing poultry.\n\n“By-the-bye,” says Case, “we must get you a wife.”\n\n“That’s so,” said I; “I had forgotten.”\n\nThere was a crowd of girls about us, and I pulled myself up and looked\namong them like a Bashaw.  They were all dressed out for the sake of the\nship being in; and the women of Falesá are a handsome lot to see.  If\nthey have a fault, they are a trifle broad in the beam; and I was just\nthinking so when Case touched me.\n\n“That’s pretty,” says he.\n\nI saw one coming on the other side alone.  She had been fishing; all she\nwore was a chemise, and it was wetted through.  She was young and very\nslender for an island maid, with a long face, a high forehead, and a shy,\nstrange, blindish look, between a cat’s and a baby’s.\n\n“Who’s she?” said I.  “She’ll do.”\n\n“That’s Uma,” said Case, and he called her up and spoke to her in the\nnative.  I didn’t know what he said; but when he was in the midst she\nlooked up at me quick and timid, like a child dodging a blow, then down\nagain, and presently smiled.  She had a wide mouth, the lips and the chin\ncut like any statue’s; and the smile came out for a moment and was gone.\nThen she stood with her head bent, and heard Case to an end, spoke back\nin the pretty Polynesian voice, looking him full in the face, heard him\nagain in answer, and then with an obeisance started off.  I had just a\nshare of the bow, but never another shot of her eye, and there was no\nmore word of smiling.\n\n“I guess it’s all right,” said Case.  “I guess you can have her.  I’ll\nmake it square with the old lady.  You can have your pick of the lot for\na plug of tobacco,” he added, sneering.\n\nI suppose it was the smile stuck in my memory, for I spoke back sharp.\n“She doesn’t look that sort,” I cried.\n\n“I don’t know that she is,” said Case.  “I believe she’s as right as the\nmail.  Keeps to herself, don’t go round with the gang, and that.  O no,\ndon’t you misunderstand me—Uma’s on the square.”  He spoke eager, I\nthought, and that surprised and pleased me.  “Indeed,” he went on, “I\nshouldn’t make so sure of getting her, only she cottoned to the cut of\nyour jib.  All you have to do is to keep dark and let me work the mother\nmy own way; and I’ll bring the girl round to the captain’s for the\nmarriage.”\n\nI didn’t care for the word marriage, and I said so.\n\n“Oh, there’s nothing to hurt in the marriage,” says he.  “Black Jack’s\nthe chaplain.”\n\nBy this time we had come in view of the house of these three white men;\nfor a negro is counted a white man, and so is a Chinese! a strange idea,\nbut common in the islands.  It was a board house with a strip of rickety\nverandah.  The store was to the front, with a counter, scales, and the\npoorest possible display of trade: a case or two of tinned meats; a\nbarrel of hard bread; a few bolts of cotton stuff, not to be compared\nwith mine; the only thing well represented being the contraband, firearms\nand liquor.  “If these are my only rivals,” thinks I, “I should do well\nin Falesá.”  Indeed, there was only the one way they could touch me, and\nthat was with the guns and drink.\n\nIn the back room was old Captain Randall, squatting on the floor native\nfashion, fat and pale, naked to the waist, grey as a badger, and his eyes\nset with drink.  His body was covered with grey hair and crawled over by\nflies; one was in the corner of his eye—he never heeded; and the\nmosquitoes hummed about the man like bees.  Any clean-minded man would\nhave had the creature out at once and buried him; and to see him, and\nthink he was seventy, and remember he had once commanded a ship, and come\nashore in his smart togs, and talked big in bars and consulates, and sat\nin club verandahs, turned me sick and sober.\n\nHe tried to get up when I came in, but that was hopeless; so he reached\nme a hand instead, and stumbled out some salutation.\n\n“Papa’s {1} pretty full this morning,” observed Case.  “We’ve had an\nepidemic here; and Captain Randall takes gin for a prophylactic—don’t\nyou, Papa?”\n\n“Never took such a thing in my life!” cried the captain indignantly.\n“Take gin for my health’s sake, Mr. Wha’s-ever-your-name—’s a\nprecautionary measure.”\n\n“That’s all right, Papa,” said Case.  “But you’ll have to brace up.\nThere’s going to be a marriage—Mr. Wiltshire here is going to get\nspliced.”\n\nThe old man asked to whom.\n\n“To Uma,” said Case.\n\n“Uma!” cried the captain.  “Wha’s he want Uma for?  ’s he come here for\nhis health, anyway?  Wha’ ’n hell’s he want Uma for?”\n\n“Dry up, Papa,” said Case.  “’Tain’t you that’s to marry her.  I guess\nyou’re not her godfather and godmother.  I guess Mr. Wiltshire’s going to\nplease himself.”\n\nWith that he made an excuse to me that he must move about the marriage,\nand left me alone with the poor wretch that was his partner and (to speak\ntruth) his gull.  Trade and station belonged both to Randall; Case and\nthe negro were parasites; they crawled and fed upon him like the flies,\nhe none the wiser.  Indeed, I have no harm to say of Billy Randall beyond\nthe fact that my gorge rose at him, and the time I now passed in his\ncompany was like a nightmare.\n\nThe room was stifling hot and full of flies; for the house was dirty and\nlow and small, and stood in a bad place, behind the village, in the\nborders of the bush, and sheltered from the trade.  The three men’s beds\nwere on the floor, and a litter of pans and dishes.  There was no\nstanding furniture; Randall, when he was violent, tearing it to laths.\nThere I sat and had a meal which was served us by Case’s wife; and there\nI was entertained all day by that remains of man, his tongue stumbling\namong low old jokes and long old stories, and his own wheezy laughter\nalways ready, so that he had no sense of my depression.  He was nipping\ngin all the while.  Sometimes he fell asleep, and awoke again, whimpering\nand shivering, and every now and again he would ask me why I wanted to\nmarry Uma.  “My friend,” I was telling myself all day, “you must not come\nto be an old gentleman like this.”\n\nIt might be four in the afternoon, perhaps, when the back door was thrust\nslowly open, and a strange old native woman crawled into the house almost\non her belly.  She was swathed in black stuff to her heels; her hair was\ngrey in swatches; her face was tattooed, which was not the practice in\nthat island; her eyes big and bright and crazy.  These she fixed upon me\nwith a rapt expression that I saw to be part acting.  She said no plain\nword, but smacked and mumbled with her lips, and hummed aloud, like a\nchild over its Christmas pudding.  She came straight across the house,\nheading for me, and, as soon as she was alongside, caught up my hand and\npurred and crooned over it like a great cat.  From this she slipped into\na kind of song.\n\n“Who the devil’s this?” cried I, for the thing startled me.\n\n“It’s Fa’avao,” says Randall; and I saw he had hitched along the floor\ninto the farthest corner.\n\n“You ain’t afraid of her?” I cried.\n\n“Me ’fraid!” cried the captain.  “My dear friend, I defy her!  I don’t\nlet her put her foot in here, only I suppose ’s different to-day, for the\nmarriage.  ’s Uma’s mother.”\n\n“Well, suppose it is; what’s she carrying on about?”  I asked, more\nirritated, perhaps more frightened, than I cared to show; and the captain\ntold me she was making up a quantity of poetry in my praise because I was\nto marry Uma.  “All right, old lady,” says I, with rather a failure of a\nlaugh, “anything to oblige.  But when you’re done with my hand, you might\nlet me know.”\n\nShe did as though she understood; the song rose into a cry, and stopped;\nthe woman crouched out of the house the same way that she came in, and\nmust have plunged straight into the bush, for when I followed her to the\ndoor she had already vanished.\n\n“These are rum manners,” said I.\n\n“’s a rum crowd,” said the captain, and, to my surprise, he made the sign\nof the cross on his bare bosom.\n\n“Hillo!” says I, “are you a Papist?”\n\nHe repudiated the idea with contempt.  “Hard-shell Baptis’,” said he.\n“But, my dear friend, the Papists got some good ideas too; and tha’ ’s\none of ’em.  You take my advice, and whenever you come across Uma or\nFa’avao or Vigours, or any of that crowd, you take a leaf out o’ the\npriests, and do what I do.  Savvy?” says he, repeated the sign, and\nwinked his dim eye at me.  “No, _sir_!” he broke out again, “no Papists\nhere!” and for a long time entertained me with his religious opinions.\n\nI must have been taken with Uma from the first, or I should certainly\nhave fled from that house, and got into the clean air, and the clean sea,\nor some convenient river—though, it’s true, I was committed to Case; and,\nbesides, I could never have held my head up in that island if I had run\nfrom a girl upon my wedding-night.\n\nThe sun was down, the sky all on fire, and the lamp had been some time\nlighted, when Case came back with Uma and the negro.  She was dressed and\nscented; her kilt was of fine tapa, looking richer in the folds than any\nsilk; her bust, which was of the colour of dark honey, she wore bare only\nfor some half a dozen necklaces of seeds and flowers; and behind her ears\nand in her hair she had the scarlet flowers of the hibiscus.  She showed\nthe best bearing for a bride conceivable, serious and still; and I\nthought shame to stand up with her in that mean house and before that\ngrinning negro.  I thought shame, I say; for the mountebank was dressed\nwith a big paper collar, the book he made believe to read from was an odd\nvolume of a novel, and the words of his service not fit to be set down.\nMy conscience smote me when we joined hands; and when she got her\ncertificate I was tempted to throw up the bargain and confess.  Here is\nthe document.  It was Case that wrote it, signatures and all, in a leaf\nout of the ledger:—\n\n    This is to certify that Uma, daughter of Fa’avao of Falesá, Island of\n    ---, is illegally married to Mr. John Wiltshire for one week, and Mr.\n    John Wiltshire is at liberty to send her to hell when he pleases.\n\n                                                          JOHN BLACKAMOAR.\n                                                    Chaplain to the hulks.\n\n    Extracted from the Register\n    by William T. Randall,\n    Master Mariner.\n\nA nice paper to put in a girl’s hand and see her hide away like gold.  A\nman might easily feel cheap for less.  But it was the practice in these\nparts, and (as I told myself) not the least the fault of us white men,\nbut of the missionaries.  If they had let the natives be, I had never\nneeded this deception, but taken all the wives I wished, and left them\nwhen I pleased, with a clear conscience.\n\nThe more ashamed I was, the more hurry I was in to be gone; and our\ndesires thus jumping together, I made the less remark of a change in the\ntraders.  Case had been all eagerness to keep me; now, as though he had\nattained a purpose, he seemed all eagerness to have me go.  Uma, he said,\ncould show me to my house, and the three bade us farewell indoors.\n\nThe night was nearly come; the village smelt of trees and flowers and the\nsea and bread-fruit-cooking; there came a fine roll of sea from the reef,\nand from a distance, among the woods and houses, many pretty sounds of\nmen and children.  It did me good to breathe free air; it did me good to\nbe done with the captain and see, instead, the creature at my side.  I\nfelt for all the world as though she were some girl at home in the Old\nCountry, and, forgetting myself for the minute, took her hand to walk\nwith.  Her fingers nestled into mine, I heard her breathe deep and quick,\nand all at once she caught my hand to her face and pressed it there.\n“You good!” she cried, and ran ahead of me, and stopped and looked back\nand smiled, and ran ahead of me again, thus guiding me through the edge\nof the bush, and by a quiet way to my own house.\n\nThe truth is, Case had done the courting for me in style—told her I was\nmad to have her, and cared nothing for the consequence; and the poor\nsoul, knowing that which I was still ignorant of, believed it, every\nword, and had her head nigh turned with vanity and gratitude.  Now, of\nall this I had no guess; I was one of those most opposed to any nonsense\nabout native women, having seen so many whites eaten up by their wives’\nrelatives, and made fools of in the bargain; and I told myself I must\nmake a stand at once, and bring her to her bearings.  But she looked so\nquaint and pretty as she ran away and then awaited me, and the thing was\ndone so like a child or a kind dog, that the best I could do was just to\nfollow her whenever she went on, to listen for the fall of her bare feet,\nand to watch in the dusk for the shining of her body.  And there was\nanother thought came in my head.  She played kitten with me now when we\nwere alone; but in the house she had carried it the way a countess might,\nso proud and humble.  And what with her dress—for all there was so little\nof it, and that native enough—what with her fine tapa and fine scents,\nand her red flowers and seeds, that were quite as bright as jewels, only\nlarger—it came over me she was a kind of countess really, dressed to hear\ngreat singers at a concert, and no even mate for a poor trader like\nmyself.\n\nShe was the first in the house; and while I was still without I saw a\nmatch flash and the lamplight kindle in the windows.  The station was a\nwonderful fine place, coral built, with quite a wide verandah, and the\nmain room high and wide.  My chests and cases had been piled in, and made\nrather of a mess; and there, in the thick of the confusion, stood Uma by\nthe table, awaiting me.  Her shadow went all the way up behind her into\nthe hollow of the iron roof; she stood against it bright, the lamplight\nshining on her skin.  I stopped in the door, and she looked at me, not\nspeaking, with eyes that were eager and yet daunted; then she touched\nherself on the bosom.\n\n“Me—your wifie,” she said.  It had never taken me like that before; but\nthe want of her took and shook all through me, like the wind in the luff\nof a sail.\n\nI could not speak if I had wanted; and if I could, I would not.  I was\nashamed to be so much moved about a native, ashamed of the marriage too,\nand the certificate she had treasured in her kilt; and I turned aside and\nmade believe to rummage among my cases.  The first thing I lighted on was\na case of gin, the only one that I had brought; and, partly for the\ngirl’s sake, and partly for horror of the recollections of old Randall,\ntook a sudden resolve.  I prized the lid off.  One by one I drew the\nbottles with a pocket corkscrew, and sent Uma out to pour the stuff from\nthe verandah.\n\nShe came back after the last, and looked at me puzzled like.\n\n“No good,” said I, for I was now a little better master of my tongue.\n“Man he drink, he no good.”\n\nShe agreed with this, but kept considering.  “Why you bring him?” she\nasked presently.  “Suppose you no want drink, you no bring him, I think.”\n\n“That’s all right,” said I.  “One time I want drink too much; now no\nwant.  You see, I no savvy I get one little wifie.  Suppose I drink gin,\nmy little wifie he ’fraid.”\n\nTo speak to her kindly was about more than I was fit for; I had made my\nvow I would never let on to weakness with a native, and I had nothing for\nit but to stop.\n\nShe stood looking gravely down at me where I sat by the open case.  “I\nthink you good man,” she said.  And suddenly she had fallen before me on\nthe floor.  “I belong you all-e-same pig!” she cried.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER II.  THE BAN.\n\n\nI came on the verandah just before the sun rose on the morrow.  My house\nwas the last on the east; there was a cape of woods and cliffs behind\nthat hid the sunrise.  To the west, a swift cold river ran down, and\nbeyond was the green of the village, dotted with cocoa-palms and\nbreadfruits and houses.  The shutters were some of them down and some\nopen; I saw the mosquito bars still stretched, with shadows of people\nnew-awakened sitting up inside; and all over the green others were\nstalking silent, wrapped in their many-coloured sleeping clothes like\nBedouins in Bible pictures.  It was mortal still and solemn and chilly,\nand the light of the dawn on the lagoon was like the shining of a fire.\n\nBut the thing that troubled me was nearer hand.  Some dozen young men and\nchildren made a piece of a half-circle, flanking my house: the river\ndivided them, some were on the near side, some on the far, and one on a\nboulder in the midst; and they all sat silent, wrapped in their sheets,\nand stared at me and my house as straight as pointer dogs.  I thought it\nstrange as I went out.  When I had bathed and come back again, and found\nthem all there, and two or three more along with them, I thought it\nstranger still.  What could they see to gaze at in my house, I wondered,\nand went in.\n\nBut the thought of these starers stuck in my mind, and presently I came\nout again.  The sun was now up, but it was still behind the cape of\nwoods.  Say a quarter of an hour had come and gone.  The crowd was\ngreatly increased, the far bank of the river was lined for quite a\nway—perhaps thirty grown folk, and of children twice as many, some\nstanding, some squatted on the ground, and all staring at my house.  I\nhave seen a house in a South Sea village thus surrounded, but then a\ntrader was thrashing his wife inside, and she singing out.  Here was\nnothing: the stove was alight, the smoke going up in a Christian manner;\nall was shipshape and Bristol fashion.  To be sure, there was a stranger\ncome, but they had a chance to see that stranger yesterday, and took it\nquiet enough.  What ailed them now?  I leaned my arms on the rail and\nstared back.  Devil a wink they had in them!  Now and then I could see\nthe children chatter, but they spoke so low not even the hum of their\nspeaking came my length.  The rest were like graven images: they stared\nat me, dumb and sorrowful, with their bright eyes; and it came upon me\nthings would look not much different if I were on the platform of the\ngallows, and these good folk had come to see me hanged.\n\nI felt I was getting daunted, and began to be afraid I looked it, which\nwould never do.  Up I stood, made believe to stretch myself, came down\nthe verandah stair, and strolled towards the river.  There went a short\nbuzz from one to the other, like what you hear in theatres when the\ncurtain goes up; and some of the nearest gave back the matter of a pace.\nI saw a girl lay one hand on a young man and make a gesture upward with\nthe other; at the same time she said something in the native with a\ngasping voice.  Three little boys sat beside my path, where, I must pass\nwithin three feet of them.  Wrapped in their sheets, with their shaved\nheads and bits of top-knots, and queer faces, they looked like figures on\na chimney-piece.  Awhile they sat their ground, solemn as judges.  I came\nup hand over fist, doing my five knots, like a man that meant business;\nand I thought I saw a sort of a wink and gulp in the three faces.  Then\none jumped up (he was the farthest off) and ran for his mammy.  The other\ntwo, trying to follow suit, got foul, came to ground together bawling,\nwriggled right out of their sheets mother-naked, and in a moment there\nwere all three of them scampering for their lives and singing out like\npigs.  The natives, who would never let a joke slip, even at a burial,\nlaughed and let up, as short as a dog’s bark.\n\nThey say it scares a man to be alone.  No such thing.  What scares him in\nthe dark or the high bush is that he can’t make sure, and there might be\nan army at his elbow.  What scares him worst is to be right in the midst\nof a crowd, and have no guess of what they’re driving at.  When that\nlaugh stopped, I stopped too.  The boys had not yet made their offing,\nthey were still on the full stretch going the one way, when I had already\ngone about ship and was sheering off the other.  Like a fool I had come\nout, doing my five knots; like a fool I went back again.  It must have\nbeen the funniest thing to see, and what knocked me silly, this time no\none laughed; only one old woman gave a kind of pious moan, the way you\nhave heard Dissenters in their chapels at the sermon.\n\n“I never saw such fools of Kanakas as your people here,” I said once to\nUma, glancing out of the window at the starers.\n\n“Savvy nothing,” says Uma, with a kind of disgusted air that she was good\nat.\n\nAnd that was all the talk we had upon the matter, for I was put out, and\nUma took the thing so much as a matter of course that I was fairly\nashamed.\n\nAll day, off and on, now fewer and now more, the fools sat about the west\nend of my house and across the river, waiting for the show, whatever that\nwas—fire to come down from heaven, I suppose, and consume me, bones and\nbaggage.  But by evening, like real islanders, they had wearied of the\nbusiness, and got away, and had a dance instead in the big house of the\nvillage, where I heard them singing and clapping hands till, maybe, ten\nat night, and the next day it seemed they had forgotten I existed.  If\nfire had come down from heaven or the earth opened and swallowed me,\nthere would have been nobody to see the sport or take the lesson, or\nwhatever you like to call it.  But I was to find they hadn’t forgot\neither, and kept an eye lifting for phenomena over my way.\n\nI was hard at it both these days getting my trade in order and taking\nstock of what Vigours had left.  This was a job that made me pretty sick,\nand kept me from thinking on much else.  Ben had taken stock the trip\nbefore—I knew I could trust Ben—but it was plain somebody had been making\nfree in the meantime.  I found I was out by what might easily cover six\nmonths’ salary and profit, and I could have kicked myself all round the\nvillage to have been such a blamed ass, sitting boozing with that Case\ninstead of attending to my own affairs and taking stock.\n\nHowever, there’s no use crying over spilt milk.  It was done now, and\ncouldn’t be undone.  All I could do was to get what was left of it, and\nmy new stuff (my own choice) in order, to go round and get after the rats\nand cockroaches, and to fix up that store regular Sydney style.  A fine\nshow I made of it; and the third morning when I had lit my pipe and stood\nin the door-way and looked in, and turned and looked far up the mountain\nand saw the cocoanuts waving and posted up the tons of copra, and over\nthe village green and saw the island dandies and reckoned up the yards of\nprint they wanted for their kilts and dresses, I felt as if I was in the\nright place to make a fortune, and go home again and start a\npublic-house.  There was I, sitting in that verandah, in as handsome a\npiece of scenery as you could find, a splendid sun, and a fine fresh\nhealthy trade that stirred up a man’s blood like sea-bathing; and the\nwhole thing was clean gone from me, and I was dreaming England, which is,\nafter all, a nasty, cold, muddy hole, with not enough light to see to\nread by; and dreaming the looks of my public, by a cant of a broad\nhigh-road like an avenue, and with the sign on a green tree.\n\nSo much for the morning, but the day passed and the devil anyone looked\nnear me, and from all I knew of natives in other islands I thought this\nstrange.  People laughed a little at our firm and their fine stations,\nand at this station of Falesá in particular; all the copra in the\ndistrict wouldn’t pay for it (I had heard them say) in fifty years, which\nI supposed was an exaggeration.  But when the day went, and no business\ncame at all, I began to get downhearted; and, about three in the\nafternoon, I went out for a stroll to cheer me up.  On the green I saw a\nwhite man coming with a cassock on, by which and by the face of him I\nknew he was a priest.  He was a good-natured old soul to look at, gone a\nlittle grizzled, and so dirty you could have written with him on a piece\nof paper.\n\n“Good day, sir,” said I.\n\nHe answered me eagerly in native.\n\n“Don’t you speak any English?” said I.\n\n“French,” says he.\n\n“Well,” said I, “I’m sorry, but I can’t do anything there.”\n\nHe tried me awhile in the French, and then again in native, which he\nseemed to think was the best chance.  I made out he was after more than\npassing the time of day with me, but had something to communicate, and I\nlistened the harder.  I heard the names of Adams and Case and of\nRandall—Randall the oftenest—and the word “poison,” or something like it,\nand a native word that he said very often.  I went home, repeating it to\nmyself.\n\n“What does fussy-ocky mean?” I asked of Uma, for that was as near as I\ncould come to it.\n\n“Make dead,” said she.\n\n“The devil it does!” says I.  “Did ever you hear that Case had poisoned\nJohnnie Adams?”\n\n“Every man he savvy that,” says Uma, scornful-like.  “Give him white\nsand—bad sand.  He got the bottle still.  Suppose he give you gin, you no\ntake him.”\n\nNow I had heard much the same sort of story in other islands, and the\nsame white powder always to the front, which made me think the less of\nit.  For all that, I went over to Randall’s place to see what I could\npick up, and found Case on the doorstep, cleaning a gun.\n\n“Good shooting here?” says I.\n\n“A 1,” says he.  “The bush is full of all kinds of birds.  I wish copra\nwas as plenty,” says he—I thought, slyly—“but there don’t seem anything\ndoing.”\n\nI could see Black Jack in the store, serving a customer.\n\n“That looks like business, though,” said I.\n\n“That’s the first sale we’ve made in three weeks,” said he.\n\n“You don’t tell me?” says I.  “Three weeks?  Well, well.”\n\n“If you don’t believe me,” he cries, a little hot, “you can go and look\nat the copra-house.  It’s half empty to this blessed hour.”\n\n“I shouldn’t be much the better for that, you see,” says I.  “For all I\ncan tell, it might have been whole empty yesterday.”\n\n“That’s so,” says he, with a bit of a laugh.\n\n“By-the-bye,” I said, “what sort of a party is that priest?  Seems rather\na friendly sort.”\n\nAt this Case laughed right out loud.  “Ah!” says he, “I see what ails you\nnow.  Galuchet’s been at you.”—_Father Galoshes_ was the name he went by\nmost, but Case always gave it the French quirk, which was another reason\nwe had for thinking him above the common.\n\n“Yes, I have seen him,” I says.  “I made out he didn’t think much of your\nCaptain Randall.”\n\n“That he don’t!” says Case.  “It was the trouble about poor Adams.  The\nlast day, when he lay dying, there was young Buncombe round.  Ever met\nBuncombe?”\n\nI told him no.\n\n“He’s a cure, is Buncombe!” laughs Case.  “Well, Buncombe took it in his\nhead that, as there was no other clergyman about, bar Kanaka pastors, we\nought to call in Father Galuchet, and have the old man administered and\ntake the sacrament.  It was all the same to me, you may suppose; but I\nsaid I thought Adams was the fellow to consult.  He was jawing away about\nwatered copra and a sight of foolery.  ‘Look here,’ I said, ‘you’re\npretty sick.  Would you like to see Galoshes?’  He sat right up on his\nelbow.  ‘Get the priest,’ says he, ‘get the priest; don’t let me die here\nlike a dog!’  He spoke kind of fierce and eager, but sensible enough.\nThere was nothing to say against that, so we sent and asked Galuchet if\nhe would come.  You bet he would.  He jumped in his dirty linen at the\nthought of it.  But we had reckoned without Papa.  He’s a hard-shell\nBaptist, is Papa; no Papists need apply.  And he took and locked the\ndoor.  Buncombe told him he was bigoted, and I thought he would have had\na fit.  ‘Bigoted!’ he says.  ‘Me bigoted?  Have I lived to hear it from a\njackanapes like you?’  And he made for Buncombe, and I had to hold them\napart; and there was Adams in the middle, gone luny again, and carrying\non about copra like a born fool.  It was good as the play, and I was\nabout knocked out of time with laughing, when all of a sudden Adams sat\nup, clapped his hands to his chest, and went into the horrors.  He died\nhard, did John Adams,” says Case, with a kind of a sudden sternness.\n\n“And what became of the priest?” I asked.\n\n“The priest?” says Case.  “O! he was hammering on the door outside, and\ncrying on the natives to come and beat it in, and singing out it was a\nsoul he wished to save, and that.  He was in a rare taking, was the\npriest.  But what would you have?  Johnny had slipped his cable; no more\nJohnny in the market; and the administration racket clean played out.\nNext thing, word came to Randall the priest was praying upon Johnny’s\ngrave.  Papa was pretty full, and got a club, and lit out straight for\nthe place, and there was Galoshes on his knees, and a lot of natives\nlooking on.  You wouldn’t think Papa cared—that much about anything,\nunless it was liquor; but he and the priest stuck to it two hours,\nslanging each other in native, and every time Galoshes tried to kneel\ndown Papa went for him with the club.  There never were such larks in\nFalesá.  The end of it was that Captain Randall knocked over with some\nkind of a fit or stroke, and the priest got in his goods after all.  But\nhe was the angriest priest you ever heard of, and complained to the\nchiefs about the outrage, as he called it.  That was no account, for our\nchiefs are Protestant here; and, anyway, he had been making trouble about\nthe drum for morning school, and they were glad to give him a wipe.  Now\nhe swears old Randall gave Adams poison or something, and when the two\nmeet they grin at each other like baboons.”\n\nHe told this story as natural as could be, and like a man that enjoyed\nthe fun; though, now I come to think of it after so long, it seems rather\na sickening yarn.  However, Case never set up to be soft, only to be\nsquare and hearty, and a man all round; and, to tell the truth, he\npuzzled me entirely.\n\nI went home and asked Uma if she were a Popey, which I had made out to be\nthe native word for Catholics.\n\n“_E le ai_!” says she.  She always used the native when she meant “no”\nmore than usually strong, and, indeed, there’s more of it.  “No good\nPopey,” she added.\n\nThen I asked her about Adams and the priest, and she told me much the\nsame yarn in her own way.  So that I was left not much farther on, but\ninclined, upon the whole, to think the bottom of the matter was the row\nabout the sacrament, and the poisoning only talk.\n\nThe next day was a Sunday, when there was no business to be looked for.\nUma asked me in the morning if I was going to “pray”; I told her she bet\nnot, and she stopped home herself with no more words.  I thought this\nseemed unlike a native, and a native woman, and a woman that had new\nclothes to show off; however, it suited me to the ground, and I made the\nless of it.  The queer thing was that I came next door to going to church\nafter all, a thing I’m little likely to forget.  I had turned out for a\nstroll, and heard the hymn tune up.  You know how it is.  If you hear\nfolk singing, it seems to draw you; and pretty soon I found myself\nalongside the church.  It was a little long low place, coral built,\nrounded off at both ends like a whale-boat, a big native roof on the top\nof it, windows without sashes and doorways without doors.  I stuck my\nhead into one of the windows, and the sight was so new to me—for things\nwent quite different in the islands I was acquainted with—that I stayed\nand looked on.  The congregation sat on the floor on mats, the women on\none side, the men on the other, all rigged out to kill—the women with\ndresses and trade hats, the men in white jackets and shirts.  The hymn\nwas over; the pastor, a big buck Kanaka, was in the pulpit, preaching for\nhis life; and by the way he wagged his hand, and worked his voice, and\nmade his points, and seemed to argue with the folk, I made out he was a\ngun at the business.  Well, he looked up suddenly and caught my eye, and\nI give you my word he staggered in the pulpit; his eyes bulged out of his\nhead, his hand rose and pointed at me like as if against his will, and\nthe sermon stopped right there.\n\nIt isn’t a fine thing to say for yourself, but I ran away; and if the\nsame kind of a shock was given me, I should run away again to-morrow.  To\nsee that palavering Kanaka struck all of a heap at the mere sight of me\ngave me a feeling as if the bottom had dropped out of the world.  I went\nright home, and stayed there, and said nothing.  You might think I would\ntell Uma, but that was against my system.  You might have thought I would\nhave gone over and consulted Case; but the truth was I was ashamed to\nspeak of such a thing, I thought everyone would blurt out laughing in my\nface.  So I held my tongue, and thought all the more; and the more I\nthought, the less I liked the business.\n\nBy Monday night I got it clearly in my head I must be tabooed.  A new\nstore to stand open two days in a village and not a man or woman come to\nsee the trade was past believing.\n\n“Uma,” said I, “I think I’m tabooed.”\n\n“I think so,” said she.\n\nI thought awhile whether I should ask her more, but it’s a bad idea to\nset natives up with any notion of consulting them, so I went to Case.  It\nwas dark, and he was sitting alone, as he did mostly, smoking on the\nstairs.\n\n“Case,” said I, “here’s a queer thing.  I’m tabooed.”\n\n“O, fudge!” says he; “’tain’t the practice in these islands.”\n\n“That may be, or it mayn’t,” said I.  “It’s the practice where I was\nbefore.  You can bet I know what it’s like; and I tell it you for a fact,\nI’m tabooed.”\n\n“Well,” said he, “what have you been doing?”\n\n“That’s what I want to find out,” said I.\n\n“O, you can’t be,” said he; “it ain’t possible.  However, I’ll tell you\nwhat I’ll do.  Just to put your mind at rest, I’ll go round and find out\nfor sure.  Just you waltz in and talk to Papa.”\n\n“Thank you,” I said, “I’d rather stay right out here on the verandah.\nYour house is so close.”\n\n“I’ll call Papa out here, then,” says he.\n\n“My dear fellow,” I says, “I wish you wouldn’t.  The fact is, I don’t\ntake to Mr. Randall.”\n\nCase laughed, took a lantern from the store, and set out into the\nvillage.  He was gone perhaps a quarter of an hour, and he looked mighty\nserious when he came back.\n\n“Well,” said he, clapping down the lantern on the verandah steps, “I\nwould never have believed it.  I don’t know where the impudence of these\nKanakas ’ll go next; they seem to have lost all idea of respect for\nwhites.  What we want is a man-of-war—a German, if we could—they know how\nto manage Kanakas.”\n\n“I _am_ tabooed, then?” I cried.\n\n“Something of the sort,” said he.  “It’s the worst thing of the kind I’ve\nheard of yet.  But I’ll stand by you, Wiltshire, man to man.  You come\nround here to-morrow about nine, and we’ll have it out with the chiefs.\nThey’re afraid of me, or they used to be; but their heads are so big by\nnow, I don’t know what to think.  Understand me, Wiltshire; I don’t count\nthis your quarrel,” he went on, with a great deal of resolution, “I count\nit all of our quarrel, I count it the White Man’s Quarrel, and I’ll stand\nto it through thick and thin, and there’s my hand on it.”\n\n“Have you found out what’s the reason?” I asked.\n\n“Not yet,” said Case.  “But we’ll fix them down to-morrow.”\n\nAltogether I was pretty well pleased with his attitude, and almost more\nthe next day, when we met to go before the chiefs, to see him so stern\nand resolved.  The chiefs awaited us in one of their big oval houses,\nwhich was marked out to us from a long way off by the crowd about the\neaves, a hundred strong if there was one—men, women, and children.  Many\nof the men were on their way to work and wore green wreaths, and it put\nme in thoughts of the 1st of May at home.  This crowd opened and buzzed\nabout the pair of us as we went in, with a sudden angry animation.  Five\nchiefs were there; four mighty stately men, the fifth old and puckered.\nThey sat on mats in their white kilts and jackets; they had fans in their\nhands, like fine ladies; and two of the younger ones wore Catholic\nmedals, which gave me matter of reflection.  Our place was set, and the\nmats laid for us over against these grandees, on the near side of the\nhouse; the midst was empty; the crowd, close at our backs, murmured and\ncraned and jostled to look on, and the shadows of them tossed in front of\nus on the clean pebbles of the floor.  I was just a hair put out by the\nexcitement of the commons, but the quiet civil appearance of the chiefs\nreassured me, all the more when their spokesman began and made a long\nspeech in a low tone of voice, sometimes waving his hand towards Case,\nsometimes toward me, and sometimes knocking with his knuckles on the mat.\nOne thing was clear: there was no sign of anger in the chiefs.\n\n“What’s he been saying?” I asked, when he had done.\n\n“O, just that they’re glad to see you, and they understand by me you wish\nto make some kind of complaint, and you’re to fire away, and they’ll do\nthe square thing.”\n\n“It took a precious long time to say that,” said I.\n\n“O, the rest was sawder and _bonjour_ and that,” said Case.  “You know\nwhat Kanakas are.”\n\n“Well, they don’t get much _bonjour_ out of me,” said I.  “You tell them\nwho I am.  I’m a white man, and a British subject, and no end of a big\nchief at home; and I’ve come here to do them good, and bring them\ncivilisation; and no sooner have I got my trade sorted out than they go\nand taboo me, and no one dare come near my place!  Tell them I don’t mean\nto fly in the face of anything legal; and if what they want’s a present,\nI’ll do what’s fair.  I don’t blame any man looking out for himself, tell\nthem, for that’s human nature; but if they think they’re going to come\nany of their native ideas over me, they’ll find themselves mistaken.  And\ntell them plain that I demand the reason of this treatment as a white man\nand a British subject.”\n\nThat was my speech.  I know how to deal with Kanakas: give them plain\nsense and fair dealing, and—I’ll do them that much justice—they knuckle\nunder every time.  They haven’t any real government or any real law,\nthat’s what you’ve got to knock into their heads; and even if they had,\nit would be a good joke if it was to apply to a white man.  It would be a\nstrange thing if we came all this way and couldn’t do what we pleased.\nThe mere idea has always put my monkey up, and I rapped my speech out\npretty big.  Then Case translated it—or made believe to, rather—and the\nfirst chief replied, and then a second, and a third, all in the same\nstyle, easy and genteel, but solemn underneath.  Once a question was put\nto Case, and he answered it, and all hands (both chiefs and commons)\nlaughed out aloud, and looked at me.  Last of all, the puckered old\nfellow and the big young chief that spoke first started in to put Case\nthrough a kind of catechism.  Sometimes I made out that Case was trying\nto fence, and they stuck to him like hounds, and the sweat ran down his\nface, which was no very pleasant sight to me, and at some of his answers\nthe crowd moaned and murmured, which was a worse hearing.  It’s a cruel\nshame I knew no native, for (as I now believe) they were asking Case\nabout my marriage, and he must have had a tough job of it to clear his\nfeet.  But leave Case alone; he had the brains to run a parliament.\n\n“Well, is that all?” I asked, when a pause came.\n\n“Come along,” says he, mopping his face; “I’ll tell you outside.”\n\n“Do you mean they won’t take the taboo off?”  I cried.\n\n“It’s something queer,” said he.  “I’ll tell you outside.  Better come\naway.”\n\n“I won’t take it at their hands,” cried I.  “I ain’t that kind of a man.\nYou don’t find me turn my back on a parcel of Kanakas.”\n\n“You’d better,” said Case.\n\nHe looked at me with a signal in his eye; and the five chiefs looked at\nme civilly enough, but kind of pointed; and the people looked at me and\ncraned and jostled.  I remembered the folks that watched my house, and\nhow the pastor had jumped in his pulpit at the bare sight of me; and the\nwhole business seemed so out of the way that I rose and followed Case.\nThe crowd opened again to let us through, but wider than before, the\nchildren on the skirts running and singing out, and as we two white men\nwalked away they all stood and watched us.\n\n“And now,” said I, “what is all this about?”\n\n“The truth is I can’t rightly make it out myself.  They have a down on\nyou,” says Case.\n\n“Taboo a man because they have a down on him!” I cried.  “I never heard\nthe like.”\n\n“It’s worse than that, you see,” said Case.  “You ain’t tabooed—I told\nyou that couldn’t be.  The people won’t go near you, Wiltshire, and\nthere’s where it is.”\n\n“They won’t go near me?  What do you mean by that?  Why won’t they go\nnear me?” I cried.\n\nCase hesitated.  “Seems they’re frightened,” says he, in a low, voice.\n\nI stopped dead short.  “Frightened?” I repeated.  “Are you gone crazy,\nCase?  What are they frightened of?”\n\n“I wish I could make out,” Case answered, shaking his head.  “Appears\nlike one of their tomfool superstitions.  That’s what I don’t cotton to,”\nhe said.  “It’s like the business about Vigours.”\n\n“I’d like to know what you mean by that, and I’ll trouble you to tell\nme,” says I.\n\n“Well, you know, Vigours lit out and left all standing,” said he.  “It\nwas some superstition business—I never got the hang of it but it began to\nlook bad before the end.”\n\n“I’ve heard a different story about that,” said I, “and I had better tell\nyou so.  I heard he ran away because of you.”\n\n“O! well, I suppose he was ashamed to tell the truth,” says Case; “I\nguess he thought it silly.  And it’s a fact that I packed him off.  ‘What\nwould you do, old man?’ says he.  ‘Get,’ says I, ‘and not think twice\nabout it.’  I was the gladdest kind of man to see him clear away.  It\nain’t my notion to turn my back on a mate when he’s in a tight place, but\nthere was that much trouble in the village that I couldn’t see where it\nmight likely end.  I was a fool to be so much about with Vigours.  They\ncast it up to me to-day.  Didn’t you hear Maea—that’s the young chief,\nthe big one—ripping out about ‘Vika’?  That was him they were after.\nThey don’t seem to forget it, somehow.”\n\n“This is all very well,” said I, “but it don’t tell me what’s wrong; it\ndon’t tell me what they’re afraid of—what their idea is.”\n\n“Well, I wish I knew,” said Case.  “I can’t say fairer than that.”\n\n“You might have asked, I think,” says I.\n\n“And so I did,” says he.  “But you must have seen for yourself, unless\nyou’re blind, that the asking got the other way.  I’ll go as far as I\ndare for another white man; but when I find I’m in the scrape myself, I\nthink first of my own bacon.  The loss of me is I’m too good-natured.\nAnd I’ll take the freedom of telling you you show a queer kind of\ngratitude to a man who’s got into all this mess along of your affairs.”\n\n“There’s a thing I am thinking of,” said I.  “You were a fool to be so\nmuch about with Vigours.  One comfort, you haven’t been much about with\nme.  I notice you’ve never been inside my house.  Own up now; you had\nword of this before?”\n\n“It’s a fact I haven’t been,” said he.  “It was an oversight, and I am\nsorry for it, Wiltshire.  But about coming now, I’ll be quite plain.”\n\n“You mean you won’t?” I asked.\n\n“Awfully sorry, old man, but that’s the size of it,” says Case.\n\n“In short, you’re afraid?” says I.\n\n“In short, I’m afraid,” says he.\n\n“And I’m still to be tabooed for nothing?” I asked\n\n“I tell you you’re not tabooed,” said he.  “The Kanakas won’t go near\nyou, that’s all.  And who’s to make ’em?  We traders have a lot of gall,\nI must say; we make these poor Kanakas take back their laws, and take up\ntheir taboos, and that, whenever it happens to suit us.  But you don’t\nmean to say you expect a law obliging people to deal in your store\nwhether they want to or not?  You don’t mean to tell me you’ve got the\ngall for that?  And if you had, it would be a queer thing to propose to\nme.  I would just like to point out to you, Wiltshire, that I’m a trader\nmyself.”\n\n“I don’t think I would talk of gall if I was you,” said I.  “Here’s about\nwhat it comes to, as well as I can make out: None of the people are to\ntrade with me, and they’re all to trade with you.  You’re to have the\ncopra, and I’m to go to the devil and shake myself.  And I don’t know any\nnative, and you’re the only man here worth mention that speaks English,\nand you have the gall to up and hint to me my life’s in danger, and all\nyou’ve got to tell me is you don’t know why!”\n\n“Well, it _is_ all I have to tell you,” said he.  “I don’t know—I wish I\ndid.”\n\n“And so you turn your back and leave me to myself!  Is that the\nposition?” says I.\n\n“If you like to put it nasty,” says he.  “I don’t put it so.  I say\nmerely, ‘I’m going to keep clear of you; or, if I don’t, I’ll get in\ndanger for myself.’”\n\n“Well,” says I, “you’re a nice kind of a white man!”\n\n“O, I understand; you’re riled,” said he.  “I would be myself.  I can\nmake excuses.”\n\n“All right,” I said, “go and make excuses somewhere else.  Here’s my way,\nthere’s yours!”\n\nWith that we parted, and I went straight home, in a hot temper, and found\nUma trying on a lot of trade goods like a baby.\n\n“Here,” I said, “you quit that foolery!  Here’s a pretty mess to have\nmade, as if I wasn’t bothered enough anyway!  And I thought I told you to\nget dinner!”\n\nAnd then I believe I gave her a bit of the rough side of my tongue, as\nshe deserved.  She stood up at once, like a sentry to his officer; for I\nmust say she was always well brought up, and had a great respect for\nwhites.\n\n“And now,” says I, “you belong round here, you’re bound to understand\nthis.  What am I tabooed for, anyway?  Or, if I ain’t tabooed, what makes\nthe folks afraid of me?”\n\nShe stood and looked at me with eyes like saucers.\n\n“You no savvy?” she gasps at last.\n\n“No,” said I.  “How would you expect me to?  We don’t have any such\ncraziness where I come from.”\n\n“Ese no tell you?” she asked again.\n\n(_Ese_ was the name the natives had for Case; it may mean foreign, or\nextraordinary; or it might mean a mummy apple; but most like it was only\nhis own name misheard and put in a Kanaka spelling.)\n\n“Not much,” said I.\n\n“D-n Ese!” she cried.\n\nYou might think it funny to hear this Kanaka girl come out with a big\nswear.  No such thing.  There was no swearing in her—no, nor anger; she\nwas beyond anger, and meant the word simple and serious.  She stood there\nstraight as she said it.  I cannot justly say that I ever saw a woman\nlook like that before or after, and it struck me mum.  Then she made a\nkind of an obeisance, but it was the proudest kind, and threw her hands\nout open.\n\n“I ’shamed,” she said.  “I think you savvy.  Ese he tell me you savvy, he\ntell me you no mind, tell me you love me too much.  Taboo belong me,” she\nsaid, touching herself on the bosom, as she had done upon our\nwedding-night.  “Now I go ’way, taboo he go ’way too.  Then you get too\nmuch copra.  You like more better, I think.  _Tofâ_, _alii_,” says she in\nthe native—“Farewell, chief!”\n\n“Hold on!” I cried.  “Don’t be in such a hurry.”\n\nShe looked at me sidelong with a smile.  “You see, you get copra,” she\nsaid, the same as you might offer candies to a child.\n\n“Uma,” said I, “hear reason.  I didn’t know, and that’s a fact; and Case\nseems to have played it pretty mean upon the pair of us.  But I do know\nnow, and I don’t mind; I love you too much.  You no go ’way, you no leave\nme, I too much sorry.”\n\n“You no love, me,” she cried, “you talk me bad words!”  And she threw\nherself in a corner of the floor, and began to cry.\n\nWell, I’m no scholar, but I wasn’t born yesterday, and I thought the\nworst of that trouble was over.  However, there she lay—her back turned,\nher face to the wall—and shook with sobbing like a little child, so that\nher feet jumped with it.  It’s strange how it hits a man when he’s in\nlove; for there’s no use mincing things—Kanaka and all, I was in love\nwith her, or just as good.  I tried to take her hand, but she would none\nof that.  “Uma,” I said, “there’s no sense in carrying on like this.  I\nwant you stop here, I want my little wifie, I tell you true.”\n\n“No tell me true,” she sobbed.\n\n“All right,” says I, “I’ll wait till you’re through with this.”  And I\nsat right down beside her on the floor, and set to smooth her hair with\nmy hand.  At first she wriggled away when I touched her; then she seemed\nto notice me no more; then her sobs grew gradually less, and presently\nstopped; and the next thing I knew, she raised her face to mime.\n\n“You tell me true?  You like me stop?” she asked.\n\n“Uma,” I said, “I would rather have you than all the copra in the South\nSeas,” which was a very big expression, and the strangest thing was that\nI meant it.\n\nShe threw her arms about me, sprang close up, and pressed her face to\nmine in the island way of kissing, so that I was all wetted with her\ntears, and my heart went out to her wholly.  I never had anything so near\nme as this little brown bit of a girl.  Many things went together, and\nall helped to turn my head.  She was pretty enough to eat; it seemed she\nwas my only friend in that queer place; I was ashamed that I had spoken\nrough to her: and she was a woman, and my wife, and a kind of a baby\nbesides that I was sorry for; and the salt of her tears was in my mouth.\nAnd I forgot Case and the natives; and I forgot that I knew nothing of\nthe story, or only remembered it to banish the remembrance; and I forgot\nthat I was to get no copra, and so could make no livelihood; and I forgot\nmy employers, and the strange kind of service I was doing them, when I\npreferred my fancy to their business; and I forgot even that Uma was no\ntrue wife of mine, but just a maid beguiled, and that in a pretty shabby\nstyle.  But that is to look too far on.  I will come to that part of it\nnext.\n\nIt was late before we thought of getting dinner.  The stove was out, and\ngone stone-cold; but we fired up after a while, and cooked each a dish,\nhelping and hindering each other, and making a play of it like children.\nI was so greedy of her nearness that I sat down to dinner with my lass\nupon my knee, made sure of her with one hand, and ate with the other.\nAy, and more than that.  She was the worst cook I suppose God made; the\nthings she set her hand to it would have sickened an honest horse to eat\nof; yet I made my meal that day on Uma’s cookery, and can never call to\nmind to have been better pleased.\n\nI didn’t pretend to myself, and I didn’t pretend to her.  I saw I was\nclean gone; and if she was to make a fool of me, she must.  And I suppose\nit was this that set her talking, for now she made sure that we were\nfriends.  A lot she told me, sitting in my lap and eating my dish, as I\nate hers, from foolery—a lot about herself and her mother and Case, all\nwhich would be very tedious, and fill sheets if I set it down in Beach de\nMar, but which I must give a hint of in plain English, and one thing\nabout myself which had a very big effect on my concerns, as you are soon\nto hear.\n\nIt seems she was born in one of the Line Islands; had been only two or\nthree years in these parts, where she had come with a white man, who was\nmarried to her mother and then died; and only the one year in Falesá.\nBefore that they had been a good deal on the move, trekking about after\nthe white man, who was one of those rolling stones that keep going round\nafter a soft job.  They talk about looking for gold at the end of a\nrainbow; but if a man wants an employment that’ll last him till he dies,\nlet him start out on the soft-job hunt.  There’s meat and drink in it\ntoo, and beer and skittles, for you never hear of them starving, and\nrarely see them sober; and as for steady sport, cock-fighting isn’t in\nthe same county with it.  Anyway, this beachcomber carried the woman and\nher daughter all over the shop, but mostly to out-of-the-way islands,\nwhere there were no police, and he thought, perhaps, the soft job hung\nout.  I’ve my own view of this old party; but I was just as glad he had\nkept Uma clear of Apia and Papeete and these flash towns.  At last he\nstruck Fale-alii on this island, got some trade—the Lord knows\nhow!—muddled it all away in the usual style, and died worth next to\nnothing, bar a bit of land at Falesá that he had got for a bad debt,\nwhich was what put it in the minds of the mother and daughter to come\nthere and live.  It seems Case encouraged them all he could, and helped\nto get their house built.  He was very kind those days, and gave Uma\ntrade, and there is no doubt he had his eye on her from the beginning.\nHowever, they had scarce settled, when up turned a young man, a native,\nand wanted to marry her.  He was a small chief, and had some fine mats\nand old songs in his family, and was “very pretty,” Uma said; and,\naltogether, it was an extraordinary match for a penniless girl and an\nout-islander.\n\nAt the first word of this I got downright sick with jealousy.\n\n“And you mean to say you would have married him?” I cried.\n\n“_Ioe_, yes,” said she.  “I like too much!”\n\n“Well!” I said.  “And suppose I had come round after?”\n\n“I like you more better now,” said she.  “But, suppose I marry Ioane, I\none good wife.  I no common Kanaka.  Good girl!” says she.\n\nWell, I had to be pleased with that; but I promise you I didn’t care\nabout the business one little bit.  And I liked the end of that yarn no\nbetter than the beginning.  For it seems this proposal of marriage was\nthe start of all the trouble.  It seems, before that, Uma and her mother\nhad been looked down upon, of course, for kinless folk and out-islanders,\nbut nothing to hurt; and, even when Ioane came forward, there was less\ntrouble at first than might have been looked for.  And then, all of a\nsudden, about six months before my coming, Ioane backed out and left that\npart of the island, and from that day to this Uma and her mother had\nfound themselves alone.  None called at their house, none spoke to them\non the roads.  If they went to church, the other women drew their mats\naway and left them in a clear place by themselves.  It was a regular\nexcommunication, like what you read of in the Middle Ages; and the cause\nor sense of it beyond guessing.  It was some _tala pepelo_, Uma said,\nsome lie, some calumny; and all she knew of it was that the girls who had\nbeen jealous of her luck with Ioane used to twit her with his desertion,\nand cry out, when they met her alone in the woods, that she would never\nbe married.  “They tell me no man he marry me.  He too much ’fraid,” she\nsaid.\n\nThe only soul that came about them after this desertion was Master Case.\nEven he was chary of showing himself, and turned up mostly by night; and\npretty soon he began to table his cards and make up to Uma.  I was still\nsore about Ioane, and when Case turned up in the same line of business I\ncut up downright rough.\n\n“Well,” I said, sneering, “and I suppose you thought Case ‘very pretty’\nand ‘liked too much’?”\n\n“Now you talk silly,” said she.  “White man, he come here, I marry him\nall-e-same Kanaka; very well then, he marry me all-e-same white woman.\nSuppose he no marry, he go ’way, woman he stop.  All-e-same thief, empty\nhand, Tonga-heart—no can love!  Now you come marry me.  You big heart—you\nno ’shamed island-girl.  That thing I love you for too much.  I proud.”\n\nI don’t know that ever I felt sicker all the days of my life.  I laid\ndown my fork, and I put away “the island-girl”; I didn’t seem somehow to\nhave any use for either, and I went and walked up and down in the house,\nand Uma followed me with her eyes, for she was troubled, and small\nwonder!  But troubled was no word for it with me.  I so wanted, and so\nfeared, to make a clean breast of the sweep that I had been.\n\nAnd just then there came a sound of singing out of the sea; it sprang up\nsuddenly clear and near, as the boat turned the headland, and Uma,\nrunning to the window, cried out it was “Misi” come upon his rounds.\n\nI thought it was a strange thing I should be glad to have a missionary;\nbut, if it was strange, it was still true.\n\n“Uma,” said I, “you stop here in this room, and don’t budge a foot out of\nit till I come back.”\n\n\n\nCHAPTER III.  THE MISSIONARY.\n\n\nAs I came out on the verandah, the mission-boat was shooting for the\nmouth of the river.  She was a long whale-boat painted white; a bit of an\nawning astern; a native pastor crouched on the wedge of the poop,\nsteering; some four-and-twenty paddles flashing and dipping, true to the\nboat-song; and the missionary under the awning, in his white clothes,\nreading in a book, and set him up!  It was pretty to see and hear;\nthere’s no smarter sight in the islands than a missionary boat with a\ngood crew and a good pipe to them; and I considered it for half a minute,\nwith a bit of envy perhaps, and then strolled down towards the river.\n\nFrom the opposite side there was another man aiming for the same place,\nbut he ran and got there first.  It was Case; doubtless his idea was to\nkeep me apart from the missionary, who might serve me as interpreter; but\nmy mind was upon other things.  I was thinking how he had jockeyed us\nabout the marriage, and tried his hand on Uma before; and at the sight of\nhim rage flew into my nostrils.\n\n“Get out of that, you low, swindling thief!”  I cried.\n\n“What’s that you say?” says he.\n\nI gave him the word again, and rammed it down with a good oath.  “And if\never I catch you within six fathoms of my house,” I cried, “I’ll clap a\nbullet in your measly carcase.”\n\n“You must do as you like about your house,” said he, “where I told you I\nhave no thought of going; but this is a public place.”\n\n“It’s a place where I have private business,” said I.  “I have no idea of\na hound like you eavesdropping, and I give you notice to clear out.”\n\n“I don’t take it, though,” says Case.\n\n“I’ll show you, then,” said I.\n\n“We’ll have to see about that,” said he.\n\nHe was quick with his hands, but he had neither the height nor the\nweight, being a flimsy creature alongside a man like me, and, besides, I\nwas blazing to that height of wrath that I could have bit into a chisel.\nI gave him first the one and then the other, so that I could hear his\nhead rattle and crack, and he went down straight.\n\n“Have you had enough?” cried I.  But he only looked up white and blank,\nand the blood spread upon his face like wine upon a napkin.  “Have you\nhad enough?” I cried again.  “Speak up, and don’t lie malingering there,\nor I’ll take my feet to you.”\n\nHe sat up at that, and held his head—by the look of him you could see it\nwas spinning—and the blood poured on his pyjamas.\n\n“I’ve had enough for this time,” says he, and he got up staggering, and\nwent off by the way that he had come.\n\nThe boat was close in; I saw the missionary had laid his book to one\nside, and I smiled to myself.  “He’ll know I’m a man, anyway,” thinks I.\n\nThis was the first time, in all my years in the Pacific, I had ever\nexchanged two words with any missionary, let alone asked one for a\nfavour.  I didn’t like the lot, no trader does; they look down upon us,\nand make no concealment; and, besides, they’re partly Kanakaised, and\nsuck up with natives instead of with other white men like themselves.  I\nhad on a rig of clean striped pyjamas—for, of course, I had dressed\ndecent to go before the chiefs; but when I saw the missionary step out of\nthis boat in the regular uniform, white duck clothes, pith helmet, white\nshirt and tie, and yellow boots to his feet, I could have bunged stones\nat him.  As he came nearer, queering me pretty curious (because of the\nfight, I suppose), I saw he looked mortal sick, for the truth was he had\na fever on, and had just had a chill in the boat.\n\n“Mr. Tarleton, I believe?” says I, for I had got his name.\n\n“And you, I suppose, are the new trader?” says he.\n\n“I want to tell you first that I don’t hold with missions,” I went on,\n“and that I think you and the likes of you do a sight of harm, filling up\nthe natives with old wives’ tales and bumptiousness.”\n\n“You are perfectly entitled to your opinions,” says he, looking a bit\nugly, “but I have no call to hear them.”\n\n“It so happens that you’ve got to hear them,” I said.  “I’m no\nmissionary, nor missionary lover; I’m no Kanaka, nor favourer of\nKanakas—I’m just a trader; I’m just a common, low-down, God-damned white\nman and British subject, the sort you would like to wipe your boots on.\nI hope that’s plain!”\n\n“Yes, my man,” said he.  “It’s more plain than creditable.  When you are\nsober, you’ll be sorry for this.”\n\nHe tried to pass on, but I stopped him with my hand.  The Kanakas were\nbeginning to growl.  Guess they didn’t like my tone, for I spoke to that\nman as free as I would to you.\n\n“Now, you can’t say I’ve deceived you,” said I, “and I can go on.  I want\na service—I want two services, in fact; and, if you care to give me them,\nI’ll perhaps take more stock in what you call your Christianity.”\n\nHe was silent for a moment.  Then he smiled.  “You are rather a strange\nsort of man,” says he.\n\n“I’m the sort of man God made me,” says I.  “I don’t set up to be a\ngentleman,” I said.\n\n“I am not quite so sure,” said he.  “And what can I do for you, Mr.—?”\n\n“Wiltshire,” I says, “though I’m mostly called Welsher; but Wiltshire is\nthe way it’s spelt, if the people on the beach could only get their\ntongues about it.  And what do I want?  Well, I’ll tell you the first\nthing.  I’m what you call a sinner—what I call a sweep—and I want you to\nhelp me make it up to a person I’ve deceived.”\n\nHe turned and spoke to his crew in the native.  “And now I am at your\nservice,” said he, “but only for the time my crew are dining.  I must be\nmuch farther down the coast before night.  I was delayed at Papa-Malulu\ntill this morning, and I have an engagement in Fale-alii to-morrow\nnight.”\n\nI led the way to my house in silence, and rather pleased with myself for\nthe way I had managed the talk, for I like a man to keep his\nself-respect.\n\n“I was sorry to see you fighting,” says he.\n\n“O, that’s part of the yarn I want to tell you,” I said.  “That’s service\nnumber two.  After you’ve heard it you’ll let me know whether you’re\nsorry or not.”\n\nWe walked right in through the store, and I was surprised to find Uma had\ncleared away the dinner things.  This was so unlike her ways that I saw\nshe had done it out of gratitude, and liked her the better.  She and Mr.\nTarleton called each other by name, and he was very civil to her\nseemingly.  But I thought little of that; they can always find civility\nfor a Kanaka, it’s us white men they lord it over.  Besides, I didn’t\nwant much Tarleton just them.  I was going to do my pitch.\n\n“Uma,” said I, “give us your marriage certificate.”  She looked put out.\n“Come,” said I, “you can trust me.  Hand it up.”\n\nShe had it about her person, as usual; I believe she thought it was a\npass to heaven, and if she died without having it handy she would go to\nhell.  I couldn’t see where she put it the first time, I couldn’t see now\nwhere she took it from; it seemed to jump into her hand like that\nBlavatsky business in the papers.  But it’s the same way with all island\nwomen, and I guess they’re taught it when young.\n\n“Now,” said I, with the certificate in my hand, “I was married to this\ngirl by Black Jack the negro.  The certificate was wrote by Case, and\nit’s a dandy piece of literature, I promise you.  Since then I’ve found\nthat there’s a kind of cry in the place against this wife of mine, and so\nlong as I keep her I cannot trade.  Now, what would any man do in my\nplace, if he was a man?” I said.  “The first thing he would do is this, I\nguess.”  And I took and tore up the certificate and bunged the pieces on\nthe floor.\n\n“_Aué_!” {2} cried Uma, and began to clap her hands; but I caught one of\nthem in mine.\n\n“And the second thing that he would do,” said I, “if he was what I would\ncall a man and you would call a man, Mr. Tarleton, is to bring the girl\nright before you or any other missionary, and to up and say: ‘I was wrong\nmarried to this wife of mine, but I think a heap of her, and now I want\nto be married to her right.’  Fire away, Mr. Tarleton.  And I guess you’d\nbetter do it in native; it’ll please the old lady,” I said, giving her\nthe proper name of a man’s wife upon the spot.\n\nSo we had in two of the crew for to witness, and were spliced in our own\nhouse; and the parson prayed a good bit, I must say—but not so long as\nsome—and shook hands with the pair of us.\n\n“Mr. Wiltshire,” he says, when he had made out the lines and packed off\nthe witnesses, “I have to thank you for a very lively pleasure.  I have\nrarely performed the marriage ceremony with more grateful emotions.”\n\nThat was what you would call talking.  He was going on, besides, with\nmore of it, and I was ready for as much taffy as he had in stock, for I\nfelt good.  But Uma had been taken up with something half through the\nmarriage, and cut straight in.\n\n“How your hand he get hurt?” she asked.\n\n“You ask Case’s head, old lady,” says I.\n\nShe jumped with joy, and sang out.\n\n“You haven’t made much of a Christian of this one,” says I to Mr.\nTarleton.\n\n“We didn’t think her one of our worst,” says he, “when she was at\nFale-alii; and if Uma bears malice I shall be tempted to fancy she has\ngood cause.”\n\n“Well, there we are at service number two,” said I.  “I want to tell you\nour yarn, and see if you can let a little daylight in.”\n\n“Is it long?” he asked.\n\n“Yes,” I cried; “it’s a goodish bit of a yarn!”\n\n“Well, I’ll give you all the time I can spare,” says he, looking at his\nwatch.  “But I must tell you fairly, I haven’t eaten since five this\nmorning, and, unless you can let me have something I am not likely to eat\nagain before seven or eight to-night.”\n\n“By God, we’ll give you dinner!” I cried.\n\nI was a little caught up at my swearing, just when all was going\nstraight; and so was the missionary, I suppose, but he made believe to\nlook out of the window, and thanked us.\n\nSo we ran him up a bit of a meal.  I was bound to let the old lady have a\nhand in it, to show off, so I deputised her to brew the tea.  I don’t\nthink I ever met such tea as she turned out.  But that was not the worst,\nfor she got round with the salt-box, which she considered an extra\nEuropean touch, and turned my stew into sea-water.  Altogether, Mr.\nTarleton had a devil of a dinner of it; but he had plenty entertainment\nby the way, for all the while that we were cooking, and afterwards, when\nhe was making believe to eat, I kept posting him up on Master Case and\nthe beach of Falesá, and he putting questions that showed he was\nfollowing close.\n\n“Well,” said he at last, “I am afraid you have a dangerous enemy.  This\nman Case is very clever and seems really wicked.  I must tell you I have\nhad my eye on him for nearly a year, and have rather had the worst of our\nencounters.  About the time when the last representative of your firm ran\nso suddenly away, I had a letter from Namu, the native pastor, begging me\nto come to Falesá at my earliest convenience, as his flock were all\n‘adopting Catholic practices.’  I had great confidence in Namu; I fear it\nonly shows how easily we are deceived.  No one could hear him preach and\nnot be persuaded he was a man of extraordinary parts.  All our islanders\neasily acquire a kind of eloquence, and can roll out and illustrate, with\na great deal of vigour and fancy, second-hand sermons; but Namu’s sermons\nare his own, and I cannot deny that I have found them means of grace.\nMoreover, he has a keen curiosity in secular things, does not fear work,\nis clever at carpentering, and has made himself so much respected among\nthe neighbouring pastors that we call him, in a jest which is half\nserious, the Bishop of the East.  In short, I was proud of the man; all\nthe more puzzled by his letter, and took an occasion to come this way.\nThe morning before my arrival, Vigours had been sent on board the _Lion_,\nand Namu was perfectly at his ease, apparently ashamed of his letter, and\nquite unwilling to explain it.  This, of course, I could not allow, and\nhe ended by confessing that he had been much concerned to find his people\nusing the sign of the cross, but since he had learned the explanation his\nmind was satisfied.  For Vigours had the Evil Eye, a common thing in a\ncountry of Europe called Italy, where men were often struck dead by that\nkind of devil, and it appeared the sign of the cross was a charm against\nits power.\n\n“‘And I explain it, Misi,’ said Namu, ‘in this way: The country in Europe\nis a Popey country, and the devil of the Evil Eye may be a Catholic\ndevil, or, at least, used to Catholic ways.  So then I reasoned thus: if\nthis sign of the cross were used in a Popey manner it would be sinful,\nbut when it is used only to protect men from a devil, which is a thing\nharmless in itself, the sign too must be, as a bottle is neither good nor\nbad, harmless.  For the sign is neither good nor bad.  But if the bottle\nbe full of gin, the gin is bad; and if the sign be made in idolatry bad,\nso is the idolatry.’  And, very like a native pastor, he had a text\napposite about the casting out of devils.\n\n“‘And who has been telling you about the Evil Eye?’ I asked.\n\n“He admitted it was Case.  Now, I am afraid you will think me very\nnarrow, Mr. Wiltshire, but I must tell you I was displeased, and cannot\nthink a trader at all a good man to advise or have an influence upon my\npastors.  And, besides, there had been some flying talk in the country of\nold Adams and his being poisoned, to which I had paid no great heed; but\nit came back to me at the moment.\n\n“‘And is this Case a man of a sanctified life?’ I asked.\n\n“He admitted he was not; for, though he did not drink, he was profligate\nwith women, and had no religion.\n\n“‘Then,’ said I, ‘I think the less you have to do with him the better.’\n\n“But it is not easy to have the last word with a man like Namu.  He was\nready in a moment with an illustration.  ‘Misi,’ said he, ‘you have told\nme there were wise men, not pastors, not even holy, who knew many things\nuseful to be taught—about trees for instance, and beasts, and to print\nbooks, and about the stones that are burned to make knives of.  Such men\nteach you in your college, and you learn from them, but take care not to\nlearn to be unholy.  Misi, Case is my college.’\n\n“I knew not what to say.  Mr. Vigours had evidently been driven out of\nFalesá by the machinations of Case and with something not very unlike the\ncollusion of my pastor.  I called to mind it was Namu who had reassured\nme about Adams and traced the rumour to the ill-will of the priest.  And\nI saw I must inform myself more thoroughly from an impartial source.\nThere is an old rascal of a chief here, Faiaso, whom I dare say you saw\nto-day at the council; he has been all his life turbulent and sly, a\ngreat fomenter of rebellions, and a thorn in the side of the mission and\nthe island.  For all that he is very shrewd, and, except in politics or\nabout his own misdemeanours, a teller of the truth.  I went to his house,\ntold him what I had heard, and besought him to be frank.  I do not think\nI had ever a more painful interview.  Perhaps you will understand me, Mr.\nWiltshire, if I tell you that I am perfectly serious in these old wives’\ntales with which you reproached me, and as anxious to do well for these\nislands as you can be to please and to protect your pretty wife.  And you\nare to remember that I thought Namu a paragon, and was proud of the man\nas one of the first ripe fruits of the mission.  And now I was informed\nthat he had fallen in a sort of dependence upon Case.  The beginning of\nit was not corrupt; it began, doubtless, in fear and respect, produced by\ntrickery and pretence; but I was shocked to find that another element had\nbeen lately added, that Namu helped himself in the store, and was\nbelieved to be deep in Case’s debt.  Whatever the trader said, that Namu\nbelieved with trembling.  He was not alone in this; many in the village\nlived in a similar subjection; but Namu’s case was the most influential,\nit was through Namu Case had wrought most evil; and with a certain\nfollowing among the chiefs, and the pastor in his pocket, the man was as\ngood as master of the village.  You know something of Vigours and Adams,\nbut perhaps you have never heard of old Underhill, Adams’ predecessor.\nHe was a quiet, mild old fellow, I remember, and we were told he had died\nsuddenly: white men die very suddenly in Falesá.  The truth, as I now\nheard it, made my blood run cold.  It seems he was struck with a general\npalsy, all of him dead but one eye, which he continually winked.  Word\nwas started that the helpless old man was now a devil, and this vile\nfellow Case worked upon the natives’ fears, which he professed to share,\nand pretended he durst not go into the house alone.  At last a grave was\ndug, and the living body buried at the far end of the village.  Namu, my\npastor, whom I had helped to educate, offered up a prayer at the hateful\nscene.\n\n“I felt myself in a very difficult position.  Perhaps it was my duty to\nhave denounced Namu and had him deposed.  Perhaps I think so now, but at\nthe time it seemed less clear.  He had a great influence, it might prove\ngreater than mine.  The natives are prone to superstition; perhaps by\nstirring them up I might but ingrain and spread these dangerous fancies.\nAnd Namu besides, apart from this novel and accursed influence, was a\ngood pastor, an able man, and spiritually minded.  Where should I look\nfor a better?  How was I to find as good?  At that moment, with Namu’s\nfailure fresh in my view, the work of my life appeared a mockery; hope\nwas dead in me.  I would rather repair such tools as I had than go abroad\nin quest of others that must certainly prove worse; and a scandal is, at\nthe best, a thing to be avoided when humanly possible.  Right or wrong,\nthen, I determined on a quiet course.  All that night I denounced and\nreasoned with the erring pastor, twitted him with his ignorance and want\nof faith, twitted him with his wretched attitude, making clean the\noutside of the cup and platter, callously helping at a murder, childishly\nflying in excitement about a few childish, unnecessary, and inconvenient\ngestures; and long before day I had him on his knees and bathed in the\ntears of what seemed a genuine repentance.  On Sunday I took the pulpit\nin the morning, and preached from First Kings, nineteenth, on the fire,\nthe earthquake, and the voice, distinguishing the true spiritual power,\nand referring with such plainness as I dared to recent events in Falesá.\nThe effect produced was great, and it was much increased when Namu rose\nin his turn and confessed that he had been wanting in faith and conduct,\nand was convinced of sin.  So far, then, all was well; but there was one\nunfortunate circumstance.  It was nearing the time of our ‘May’ in the\nisland, when the native contributions to the missions are received; it\nfell in my duty to make a notification on the subject, and this gave my\nenemy his chance, by which he was not slow to profit.\n\n“News of the whole proceedings must have been carried to Case as soon as\nchurch was over, and the same afternoon he made an occasion to meet me in\nthe midst of the village.  He came up with so much intentness and\nanimosity that I felt it would be damaging to avoid him.\n\n“‘So,’ says he, in native, ‘here is the holy man.  He has been preaching\nagainst me, but that was not in his heart.  He has been preaching upon\nthe love of God; but that was not in his heart, it was between his teeth.\nWill you know what was in his heart?’—cries he.  ‘I will show it you!’\nAnd, making a snatch at my head, he made believe to pluck out a dollar,\nand held it in the air.\n\n“There went that rumour through the crowd with which Polynesians receive\na prodigy.  As for myself, I stood amazed.  The thing was a common\nconjuring trick which I have seen performed at home a score of times; but\nhow was I to convince the villagers of that?  I wished I had learned\nlegerdemain instead of Hebrew, that I might have paid the fellow out with\nhis own coin.  But there I was; I could not stand there silent, and the\nbest I could find to say was weak.\n\n“‘I will trouble you not to lay hands on me again,’ said I.\n\n“‘I have no such thought,’ said he, ‘nor will I deprive you of your\ndollar.  Here it is,’ he said, and flung it at my feet.  I am told it lay\nwhere it fell three days.”\n\n“I must say it was well played, said I.\n\n“O! he is clever,” said Mr. Tarleton, “and you can now see for yourself\nhow dangerous.  He was a party to the horrid death of the paralytic; he\nis accused of poisoning Adams; he drove Vigours out of the place by lies\nthat might have led to murder; and there is no question but he has now\nmade up his mind to rid himself of you.  How he means to try we have no\nguess; only be sure, it’s something new.  There is no end to his\nreadiness and invention.”\n\n“He gives himself a sight of trouble,” says I.  “And after all, what\nfor?”\n\n“Why, how many tons of copra may they make in this district?” asked the\nmissionary.\n\n“I daresay as much as sixty tons,” says I.\n\n“And what is the profit to the local trader?” he asked.\n\n“You may call it, three pounds,” said I.\n\n“Then you can reckon for yourself how much he does it for,” said Mr.\nTarleton.  “But the more important thing is to defeat him.  It is clear\nhe spread some report against Uma, in order to isolate and have his\nwicked will of her.  Failing of that, and seeing a new rival come upon\nthe scene, he used her in a different way.  Now, the first point to find\nout is about Namu.  Uma, when people began to leave you and your mother\nalone, what did Namu do?”\n\n“Stop away all-e-same,” says Uma.\n\n“I fear the dog has returned to his vomit,” said Mr. Tarleton.  “And now\nwhat am I to do for you?  I will speak to Namu, I will warn him he is\nobserved; it will be strange if he allow anything to go on amiss when he\nis put upon his guard.  At the same time, this precaution may fail, and\nthen you must turn elsewhere.  You have two people at hand to whom you\nmight apply.  There is, first of all, the priest, who might protect you\nby the Catholic interest; they are a wretchedly small body, but they\ncount two chiefs.  And then there is old Faiaso.  Ah! if it had been some\nyears ago you would have needed no one else; but his influence is much\nreduced, it has gone into Maea’s hands, and Maea, I fear, is one of\nCase’s jackals.  In fine, if the worst comes to the worst, you must send\nup or come yourself to Fale-alii, and, though I am not due at this end of\nthe island for a month, I will just see what can be done.”\n\nSo Mr. Tarleton said farewell; and half an hour later the crew were\nsinging and the paddles flashing in the missionary-boat.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER IV.  DEVIL-WORK.\n\n\nNear a month went by without much doing.  The same night of our marriage\nGaloshes called round, and made himself mighty civil, and got into a\nhabit of dropping in about dark and smoking his pipe with the family.  He\ncould talk to Uma, of course, and started to teach me native and French\nat the same time.  He was a kind old buffer, though the dirtiest you\nwould wish to see, and he muddled me up with foreign languages worse than\nthe tower of Babel.\n\nThat was one employment we had, and it made me feel less lonesome; but\nthere was no profit in the thing, for though the priest came and sat and\nyarned, none of his folks could be enticed into my store; and if it\nhadn’t been for the other occupation I struck out, there wouldn’t have\nbeen a pound of copra in the house.  This was the idea: Fa’avao (Uma’s\nmother) had a score of bearing trees.  Of course we could get no labour,\nbeing all as good as tabooed, and the two women and I turned to and made\ncopra with our own hands.  It was copra to make your mouth water when it\nwas done—I never understood how much the natives cheated me till I had\nmade that four hundred pounds of my own hand—and it weighed so light I\nfelt inclined to take and water it myself.\n\nWhen we were at the job a good many Kanakas used to put in the best of\nthe day looking on, and once that nigger turned up.  He stood back with\nthe natives and laughed and did the big don and the funny dog, till I\nbegan to get riled.\n\n“Here, you nigger!” says I.\n\n“I don’t address myself to you, Sah,” says the nigger.  “Only speak to\ngen’le’um.”\n\n“I know,” says I, “but it happens I was addressing myself to you, Mr.\nBlack Jack.  And all I want to know is just this: did you see Case’s\nfigurehead about a week ago?”\n\n“No, Sah,” says he.\n\n“That’s all right, then,” says I; “for I’ll show you the own brother to\nit, only black, in the inside of about two minutes.”\n\nAnd I began to walk towards him, quite slow, and my hands down; only\nthere was trouble in my eye, if anybody took the pains to look.\n\n“You’re a low, obstropulous fellow, Sah,” says he.\n\n“You bet!” says I.\n\nBy that time he thought I was about as near as convenient, and lit out so\nit would have done your heart good to see him travel.  And that was all I\nsaw of that precious gang until what I am about to tell you.\n\nIt was one of my chief employments these days to go pot-hunting in the\nwoods, which I found (as Case had told me) very rich in game.  I have\nspoken of the cape which shut up the village and my station from the\neast.  A path went about the end of it, and led into the next bay.  A\nstrong wind blew here daily, and as the line of the barrier reef stopped\nat the end of the cape, a heavy surf ran on the shores of the bay.  A\nlittle cliffy hill cut the valley in two parts, and stood close on the\nbeach; and at high water the sea broke right on the face of it, so that\nall passage was stopped.  Woody mountains hemmed the place all round; the\nbarrier to the east was particularly steep and leafy, the lower parts of\nit, along the sea, falling in sheer black cliffs streaked with cinnabar;\nthe upper part lumpy with the tops of the great trees.  Some of the trees\nwere bright green, and some red, and the sand of the beach as black as\nyour shoes.  Many birds hovered round the bay, some of them snow-white;\nand the flying-fox (or vampire) flew there in broad daylight, gnashing\nits teeth.\n\nFor a long while I came as far as this shooting, and went no farther.\nThere was no sign of any path beyond, and the cocoa-palms in the front of\nthe foot of the valley were the last this way.  For the whole “eye” of\nthe island, as natives call the windward end, lay desert.  From Falesá\nround about to Papa-malulu, there was neither house, nor man, nor planted\nfruit-tree; and the reef being mostly absent, and the shores bluff, the\nsea beat direct among crags, and there was scarce a landing-place.\n\nI should tell you that after I began to go in the woods, although no one\noffered to come near my store, I found people willing enough to pass the\ntime of day with me where nobody could see them; and as I had begun to\npick up native, and most of them had a word or two of English, I began to\nhold little odds and ends of conversation, not to much purpose to be\nsure, but they took off the worst of the feeling, for it’s a miserable\nthing to be made a leper of.\n\nIt chanced one day towards the end of the month, that I was sitting in\nthis bay in the edge of the bush, looking east, with a Kanaka.  I had\ngiven him a fill of tobacco, and we were making out to talk as best we\ncould; indeed, he had more English than most.\n\nI asked him if there was no road going eastward.\n\n“One time one road,” said he.  “Now he dead.”\n\n“Nobody he go there?” I asked.\n\n“No good,” said he.  “Too much devil he stop there.”\n\n“Oho!” says I, “got-um plenty devil, that bush?”\n\n“Man devil, woman devil; too much devil,” said my friend.  “Stop there\nall-e-time.  Man he go there, no come back.”\n\nI thought if this fellow was so well posted on devils and spoke of them\nso free, which is not common, I had better fish for a little information\nabout myself and Uma.\n\n“You think me one devil?” I asked.\n\n“No think devil,” said he soothingly.  “Think all-e-same fool.”\n\n“Uma, she devil?” I asked again.\n\n“No, no; no devil.  Devil stop bush,” said the young man.\n\nI was looking in front of me across the bay, and I saw the hanging front\nof the woods pushed suddenly open, and Case, with a gun in his hand, step\nforth into the sunshine on the black beach.  He was got up in light\npyjamas, near white, his gun sparkled, he looked mighty conspicuous; and\nthe land-crabs scuttled from all round him to their holes.\n\n“Hullo, my friend!” says I, “you no talk all-e-same true.  Ese he go, he\ncome back.”\n\n“Ese no all-e-same; Ese _Tiapolo_,” says my friend; and, with a\n“Good-bye,” slunk off among the trees.\n\nI watched Case all round the beach, where the tide was low; and let him\npass me on the homeward way to Falesá.  He was in deep thought, and the\nbirds seemed to know it, trotting quite near him on the sand, or wheeling\nand calling in his ears.  When he passed me I could see by the working of\nhis lips that he was talking to himself, and what pleased me mightily, he\nhad still my trade mark on his brow, I tell you the plain truth: I had a\nmind to give him a gunful in his ugly mug, but I thought better of it.\n\nAll this time, and all the time I was following home, I kept repeating\nthat native word, which I remembered by “Polly, put the kettle on and\nmake us all some tea,” tea-a-pollo.\n\n“Uma,” says I, when I got back, “what does _Tiapolo_ mean?”\n\n“Devil,” says she.\n\n“I thought _aitu_ was the word for that,” I said.\n\n“_Aitu_ ’nother kind of devil,” said she; “stop bush, eat Kanaka.\nTiapolo big chief devil, stop home; all-e-same Christian devil.”\n\n“Well then,” said I, “I’m no farther forward.  How can Case be Tiapolo?”\n\n“No all-e-same,” said she.  “Ese belong Tiapolo; Tiapolo too much like;\nEse all-e-same his son.  Suppose Ese he wish something, Tiapolo he make\nhim.”\n\n“That’s mighty convenient for Ese,” says I.  “And what kind of things\ndoes he make for him?”\n\nWell, out came a rigmarole of all sorts of stories, many of which (like\nthe dollar he took from Mr. Tarleton’s head) were plain enough to me, but\nothers I could make nothing of; and the thing that most surprised the\nKanakas was what surprised me least—namely, that he would go in the\ndesert among all the _aitus_.  Some of the boldest, however, had\naccompanied him, and had heard him speak with the dead and give them\norders, and, safe in his protection, had returned unscathed.  Some said\nhe had a church there, where he worshipped Tiapolo, and Tiapolo appeared\nto him; others swore that there was no sorcery at all, that he performed\nhis miracles by the power of prayer, and the church was no church, but a\nprison, in which he had confined a dangerous _aitu_.  Namu had been in\nthe bush with him once, and returned glorifying God for these wonders.\nAltogether, I began to have a glimmer of the man’s position, and the\nmeans by which he had acquired it, and, though I saw he was a tough nut\nto crack, I was noways cast down.\n\n“Very well,” said I, “I’ll have a look at Master Case’s place of worship\nmyself, and we’ll see about the glorifying.”\n\nAt this Uma fell in a terrible taking; if I went in the high bush I\nshould never return; none could go there but by the protection of\nTiapolo.\n\n“I’ll chance it on God’s,” said I.  “I’m a good sort of a fellow, Uma, as\nfellows go, and I guess God’ll con me through.”\n\nShe was silent for a while.  “I think,” said she, mighty solemn—and then,\npresently—“Victoreea, he big chief?”\n\n“You bet!” said I.\n\n“He like you too much?” she asked again.\n\nI told her, with a grin, I believed the old lady was rather partial to\nme.\n\n“All right,” said she.  “Victoreea he big chief, like you too much.  No\ncan help you here in Falesá; no can do—too far off.  Maea he small\nchief—stop here.  Suppose he like you—make you all right.  All-e-same God\nand Tiapolo.  God he big chief—got too much work.  Tiapolo he small\nchief—he like too much make-see, work very hard.”\n\n“I’ll have to hand you over to Mr. Tarleton,” said I.  “Your theology’s\nout of its bearings, Uma.”\n\nHowever, we stuck to this business all the evening, and, with the stories\nshe told me of the desert and its dangers, she came near frightening\nherself into a fit.  I don’t remember half a quarter of them, of course,\nfor I paid little heed; but two come back to me kind of clear.\n\nAbout six miles up the coast there is a sheltered cove they call\n_Fanga-anaana_—“the haven full of caves.”  I’ve seen it from the sea\nmyself, as near as I could get my boys to venture in; and it’s a little\nstrip of yellow sand.  Black cliffs overhang it, full of the black mouths\nof caves; great trees overhang the cliffs, and dangle-down lianas; and in\none place, about the middle, a big brook pours over in a cascade.  Well,\nthere was a boat going by here, with six young men of Falesá, “all very\npretty,” Uma said, which was the loss of them.  It blew strong, there was\na heavy head sea, and by the time they opened Fanga-anaana, and saw the\nwhite cascade and the shady beach, they were all tired and thirsty, and\ntheir water had run out.  One proposed to land and get a drink, and,\nbeing reckless fellows, they were all of the same mind except the\nyoungest.  Lotu was his name; he was a very good young gentleman, and\nvery wise; and he held out that they were crazy, telling them the place\nwas given over to spirits and devils and the dead, and there were no\nliving folk nearer than six miles the one way, and maybe twelve the\nother.  But they laughed at his words, and, being five to one, pulled in,\nbeached the boat, and landed.  It was a wonderful pleasant place, Lotu\nsaid, and the water excellent.  They walked round the beach, but could\nsee nowhere any way to mount the cliffs, which made them easier in their\nmind; and at last they sat down to make a meal on the food they had\nbrought with them.  They were scarce set, when there came out of the\nmouth of one of the black caves six of the most beautiful ladies ever\nseen: they had flowers in their hair, and the most beautiful breasts, and\nnecklaces of scarlet seeds; and began to jest with these young gentlemen,\nand the young gentlemen to jest back with them, all but Lotu.  As for\nLotu, he saw there could be no living woman in such a place, and ran, and\nflung himself in the bottom of the boat, and covered his face, and\nprayed.  All the time the business lasted Lotu made one clean break of\nprayer, and that was all he knew of it, until his friends came back, and\nmade him sit up, and they put to sea again out of the bay, which was now\nquite desert, and no word of the six ladies.  But, what frightened Lotu\nmost, not one of the five remembered anything of what had passed, but\nthey were all like drunken men, and sang and laughed in the boat, and\nskylarked.  The wind freshened and came squally, and the sea rose\nextraordinary high; it was such weather as any man in the islands would\nhave turned his back to and fled home to Falesá; but these five were like\ncrazy folk, and cracked on all sail and drove their boat into the seas.\nLotu went to the bailing; none of the others thought to help him, but\nsang and skylarked and carried on, and spoke singular things beyond a\nman’s comprehension, and laughed out loud when they said them.  So the\nrest of the day Lotu bailed for his life in the bottom of the boat, and\nwas all drenched with sweat and cold sea-water; and none heeded him.\nAgainst all expectation, they came safe in a dreadful tempest to\nPapa-malulu, where the palms were singing out, and the cocoa-nuts flying\nlike cannon-balls about the village green; and the same night the five\nyoung gentlemen sickened, and spoke never a reasonable word until they\ndied.\n\n“And do you mean to tell me you can swallow a yarn like that?” I asked.\n\nShe told me the thing was well known, and with handsome young men alone\nit was even common; but this was the only case where five had been slain\nthe same day and in a company by the love of the women-devils; and it had\nmade a great stir in the island, and she would be crazy if she doubted.\n\n“Well, anyway,” says I, “you needn’t be frightened about me.  I’ve no use\nfor the women-devils.  You’re all the women I want, and all the devil\ntoo, old lady.”\n\nTo this she answered there were other sorts, and she had seen one with\nher own eyes.  She had gone one day alone to the next bay, and, perhaps,\ngot too near the margin of the bad place.  The boughs of the high bush\novershadowed her from the cant of the hill, but she herself was outside\non a flat place, very stony and growing full of young mummy-apples four\nand five feet high.  It was a dark day in the rainy season, and now there\ncame squalls that tore off the leaves and sent them flying, and now it\nwas all still as in a house.  It was in one of these still times that a\nwhole gang of birds and flying foxes came pegging out of the bush like\ncreatures frightened.  Presently after she heard a rustle nearer hand,\nand saw, coming out of the margin of the trees, among the mummy-apples,\nthe appearance of a lean grey old boar.  It seemed to think as it came,\nlike a person; and all of a sudden, as she looked at it coming, she was\naware it was no boar but a thing that was a man with a man’s thoughts.\nAt that she ran, and the pig after her, and as the pig ran it holla’d\naloud, so that the place rang with it.\n\n“I wish I had been there with my gun,” said I.  “I guess that pig would\nhave holla’d so as to surprise himself.”\n\nBut she told me a gun was of no use with the like of these, which were\nthe spirits of the dead.\n\nWell, this kind of talk put in the evening, which was the best of it; but\nof course it didn’t change my notion, and the next day, with my gun and a\ngood knife, I set off upon a voyage of discovery.  I made, as near as I\ncould, for the place where I had seen Case come out; for if it was true\nhe had some kind of establishment in the bush I reckoned I should find a\npath.  The beginning of the desert was marked off by a wall, to call it\nso, for it was more of a long mound of stones.  They say it reaches right\nacross the island, but how they know it is another question, for I doubt\nif anyone has made the journey in a hundred years, the natives sticking\nchiefly to the sea and their little colonies along the coast, and that\npart being mortal high and steep and full of cliffs.  Up to the west side\nof the wall, the ground has been cleared, and there are cocoa palms and\nmummy-apples and guavas, and lots of sensitive plants.  Just across, the\nbush begins outright; high bush at that, trees going up like the masts of\nships, and ropes of liana hanging down like a ship’s rigging, and nasty\norchids growing in the forks like funguses.  The ground where there was\nno underwood looked to be a heap of boulders.  I saw many green pigeons\nwhich I might have shot, only I was there with a different idea.  A\nnumber of butterflies flopped up and down along the ground like dead\nleaves; sometimes I would hear a bird calling, sometimes the wind\noverhead, and always the sea along the coast.\n\nBut the queerness of the place it’s more difficult to tell of, unless to\none who has been alone in the high bush himself.  The brightest kind of a\nday it is always dim down there.  A man can see to the end of nothing;\nwhichever way he looks the wood shuts up, one bough folding with another\nlike the fingers of your hand; and whenever he listens he hears always\nsomething new—men talking, children laughing, the strokes of an axe a far\nway ahead of him, and sometimes a sort of a quick, stealthy scurry near\nat hand that makes him jump and look to his weapons.  It’s all very well\nfor him to tell himself that he’s alone, bar trees and birds; he can’t\nmake out to believe it; whichever way he turns the whole place seems to\nbe alive and looking on.  Don’t think it was Uma’s yarns that put me out;\nI don’t value native talk a fourpenny-piece; it’s a thing that’s natural\nin the bush, and that’s the end of it.\n\nAs I got near the top of the hill, for the ground of the wood goes up in\nthis place steep as a ladder, the wind began to sound straight on, and\nthe leaves to toss and switch open and let in the sun.  This suited me\nbetter; it was the same noise all the time, and nothing to startle.\nWell, I had got to a place where there was an underwood of what they call\nwild cocoanut—mighty pretty with its scarlet fruit—when there came a\nsound of singing in the wind that I thought I had never heard the like\nof.  It was all very fine to tell myself it was the branches; I knew\nbetter.  It was all very fine to tell myself it was a bird; I knew never\na bird that sang like that.  It rose and swelled, and died away and\nswelled again; and now I thought it was like someone weeping, only\nprettier; and now I thought it was like harps; and there was one thing I\nmade sure of, it was a sight too sweet to be wholesome in a place like\nthat.  You may laugh if you like; but I declare I called to mind the six\nyoung ladies that came, with their scarlet necklaces, out of the cave at\nFanga-anaana, and wondered if they sang like that.  We laugh at the\nnatives and their superstitions; but see how many traders take them up,\nsplendidly educated white men, that have been book-keepers (some of them)\nand clerks in the old country.  It’s my belief a superstition grows up in\na place like the different kind of weeds; and as I stood there and\nlistened to that wailing I twittered in my shoes.\n\nYou may call me a coward to be frightened; I thought myself brave enough\nto go on ahead.  But I went mighty carefully, with my gun cocked, spying\nall about me like a hunter, fully expecting to see a handsome young woman\nsitting somewhere in the bush, and fully determined (if I did) to try her\nwith a charge of duck-shot.  And sure enough, I had not gone far when I\nmet with a queer thing.  The wind came on the top of the wood in a strong\npuff, the leaves in front of me burst open, and I saw for a second\nsomething hanging in a tree.  It was gone in a wink, the puff blowing by\nand the leaves closing.  I tell you the truth: I had made up my mind to\nsee an _aitu_; and if the thing had looked like a pig or a woman, it\nwouldn’t have given me the same turn.  The trouble was that it seemed\nkind of square, and the idea of a square thing that was alive and sang\nknocked me sick and silly.  I must have stood quite a while; and I made\npretty certain it was right out of the same tree that the singing came.\nThen I began to come to myself a bit.\n\n“Well,” says I, “if this is really so, if this is a place where there are\nsquare things that sing, I’m gone up anyway.  Let’s have my fun for my\nmoney.”\n\nBut I thought I might as well take the off chance of a prayer being any\ngood; so I plumped on my knees and prayed out loud; and all the time I\nwas praying the strange sounds came out of the tree, and went up and\ndown, and changed, for all the world like music, only you could see it\nwasn’t human—there was nothing there that you could whistle.\n\nAs soon as I had made an end in proper style, I laid down my gun, stuck\nmy knife between my teeth, walked right up to that tree, and began to\nclimb.  I tell you my heart was like ice.  But presently, as I went up, I\ncaught another glimpse of the thing, and that relieved me, for I thought\nit seemed like a box; and when I had got right up to it I near fell out\nof the tree with laughing.\n\nA box it was, sure enough, and a candle-box at that, with the brand upon\nthe side of it; and it had banjo strings stretched so as to sound when\nthe wind blew.  I believe they call the thing a Tyrolean {3} harp,\nwhatever that may mean.\n\n“Well, Mr. Case,” said I, “you’ve frightened me once, but I defy you to\nfrighten me again,” I says, and slipped down the tree, and set out again\nto find my enemy’s head office, which I guessed would not be far away.\n\nThe undergrowth was thick in this part; I couldn’t see before my nose,\nand must burst my way through by main force and ply the knife as I went,\nslicing the cords of the lianas and slashing down whole trees at a blow.\nI call them trees for the bigness, but in truth they were just big weeds,\nand sappy to cut through like carrot.  From all this crowd and kind of\nvegetation, I was just thinking to myself, the place might have once been\ncleared, when I came on my nose over a pile of stones, and saw in a\nmoment it was some kind of a work of man.  The Lord knows when it was\nmade or when deserted, for this part of the island has lain undisturbed\nsince long before the whites came.  A few steps beyond I hit into the\npath I had been always looking for.  It was narrow, but well beaten, and\nI saw that Case had plenty of disciples.  It seems, indeed, it was a\npiece of fashionable boldness to venture up here with the trader, and a\nyoung man scarce reckoned himself grown till he had got his breech\ntattooed, for one thing, and seen Case’s devils for another.  This is\nmighty like Kanakas; but, if you look at it another way, it’s mighty like\nwhite folks too.\n\nA bit along the path I was brought to a clear stand, and had to rub my\neyes.  There was a wall in front of me, the path passing it by a gap; it\nwas tumbledown and plainly very old, but built of big stones very well\nlaid; and there is no native alive to-day upon that island that could\ndream of such a piece of building.  Along all the top of it was a line of\nqueer figures, idols or scarecrows, or what not.  They had carved and\npainted faces ugly to view, their eyes and teeth were of shell, their\nhair and their bright clothes blew in the wind, and some of them worked\nwith the tugging.  There are islands up west where they make these kind\nof figures till to-day; but if ever they were made in this island, the\npractice and the very recollection of it are now long forgotten.  And the\nsingular thing was that all these bogies were as fresh as toys out of a\nshop.\n\nThen it came in my mind that Case had let out to me the first day that he\nwas a good forger of island curiosities, a thing by which so many traders\nturn an honest penny.  And with that I saw the whole business, and how\nthis display served the man a double purpose: first of all, to season his\ncuriosities, and then to frighten those that came to visit him.\n\nBut I should tell you (what made the thing more curious) that all the\ntime the Tyrolean harps were harping round me in the trees, and even\nwhile I looked, a green-and-yellow bird (that, I suppose, was building)\nbegan to tear the hair off the head of one of the figures.\n\nA little farther on I found the best curiosity of the museum.  The first\nI saw of it was a longish mound of earth with a twist to it.  Digging off\nthe earth with my hands, I found underneath tarpaulin stretched on\nboards, so that this was plainly the roof of a cellar.  It stood right on\nthe top of the hill, and the entrance was on the far side, between two\nrocks, like the entrance to a cave.  I went as far in as the bend, and,\nlooking round the corner, saw a shining face.  It was big and ugly, like\na pantomime mask, and the brightness of it waxed and dwindled, and at\ntimes it smoked.\n\n“Oho!” says I, “luminous paint!”\n\nAnd I must say I rather admired the man’s ingenuity.  With a box of tools\nand a few mighty simple contrivances he had made out to have a devil of a\ntemple.  Any poor Kanaka brought up here in the dark, with the harps\nwhining all round him, and shown that smoking face in the bottom of a\nhole, would make no kind of doubt but he had seen and heard enough devils\nfor a lifetime.  It’s easy to find out what Kanakas think.  Just go back\nto yourself any way round from ten to fifteen years old, and there’s an\naverage Kanaka.  There are some pious, just as there are pious boys; and\nthe most of them, like the boys again, are middling honest and yet think\nit rather larks to steal, and are easy scared and rather like to be so.\nI remember a boy I was at school with at home who played the Case\nbusiness.  He didn’t know anything, that boy; he couldn’t do anything; he\nhad no luminous paint and no Tyrolean harps; he just boldly said he was a\nsorcerer, and frightened us out of our boots, and we loved it.  And then\nit came in my mind how the master had once flogged that boy, and the\nsurprise we were all in to see the sorcerer catch it and bum like anybody\nelse.  Thinks I to myself, “I must find some way of fixing it so for\nMaster Case.”  And the next moment I had my idea.\n\nI went back by the path, which, when once you had found it, was quite\nplain and easy walking; and when I stepped out on the black sands, who\nshould I see but Master Case himself.  I cocked my gun and held it handy,\nand we marched up and passed without a word, each keeping the tail of his\neye on the other; and no sooner had we passed than we each wheeled round\nlike fellows drilling, and stood face to face.  We had each taken the\nsame notion in his head, you see, that the other fellow might give him\nthe load of his gun in the stern.\n\n“You’ve shot nothing,” says Case.\n\n“I’m not on the shoot to-day,” said I.\n\n“Well, the devil go with you for me,” says he.\n\n“The same to you,” says I.\n\nBut we stuck just the way we were; no fear of either of us moving.\n\nCase laughed.  “We can’t stop here all day, though,” said he.\n\n“Don’t let me detain you,” says I.\n\nHe laughed again.  “Look here, Wiltshire, do you think me a fool?” he\nasked.\n\n“More of a knave, if you want to know,” says I.\n\n“Well, do you think it would better me to shoot you here, on this open\nbeach?” said he.  “Because I don’t.  Folks come fishing every day.  There\nmay be a score of them up the valley now, making copra; there might be\nhalf a dozen on the hill behind you, after pigeons; they might be\nwatching us this minute, and I shouldn’t wonder.  I give you my word I\ndon’t want to shoot you.  Why should I?  You don’t hinder me any.  You\nhaven’t got one pound of copra but what you made with your own hands,\nlike a negro slave.  You’re vegetating—that’s what I call it—and I don’t\ncare where you vegetate, nor yet how long.  Give me your word you don’t\nmean to shoot me, and I’ll give you a lead and walk away.”\n\n“Well,” said I, “You’re frank and pleasant, ain’t you?  And I’ll be the\nsame.  I don’t mean to shoot you to-day.  Why should I?  This business is\nbeginning; it ain’t done yet, Mr. Case.  I’ve given you one turn already;\nI can see the marks of my knuckles on your head to this blooming hour,\nand I’ve more cooking for you.  I’m not a paralee, like Underhill.  My\nname ain’t Adams, and it ain’t Vigours; and I mean to show you that\nyou’ve met your match.”\n\n“This is a silly way to talk,” said he.  “This is not the talk to make me\nmove on with.”\n\n“All right,” said I, “stay where you are.  I ain’t in any hurry, and you\nknow it.  I can put in a day on this beach and never mind.  I ain’t got\nany copra to bother with.  I ain’t got any luminous paint to see to.”\n\nI was sorry I said that last, but it whipped out before I knew.  I could\nsee it took the wind out of his sails, and he stood and stared at me with\nhis brow drawn up.  Then I suppose he made up his mind he must get to the\nbottom of this.\n\n“I take you at your word,” says he, and turned his back, and walked right\ninto the devil’s bush.\n\nI let him go, of course, for I had passed my word.  But I watched him as\nlong as he was in sight, and after he was gone lit out for cover as\nlively as you would want to see, and went the rest of the way home under\nthe bush, for I didn’t trust him sixpence-worth.  One thing I saw, I had\nbeen ass enough to give him warning, and that which I meant to do I must\ndo at once.\n\nYou would think I had had about enough excitement for one morning, but\nthere was another turn waiting me.  As soon as I got far enough round the\ncape to see my house I made out there were strangers there; a little\nfarther, and no doubt about it.  There was a couple of armed sentinels\nsquatting at my door.  I could only suppose the trouble about Uma must\nhave come to a head, and the station been seized.  For aught I could\nthink, Uma was taken up already, and these armed men were waiting to do\nthe like with me.\n\nHowever, as I came nearer, which I did at top speed, I saw there was a\nthird native sitting on the verandah like a guest, and Uma was talking\nwith him like a hostess.  Nearer still I made out it was the big young\nchief, Maea, and that he was smiling away and smoking.  And what was he\nsmoking?  None of your European cigarettes fit for a cat, not even the\ngenuine big, knock-me-down native article that a fellow can really put in\nthe time with if his pipe is broke—but a cigar, and one of my Mexicans at\nthat, that I could swear to.  At sight of this my heart started beating,\nand I took a wild hope in my head that the trouble was over, and Maea had\ncome round.\n\nUma pointed me out to him as I came up, and he met me at the head of my\nown stairs like a thorough gentleman.\n\n“Vilivili,” said he, which was the best they could make of my name, “I\npleased.”\n\nThere is no doubt when an island chief wants to be civil he can do it.  I\nsaw the way things were from the word go.  There was no call for Uma to\nsay to me: “He no ’fraid Ese now, come bring copra.”  I tell you I shook\nhands with that Kanaka like as if he was the best white man in Europe.\n\nThe fact was, Case and he had got after the same girl; or Maea suspected\nit, and concluded to make hay of the trader on the chance.  He had\ndressed himself up, got a couple of his retainers cleaned and armed to\nkind of make the thing more public, and, just waiting till Case was clear\nof the village, came round to put the whole of his business my way.  He\nwas rich as well as powerful.  I suppose that man was worth fifty\nthousand nuts per annum.  I gave him the price of the beach and a quarter\ncent better, and as for credit, I would have advanced him the inside of\nthe store and the fittings besides, I was so pleased to see him.  I must\nsay he bought like a gentleman: rice and tins and biscuits enough for a\nweek’s feast, and stuffs by the bolt.  He was agreeable besides; he had\nplenty fun to him; and we cracked jests together, mostly through the\ninterpreter, because he had mighty little English, and my native was\nstill off colour.  One thing I made out: he could never really have\nthought much harm of Uma; he could never have been really frightened, and\nmust just have made believe from dodginess, and because he thought Case\nhad a strong pull in the village and could help him on.\n\nThis set me thinking that both he and I were in a tightish place.  What\nhe had done was to fly in the face of the whole village, and the thing\nmight cost him his authority.  More than that, after my talk with Case on\nthe beach, I thought it might very well cost me my life.  Case had as\ngood as said he would pot me if ever I got any copra; he would come home\nto find the best business in the village had changed hands; and the best\nthing I thought I could do was to get in first with the potting.\n\n“See here, Uma,” says I, “tell him I’m sorry I made him wait, but I was\nup looking at Case’s Tiapolo store in the bush.”\n\n“He want savvy if you no ’fraid?” translated Uma.\n\nI laughed out.  “Not much!” says I.  “Tell him the place is a blooming\ntoy-shop!  Tell him in England we give these things to the kids to play\nwith.”\n\n“He want savvy if you hear devil sing?” she asked next.\n\n“Look here,” I said, “I can’t do it now because I’ve got no banjo-strings\nin stock; but the next time the ship comes round I’ll have one of these\nsame contraptions right here in my verandah, and he can see for himself\nhow much devil there is to it.  Tell him, as soon as I can get the\nstrings I’ll make one for his picaninnies.  The name of the concern is a\nTyrolean harp; and you can tell him the name means in English that nobody\nbut dam-fools give a cent for it.”\n\nThis time he was so pleased he had to try his English again.  “You talk\ntrue?” says he.\n\n“Rather!” said I.  “Talk all-e-same Bible.  Bring out a Bible here, Uma,\nif you’ve got such a thing, and I’ll kiss it.  Or, I’ll tell you what’s\nbetter still,” says I, taking a header, “ask him if he’s afraid to go up\nthere himself by day.”\n\nIt appeared he wasn’t; he could venture as far as that by day and in\ncompany.\n\n“That’s the ticket, then!” said I.  “Tell him the man’s a fraud and the\nplace foolishness, and if he’ll go up there to-morrow he’ll see all\nthat’s left of it.  But tell him this, Uma, and mind he understands it:\nIf he gets talking, it’s bound to come to Case, and I’m a dead man!  I’m\nplaying his game, tell him, and if he says one word my blood will be at\nhis door and be the damnation of him here and after.”\n\nShe told him, and he shook hands with me up to the hilt, and, says he:\n“No talk.  Go up to-morrow.  You my friend?”\n\n“No sir,” says I, “no such foolishness.  I’ve come here to trade, tell\nhim, and not to make friends.  But, as to Case, I’ll send that man to\nglory!”\n\nSo off Maea went, pretty well pleased, as I could see.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER V.  NIGHT IN THE BUSH.\n\n\nWell, I was committed now; Tiapolo had to be smashed up before next day,\nand my hands were pretty full, not only with preparations, but with\nargument.  My house was like a mechanics’ debating society: Uma was so\nmade up that I shouldn’t go into the bush by night, or that, if I did, I\nwas never to come back again.  You know her style of arguing: you’ve had\na specimen about Queen Victoria and the devil; and I leave you to fancy\nif I was tired of it before dark.\n\nAt last I had a good idea.  What was the use of casting my pearls before\nher?  I thought; some of her own chopped hay would be likelier to do the\nbusiness.\n\n“I’ll tell you what, then,” said I.  “You fish out your Bible, and I’ll\ntake that up along with me.  That’ll make me right.”\n\nShe swore a Bible was no use.\n\n“That’s just your Kanaka ignorance,” said I.  “Bring the Bible out.”\n\nShe brought it, and I turned to the title-page, where I thought there\nwould likely be some English, and so there was.  “There!” said I.  “Look\nat that!  ‘_London_: _Printed for the British and Foreign Bible Society_,\n_Blackfriars_,’ and the date, which I can’t read, owing to its being in\nthese X’s.  There’s no devil in hell can look near the Bible Society,\nBlackfriars.  Why, you silly!”  I said, “how do you suppose we get along\nwith our own _aitus_ at home?  All Bible Society!”\n\n“I think you no got any,” said she.  “White man, he tell me you no got.”\n\n“Sounds likely, don’t it?” I asked.  “Why would these islands all be\nchock full of them and none in Europe?”\n\n“Well, you no got breadfruit,” said she.\n\nI could have torn my hair.  “Now look here, old lady,” said I, “you dry\nup, for I’m tired of you.  I’ll take the Bible, which’ll put me as\nstraight as the mail, and that’s the last word I’ve got to say.”\n\nThe night fell extraordinary dark, clouds coming up with sundown and\noverspreading all; not a star showed; there was only an end of a moon,\nand that not due before the small hours.  Round the village, what with\nthe lights and the fires in the open houses, and the torches of many\nfishers moving on the reef, it kept as gay as an illumination; but the\nsea and the mountains and woods were all clean gone.  I suppose it might\nbe eight o’clock when I took the road, laden like a donkey.  First there\nwas that Bible, a book as big as your head, which I had let myself in for\nby my own tomfoolery.  Then there was my gun, and knife, and lantern, and\npatent matches, all necessary.  And then there was the real plant of the\naffair in hand, a mortal weight of gunpowder, a pair of dynamite\nfishing-bombs, and two or three pieces of slow match that I had hauled\nout of the tin cases and spliced together the best way I could; for the\nmatch was only trade stuff, and a man would be crazy that trusted it.\nAltogether, you see, I had the materials of a pretty good blow-up!\nExpense was nothing to me; I wanted that thing done right.\n\nAs long as I was in the open, and had the lamp in my house to steer by, I\ndid well.  But when I got to the path, it fell so dark I could make no\nheadway, walking into trees and swearing there, like a man looking for\nthe matches in his bed-room.  I knew it was risky to light up, for my\nlantern would be visible all the way to the point of the cape, and as no\none went there after dark, it would be talked about, and come to Case’s\nears.  But what was I to do?  I had either to give the business over and\nlose caste with Maea, or light up, take my chance, and get through the\nthing the smartest I was able.\n\nAs long as I was on the path I walked hard, but when I came to the black\nbeach I had to run.  For the tide was now nearly flowed; and to get\nthrough with my powder dry between the surf and the steep hill, took all\nthe quickness I possessed.  As it was, even, the wash caught me to the\nknees, and I came near falling on a stone.  All this time the hurry I was\nin, and the free air and smell of the sea, kept my spirits lively; but\nwhen I was once in the bush and began to climb the path I took it easier.\nThe fearsomeness of the wood had been a good bit rubbed off for me by\nMaster Case’s banjo-strings and graven images, yet I thought it was a\ndreary walk, and guessed, when the disciples went up there, they must be\nbadly scared.  The light of the lantern, striking among all these trunks\nand forked branches and twisted rope-ends of lianas, made the whole\nplace, or all that you could see of it, a kind of a puzzle of turning\nshadows.  They came to meet you, solid and quick like giants, and then\nspan off and vanished; they hove up over your head like clubs, and flew\naway into the night like birds.  The floor of the bush glimmered with\ndead wood, the way the match-box used to shine after you had struck a\nlucifer.  Big, cold drops fell on me from the branches overhead like\nsweat.  There was no wind to mention; only a little icy breath of a\nland-breeze that stirred nothing; and the harps were silent.\n\nThe first landfall I made was when I got through the bush of wild\ncocoanuts, and came in view of the bogies on the wall.  Mighty queer they\nlooked by the shining of the lantern, with their painted faces and shell\neyes, and their clothes and their hair hanging.  One after another I\npulled them all up and piled them in a bundle on the cellar roof, so as\nthey might go to glory with the rest.  Then I chose a place behind one of\nthe big stones at the entrance, buried my powder and the two shells, and\narranged my match along the passage.  And then I had a look at the\nsmoking head, just for good-bye.  It was doing fine.\n\n“Cheer up,” says I.  “You’re booked.”\n\nIt was my first idea to light up and be getting homeward; for the\ndarkness and the glimmer of the dead wood and the shadows of the lantern\nmade me lonely.  But I knew where one of the harps hung; it seemed a pity\nit shouldn’t go with the rest; and at the same time I couldn’t help\nletting on to myself that I was mortal tired of my employment, and would\nlike best to be at home and have the door shut.  I stepped out of the\ncellar and argued it fore and back.  There was a sound of the sea far\ndown below me on the coast; nearer hand not a leaf stirred; I might have\nbeen the only living creature this side of Cape Horn.  Well, as I stood\nthere thinking, it seemed the bush woke and became full of little noises.\nLittle noises they were, and nothing to hurt—a bit of a crackle, a bit of\na rush—but the breath jumped right out of me and my throat went as dry as\na biscuit.  It wasn’t Case I was afraid of, which would have been\ncommon-sense; I never thought of Case; what took me, as sharp as the\ncolic, was the old wives’ tales, the devil-women and the man-pigs.  It\nwas the toss of a penny whether I should run: but I got a purchase on\nmyself, and stepped out, and held up the lantern (like a fool) and looked\nall round.\n\nIn the direction of the village and the path there was nothing to be\nseen; but when I turned inland it’s a wonder to me I didn’t drop.  There,\ncoming right up out of the desert and the bad bush—there, sure enough,\nwas a devil-woman, just as the way I had figured she would look.  I saw\nthe light shine on her bare arms and her bright eyes, and there went out\nof me a yell so big that I thought it was my death.\n\n“Ah!  No sing out!” says the devil-woman, in a kind of a high whisper.\n“Why you talk big voice?  Put out light!  Ese he come.”\n\n“My God Almighty, Uma, is that you?” says I.\n\n“_Ioe_,” {4} says she.  “I come quick.  Ese here soon.”\n\n“You come alone?” I asked.  “You no ’fraid?”\n\n“Ah, too much ’fraid!” she whispered, clutching me.  “I think die.”\n\n“Well,” says I, with a kind of a weak grin, “I’m not the one to laugh at\nyou, Mrs. Wiltshire, for I’m about the worst scared man in the South\nPacific myself.”\n\nShe told me in two words what brought her.  I was scarce gone, it seems,\nwhen Fa’avao came in, and the old woman had met Black Jack running as\nhard as he was fit from our house to Case’s.  Uma neither spoke nor\nstopped, but lit right out to come and warn me.  She was so close at my\nheels that the lantern was her guide across the beach, and afterwards, by\nthe glimmer of it in the trees, she got her line up hill.  It was only\nwhen I had got to the top or was in the cellar that she wandered Lord\nknows where! and lost a sight of precious time, afraid to call out lest\nCase was at the heels of her, and falling in the bush, so that she was\nall knocked and bruised.  That must have been when she got too far to the\nsouthward, and how she came to take me in the flank at last and frighten\nme beyond what I’ve got the words to tell of.\n\nWell, anything was better than a devil-woman, but I thought her yarn\nserious enough.  Black Jack had no call to be about my house, unless he\nwas set there to watch; and it looked to me as if my tomfool word about\nthe paint, and perhaps some chatter of Maea’s, had got us all in a clove\nhitch.  One thing was clear: Uma and I were here for the night; we\ndaren’t try to go home before day, and even then it would be safer to\nstrike round up the mountain and come in by the back of the village, or\nwe might walk into an ambuscade.  It was plain, too, that the mine should\nbe sprung immediately, or Case might be in time to stop it.\n\nI marched into the tunnel, Uma keeping tight hold of me, opened my\nlantern and lit the match.  The first length of it burned like a spill of\npaper, and I stood stupid, watching it burn, and thinking we were going\naloft with Tiapolo, which was none of my views.  The second took to a\nbetter rate, though faster than I cared about; and at that I got my wits\nagain, hauled Uma clear of the passage, blew out and dropped the lantern,\nand the pair of us groped our way into the bush until I thought it might\nbe safe, and lay down together by a tree.\n\n“Old lady,” I said, “I won’t forget this night.  You’re a trump, and\nthat’s what’s wrong with you.”\n\nShe humped herself close up to me.  She had run out the way she was, with\nnothing on her but her kilt; and she was all wet with the dews and the\nsea on the black beach, and shook straight on with cold and the terror of\nthe dark and the devils.\n\n“Too much ’fraid,” was all she said.\n\nThe far side of Case’s hill goes down near as steep as a precipice into\nthe next valley.  We were on the very edge of it, and I could see the\ndead wood shine and hear the sea sound far below.  I didn’t care about\nthe position, which left me no retreat, but I was afraid to change.  Then\nI saw I had made a worse mistake about the lantern, which I should have\nleft lighted, so that I could have had a crack at Case when he stepped\ninto the shine of it.  And even if I hadn’t had the wit to do that, it\nseemed a senseless thing to leave the good lantern to blow up with the\ngraven images.  The thing belonged to me, after all, and was worth money,\nand might come in handy.  If I could have trusted the match, I might have\nrun in still and rescued it.  But who was going to trust the match?  You\nknow what trade is.  The stuff was good enough for Kanakas to go fishing\nwith, where they’ve got to look lively anyway, and the most they risk is\nonly to have their hand blown off.  But for anyone that wanted to fool\naround a blow-up like mine that match was rubbish.\n\nAltogether the best I could do was to lie still, see my shot-gun handy,\nand wait for the explosion.  But it was a solemn kind of a business.  The\nblackness of the night was like solid; the only thing you could see was\nthe nasty bogy glimmer of the dead wood, and that showed you nothing but\nitself; and as for sounds, I stretched my ears till I thought I could\nhave heard the match burn in the tunnel, and that bush was as silent as a\ncoffin.  Now and then there was a bit of a crack; but whether it was near\nor far, whether it was Case stubbing his toes within a few yards of me,\nor a tree breaking miles away, I knew no more than the babe unborn.\n\nAnd then, all of a sudden, Vesuvius went off.  It was a long time coming;\nbut when it came (though I say it that shouldn’t) no man could ask to see\na better.  At first it was just a son of a gun of a row, and a spout of\nfire, and the wood lighted up so that you could see to read.  And then\nthe trouble began.  Uma and I were half buried under a wagonful of earth,\nand glad it was no worse, for one of the rocks at the entrance of the\ntunnel was fired clean into the air, fell within a couple of fathoms of\nwhere we lay, and bounded over the edge of the hill, and went pounding\ndown into the next valley.  I saw I had rather undercalculated our\ndistance, or over-done the dynamite and powder, which you please.\n\nAnd presently I saw I had made another slip.  The noise of the thing\nbegan to die off, shaking the island; the dazzle was over; and yet the\nnight didn’t come back the way I expected.  For the whole wood was\nscattered with red coals and brands from the explosion; they were all\nround me on the flat; some had fallen below in the valley, and some stuck\nand flared in the tree-tops.  I had no fear of fire, for these forests\nare too wet to kindle.  But the trouble was that the place was all lit\nup-not very bright, but good enough to get a shot by; and the way the\ncoals were scattered, it was just as likely Case might have the advantage\nas myself.  I looked all round for his white face, you may be sure; but\nthere was not a sign of him.  As for Uma, the life seemed to have been\nknocked right out of her by the bang and blaze of it.\n\nThere was one bad point in my game.  One of the blessed graven images had\ncome down all afire, hair and clothes and body, not four yards away from\nme.  I cast a mighty noticing glance all round; there was still no Case,\nand I made up my mind I must get rid of that burning stick before he\ncame, or I should be shot there like a dog.\n\nIt was my first idea to have crawled, and then I thought speed was the\nmain thing, and stood half up to make a rush.  The same moment from\nsomewhere between me and the sea there came a flash and a report, and a\nrifle bullet screeched in my ear.  I swung straight round and up with my\ngun, but the brute had a Winchester, and before I could as much as see\nhim his second shot knocked me over like a nine-pin.  I seemed to fly in\nthe air, then came down by the run and lay half a minute, silly; and then\nI found my hands empty, and my gun had flown over my head as I fell.  It\nmakes a man mighty wide awake to be in the kind of box that I was in.  I\nscarcely knew where I was hurt, or whether I was hurt or not, but turned\nright over on my face to crawl after my weapon.  Unless you have tried to\nget about with a smashed leg you don’t know what pain is, and I let out a\nhowl like a bullock’s.\n\nThis was the unluckiest noise that ever I made in my life.  Up to then\nUma had stuck to her tree like a sensible woman, knowing she would be\nonly in the way; but as soon as she heard me sing out, she ran forward.\nThe Winchester cracked again, and down she went.\n\nI had sat up, leg and all, to stop her; but when I saw her tumble I\nclapped down again where I was, lay still, and felt the handle of my\nknife.  I had been scurried and put out before.  No more of that for me.\nHe had knocked over my girl, I had got to fix him for it; and I lay there\nand gritted my teeth, and footed up the chances.  My leg was broke, my\ngun was gone.  Case had still ten shots in his Winchester.  It looked a\nkind of hopeless business.  But I never despaired nor thought upon\ndespairing: that man had got to go.\n\nFor a goodish bit not one of us let on.  Then I heard Case begin to move\nnearer in the bush, but mighty careful.  The image had burned out; there\nwere only a few coals left here and there, and the wood was main dark,\nbut had a kind of a low glow in it like a fire on its last legs.  It was\nby this that I made out Case’s head looking at me over a big tuft of\nferns, and at the same time the brute saw me and shouldered his\nWinchester.  I lay quite still, and as good as looked into the barrel: it\nwas my last chance, but I thought my heart would have come right out of\nits bearings.  Then he fired.  Lucky for me it was no shot-gun, for the\nbullet struck within an inch of me and knocked the dirt in my eyes.\n\nJust you try and see if you can lie quiet, and let a man take a sitting\nshot at you and miss you by a hair.  But I did, and lucky too.  A while\nCase stood with the Winchester at the port-arms; then he gave a little\nlaugh to himself, and stepped round the ferns.\n\n“Laugh!” thought I.  “If you had the wit of a louse you would be\npraying!”\n\nI was all as taut as a ship’s hawser or the spring of a watch, and as\nsoon as he came within reach of me I had him by the ankle, plucked the\nfeet right out from under him, laid him out, and was upon the top of him,\nbroken leg and all, before he breathed.  His Winchester had gone the same\nroad as my shot-gun; it was nothing to me—I defied him now.  I’m a pretty\nstrong man anyway, but I never knew what strength was till I got hold of\nCase.  He was knocked out of time by the rattle he came down with, and\nthrew up his hands together, more like a frightened woman, so that I\ncaught both of them with my left.  This wakened him up, and he fastened\nhis teeth in my forearm like a weasel.  Much I cared.  My leg gave me all\nthe pain I had any use for, and I drew my knife and got it in the place.\n\n“Now,” said I, “I’ve got you; and you’re gone up, and a good job too!  Do\nyou feel the point of that?  That’s for Underhill!  And there’s for\nAdams!  And now here’s for Uma, and that’s going to knock your blooming\nsoul right out of you!”\n\nWith that I gave him the cold steel for all I was worth.  His body kicked\nunder me like a spring sofa; he gave a dreadful kind of a long moan, and\nlay still.\n\n“I wonder if you’re dead?  I hope so!” I thought, for my head was\nswimming.  But I wasn’t going to take chances; I had his own example too\nclose before me for that; and I tried to draw the knife out to give it\nhim again.  The blood came over my hands, I remember, hot as tea; and\nwith that I fainted clean away, and fell with my head on the man’s mouth.\n\nWhen I came to myself it was pitch dark; the cinders had burned out;\nthere was nothing to be seen but the shine of the dead wood, and I\ncouldn’t remember where I was nor why I was in such pain nor what I was\nall wetted with.  Then it came back, and the first thing I attended to\nwas to give him the knife again a half-a-dozen times up to the handle.  I\nbelieve he was dead already, but it did him no harm and did me good.\n\n“I bet you’re dead now,” I said, and then I called to Uma.\n\nNothing answered, and I made a move to go and grope for her, fouled my\nbroken leg, and fainted again.\n\nWhen I came to myself the second time the clouds had all cleared away,\nexcept a few that sailed there, white as cotton.  The moon was up—a\ntropic moon.  The moon at home turns a wood black, but even this old\nbutt-end of a one showed up that forest, as green as by day.  The night\nbirds—or, rather, they’re a kind of early morning bird—sang out with\ntheir long, falling notes like nightingales.  And I could see the dead\nman, that I was still half resting on, looking right up into the sky with\nhis open eyes, no paler than when he was alive; and a little way off Uma\ntumbled on her side.  I got over to her the best way I was able, and when\nI got there she was broad awake, and crying and sobbing to herself with\nno more noise than an insect.  It appears she was afraid to cry out loud,\nbecause of the _aitus_.  Altogether she was not much hurt, but scared\nbeyond belief; she had come to her senses a long while ago, cried out to\nme, heard nothing in reply, made out we were both dead, and had lain\nthere ever since, afraid to budge a finger.  The ball had ploughed up her\nshoulder, and she had lost a main quantity of blood; but I soon had that\ntied up the way it ought to be with the tail of my shirt and a scarf I\nhad on, got her head on my sound knee and my back against a trunk, and\nsettled down to wait for morning.  Uma was for neither use nor ornament,\nand could only clutch hold of me and shake and cry.  I don’t suppose\nthere was ever anybody worse scared, and, to do her justice, she had had\na lively night of it.  As for me, I was in a good bit of pain and fever,\nbut not so bad when I sat still; and every time I looked over to Case I\ncould have sung and whistled.  Talk about meat and drink!  To see that\nman lying there dead as a herring filled me full.\n\nThe night birds stopped after a while; and then the light began to\nchange, the east came orange, the whole wood began to whirr with singing\nlike a musical box, and there was the broad day.\n\nI didn’t expect Maea for a long while yet; and, indeed, I thought there\nwas an off-chance he might go back on the whole idea and not come at all.\nI was the better pleased when, about an hour after daylight, I heard\nsticks smashing and a lot of Kanakas laughing, and singing out to keep\ntheir courage up.  Uma sat up quite brisk at the first word of it; and\npresently we saw a party come stringing out of the path, Maea in front,\nand behind him a white man in a pith helmet.  It was Mr. Tarleton, who\nhad turned up late last night in Falesá, having left his boat and walked\nthe last stage with a lantern.\n\nThey buried Case upon the field of glory, right in the hole where he had\nkept the smoking head.  I waited till the thing was done; and Mr.\nTarleton prayed, which I thought tomfoolery, but I’m bound to say he gave\na pretty sick view of the dear departed’s prospects, and seemed to have\nhis own ideas of hell.  I had it out with him afterwards, told him he had\nscamped his duty, and what he had ought to have done was to up like a man\nand tell the Kanakas plainly Case was damned, and a good riddance; but I\nnever could get him to see it my way.  Then they made me a litter of\npoles and carried me down to the station.  Mr. Tarleton set my leg, and\nmade a regular missionary splice of it, so that I limp to this day.  That\ndone, he took down my evidence, and Uma’s, and Maea’s, wrote it all out\nfine, and had us sign it; and then he got the chiefs and marched over to\nPapa Randall’s to seize Case’s papers.\n\nAll they found was a bit of a diary, kept for a good many years, and all\nabout the price of copra, and chickens being stolen, and that; and the\nbooks of the business and the will I told you of in the beginning, by\nboth of which the whole thing (stock, lock, and barrel) appeared to\nbelong to the Samoa woman.  It was I that bought her out at a mighty\nreasonable figure, for she was in a hurry to get home.  As for Randall\nand the black, they had to tramp; got into some kind of a station on the\nPapa-malulu side; did very bad business, for the truth is neither of the\npair was fit for it, and lived mostly on fish, which was the means of\nRandall’s death.  It seems there was a nice shoal in one day, and papa\nwent after them with the dynamite; either the match burned too fast, or\npapa was full, or both, but the shell went off (in the usual way) before\nhe threw it, and where was papa’s hand?  Well, there’s nothing to hurt in\nthat; the islands up north are all full of one-handed men, like the\nparties in the “Arabian Nights”; but either Randall was too old, or he\ndrank too much, and the short and the long of it was that he died.\nPretty soon after, the nigger was turned out of the island for stealing\nfrom white men, and went off to the west, where he found men of his own\ncolour, in case he liked that, and the men of his own colour took and ate\nhim at some kind of a corroborree, and I’m sure I hope he was to their\nfancy!\n\nSo there was I, left alone in my glory at Falesá; and when the schooner\ncame round I filled her up, and gave her a deck-cargo half as high as the\nhouse.  I must say Mr. Tarleton did the right thing by us; but he took a\nmeanish kind of a revenge.\n\n“Now, Mr. Wiltshire,” said he, “I’ve put you all square with everybody\nhere.  It wasn’t difficult to do, Case being gone; but I have done it,\nand given my pledge besides that you will deal fairly with the natives.\nI must ask you to keep my word.”\n\nWell, so I did.  I used to be bothered about my balances, but I reasoned\nit out this way: We all have queerish balances; and the natives all know\nit, and water their copra in a proportion so that it’s fair all round;\nbut the truth is, it did use to bother me, and, though I did well in\nFalesá, I was half glad when the firm moved me on to another station,\nwhere I was under no kind of a pledge and could look my balances in the\nface.\n\nAs for the old lady, you know her as well as I do.  She’s only the one\nfault.  If you don’t keep your eye lifting she would give away the roof\noff the station.  Well, it seems it’s natural in Kanakas.  She’s turned a\npowerful big woman now, and could throw a London bobby over her shoulder.\nBut that’s natural in Kanakas too, and there’s no manner of doubt that\nshe’s an A 1 wife.\n\nMr. Tarleton’s gone home, his trick being over.  He was the best\nmissionary I ever struck, and now, it seems, he’s parsonising down\nSomerset way.  Well, that’s best for him; he’ll have no Kanakas there to\nget luny over.\n\nMy public-house?  Not a bit of it, nor ever likely.  I’m stuck here, I\nfancy.  I don’t like to leave the kids, you see: and—there’s no use\ntalking—they’re better here than what they would be in a white man’s\ncountry, though Ben took the eldest up to Auckland, where he’s being\nschooled with the best.  But what bothers me is the girls.  They’re only\nhalf-castes, of course; I know that as well as you do, and there’s nobody\nthinks less of half-castes than I do; but they’re mine, and about all\nI’ve got.  I can’t reconcile my mind to their taking up with Kanakas, and\nI’d like to know where I’m to find the whites?\n\n\n\n\nTHE BOTTLE IMP.\n\n\nNote.—Any student of that very unliterary product, the English drama of\nthe early part of the century, will here recognise the name and the root\nidea of a piece once rendered popular by the redoubtable O. Smith.  The\nroot idea is there and identical, and yet I hope I have made it a new\nthing.  And the fact that the tale has been designed and written for a\nPolynesian audience may lend it some extraneous interest nearer home.—R.\nL. S.\n\nThere was a man of the Island of Hawaii, whom I shall call Keawe; for the\ntruth is, he still lives, and his name must be kept secret; but the place\nof his birth was not far from Honaunau, where the bones of Keawe the\nGreat lie hidden in a cave.  This man was poor, brave, and active; he\ncould read and write like a schoolmaster; he was a first-rate mariner\nbesides, sailed for some time in the island steamers, and steered a\nwhaleboat on the Hamakua coast.  At length it came in Keawe’s mind to\nhave a sight of the great world and foreign cities, and he shipped on a\nvessel bound to San Francisco.\n\nThis is a fine town, with a fine harbour, and rich people uncountable;\nand, in particular, there is one hill which is covered with palaces.\nUpon this hill Keawe was one day taking a walk with his pocket full of\nmoney, viewing the great houses upon either hand with pleasure, “What\nfine houses these are!” he was thinking, “and how happy must those people\nbe who dwell in them, and take no care for the morrow!”  The thought was\nin his mind when he came abreast of a house that was smaller than some\nothers, but all finished and beautified like a toy; the steps of that\nhouse shone like silver, and the borders of the garden bloomed like\ngarlands, and the windows were bright like diamond; and Keawe stopped and\nwondered at the excellence of all he saw.  So stopping, he was aware of a\nman that looked forth upon him through a window so clear that Keawe could\nsee him as you see a fish in a pool upon the reef.  The man was elderly,\nwith a bald head and a black beard; and his face was heavy with sorrow,\nand he bitterly sighed.  And the truth of it is, that as Keawe looked in\nupon the man, and the man looked out upon Keawe, each envied the other.\n\nAll of a sudden, the man smiled and nodded, and beckoned Keawe to enter,\nand met him at the door of the house.\n\n“This is a fine house of mine,” said the man, and bitterly sighed.\n“Would you not care to view the chambers?”\n\nSo he led Keawe all over it, from the cellar to the roof, and there was\nnothing there that was not perfect of its kind, and Keawe was astonished.\n\n“Truly,” said Keawe, “this is a beautiful house; if I lived in the like\nof it, I should be laughing all day long.  How comes it, then, that you\nshould be sighing?”\n\n“There is no reason,” said the man, “why you should not have a house in\nall points similar to this, and finer, if you wish.  You have some money,\nI suppose?”\n\n“I have fifty dollars,” said Keawe; “but a house like this will cost more\nthan fifty dollars.”\n\nThe man made a computation.  “I am sorry you have no more,” said he, “for\nit may raise you trouble in the future; but it shall be yours at fifty\ndollars.”\n\n“The house?” asked Keawe.\n\n“No, not the house,” replied the man; “but the bottle.  For, I must tell\nyou, although I appear to you so rich and fortunate, all my fortune, and\nthis house itself and its garden, came out of a bottle not much bigger\nthan a pint.  This is it.”\n\nAnd he opened a lockfast place, and took out a round-bellied bottle with\na long neck; the glass of it was white like milk, with changing rainbow\ncolours in the grain.  Withinsides something obscurely moved, like a\nshadow and a fire.\n\n“This is the bottle,” said the man; and, when Keawe laughed, “You do not\nbelieve me?” he added.  “Try, then, for yourself.  See if you can break\nit.”\n\nSo Keawe took the bottle up and dashed it on the floor till he was weary;\nbut it jumped on the floor like a child’s ball, and was not injured.\n\n“This is a strange thing,” said Keawe.  “For by the touch of it, as well\nas by the look, the bottle should be of glass.”\n\n“Of glass it is,” replied the man, sighing more heavily than ever; “but\nthe glass of it was tempered in the flames of hell.  An imp lives in it,\nand that is the shadow we behold there moving: or so I suppose.  If any\nman buy this bottle the imp is at his command; all that he desires—love,\nfame, money, houses like this house, ay, or a city like this city—all are\nhis at the word uttered.  Napoleon had this bottle, and by it he grew to\nbe the king of the world; but he sold it at the last, and fell.  Captain\nCook had this bottle, and by it he found his way to so many islands; but\nhe, too, sold it, and was slain upon Hawaii.  For, once it is sold, the\npower goes and the protection; and unless a man remain content with what\nhe has, ill will befall him.”\n\n“And yet you talk of selling it yourself?”  Keawe said.\n\n“I have all I wish, and I am growing elderly,” replied the man.  “There\nis one thing the imp cannot do—he cannot prolong life; and, it would not\nbe fair to conceal from you, there is a drawback to the bottle; for if a\nman die before he sells it, he must burn in hell forever.”\n\n“To be sure, that is a drawback and no mistake,” cried Keawe.  “I would\nnot meddle with the thing.  I can do without a house, thank God; but\nthere is one thing I could not be doing with one particle, and that is to\nbe damned.”\n\n“Dear me, you must not run away with things,” returned the man.  “All you\nhave to do is to use the power of the imp in moderation, and then sell it\nto someone else, as I do to you, and finish your life in comfort.”\n\n“Well, I observe two things,” said Keawe.  “All the time you keep sighing\nlike a maid in love, that is one; and, for the other, you sell this\nbottle very cheap.”\n\n“I have told you already why I sigh,” said the man.  “It is because I\nfear my health is breaking up; and, as you said yourself, to die and go\nto the devil is a pity for anyone.  As for why I sell so cheap, I must\nexplain to you there is a peculiarity about the bottle.  Long ago, when\nthe devil brought it first upon earth, it was extremely expensive, and\nwas sold first of all to Prester John for many millions of dollars; but\nit cannot be sold at all, unless sold at a loss.  If you sell it for as\nmuch as you paid for it, back it comes to you again like a homing pigeon.\nIt follows that the price has kept falling in these centuries, and the\nbottle is now remarkably cheap.  I bought it myself from one of my great\nneighbours on this hill, and the price I paid was only ninety dollars.  I\ncould sell it for as high as eighty-nine dollars and ninety-nine cents,\nbut not a penny dearer, or back the thing must come to me.  Now, about\nthis there are two bothers.  First, when you offer a bottle so singular\nfor eighty odd dollars, people suppose you to be jesting.  And second—but\nthere is no hurry about that—and I need not go into it.  Only remember it\nmust be coined money that you sell it for.”\n\n“How am I to know that this is all true?” asked Keawe.\n\n“Some of it you can try at once,” replied the man.  “Give me your fifty\ndollars, take the bottle, and wish your fifty dollars back into your\npocket.  If that does not happen, I pledge you my honour I will cry off\nthe bargain and restore your money.”\n\n“You are not deceiving me?” said Keawe.\n\nThe man bound himself with a great oath.\n\n“Well, I will risk that much,” said Keawe, “for that can do no harm.”\nAnd he paid over his money to the man, and the man handed him the bottle.\n\n“Imp of the bottle,” said Keawe, “I want my fifty dollars back.”  And\nsure enough he had scarce said the word before his pocket was as heavy as\never.\n\n“To be sure this is a wonderful bottle,” said Keawe.\n\n“And now good-morning to you, my fine fellow, and the devil go with you\nfor me!” said the man.\n\n“Hold on,” said Keawe, “I don’t want any more of this fun.  Here, take\nyour bottle back.”\n\n“You have bought it for less than I paid for it,” replied the man,\nrubbing his hands.  “It is yours now; and, for my part, I am only\nconcerned to see the back of you.”  And with that he rang for his Chinese\nservant, and had Keawe shown out of the house.\n\nNow, when Keawe was in the street, with the bottle under his arm, he\nbegan to think.  “If all is true about this bottle, I may have made a\nlosing bargain,” thinks he.  “But perhaps the man was only fooling me.”\nThe first thing he did was to count his money; the sum was\nexact—forty-nine dollars American money, and one Chili piece.  “That\nlooks like the truth,” said Keawe.  “Now I will try another part.”\n\nThe streets in that part of the city were as clean as a ship’s decks, and\nthough it was noon, there were no passengers.  Keawe set the bottle in\nthe gutter and walked away.  Twice he looked back, and there was the\nmilky, round-bellied bottle where he left it.  A third time he looked\nback, and turned a corner; but he had scarce done so, when something\nknocked upon his elbow, and behold! it was the long neck sticking up; and\nas for the round belly, it was jammed into the pocket of his pilot-coat.\n\n“And that looks like the truth,” said Keawe.\n\nThe next thing he did was to buy a cork-screw in a shop, and go apart\ninto a secret place in the fields.  And there he tried to draw the cork,\nbut as often as he put the screw in, out it came again, and the cork as\nwhole as ever.\n\n“This is some new sort of cork,” said Keawe, and all at once he began to\nshake and sweat, for he was afraid of that bottle.\n\nOn his way back to the port-side, he saw a shop where a man sold shells\nand clubs from the wild islands, old heathen deities, old coined money,\npictures from China and Japan, and all manner of things that sailors\nbring in their sea-chests.  And here he had an idea.  So he went in and\noffered the bottle for a hundred dollars.  The man of the shop laughed at\nhim at the first, and offered him five; but, indeed, it was a curious\nbottle—such glass was never blown in any human glassworks, so prettily\nthe colours shone under the milky white, and so strangely the shadow\nhovered in the midst; so, after he had disputed awhile after the manner\nof his kind, the shop-man gave Keawe sixty silver dollars for the thing,\nand set it on a shelf in the midst of his window.\n\n“Now,” said Keawe, “I have sold that for sixty which I bought for\nfifty—or, to say truth, a little less, because one of my dollars was from\nChili.  Now I shall know the truth upon another point.”\n\nSo he went back on board his ship, and, when he opened his chest, there\nwas the bottle, and had come more quickly than himself.  Now Keawe had a\nmate on board whose name was Lopaka.\n\n“What ails you?” said Lopaka, “that you stare in your chest?”\n\nThey were alone in the ship’s forecastle, and Keawe bound him to secrecy,\nand told all.\n\n“This is a very strange affair,” said Lopaka; “and I fear you will be in\ntrouble about this bottle.  But there is one point very clear—that you\nare sure of the trouble, and you had better have the profit in the\nbargain.  Make up your mind what you want with it; give the order, and if\nit is done as you desire, I will buy the bottle myself; for I have an\nidea of my own to get a schooner, and go trading through the islands.”\n\n“That is not my idea,” said Keawe; “but to have a beautiful house and\ngarden on the Kona Coast, where I was born, the sun shining in at the\ndoor, flowers in the garden, glass in the windows, pictures on the walls,\nand toys and fine carpets on the tables, for all the world like the house\nI was in this day—only a storey higher, and with balconies all about like\nthe King’s palace; and to live there without care and make merry with my\nfriends and relatives.”\n\n“Well,” said Lopaka, “let us carry it back with us to Hawaii; and if all\ncomes true, as you suppose, I will buy the bottle, as I said, and ask a\nschooner.”\n\nUpon that they were agreed, and it was not long before the ship returned\nto Honolulu, carrying Keawe and Lopaka, and the bottle.  They were scarce\ncome ashore when they met a friend upon the beach, who began at once to\ncondole with Keawe.\n\n“I do not know what I am to be condoled about,” said Keawe.\n\n“Is it possible you have not heard,” said the friend, “your uncle—that\ngood old man—is dead, and your cousin—that beautiful boy—was drowned at\nsea?”\n\nKeawe was filled with sorrow, and, beginning to weep and to lament, he\nforgot about the bottle.  But Lopaka was thinking to himself, and\npresently, when Keawe’s grief was a little abated, “I have been\nthinking,” said Lopaka.  “Had not your uncle lands in Hawaii, in the\ndistrict of Kau?”\n\n“No,” said Keawe, “not in Kau; they are on the mountain-side—a little way\nsouth of Hookena.”\n\n“These lands will now be yours?” asked Lopaka.\n\n“And so they will,” says Keawe, and began again to lament for his\nrelatives.\n\n“No,” said Lopaka, “do not lament at present.  I have a thought in my\nmind.  How if this should be the doing of the bottle?  For here is the\nplace ready for your house.”\n\n“If this be so,” cried Keawe, “it is a very ill way to serve me by\nkilling my relatives.  But it may be, indeed; for it was in just such a\nstation that I saw the house with my mind’s eye.”\n\n“The house, however, is not yet built,” said Lopaka.\n\n“No, nor like to be!” said Keawe; “for though my uncle has some coffee\nand ava and bananas, it will not be more than will keep me in comfort;\nand the rest of that land is the black lava.”\n\n“Let us go to the lawyer,” said Lopaka; “I have still this idea in my\nmind.”\n\nNow, when they came to the lawyer’s, it appeared Keawe’s uncle had grown\nmonstrous rich in the last days, and there was a fund of money.\n\n“And here is the money for the house!” cried Lopaka.\n\n“If you are thinking of a new house,” said the lawyer, “here is the card\nof a new architect, of whom they tell me great things.”\n\n“Better and better!” cried Lopaka.  “Here is all made plain for us.  Let\nus continue to obey orders.”\n\nSo they went to the architect, and he had drawings of houses on his\ntable.\n\n“You want something out of the way,” said the architect.  “How do you\nlike this?” and he handed a drawing to Keawe.\n\nNow, when Keawe set eyes on the drawing, he cried out aloud, for it was\nthe picture of his thought exactly drawn.\n\n“I am in for this house,” thought he.  “Little as I like the way it comes\nto me, I am in for it now, and I may as well take the good along with the\nevil.”\n\nSo he told the architect all that he wished, and how he would have that\nhouse furnished, and about the pictures on the wall and the knick-knacks\non the tables; and he asked the man plainly for how much he would\nundertake the whole affair.\n\nThe architect put many questions, and took his pen and made a\ncomputation; and when he had done he named the very sum that Keawe had\ninherited.\n\nLopaka and Keawe looked at one another and nodded.\n\n“It is quite clear,” thought Keawe, “that I am to have this house,\nwhether or no.  It comes from the devil, and I fear I will get little\ngood by that; and of one thing I am sure, I will make no more wishes as\nlong as I have this bottle.  But with the house I am saddled, and I may\nas well take the good along with the evil.”\n\nSo he made his terms with the architect, and they signed a paper; and\nKeawe and Lopaka took ship again and sailed to Australia; for it was\nconcluded between them they should not interfere at all, but leave the\narchitect and the bottle imp to build and to adorn that house at their\nown pleasure.\n\nThe voyage was a good voyage, only all the time Keawe was holding in his\nbreath, for he had sworn he would utter no more wishes, and take no more\nfavours from the devil.  The time was up when they got back.  The\narchitect told them that the house was ready, and Keawe and Lopaka took a\npassage in the _Hall_, and went down Kona way to view the house, and see\nif all had been done fitly according to the thought that was in Keawe’s\nmind.\n\nNow the house stood on the mountain side, visible to ships.  Above, the\nforest ran up into the clouds of rain; below, the black lava fell in\ncliffs, where the kings of old lay buried.  A garden bloomed about that\nhouse with every hue of flowers; and there was an orchard of papaia on\nthe one hand and an orchard of breadfruit on the other, and right in\nfront, toward the sea, a ship’s mast had been rigged up and bore a flag.\nAs for the house, it was three storeys high, with great chambers and\nbroad balconies on each.  The windows were of glass, so excellent that it\nwas as clear as water and as bright as day.  All manner of furniture\nadorned the chambers.  Pictures hung upon the wall in golden frames:\npictures of ships, and men fighting, and of the most beautiful women, and\nof singular places; nowhere in the world are there pictures of so bright\na colour as those Keawe found hanging in his house.  As for the\nknick-knacks, they were extraordinary fine; chiming clocks and musical\nboxes, little men with nodding heads, books filled with pictures, weapons\nof price from all quarters of the world, and the most elegant puzzles to\nentertain the leisure of a solitary man.  And as no one would care to\nlive in such chambers, only to walk through and view them, the balconies\nwere made so broad that a whole town might have lived upon them in\ndelight; and Keawe knew not which to prefer, whether the back porch,\nwhere you got the land breeze, and looked upon the orchards and the\nflowers, or the front balcony, where you could drink the wind of the sea,\nand look down the steep wall of the mountain and see the _Hall_ going by\nonce a week or so between Hookena and the hills of Pele, or the schooners\nplying up the coast for wood and ava and bananas.\n\nWhen they had viewed all, Keawe and Lopaka sat on the porch.\n\n“Well,” asked Lopaka, “is it all as you designed?”\n\n“Words cannot utter it,” said Keawe.  “It is better than I dreamed, and I\nam sick with satisfaction.”\n\n“There is but one thing to consider,” said Lopaka; “all this may be quite\nnatural, and the bottle imp have nothing whatever to say to it.  If I\nwere to buy the bottle, and got no schooner after all, I should have put\nmy hand in the fire for nothing.  I gave you my word, I know; but yet I\nthink you would not grudge me one more proof.”\n\n“I have sworn I would take no more favours,” said Keawe.  “I have gone\nalready deep enough.”\n\n“This is no favour I am thinking of,” replied Lopaka.  “It is only to see\nthe imp himself.  There is nothing to be gained by that, and so nothing\nto be ashamed of; and yet, if I once saw him, I should be sure of the\nwhole matter.  So indulge me so far, and let me see the imp; and, after\nthat, here is the money in my hand, and I will buy it.”\n\n“There is only one thing I am afraid of,” said Keawe.  “The imp may be\nvery ugly to view; and if you once set eyes upon him you might be very\nundesirous of the bottle.”\n\n“I am a man of my word,” said Lopaka.  “And here is the money betwixt\nus.”\n\n“Very well,” replied Keawe.  “I have a curiosity myself.  So come, let us\nhave one look at you, Mr. Imp.”\n\nNow as soon as that was said, the imp looked out of the bottle, and in\nagain, swift as a lizard; and there sat Keawe and Lopaka turned to stone.\nThe night had quite come, before either found a thought to say or voice\nto say it with; and then Lopaka pushed the money over and took the\nbottle.\n\n“I am a man of my word,” said he, “and had need to be so, or I would not\ntouch this bottle with my foot.  Well, I shall get my schooner and a\ndollar or two for my pocket; and then I will be rid of this devil as fast\nas I can.  For to tell you the plain truth, the look of him has cast me\ndown.”\n\n“Lopaka,” said Keawe, “do not you think any worse of me than you can\nhelp; I know it is night, and the roads bad, and the pass by the tombs an\nill place to go by so late, but I declare since I have seen that little\nface, I cannot eat or sleep or pray till it is gone from me.  I will give\nyou a lantern and a basket to put the bottle in, and any picture or fine\nthing in all my house that takes your fancy;—and be gone at once, and go\nsleep at Hookena with Nahinu.”\n\n“Keawe,” said Lopaka, “many a man would take this ill; above all, when I\nam doing you a turn so friendly, as to keep my word and buy the bottle;\nand for that matter, the night and the dark, and the way by the tombs,\nmust be all tenfold more dangerous to a man with such a sin upon his\nconscience, and such a bottle under his arm.  But for my part, I am so\nextremely terrified myself, I have not the heart to blame you.  Here I go\nthen; and I pray God you may be happy in your house, and I fortunate with\nmy schooner, and both get to heaven in the end in spite of the devil and\nhis bottle.”\n\nSo Lopaka went down the mountain; and Keawe stood in his front balcony,\nand listened to the clink of the horse’s shoes, and watched the lantern\ngo shining down the path, and along the cliff of caves where the old dead\nare buried; and all the time he trembled and clasped his hands, and\nprayed for his friend, and gave glory to God that he himself was escaped\nout of that trouble.\n\nBut the next day came very brightly, and that new house of his was so\ndelightful to behold that he forgot his terrors.  One day followed\nanother, and Keawe dwelt there in perpetual joy.  He had his place on the\nback porch; it was there he ate and lived, and read the stories in the\nHonolulu newspapers; but when anyone came by they would go in and view\nthe chambers and the pictures.  And the fame of the house went far and\nwide; it was called _Ka-Hale Nui_—the Great House—in all Kona; and\nsometimes the Bright House, for Keawe kept a Chinaman, who was all day\ndusting and furbishing; and the glass, and the gilt, and the fine stuffs,\nand the pictures, shone as bright as the morning.  As for Keawe himself,\nhe could not walk in the chambers without singing, his heart was so\nenlarged; and when ships sailed by upon the sea, he would fly his colours\non the mast.\n\nSo time went by, until one day Keawe went upon a visit as far as Kailua\nto certain of his friends.  There he was well feasted; and left as soon\nas he could the next morning, and rode hard, for he was impatient to\nbehold his beautiful house; and, besides, the night then coming on was\nthe night in which the dead of old days go abroad in the sides of Kona;\nand having already meddled with the devil, he was the more chary of\nmeeting with the dead.  A little beyond Honaunau, looking far ahead, he\nwas aware of a woman bathing in the edge of the sea; and she seemed a\nwell-grown girl, but he thought no more of it.  Then he saw her white\nshift flutter as she put it on, and then her red holoku; and by the time\nhe came abreast of her she was done with her toilet, and had come up from\nthe sea, and stood by the track-side in her red holoku, and she was all\nfreshened with the bath, and her eyes shone and were kind.  Now Keawe no\nsooner beheld her than he drew rein.\n\n“I thought I knew everyone in this country,” said he.  “How comes it that\nI do not know you?”\n\n“I am Kokua, daughter of Kiano,” said the girl, “and I have just returned\nfrom Oahu.  Who are you?”\n\n“I will tell you who I am in a little,” said Keawe, dismounting from his\nhorse, “but not now.  For I have a thought in my mind, and if you knew\nwho I was, you might have heard of me, and would not give me a true\nanswer.  But tell me, first of all, one thing: Are you married?”\n\nAt this Kokua laughed out aloud.  “It is you who ask questions,” she\nsaid.  “Are you married yourself?”\n\n“Indeed, Kokua, I am not,” replied Keawe, “and never thought to be until\nthis hour.  But here is the plain truth.  I have met you here at the\nroadside, and I saw your eyes, which are like the stars, and my heart\nwent to you as swift as a bird.  And so now, if you want none of me, say\nso, and I will go on to my own place; but if you think me no worse than\nany other young man, say so, too, and I will turn aside to your father’s\nfor the night, and to-morrow I will talk with the good man.”\n\nKokua said never a word, but she looked at the sea and laughed.\n\n“Kokua,” said Keawe, “if you say nothing, I will take that for the good\nanswer; so let us be stepping to your father’s door.”\n\nShe went on ahead of him, still without speech; only sometimes she\nglanced back and glanced away again, and she kept the strings of her hat\nin her mouth.\n\nNow, when they had come to the door, Kiano came out on his verandah, and\ncried out and welcomed Keawe by name.  At that the girl looked over, for\nthe fame of the great house had come to her ears; and, to be sure, it was\na great temptation.  All that evening they were very merry together; and\nthe girl was as bold as brass under the eyes of her parents, and made a\nmock of Keawe, for she had a quick wit.  The next day he had a word with\nKiano, and found the girl alone.\n\n“Kokua,” said he, “you made a mock of me all the evening; and it is still\ntime to bid me go.  I would not tell you who I was, because I have so\nfine a house, and I feared you would think too much of that house and too\nlittle of the man that loves you.  Now you know all, and if you wish to\nhave seen the last of me, say so at once.”\n\n“No,” said Kokua; but this time she did not laugh, nor did Keawe ask for\nmore.\n\nThis was the wooing of Keawe; things had gone quickly; but so an arrow\ngoes, and the ball of a rifle swifter still, and yet both may strike the\ntarget.  Things had gone fast, but they had gone far also, and the\nthought of Keawe rang in the maiden’s head; she heard his voice in the\nbreach of the surf upon the lava, and for this young man that she had\nseen but twice she would have left father and mother and her native\nislands.  As for Keawe himself, his horse flew up the path of the\nmountain under the cliff of tombs, and the sound of the hoofs, and the\nsound of Keawe singing to himself for pleasure, echoed in the caverns of\nthe dead.  He came to the Bright House, and still he was singing.  He sat\nand ate in the broad balcony, and the Chinaman wondered at his master, to\nhear how he sang between the mouthfuls.  The sun went down into the sea,\nand the night came; and Keawe walked the balconies by lamplight, high on\nthe mountains, and the voice of his singing startled men on ships.\n\n“Here am I now upon my high place,” he said to himself.  “Life may be no\nbetter; this is the mountain top; and all shelves about me toward the\nworse.  For the first time I will light up the chambers, and bathe in my\nfine bath with the hot water and the cold, and sleep alone in the bed of\nmy bridal chamber.”\n\nSo the Chinaman had word, and he must rise from sleep and light the\nfurnaces; and as he wrought below, beside the boilers, he heard his\nmaster singing and rejoicing above him in the lighted chambers.  When the\nwater began to be hot the Chinaman cried to his master; and Keawe went\ninto the bathroom; and the Chinaman heard him sing as he filled the\nmarble basin; and heard him sing, and the singing broken, as he\nundressed; until of a sudden, the song ceased.  The Chinaman listened,\nand listened; he called up the house to Keawe to ask if all were well,\nand Keawe answered him “Yes,” and bade him go to bed; but there was no\nmore singing in the Bright House; and all night long, the Chinaman heard\nhis master’s feet go round and round the balconies without repose.\n\nNow the truth of it was this: as Keawe undressed for his bath, he spied\nupon his flesh a patch like a patch of lichen on a rock, and it was then\nthat he stopped singing.  For he knew the likeness of that patch, and\nknew that he was fallen in the Chinese Evil. {5}\n\nNow, it is a sad thing for any man to fall into this sickness.  And it\nwould be a sad thing for anyone to leave a house so beautiful and so\ncommodious, and depart from all his friends to the north coast of Molokai\nbetween the mighty cliff and the sea-breakers.  But what was that to the\ncase of the man Keawe, he who had met his love but yesterday, and won her\nbut that morning, and now saw all his hopes break, in a moment, like a\npiece of glass?\n\nAwhile he sat upon the edge of the bath; then sprang, with a cry, and ran\noutside; and to and fro, to and fro, along the balcony, like one\ndespairing.\n\n“Very willingly could I leave Hawaii, the home of my fathers,” Keawe was\nthinking.  “Very lightly could I leave my house, the high-placed, the\nmany-windowed, here upon the mountains.  Very bravely could I go to\nMolokai, to Kalaupapa by the cliffs, to live with the smitten and to\nsleep there, far from my fathers.  But what wrong have I done, what sin\nlies upon my soul, that I should have encountered Kokua coming cool from\nthe sea-water in the evening?  Kokua, the soul ensnarer!  Kokua, the\nlight of my life!  Her may I never wed, her may I look upon no longer,\nher may I no more handle with my loving hand; and it is for this, it is\nfor you, O Kokua! that I pour my lamentations!”\n\nNow you are to observe what sort of a man Keawe was, for he might have\ndwelt there in the Bright House for years, and no one been the wiser of\nhis sickness; but he reckoned nothing of that, if he must lose Kokua.\nAnd again, he might have wed Kokua even as he was; and so many would have\ndone, because they have the souls of pigs; but Keawe loved the maid\nmanfully, and he would do her no hurt and bring her in no danger.\n\nA little beyond the midst of the night, there came in his mind the\nrecollection of that bottle.  He went round to the back porch, and called\nto memory the day when the devil had looked forth; and at the thought ice\nran in his veins.\n\n“A dreadful thing is the bottle,” thought Keawe, “and dreadful is the\nimp, and it is a dreadful thing to risk the flames of hell.  But what\nother hope have I to cure my sickness or to wed Kokua?  What!” he\nthought, “would I beard the devil once, only to get me a house, and not\nface him again to win Kokua?”\n\nThereupon he called to mind it was the next day the _Hall_ went by on her\nreturn to Honolulu.  “There must I go first,” he thought, “and see\nLopaka.  For the best hope that I have now is to find that same bottle I\nwas so pleased to be rid of.”\n\nNever a wink could he sleep; the food stuck in his throat; but he sent a\nletter to Kiano, and about the time when the steamer would be coming,\nrode down beside the cliff of the tombs.  It rained; his horse went\nheavily; he looked up at the black mouths of the caves, and he envied the\ndead that slept there and were done with trouble; and called to mind how\nhe had galloped by the day before, and was astonished.  So he came down\nto Hookena, and there was all the country gathered for the steamer as\nusual.  In the shed before the store they sat and jested and passed the\nnews; but there was no matter of speech in Keawe’s bosom, and he sat in\ntheir midst and looked without on the rain falling on the houses, and the\nsurf beating among the rocks, and the sighs arose in his throat.\n\n“Keawe of the Bright House is out of spirits,” said one to another.\nIndeed, and so he was, and little wonder.\n\nThen the _Hall_ came, and the whaleboat carried him on board.  The\nafter-part of the ship was full of Haoles {6} who had been to visit the\nvolcano, as their custom is; and the midst was crowded with Kanakas, and\nthe forepart with wild bulls from Hilo and horses from Kau; but Keawe sat\napart from all in his sorrow, and watched for the house of Kiano.  There\nit sat, low upon the shore in the black rocks, and shaded by the cocoa\npalms, and there by the door was a red holoku, no greater than a fly, and\ngoing to and fro with a fly’s busyness.  “Ah, queen of my heart,” he\ncried, “I’ll venture my dear soul to win you!”\n\nSoon after, darkness fell, and the cabins were lit up, and the Haoles sat\nand played at the cards and drank whiskey as their custom is; but Keawe\nwalked the deck all night; and all the next day, as they steamed under\nthe lee of Maui or of Molokai, he was still pacing to and fro like a wild\nanimal in a menagerie.\n\nTowards evening they passed Diamond Head, and came to the pier of\nHonolulu.  Keawe stepped out among the crowd and began to ask for Lopaka.\nIt seemed he had become the owner of a schooner—none better in the\nislands—and was gone upon an adventure as far as Pola-Pola or Kahiki; so\nthere was no help to be looked for from Lopaka.  Keawe called to mind a\nfriend of his, a lawyer in the town (I must not tell his name), and\ninquired of him.  They said he was grown suddenly rich, and had a fine\nnew house upon Waikiki shore; and this put a thought in Keawe’s head, and\nhe called a hack and drove to the lawyer’s house.\n\nThe house was all brand new, and the trees in the garden no greater than\nwalking-sticks, and the lawyer, when he came, had the air of a man well\npleased.\n\n“What can I do to serve you?” said the lawyer.\n\n“You are a friend of Lopaka’s,” replied Keawe, “and Lopaka purchased from\nme a certain piece of goods that I thought you might enable me to trace.”\n\nThe lawyer’s face became very dark.  “I do not profess to misunderstand\nyou, Mr. Keawe,” said he, “though this is an ugly business to be stirring\nin.  You may be sure I know nothing, but yet I have a guess, and if you\nwould apply in a certain quarter I think you might have news.”\n\nAnd he named the name of a man, which, again, I had better not repeat.\nSo it was for days, and Keawe went from one to another, finding\neverywhere new clothes and carriages, and fine new houses and men\neverywhere in great contentment, although, to be sure, when he hinted at\nhis business their faces would cloud over.\n\n“No doubt I am upon the track,” thought Keawe.  “These new clothes and\ncarriages are all the gifts of the little imp, and these glad faces are\nthe faces of men who have taken their profit and got rid of the accursed\nthing in safety.  When I see pale cheeks and hear sighing, I shall know\nthat I am near the bottle.”\n\nSo it befell at last that he was recommended to a Haole in Beritania\nStreet.  When he came to the door, about the hour of the evening meal,\nthere were the usual marks of the new house, and the young garden, and\nthe electric light shining in the windows; but when the owner came, a\nshock of hope and fear ran through Keawe; for here was a young man, white\nas a corpse, and black about the eyes, the hair shedding from his head,\nand such a look in his countenance as a man may have when he is waiting\nfor the gallows.\n\n“Here it is, to be sure,” thought Keawe, and so with this man he noways\nveiled his errand.  “I am come to buy the bottle,” said he.\n\nAt the word, the young Haole of Beritania Street reeled against the wall.\n\n“The bottle!” he gasped.  “To buy the bottle!”  Then he seemed to choke,\nand seizing Keawe by the arm carried him into a room and poured out wine\nin two glasses.\n\n“Here is my respects,” said Keawe, who had been much about with Haoles in\nhis time.  “Yes,” he added, “I am come to buy the bottle.  What is the\nprice by now?”\n\nAt that word the young man let his glass slip through his fingers, and\nlooked upon Keawe like a ghost.\n\n“The price,” says he; “the price!  You do not know the price?”\n\n“It is for that I am asking you,” returned Keawe.  “But why are you so\nmuch concerned?  Is there anything wrong about the price?”\n\n“It has dropped a great deal in value since your time, Mr. Keawe,” said\nthe young man stammering.\n\n“Well, well, I shall have the less to pay for it,” says Keawe.  “How much\ndid it cost you?”\n\nThe young man was as white as a sheet.  “Two cents,” said he.\n\n“What?” cried Keawe, “two cents?  Why, then, you can only sell it for\none.  And he who buys it—”  The words died upon Keawe’s tongue; he who\nbought it could never sell it again, the bottle and the bottle imp must\nabide with him until he died, and when he died must carry him to the red\nend of hell.\n\nThe young man of Beritania Street fell upon his knees.  “For God’s sake\nbuy it!” he cried.  “You can have all my fortune in the bargain.  I was\nmad when I bought it at that price.  I had embezzled money at my store; I\nwas lost else; I must have gone to jail.”\n\n“Poor creature,” said Keawe, “you would risk your soul upon so desperate\nan adventure, and to avoid the proper punishment of your own disgrace;\nand you think I could hesitate with love in front of me.  Give me the\nbottle, and the change which I make sure you have all ready.  Here is a\nfive-cent piece.”\n\nIt was as Keawe supposed; the young man had the change ready in a drawer;\nthe bottle changed hands, and Keawe’s fingers were no sooner clasped upon\nthe stalk than he had breathed his wish to be a clean man.  And, sure\nenough, when he got home to his room, and stripped himself before a\nglass, his flesh was whole like an infant’s.  And here was the strange\nthing: he had no sooner seen this miracle, than his mind was changed\nwithin him, and he cared naught for the Chinese Evil, and little enough\nfor Kokua; and had but the one thought, that here he was bound to the\nbottle imp for time and for eternity, and had no better hope but to be a\ncinder for ever in the flames of hell.  Away ahead of him he saw them\nblaze with his mind’s eye, and his soul shrank, and darkness fell upon\nthe light.\n\nWhen Keawe came to himself a little, he was aware it was the night when\nthe band played at the hotel.  Thither he went, because he feared to be\nalone; and there, among happy faces, walked to and fro, and heard the\ntunes go up and down, and saw Berger beat the measure, and all the while\nhe heard the flames crackle, and saw the red fire burning in the\nbottomless pit.  Of a sudden the band played _Hiki-ao-ao_; that was a\nsong that he had sung with Kokua, and at the strain courage returned to\nhim.\n\n“It is done now,” he thought, “and once more let me take the good along\nwith the evil.”\n\nSo it befell that he returned to Hawaii by the first steamer, and as soon\nas it could be managed he was wedded to Kokua, and carried her up the\nmountain side to the Bright House.\n\nNow it was so with these two, that when they were together, Keawe’s heart\nwas stilled; but so soon as he was alone he fell into a brooding horror,\nand heard the flames crackle, and saw the red fire burn in the bottomless\npit.  The girl, indeed, had come to him wholly; her heart leapt in her\nside at sight of him, her hand clung to his; and she was so fashioned\nfrom the hair upon her head to the nails upon her toes that none could\nsee her without joy.  She was pleasant in her nature.  She had the good\nword always.  Full of song she was, and went to and fro in the Bright\nHouse, the brightest thing in its three storeys, carolling like the\nbirds.  And Keawe beheld and heard her with delight, and then must shrink\nupon one side, and weep and groan to think upon the price that he had\npaid for her; and then he must dry his eyes, and wash his face, and go\nand sit with her on the broad balconies, joining in her songs, and, with\na sick spirit, answering her smiles.\n\nThere came a day when her feet began to be heavy and her songs more rare;\nand now it was not Keawe only that would weep apart, but each would\nsunder from the other and sit in opposite balconies with the whole width\nof the Bright House betwixt.  Keawe was so sunk in his despair, he scarce\nobserved the change, and was only glad he had more hours to sit alone and\nbrood upon his destiny, and was not so frequently condemned to pull a\nsmiling face on a sick heart.  But one day, coming softly through the\nhouse, he heard the sound of a child sobbing, and there was Kokua rolling\nher face upon the balcony floor, and weeping like the lost.\n\n“You do well to weep in this house, Kokua,” he said.  “And yet I would\ngive the head off my body that you (at least) might have been happy.”\n\n“Happy!” she cried.  “Keawe, when you lived alone in your Bright House,\nyou were the word of the island for a happy man; laughter and song were\nin your mouth, and your face was as bright as the sunrise.  Then you\nwedded poor Kokua; and the good God knows what is amiss in her—but from\nthat day you have not smiled.  Oh!” she cried, “what ails me?  I thought\nI was pretty, and I knew I loved him.  What ails me that I throw this\ncloud upon my husband?”\n\n“Poor Kokua,” said Keawe.  He sat down by her side, and sought to take\nher hand; but that she plucked away.  “Poor Kokua,” he said, again.  “My\npoor child—my pretty.  And I had thought all this while to spare you!\nWell, you shall know all.  Then, at least, you will pity poor Keawe; then\nyou will understand how much he loved you in the past—that he dared hell\nfor your possession—and how much he loves you still (the poor condemned\none), that he can yet call up a smile when he beholds you.”\n\nWith that, he told her all, even from the beginning.\n\n“You have done this for me?” she cried “Ah, well, then what do I\ncare!”—and she clasped and wept upon him.\n\n“Ah, child!” said Keawe, “and yet, when I consider of the fire of hell, I\ncare a good deal!”\n\n“Never tell me,” said she; “no man can be lost because he loved Kokua,\nand no other fault.  I tell you, Keawe, I shall save you with these\nhands, or perish in your company.  What! you loved me, and gave your\nsoul, and you think I will not die to save you in return?”\n\n“Ah, my dear! you might die a hundred times, and what difference would\nthat make?” he cried, “except to leave me lonely till the time comes of\nmy damnation?”\n\n“You know nothing,” said she.  “I was educated in a school in Honolulu; I\nam no common girl.  And I tell you, I shall save my lover.  What is this\nyou say about a cent?  But all the world is not American.  In England\nthey have a piece they call a farthing, which is about half a cent.  Ah!\nsorrow!” she cried, “that makes it scarcely better, for the buyer must be\nlost, and we shall find none so brave as my Keawe!  But, then, there is\nFrance; they have a small coin there which they call a centime, and these\ngo five to the cent or there-about.  We could not do better.  Come,\nKeawe, let us go to the French islands; let us go to Tahiti, as fast as\nships can bear us.  There we have four centimes, three centimes, two\ncentimes, one centime; four possible sales to come and go on; and two of\nus to push the bargain.  Come, my Keawe! kiss me, and banish care.  Kokua\nwill defend you.”\n\n“Gift of God!” he cried.  “I cannot think that God will punish me for\ndesiring aught so good!  Be it as you will, then; take me where you\nplease: I put my life and my salvation in your hands.”\n\nEarly the next day Kokua was about her preparations.  She took Keawe’s\nchest that he went with sailoring; and first she put the bottle in a\ncorner; and then packed it with the richest of their clothes and the\nbravest of the knick-knacks in the house.  “For,” said she, “we must seem\nto be rich folks, or who will believe in the bottle?”  All the time of\nher preparation she was as gay as a bird; only when she looked upon\nKeawe, the tears would spring in her eye, and she must run and kiss him.\nAs for Keawe, a weight was off his soul; now that he had his secret\nshared, and some hope in front of him, he seemed like a new man, his feet\nwent lightly on the earth, and his breath was good to him again.  Yet was\nterror still at his elbow; and ever and again, as the wind blows out a\ntaper, hope died in him, and he saw the flames toss and the red fire burn\nin hell.\n\nIt was given out in the country they were gone pleasuring to the States,\nwhich was thought a strange thing, and yet not so strange as the truth,\nif any could have guessed it.  So they went to Honolulu in the _Hall_,\nand thence in the _Umatilla_ to San Francisco with a crowd of Haoles, and\nat San Francisco took their passage by the mail brigantine, the _Tropic\nBird_, for Papeete, the chief place of the French in the south islands.\nThither they came, after a pleasant voyage, on a fair day of the Trade\nWind, and saw the reef with the surf breaking, and Motuiti with its\npalms, and the schooner riding within-side, and the white houses of the\ntown low down along the shore among green trees, and overhead the\nmountains and the clouds of Tahiti, the wise island.\n\nIt was judged the most wise to hire a house, which they did accordingly,\nopposite the British Consul’s, to make a great parade of money, and\nthemselves conspicuous with carriages and horses.  This it was very easy\nto do, so long as they had the bottle in their possession; for Kokua was\nmore bold than Keawe, and, whenever she had a mind, called on the imp for\ntwenty or a hundred dollars.  At this rate they soon grew to be remarked\nin the town; and the strangers from Hawaii, their riding and their\ndriving, the fine holokus and the rich lace of Kokua, became the matter\nof much talk.\n\nThey got on well after the first with the Tahitian language, which is\nindeed like to the Hawaiian, with a change of certain letters; and as\nsoon as they had any freedom of speech, began to push the bottle.  You\nare to consider it was not an easy subject to introduce; it was not easy\nto persuade people you were in earnest, when you offered to sell them for\nfour centimes the spring of health and riches inexhaustible.  It was\nnecessary besides to explain the dangers of the bottle; and either people\ndisbelieved the whole thing and laughed, or they thought the more of the\ndarker part, became overcast with gravity, and drew away from Keawe and\nKokua, as from persons who had dealings with the devil.  So far from\ngaining ground, these two began to find they were avoided in the town;\nthe children ran away from them screaming, a thing intolerable to Kokua;\nCatholics crossed themselves as they went by; and all persons began with\none accord to disengage themselves from their advances.\n\nDepression fell upon their spirits.  They would sit at night in their new\nhouse, after a day’s weariness, and not exchange one word, or the silence\nwould be broken by Kokua bursting suddenly into sobs.  Sometimes they\nwould pray together; sometimes they would have the bottle out upon the\nfloor, and sit all evening watching how the shadow hovered in the midst.\nAt such times they would be afraid to go to rest.  It was long ere\nslumber came to them, and, if either dozed off, it would be to wake and\nfind the other silently weeping in the dark, or, perhaps, to wake alone,\nthe other having fled from the house and the neighbourhood of that\nbottle, to pace under the bananas in the little garden, or to wander on\nthe beach by moonlight.\n\nOne night it was so when Kokua awoke.  Keawe was gone.  She felt in the\nbed and his place was cold.  Then fear fell upon her, and she sat up in\nbed.  A little moonshine filtered through the shutters.  The room was\nbright, and she could spy the bottle on the floor.  Outside it blew high,\nthe great trees of the avenue cried aloud, and the fallen leaves rattled\nin the verandah.  In the midst of this Kokua was aware of another sound;\nwhether of a beast or of a man she could scarce tell, but it was as sad\nas death, and cut her to the soul.  Softly she arose, set the door ajar,\nand looked forth into the moonlit yard.  There, under the bananas, lay\nKeawe, his mouth in the dust, and as he lay he moaned.\n\nIt was Kokua’s first thought to run forward and console him; her second\npotently withheld her.  Keawe had borne himself before his wife like a\nbrave man; it became her little in the hour of weakness to intrude upon\nhis shame.  With the thought she drew back into the house.\n\n“Heaven!” she thought, “how careless have I been—how weak!  It is he, not\nI, that stands in this eternal peril; it was he, not I, that took the\ncurse upon his soul.  It is for my sake, and for the love of a creature\nof so little worth and such poor help, that he now beholds so close to\nhim the flames of hell—ay, and smells the smoke of it, lying without\nthere in the wind and moonlight.  Am I so dull of spirit that never till\nnow I have surmised my duty, or have I seen it before and turned aside?\nBut now, at least, I take up my soul in both the hands of my affection;\nnow I say farewell to the white steps of heaven and the waiting faces of\nmy friends.  A love for a love, and let mine be equalled with Keawe’s!  A\nsoul for a soul, and be it mine to perish!”\n\nShe was a deft woman with her hands, and was soon apparelled.  She took\nin her hands the change—the precious centimes they kept ever at their\nside; for this coin is little used, and they had made provision at a\nGovernment office.  When she was forth in the avenue clouds came on the\nwind, and the moon was blackened.  The town slept, and she knew not\nwhither to turn till she heard one coughing in the shadow of the trees.\n\n“Old man,” said Kokua, “what do you here abroad in the cold night?”\n\nThe old man could scarce express himself for coughing, but she made out\nthat he was old and poor, and a stranger in the island.\n\n“Will you do me a service?” said Kokua.  “As one stranger to another, and\nas an old man to a young woman, will you help a daughter of Hawaii?”\n\n“Ah,” said the old man.  “So you are the witch from the eight islands,\nand even my old soul you seek to entangle.  But I have heard of you, and\ndefy your wickedness.”\n\n“Sit down here,” said Kokua, “and let me tell you a tale.”  And she told\nhim the story of Keawe from the beginning to the end.\n\n“And now,” said she, “I am his wife, whom he bought with his soul’s\nwelfare.  And what should I do?  If I went to him myself and offered to\nbuy it, he would refuse.  But if you go, he will sell it eagerly; I will\nawait you here; you will buy it for four centimes, and I will buy it\nagain for three.  And the Lord strengthen a poor girl!”\n\n“If you meant falsely,” said the old man, “I think God would strike you\ndead.”\n\n“He would!” cried Kokua.  “Be sure he would.  I could not be so\ntreacherous—God would not suffer it.”\n\n“Give me the four centimes and await me here,” said the old man.\n\nNow, when Kokua stood alone in the street, her spirit died.  The wind\nroared in the trees, and it seemed to her the rushing of the flames of\nhell; the shadows tossed in the light of the street lamp, and they seemed\nto her the snatching hands of evil ones.  If she had had the strength,\nshe must have run away, and if she had had the breath she must have\nscreamed aloud; but, in truth, she could do neither, and stood and\ntrembled in the avenue, like an affrighted child.\n\nThen she saw the old man returning, and he had the bottle in his hand.\n\n“I have done your bidding,” said he.  “I left your husband weeping like a\nchild; to-night he will sleep easy.”  And he held the bottle forth.\n\n“Before you give it me,” Kokua panted, “take the good with the evil—ask\nto be delivered from your cough.”\n\n“I am an old man,” replied the other, “and too near the gate of the grave\nto take a favour from the devil.  But what is this?  Why do you not take\nthe bottle?  Do you hesitate?”\n\n“Not hesitate!” cried Kokua.  “I am only weak.  Give me a moment.  It is\nmy hand resists, my flesh shrinks back from the accursed thing.  One\nmoment only!”\n\nThe old man looked upon Kokua kindly.  “Poor child!” said he, “you fear;\nyour soul misgives you.  Well, let me keep it.  I am old, and can never\nmore be happy in this world, and as for the next—”\n\n“Give it me!” gasped Kokua.  “There is your money.  Do you think I am so\nbase as that?  Give me the bottle.”\n\n“God bless you, child,” said the old man.\n\nKokua concealed the bottle under her holoku, said farewell to the old\nman, and walked off along the avenue, she cared not whither.  For all\nroads were now the same to her, and led equally to hell.  Sometimes she\nwalked, and sometimes ran; sometimes she screamed out loud in the night,\nand sometimes lay by the wayside in the dust and wept.  All that she had\nheard of hell came back to her; she saw the flames blaze, and she smelt\nthe smoke, and her flesh withered on the coals.\n\nNear day she came to her mind again, and returned to the house.  It was\neven as the old man said—Keawe slumbered like a child.  Kokua stood and\ngazed upon his face.\n\n“Now, my husband,” said she, “it is your turn to sleep.  When you wake it\nwill be your turn to sing and laugh.  But for poor Kokua, alas! that\nmeant no evil—for poor Kokua no more sleep, no more singing, no more\ndelight, whether in earth or heaven.”\n\nWith that she lay down in the bed by his side, and her misery was so\nextreme that she fell in a deep slumber instantly.\n\nLate in the morning her husband woke her and gave her the good news.  It\nseemed he was silly with delight, for he paid no heed to her distress,\nill though she dissembled it.  The words stuck in her mouth, it mattered\nnot; Keawe did the speaking.  She ate not a bite, but who was to observe\nit? for Keawe cleared the dish.  Kokua saw and heard him, like some\nstrange thing in a dream; there were times when she forgot or doubted,\nand put her hands to her brow; to know herself doomed and hear her\nhusband babble, seemed so monstrous.\n\nAll the while Keawe was eating and talking, and planning the time of\ntheir return, and thanking her for saving him, and fondling her, and\ncalling her the true helper after all.  He laughed at the old man that\nwas fool enough to buy that bottle.\n\n“A worthy old man he seemed,” Keawe said.  “But no one can judge by\nappearances.  For why did the old reprobate require the bottle?”\n\n“My husband,” said Kokua, humbly, “his purpose may have been good.”\n\nKeawe laughed like an angry man.\n\n“Fiddle-de-dee!” cried Keawe.  “An old rogue, I tell you; and an old ass\nto boot.  For the bottle was hard enough to sell at four centimes; and at\nthree it will be quite impossible.  The margin is not broad enough, the\nthing begins to smell of scorching—brrr!” said he, and shuddered.  “It is\ntrue I bought it myself at a cent, when I knew not there were smaller\ncoins.  I was a fool for my pains; there will never be found another: and\nwhoever has that bottle now will carry it to the pit.”\n\n“O my husband!” said Kokua.  “Is it not a terrible thing to save oneself\nby the eternal ruin of another?  It seems to me I could not laugh.  I\nwould be humbled.  I would be filled with melancholy.  I would pray for\nthe poor holder.”\n\nThen Keawe, because he felt the truth of what she said, grew the more\nangry.  “Heighty-teighty!” cried he.  “You may be filled with melancholy\nif you please.  It is not the mind of a good wife.  If you thought at all\nof me, you would sit shamed.”\n\nThereupon he went out, and Kokua was alone.\n\nWhat chance had she to sell that bottle at two centimes?  None, she\nperceived.  And if she had any, here was her husband hurrying her away to\na country where there was nothing lower than a cent.  And here—on the\nmorrow of her sacrifice—was her husband leaving her and blaming her.\n\nShe would not even try to profit by what time she had, but sat in the\nhouse, and now had the bottle out and viewed it with unutterable fear,\nand now, with loathing, hid it out of sight.\n\nBy-and-by, Keawe came back, and would have her take a drive.\n\n“My husband, I am ill,” she said.  “I am out of heart.  Excuse me, I can\ntake no pleasure.”\n\nThen was Keawe more wroth than ever.  With her, because he thought she\nwas brooding over the case of the old man; and with himself, because he\nthought she was right, and was ashamed to be so happy.\n\n“This is your truth,” cried he, “and this your affection!  Your husband\nis just saved from eternal ruin, which he encountered for the love of\nyou—and you can take no pleasure!  Kokua, you have a disloyal heart.”\n\nHe went forth again furious, and wandered in the town all day.  He met\nfriends, and drank with them; they hired a carriage and drove into the\ncountry, and there drank again.  All the time Keawe was ill at ease,\nbecause he was taking this pastime while his wife was sad, and because he\nknew in his heart that she was more right than he; and the knowledge made\nhim drink the deeper.\n\nNow there was an old brutal Haole drinking with him, one that had been a\nboatswain of a whaler, a runaway, a digger in gold mines, a convict in\nprisons.  He had a low mind and a foul mouth; he loved to drink and to\nsee others drunken; and he pressed the glass upon Keawe.  Soon there was\nno more money in the company.\n\n“Here, you!” says the boatswain, “you are rich, you have been always\nsaying.  You have a bottle or some foolishness.”\n\n“Yes,” says Keawe, “I am rich; I will go back and get some money from my\nwife, who keeps it.”\n\n“That’s a bad idea, mate,” said the boatswain.  “Never you trust a\npetticoat with dollars.  They’re all as false as water; you keep an eye\non her.”\n\nNow, this word struck in Keawe’s mind; for he was muddled with what he\nhad been drinking.\n\n“I should not wonder but she was false, indeed,” thought he.  “Why else\nshould she be so cast down at my release?  But I will show her I am not\nthe man to be fooled.  I will catch her in the act.”\n\nAccordingly, when they were back in town, Keawe bade the boatswain wait\nfor him at the corner, by the old calaboose, and went forward up the\navenue alone to the door of his house.  The night had come again; there\nwas a light within, but never a sound; and Keawe crept about the corner,\nopened the back door softly, and looked in.\n\nThere was Kokua on the floor, the lamp at her side; before her was a\nmilk-white bottle, with a round belly and a long neck; and as she viewed\nit, Kokua wrung her hands.\n\nA long time Keawe stood and looked in the doorway.  At first he was\nstruck stupid; and then fear fell upon him that the bargain had been made\namiss, and the bottle had come back to him as it came at San Francisco;\nand at that his knees were loosened, and the fumes of the wine departed\nfrom his head like mists off a river in the morning.  And then he had\nanother thought; and it was a strange one, that made his cheeks to burn.\n\n“I must make sure of this,” thought he.\n\nSo he closed the door, and went softly round the corner again, and then\ncame noisily in, as though he were but now returned.  And, lo! by the\ntime he opened the front door no bottle was to be seen; and Kokua sat in\na chair and started up like one awakened out of sleep.\n\n“I have been drinking all day and making merry,” said Keawe.  “I have\nbeen with good companions, and now I only come back for money, and return\nto drink and carouse with them again.”\n\nBoth his face and voice were as stern as judgment, but Kokua was too\ntroubled to observe.\n\n“You do well to use your own, my husband,” said she, and her words\ntrembled.\n\n“O, I do well in all things,” said Keawe, and he went straight to the\nchest and took out money.  But he looked besides in the corner where they\nkept the bottle, and there was no bottle there.\n\nAt that the chest heaved upon the floor like a sea-billow, and the house\nspan about him like a wreath of smoke, for he saw he was lost now, and\nthere was no escape.  “It is what I feared,” he thought.  “It is she who\nhas bought it.”\n\nAnd then he came to himself a little and rose up; but the sweat streamed\non his face as thick as the rain and as cold as the well-water.\n\n“Kokua,” said he, “I said to you to-day what ill became me.  Now I return\nto carouse with my jolly companions,” and at that he laughed a little\nquietly.  “I will take more pleasure in the cup if you forgive me.”\n\nShe clasped his knees in a moment; she kissed his knees with flowing\ntears.\n\n“O,” she cried, “I asked but a kind word!”\n\n“Let us never one think hardly of the other,” said Keawe, and was gone\nout of the house.\n\nNow, the money that Keawe had taken was only some of that store of\ncentime pieces they had laid in at their arrival.  It was very sure he\nhad no mind to be drinking.  His wife had given her soul for him, now he\nmust give his for hers; no other thought was in the world with him.\n\nAt the corner, by the old calaboose, there was the boatswain waiting.\n\n“My wife has the bottle,” said Keawe, “and, unless you help me to recover\nit, there can be no more money and no more liquor to-night.”\n\n“You do not mean to say you are serious about that bottle?” cried the\nboatswain.\n\n“There is the lamp,” said Keawe.  “Do I look as if I was jesting?”\n\n“That is so,” said the boatswain.  “You look as serious as a ghost.”\n\n“Well, then,” said Keawe, “here are two centimes; you must go to my wife\nin the house, and offer her these for the bottle, which (if I am not much\nmistaken) she will give you instantly.  Bring it to me here, and I will\nbuy it back from you for one; for that is the law with this bottle, that\nit still must be sold for a less sum.  But whatever you do, never breathe\na word to her that you have come from me.”\n\n“Mate, I wonder are you making a fool of me?” asked the boatswain.\n\n“It will do you no harm if I am,” returned Keawe.\n\n“That is so, mate,” said the boatswain.\n\n“And if you doubt me,” added Keawe, “you can try.  As soon as you are\nclear of the house, wish to have your pocket full of money, or a bottle\nof the best rum, or what you please, and you will see the virtue of the\nthing.”\n\n“Very well, Kanaka,” says the boatswain.  “I will try; but if you are\nhaving your fun out of me, I will take my fun out of you with a belaying\npin.”\n\nSo the whaler-man went off up the avenue; and Keawe stood and waited.  It\nwas near the same spot where Kokua had waited the night before; but Keawe\nwas more resolved, and never faltered in his purpose; only his soul was\nbitter with despair.\n\nIt seemed a long time he had to wait before he heard a voice singing in\nthe darkness of the avenue.  He knew the voice to be the boatswain’s; but\nit was strange how drunken it appeared upon a sudden.\n\nNext, the man himself came stumbling into the light of the lamp.  He had\nthe devil’s bottle buttoned in his coat; another bottle was in his hand;\nand even as he came in view he raised it to his mouth and drank.\n\n“You have it,” said Keawe.  “I see that.”\n\n“Hands off!” cried the boatswain, jumping back.  “Take a step near me,\nand I’ll smash your mouth.  You thought you could make a cat’s-paw of me,\ndid you?”\n\n“What do you mean?” cried Keawe.\n\n“Mean?” cried the boatswain.  “This is a pretty good bottle, this is;\nthat’s what I mean.  How I got it for two centimes I can’t make out; but\nI’m sure you shan’t have it for one.”\n\n“You mean you won’t sell?” gasped Keawe.\n\n“No, _sir_!” cried the boatswain.  “But I’ll give you a drink of the rum,\nif you like.”\n\n“I tell you,” said Keawe, “the man who has that bottle goes to hell.”\n\n“I reckon I’m going anyway,” returned the sailor; “and this bottle’s the\nbest thing to go with I’ve struck yet.  No, sir!” he cried again, “this\nis my bottle now, and you can go and fish for another.”\n\n“Can this be true?” Keawe cried.  “For your own sake, I beseech you, sell\nit me!”\n\n“I don’t value any of your talk,” replied the boatswain.  “You thought I\nwas a flat; now you see I’m not; and there’s an end.  If you won’t have a\nswallow of the rum, I’ll have one myself.  Here’s your health, and\ngood-night to you!”\n\nSo off he went down the avenue towards town, and there goes the bottle\nout of the story.\n\nBut Keawe ran to Kokua light as the wind; and great was their joy that\nnight; and great, since then, has been the peace of all their days in the\nBright House.\n\n\n\nTHE ISLE OF VOICES.\n\n\nKeola was married with Lehua, daughter of Kalamake, the wise man of\nMolokai, and he kept his dwelling with the father of his wife.  There was\nno man more cunning than that prophet; he read the stars, he could divine\nby the bodies of the dead, and by the means of evil creatures: he could\ngo alone into the highest parts of the mountain, into the region of the\nhobgoblins, and there he would lay snares to entrap the spirits of the\nancient.\n\nFor this reason no man was more consulted in all the Kingdom of Hawaii.\nPrudent people bought, and sold, and married, and laid out their lives by\nhis counsels; and the King had him twice to Kona to seek the treasures of\nKamehameha.  Neither was any man more feared: of his enemies, some had\ndwindled in sickness by the virtue of his incantations, and some had been\nspirited away, the life and the clay both, so that folk looked in vain\nfor so much as a bone of their bodies.  It was rumoured that he had the\nart or the gift of the old heroes.  Men had seen him at night upon the\nmountains, stepping from one cliff to the next; they had seen him walking\nin the high forest, and his head and shoulders were above the trees.\n\nThis Kalamake was a strange man to see.  He was come of the best blood in\nMolokai and Maui, of a pure descent; and yet he was more white to look\nupon than any foreigner: his hair the colour of dry grass, and his eyes\nred and very blind, so that “Blind as Kalamake, that can see across\nto-morrow,” was a byword in the islands.\n\nOf all these doings of his father-in-law, Keola knew a little by the\ncommon repute, a little more he suspected, and the rest he ignored.  But\nthere was one thing troubled him.  Kalamake was a man that spared for\nnothing, whether to eat or to drink, or to wear; and for all he paid in\nbright new dollars.  “Bright as Kalamake’s dollars,” was another saying\nin the Eight Isles.  Yet he neither sold, nor planted, nor took hire—only\nnow and then from his sorceries—and there was no source conceivable for\nso much silver coin.\n\nIt chanced one day Keola’s wife was gone upon a visit to Kaunakakai, on\nthe lee side of the island, and the men were forth at the sea-fishing.\nBut Keola was an idle dog, and he lay in the verandah and watched the\nsurf beat on the shore and the birds fly about the cliff.  It was a chief\nthought with him always—the thought of the bright dollars.  When he lay\ndown to bed he would be wondering why they were so many, and when he woke\nat morn he would be wondering why they were all new; and the thing was\nnever absent from his mind.  But this day of all days he made sure in his\nheart of some discovery.  For it seems he had observed the place where\nKalamake kept his treasure, which was a lock-fast desk against the\nparlour wall, under the print of Kamehameha the Fifth, and a photograph\nof Queen Victoria with her crown; and it seems again that, no later than\nthe night before, he found occasion to look in, and behold! the bag lay\nthere empty.  And this was the day of the steamer; he could see her smoke\noff Kalaupapa; and she must soon arrive with a month’s goods, tinned\nsalmon and gin, and all manner of rare luxuries for Kalamake.\n\n“Now if he can pay for his goods to-day,” Keola thought, “I shall know\nfor certain that the man is a warlock, and the dollars come out of the\nDevil’s pocket.”\n\nWhile he was so thinking, there was his father-in-law behind him, looking\nvexed.\n\n“Is that the steamer?” he asked.\n\n“Yes,” said Keola.  “She has but to call at Pelekunu, and then she will\nbe here.”\n\n“There is no help for it then,” returned Kalamake, “and I must take you\nin my confidence, Keola, for the lack of anyone better.  Come here within\nthe house.”\n\nSo they stepped together into the parlour, which was a very fine room,\npapered and hung with prints, and furnished with a rocking-chair, and a\ntable and a sofa in the European style.  There was a shelf of books\nbesides, and a family Bible in the midst of the table, and the lock-fast\nwriting desk against the wall; so that anyone could see it was the house\nof a man of substance.\n\nKalamake made Keola close the shutters of the windows, while he himself\nlocked all the doors and set open the lid of the desk.  From this he\nbrought forth a pair of necklaces hung with charms and shells, a bundle\nof dried herbs, and the dried leaves of trees, and a green branch of\npalm.\n\n“What I am about,” said he, “is a thing beyond wonder.  The men of old\nwere wise; they wrought marvels, and this among the rest; but that was at\nnight, in the dark, under the fit stars and in the desert.  The same will\nI do here in my own house and under the plain eye of day.”\n\nSo saying, he put the bible under the cushion of the sofa so that it was\nall covered, brought out from the same place a mat of a wonderfully fine\ntexture, and heaped the herbs and leaves on sand in a tin pan.  And then\nhe and Keola put on the necklaces and took their stand upon the opposite\ncorners of the mat.\n\n“The time comes,” said the warlock; “be not afraid.”\n\nWith that he set flame to the herbs, and began to mutter and wave the\nbranch of palm.  At first the light was dim because of the closed\nshutters; but the herbs caught strongly afire, and the flames beat upon\nKeola, and the room glowed with the burning; and next the smoke rose and\nmade his head swim and his eyes darken, and the sound of Kalamake\nmuttering ran in his ears.  And suddenly, to the mat on which they were\nstanding came a snatch or twitch, that seemed to be more swift than\nlightning.  In the same wink the room was gone and the house, the breath\nall beaten from Keola’s body.  Volumes of light rolled upon his eyes and\nhead, and he found himself transported to a beach of the sea under a\nstrong sun, with a great surf roaring: he and the warlock standing there\non the same mat, speechless, gasping and grasping at one another, and\npassing their hands before their eyes.\n\n“What was this?” cried Keola, who came to himself the first, because he\nwas the younger.  “The pang of it was like death.”\n\n“It matters not,” panted Kalamake.  “It is now done.”\n\n“And, in the name of God, where are we?” cried Keola.\n\n“That is not the question,” replied the sorcerer.  “Being here, we have\nmatter in our hands, and that we must attend to.  Go, while I recover my\nbreath, into the borders of the wood, and bring me the leaves of such and\nsuch a herb, and such and such a tree, which you will find to grow there\nplentifully—three handfuls of each.  And be speedy.  We must be home\nagain before the steamer comes; it would seem strange if we had\ndisappeared.”  And he sat on the sand and panted.\n\nKeola went up the beach, which was of shining sand and coral, strewn with\nsingular shells; and he thought in his heart—\n\n“How do I not know this beach?  I will come here again and gather\nshells.”\n\nIn front of him was a line of palms against the sky; not like the palms\nof the Eight Islands, but tall and fresh and beautiful, and hanging out\nwithered fans like gold among the green, and he thought in his heart—\n\n“It is strange I should not have found this grove.  I will come here\nagain, when it is warm, to sleep.”  And he thought, “How warm it has\ngrown suddenly!”  For it was winter in Hawaii, and the day had been\nchill.  And he thought also, “Where are the grey mountains?  And where is\nthe high cliff with the hanging forest and the wheeling birds?”  And the\nmore he considered, the less he might conceive in what quarter of the\nislands he was fallen.\n\nIn the border of the grove, where it met the beach, the herb was growing,\nbut the tree further back.  Now, as Keola went toward the tree, he was\naware of a young woman who had nothing on her body but a belt of leaves.\n\n“Well!” thought Keola, “they are not very particular about their dress in\nthis part of the country.”  And he paused, supposing she would observe\nhim and escape; and seeing that she still looked before her, stood and\nhummed aloud.  Up she leaped at the sound.  Her face was ashen; she\nlooked this way and that, and her mouth gaped with the terror of her\nsoul.  But it was a strange thing that her eyes did not rest upon Keola.\n\n“Good day,” said he.  “You need not be so frightened; I will not eat\nyou.”  And he had scarce opened his mouth before the young woman fled\ninto the bush.\n\n“These are strange manners,” thought Keola.  And, not thinking what he\ndid, ran after her.\n\nAs she ran, the girl kept crying in some speech that was not practised in\nHawaii, yet some of the words were the same, and he knew she kept calling\nand warning others.  And presently he saw more people running—men, women\nand children, one with another, all running and crying like people at a\nfire.  And with that he began to grow afraid himself, and returned to\nKalamake bringing the leaves.  Him he told what he had seen.\n\n“You must pay no heed,” said Kalamake.  “All this is like a dream and\nshadows.  All will disappear and be forgotten.”\n\n“It seemed none saw me,” said Keola.\n\n“And none did,” replied the sorcerer.  “We walk here in the broad sun\ninvisible by reason of these charms.  Yet they hear us; and therefore it\nis well to speak softly, as I do.”\n\nWith that he made a circle round the mat with stones, and in the midst he\nset the leaves.\n\n“It will be your part,” said he, “to keep the leaves alight, and feed the\nfire slowly.  While they blaze (which is but for a little moment) I must\ndo my errand; and before the ashes blacken, the same power that brought\nus carries us away.  Be ready now with the match; and do you call me in\ngood time lest the flames burn out and I be left.”\n\nAs soon as the leaves caught, the sorcerer leaped like a deer out of the\ncircle, and began to race along the beach like a hound that has been\nbathing.  As he ran, he kept stooping to snatch shells; and it seemed to\nKeola that they glittered as he took them.  The leaves blazed with a\nclear flame that consumed them swiftly; and presently Keola had but a\nhandful left, and the sorcerer was far off, running and stopping.\n\n“Back!” cried Keola.  “Back!  The leaves are near done.”\n\nAt that Kalamake turned, and if he had run before, now he flew.  But fast\nas he ran, the leaves burned faster.  The flame was ready to expire when,\nwith a great leap, he bounded on the mat.  The wind of his leaping blew\nit out; and with that the beach was gone, and the sun and the sea, and\nthey stood once more in the dimness of the shuttered parlour, and were\nonce more shaken and blinded; and on the mat betwixt them lay a pile of\nshining dollars.  Keola ran to the shutters; and there was the steamer\ntossing in the swell close in.\n\nThe same night Kalamake took his son-in-law apart, and gave him five\ndollars in his hand.\n\n“Keola,” said he, “if you are a wise man (which I am doubtful of) you\nwill think you slept this afternoon on the verandah, and dreamed as you\nwere sleeping.  I am a man of few words, and I have for my helpers people\nof short memories.”\n\nNever a word more said Kalamake, nor referred again to that affair.  But\nit ran all the while in Keola’s head—if he were lazy before, he would now\ndo nothing.\n\n“Why should I work,” thought he, “when I have a father-in-law who makes\ndollars of sea-shells?”\n\nPresently his share was spent.  He spent it all upon fine clothes.  And\nthen he was sorry:\n\n“For,” thought he, “I had done better to have bought a concertina, with\nwhich I might have entertained myself all day long.”  And then he began\nto grow vexed with Kalamake.\n\n“This man has the soul of a dog,” thought he.  “He can gather dollars\nwhen he pleases on the beach, and he leaves me to pine for a concertina!\nLet him beware: I am no child, I am as cunning as he, and hold his\nsecret.”  With that he spoke to his wife Lehua, and complained of her\nfather’s manners.\n\n“I would let my father be,” said Lehua.  “He is a dangerous man to\ncross.”\n\n“I care that for him!” cried Keola; and snapped his fingers.  “I have him\nby the nose.  I can make him do what I please.”  And he told Lehua the\nstory.\n\nBut she shook her head.\n\n“You may do what you like,” said she; “but as sure as you thwart my\nfather, you will be no more heard of.  Think of this person, and that\nperson; think of Hua, who was a noble of the House of Representatives,\nand went to Honolulu every year; and not a bone or a hair of him was\nfound.  Remember Kamau, and how he wasted to a thread, so that his wife\nlifted him with one hand.  Keola, you are a baby in my father’s hands; he\nwill take you with his thumb and finger and eat you like a shrimp.”\n\nNow Keola was truly afraid of Kalamake, but he was vain too; and these\nwords of his wife’s incensed him.\n\n“Very well,” said he, “if that is what you think of me, I will show how\nmuch you are deceived.”  And he went straight to where his father-in-law\nwas sitting in the parlour.\n\n“Kalamake,” said he, “I want a concertina.”\n\n“Do you, indeed?” said Kalamake.\n\n“Yes,” said he, “and I may as well tell you plainly, I mean to have it.\nA man who picks up dollars on the beach can certainly afford a\nconcertina.”\n\n“I had no idea you had so much spirit,” replied the sorcerer.  “I thought\nyou were a timid, useless lad, and I cannot describe how much pleased I\nam to find I was mistaken.  Now I begin to think I may have found an\nassistant and successor in my difficult business.  A concertina?  You\nshall have the best in Honolulu.  And to-night, as soon as it is dark,\nyou and I will go and find the money.”\n\n“Shall we return to the beach?” asked Keola.\n\n“No, no!” replied Kalamake; “you must begin to learn more of my secrets.\nLast time I taught you to pick shells; this time I shall teach you to\ncatch fish.  Are you strong enough to launch Pili’s boat?”\n\n“I think I am,” returned Keola.  “But why should we not take your own,\nwhich is afloat already?”\n\n“I have a reason which you will understand thoroughly before to-morrow,”\nsaid Kalamake.  “Pili’s boat is the better suited for my purpose.  So, if\nyou please, let us meet there as soon as it is dark; and in the\nmeanwhile, let us keep our own counsel, for there is no cause to let the\nfamily into our business.”\n\nHoney is not more sweet than was the voice of Kalamake, and Keola could\nscarce contain his satisfaction.\n\n“I might have had my concertina weeks ago,” thought he, “and there is\nnothing needed in this world but a little courage.”\n\nPresently after he spied Lehua weeping, and was half in a mind to tell\nher all was well.\n\n“But no,” thinks he; “I shall wait till I can show her the concertina; we\nshall see what the chit will do then.  Perhaps she will understand in the\nfuture that her husband is a man of some intelligence.”\n\nAs soon as it was dark father and son-in-law launched Pili’s boat and set\nthe sail.  There was a great sea, and it blew strong from the leeward;\nbut the boat was swift and light and dry, and skimmed the waves.  The\nwizard had a lantern, which he lit and held with his finger through the\nring; and the two sat in the stern and smoked cigars, of which Kalamake\nhad always a provision, and spoke like friends of magic and the great\nsums of money which they could make by its exercise, and what they should\nbuy first, and what second; and Kalamake talked like a father.\n\nPresently he looked all about, and above him at the stars, and back at\nthe island, which was already three parts sunk under the sea, and he\nseemed to consider ripely his position.\n\n“Look!” says he, “there is Molokai already far behind us, and Maui like a\ncloud; and by the bearing of these three stars I know I am come where I\ndesire.  This part of the sea is called the Sea of the Dead.  It is in\nthis place extraordinarily deep, and the floor is all covered with the\nbones of men, and in the holes of this part gods and goblins keep their\nhabitation.  The flow of the sea is to the north, stronger than a shark\ncan swim, and any man who shall here be thrown out of a ship it bears\naway like a wild horse into the uttermost ocean.  Presently he is spent\nand goes down, and his bones are scattered with the rest, and the gods\ndevour his spirit.”\n\nFear came on Keola at the words, and he looked, and by the light of the\nstars and the lantern, the warlock seemed to change.\n\n“What ails you?” cried Keola, quick and sharp.\n\n“It is not I who am ailing,” said the wizard; “but there is one here very\nsick.”\n\nWith that he changed his grasp upon the lantern, and, behold I as he drew\nhis finger from the ring, the finger stuck and the ring was burst, and\nhis hand was grown to be of the bigness of three.\n\nAt that sight Keola screamed and covered his face.\n\nBut Kalamake held up the lantern.  “Look rather at my face!” said he—and\nhis head was huge as a barrel; and still he grew and grew as a cloud\ngrows on a mountain, and Keola sat before him screaming, and the boat\nraced on the great seas.\n\n“And now,” said the wizard, “what do you think about that concertina? and\nare you sure you would not rather have a flute?  No?” says he; “that is\nwell, for I do not like my family to be changeable of purpose.  But I\nbegin to think I had better get out of this paltry boat, for my bulk\nswells to a very unusual degree, and if we are not the more careful, she\nwill presently be swamped.”\n\nWith that he threw his legs over the side.  Even as he did so, the\ngreatness of the man grew thirty-fold and forty-fold as swift as sight or\nthinking, so that he stood in the deep seas to the armpits, and his head\nand shoulders rose like a high isle, and the swell beat and burst upon\nhis bosom, as it beats and breaks against a cliff.  The boat ran still to\nthe north, but he reached out his hand, and took the gunwale by the\nfinger and thumb, and broke the side like a biscuit, and Keola was\nspilled into the sea.  And the pieces of the boat the sorcerer crushed in\nthe hollow of his hand and flung miles away into the night.\n\n“Excuse me taking the lantern,” said he; “for I have a long wade before\nme, and the land is far, and the bottom of the sea uneven, and I feel the\nbones under my toes.”\n\nAnd he turned and went off walking with great strides; and as often as\nKeola sank in the trough he could see him no longer; but as often as he\nwas heaved upon the crest, there he was striding and dwindling, and he\nheld the lamp high over his head, and the waves broke white about him as\nhe went.\n\nSince first the islands were fished out of the sea, there was never a man\nso terrified as this Keola.  He swam indeed, but he swam as puppies swim\nwhen they are cast in to drown, and knew not wherefore.  He could but\nthink of the hugeness of the swelling of the warlock, of that face which\nwas great as a mountain, of those shoulders that were broad as an isle,\nand of the seas that beat on them in vain.  He thought, too, of the\nconcertina, and shame took hold upon him; and of the dead men’s bones,\nand fear shook him.\n\nOf a sudden he was aware of something dark against the stars that tossed,\nand a light below, and a brightness of the cloven sea; and he heard\nspeech of men.  He cried out aloud and a voice answered; and in a\ntwinkling the bows of a ship hung above him on a wave like a thing\nbalanced, and swooped down.  He caught with his two hands in the chains\nof her, and the next moment was buried in the rushing seas, and the next\nhauled on board by seamen.\n\nThey gave him gin and biscuit and dry clothes, and asked him how he came\nwhere they found him, and whether the light which they had seen was the\nlighthouse, Lae o Ka Laau.  But Keola knew white men are like children\nand only believe their own stories; so about himself he told them what he\npleased, and as for the light (which was Kalamake’s lantern) he vowed he\nhad seen none.\n\nThis ship was a schooner bound for Honolulu, and then to trade in the low\nislands; and by a very good chance for Keola she had lost a man off the\nbowsprit in a squall.  It was no use talking.  Keola durst not stay in\nthe Eight Islands.  Word goes so quickly, and all men are so fond to talk\nand carry news, that if he hid in the north end of Kauai or in the south\nend of Kau, the wizard would have wind of it before a month, and he must\nperish.  So he did what seemed the most prudent, and shipped sailor in\nthe place of the man who had been drowned.\n\nIn some ways the ship was a good place.  The food was extraordinarily\nrich and plenty, with biscuits and salt beef every day, and pea-soup and\npuddings made of flour and suet twice a week, so that Keola grew fat.\nThe captain also was a good man, and the crew no worse than other whites.\nThe trouble was the mate, who was the most difficult man to please Keola\nhad ever met with, and beat and cursed him daily, both for what he did\nand what he did not.  The blows that he dealt were very sore, for he was\nstrong; and the words he used were very unpalatable, for Keola was come\nof a good family and accustomed to respect.  And what was the worst of\nall, whenever Keola found a chance to sleep, there was the mate awake and\nstirring him up with a rope’s end.  Keola saw it would never do; and he\nmade up his mind to run away.\n\nThey were about a month out from Honolulu when they made the land.  It\nwas a fine starry night, the sea was smooth as well as the sky fair; it\nblew a steady trade; and there was the island on their weather bow, a\nribbon of palm trees lying flat along the sea.  The captain and the mate\nlooked at it with the night glass, and named the name of it, and talked\nof it, beside the wheel where Keola was steering.  It seemed it was an\nisle where no traders came.  By the captain’s way, it was an isle besides\nwhere no man dwelt; but the mate thought otherwise.\n\n“I don’t give a cent for the directory,” said he, “I’ve been past here\none night in the schooner _Eugenie_; it was just such a night as this;\nthey were fishing with torches, and the beach was thick with lights like\na town.”\n\n“Well, well,” says the captain, “its steep-to, that’s the great point;\nand there ain’t any outlying dangers by the chart, so we’ll just hug the\nlee side of it.  Keep her romping full, don’t I tell you!” he cried to\nKeola, who was listening so hard that he forgot to steer.\n\nAnd the mate cursed him, and swore that Kanaka was for no use in the\nworld, and if he got started after him with a belaying pin, it would be a\ncold day for Keola.\n\nAnd so the captain and mate lay down on the house together, and Keola was\nleft to himself.\n\n“This island will do very well for me,” he thought; “if no traders deal\nthere, the mate will never come.  And as for Kalamake, it is not possible\nhe can ever get as far as this.”\n\nWith that he kept edging the schooner nearer in.  He had to do this\nquietly, for it was the trouble with these white men, and above all with\nthe mate, that you could never be sure of them; they would all be\nsleeping sound, or else pretending, and if a sail shook, they would jump\nto their feet and fall on you with a rope’s end.  So Keola edged her up\nlittle by little, and kept all drawing.  And presently the land was close\non board, and the sound of the sea on the sides of it grew loud.\n\nWith that, the mate sat up suddenly upon the house.\n\n“What are you doing?” he roars.  “You’ll have the ship ashore!”\n\nAnd he made one bound for Keola, and Keola made another clean over the\nrail and plump into the starry sea.  When he came up again, the schooner\nhad payed off on her true course, and the mate stood by the wheel\nhimself, and Keola heard him cursing.  The sea was smooth under the lee\nof the island; it was warm besides, and Keola had his sailor’s knife, so\nhe had no fear of sharks.  A little way before him the trees stopped;\nthere was a break in the line of the land like the mouth of a harbour;\nand the tide, which was then flowing, took him up and carried him\nthrough.  One minute he was without, and the next within: had floated\nthere in a wide shallow water, bright with ten thousand stars, and all\nabout him was the ring of the land, with its string of palm trees.  And\nhe was amazed, because this was a kind of island he had never heard of.\n\nThe time of Keola in that place was in two periods—the period when he was\nalone, and the period when he was there with the tribe.  At first he\nsought everywhere and found no man; only some houses standing in a\nhamlet, and the marks of fires.  But the ashes of the fires were cold and\nthe rains had washed them away; and the winds had blown, and some of the\nhuts were overthrown.  It was here he took his dwelling, and he made a\nfire drill, and a shell hook, and fished and cooked his fish, and climbed\nafter green cocoanuts, the juice of which he drank, for in all the isle\nthere was no water.  The days were long to him, and the nights\nterrifying.  He made a lamp of cocoa-shell, and drew the oil of the ripe\nnuts, and made a wick of fibre; and when evening came he closed up his\nhut, and lit his lamp, and lay and trembled till morning.  Many a time he\nthought in his heart he would have been better in the bottom of the sea,\nhis bones rolling there with the others.\n\nAll this while he kept by the inside of the island, for the huts were on\nthe shore of the lagoon, and it was there the palms grew best, and the\nlagoon itself abounded with good fish.  And to the outer slide he went\nonce only, and he looked but the once at the beach of the ocean, and came\naway shaking.  For the look of it, with its bright sand, and strewn\nshells, and strong sun and surf, went sore against his inclination.\n\n“It cannot be,” he thought, “and yet it is very like.  And how do I know?\nThese white men, although they pretend to know where they are sailing,\nmust take their chance like other people.  So that after all we may have\nsailed in a circle, and I may be quite near to Molokai, and this may be\nthe very beach where my father-in-law gathers his dollars.”\n\nSo after that he was prudent, and kept to the land side.\n\nIt was perhaps a month later, when the people of the place arrived—the\nfill of six great boats.  They were a fine race of men, and spoke a\ntongue that sounded very different from the tongue of Hawaii, but so many\nof the words were the same that it was not difficult to understand.  The\nmen besides were very courteous, and the women very towardly; and they\nmade Keola welcome, and built him a house, and gave him a wife; and what\nsurprised him the most, he was never sent to work with the young men.\n\nAnd now Keola had three periods.  First he had a period of being very\nsad, and then he had a period when he was pretty merry.  Last of all came\nthe third, when he was the most terrified man in the four oceans.\n\nThe cause of the first period was the girl he had to wife.  He was in\ndoubt about the island, and he might have been in doubt about the speech,\nof which he had heard so little when he came there with the wizard on the\nmat.  But about his wife there was no mistake conceivable, for she was\nthe same girl that ran from him crying in the wood.  So he had sailed all\nthis way, and might as well have stayed in Molokai; and had left home and\nwife and all his friends for no other cause but to escape his enemy, and\nthe place he had come to was that wizard’s hunting ground, and the shore\nwhere he walked invisible.  It was at this period when he kept the most\nclose to the lagoon side, and as far as he dared, abode in the cover of\nhis hut.\n\nThe cause of the second period was talk he heard from his wife and the\nchief islanders.  Keola himself said little.  He was never so sure of his\nnew friends, for he judged they were too civil to be wholesome, and since\nhe had grown better acquainted with his father-in-law the man had grown\nmore cautious.  So he told them nothing of himself, but only his name and\ndescent, and that he came from the Eight Islands, and what fine islands\nthey were; and about the king’s palace in Honolulu, and how he was a\nchief friend of the king and the missionaries.  But he put many questions\nand learned much.  The island where he was was called the Isle of Voices;\nit belonged to the tribe, but they made their home upon another, three\nhours’ sail to the southward.  There they lived and had their permanent\nhouses, and it was a rich island, where were eggs and chickens and pigs,\nand ships came trading with rum and tobacco.  It was there the schooner\nhad gone after Keola deserted; there, too, the mate had died, like the\nfool of a white man as he was.  It seems, when the ship came, it was the\nbeginning of the sickly season in that isle, when the fish of the lagoon\nare poisonous, and all who eat of them swell up and die.  The mate was\ntold of it; he saw the boats preparing, because in that season the people\nleave that island and sail to the Isle of Voices; but he was a fool of a\nwhite man, who would believe no stories but his own, and he caught one of\nthese fish, cooked it and ate it, and swelled up and died, which was good\nnews to Keola.  As for the Isle of Voices, it lay solitary the most part\nof the year; only now and then a boat’s crew came for copra, and in the\nbad season, when the fish at the main isle were poisonous, the tribe\ndwelt there in a body.  It had its name from a marvel, for it seemed the\nseaside of it was all beset with invisible devils; day and night you\nheard them talking one with another in strange tongues; day and night\nlittle fires blazed up and were extinguished on the beach; and what was\nthe cause of these doings no man might conceive.  Keola asked them if it\nwere the same in their own island where they stayed, and they told him\nno, not there; nor yet in any other of some hundred isles that lay all\nabout them in that sea; but it was a thing peculiar to the Isle of\nVoices.  They told him also that these fires and voices were ever on the\nseaside and in the seaward fringes of the wood, and a man might dwell by\nthe lagoon two thousand years (if he could live so long) and never be any\nway troubled; and even on the seaside the devils did no harm if let\nalone.  Only once a chief had cast a spear at one of the voices, and the\nsame night he fell out of a cocoanut palm and was killed.\n\nKeola thought a good bit with himself.  He saw he would be all right when\nthe tribe returned to the main island, and right enough where he was, if\nhe kept by the lagoon, yet he had a mind to make things righter if he\ncould.  So he told the high chief he had once been in an isle that was\npestered the same way, and the folk had found a means to cure that\ntrouble.\n\n“There was a tree growing in the bush there,” says he, “and it seems\nthese devils came to get the leaves of it.  So the people of the isle cut\ndown the tree wherever it was found, and the devils came no more.”\n\nThey asked what kind of tree this was, and he showed them the tree of\nwhich Kalamake burned the leaves.  They found it hard to believe, yet the\nidea tickled them.  Night after night the old men debated it in their\ncouncils, but the high chief (though he was a brave man) was afraid of\nthe matter, and reminded them daily of the chief who cast a spear against\nthe voices and was killed, and the thought of that brought all to a stand\nagain.\n\nThough he could not yet bring about the destruction of the trees, Keola\nwas well enough pleased, and began to look about him and take pleasure in\nhis days; and, among other things, he was the kinder to his wife, so that\nthe girl began to love him greatly.  One day he came to the hut, and she\nlay on the ground lamenting.\n\n“Why,” said Keola, “what is wrong with you now?”\n\nShe declared it was nothing.\n\nThe same night she woke him.  The lamp burned very low, but he saw by her\nface she was in sorrow.\n\n“Keola,” she said, “put your ear to my mouth that I may whisper, for no\none must hear us.  Two days before the boats begin to be got ready, go\nyou to the sea-side of the isle and lie in a thicket.  We shall choose\nthat place before-hand, you and I; and hide food; and every night I shall\ncome near by there singing.  So when a night comes and you do not hear\nme, you shall know we are clean gone out of the island, and you may come\nforth again in safety.”\n\nThe soul of Keola died within him.\n\n“What is this?” he cried.  “I cannot live among devils.  I will not be\nleft behind upon this isle.  I am dying to leave it.”\n\n“You will never leave it alive, my poor Keola,” said the girl; “for to\ntell you the truth, my people are eaters of men; but this they keep\nsecret.  And the reason they will kill you before we leave is because in\nour island ships come, and Donat-Kimaran comes and talks for the French,\nand there is a white trader there in a house with a verandah, and a\ncatechist.  Oh, that is a fine place indeed!  The trader has barrels\nfilled with flour, and a French warship once came in the lagoon and gave\neverybody wine and biscuit.  Ah, my poor Keola, I wish I could take you\nthere, for great is my love to you, and it is the finest place in the\nseas except Papeete.”\n\nSo now Keola was the most terrified man in the four oceans.  He had heard\ntell of eaters of men in the south islands, and the thing had always been\na fear to him; and here it was knocking at his door.  He had heard\nbesides, by travellers, of their practices, and how when they are in a\nmind to eat a man, they cherish and fondle him like a mother with a\nfavourite baby.  And he saw this must be his own case; and that was why\nhe had been housed, and fed, and wived, and liberated from all work; and\nwhy the old men and the chiefs discoursed with him like a person of\nweight.  So he lay on his bed and railed upon his destiny; and the flesh\ncurdled on his bones.\n\nThe next day the people of the tribe were very civil, as their way was.\nThey were elegant speakers, and they made beautiful poetry, and jested at\nmeals, so that a missionary must have died laughing.  It was little\nenough Keola cared for their fine ways; all he saw was the white teeth\nshining in their mouths, and his gorge rose at the sight; and when they\nwere done eating, he went and lay in the bush like a dead man.\n\nThe next day it was the same, and then his wife followed him.\n\n“Keola,” she said, “if you do not eat, I tell you plainly you will be\nkilled and cooked to-morrow.  Some of the old chiefs are murmuring\nalready.  They think you are fallen sick and must lose flesh.”\n\nWith that Keola got to his feet, and anger burned in him.\n\n“It is little I care one way or the other,” said he.  “I am between the\ndevil and the deep sea.  Since die I must, let me die the quickest way;\nand since I must be eaten at the best of it, let me rather be eaten by\nhobgoblins than by men.  Farewell,” said he, and he left her standing,\nand walked to the sea-side of that island.\n\nIt was all bare in the strong sun; there was no sign of man, only the\nbeach was trodden, and all about him as he went, the voices talked and\nwhispered, and the little fires sprang up and burned down.  All tongues\nof the earth were spoken there; the French, the Dutch, the Russian, the\nTamil, the Chinese.  Whatever land knew sorcery, there were some of its\npeople whispering in Keola’s ear.  That beach was thick as a cried fair,\nyet no man seen; and as he walked he saw the shells vanish before him,\nand no man to pick them up.  I think the devil would have been afraid to\nbe alone in such a company; but Keola was past fear and courted death.\nWhen the fires sprang up, he charged for them like a bull.  Bodiless\nvoices called to and fro; unseen hands poured sand upon the flames; and\nthey were gone from the beach before he reached them.\n\n“It is plain Kalamake is not here,” he thought, “or I must have been\nkilled long since.”\n\nWith that he sat him down in the margin of the wood, for he was tired,\nand put his chin upon his hands.  The business before his eyes continued:\nthe beach babbled with voices, and the fires sprang up and sank, and the\nshells vanished and were renewed again even while he looked.\n\n“It was a by-day when I was here before,” he thought, “for it was nothing\nto this.”\n\nAnd his head was dizzy with the thought of these millions and millions of\ndollars, and all these hundreds and hundreds of persons culling them upon\nthe beach and flying in the air higher and swifter than eagles.\n\n“And to think how they have fooled me with their talk of mints,” says he,\n“and that money was made there, when it is clear that all the new coin in\nall the world is gathered on these sands!  But I will know better the\nnext time!” said he.\n\nAnd at last, he knew not very well how or when, sleep feel on Keola, and\nhe forgot the island and all his sorrows.\n\nEarly the next day, before the sun was yet up, a bustle woke him.  He\nawoke in fear, for he thought the tribe had caught him napping: but it\nwas no such matter.  Only, on the beach in front of him, the bodiless\nvoices called and shouted one upon another, and it seemed they all passed\nand swept beside him up the coast of the island.\n\n“What is afoot now?” thinks Keola.  And it was plain to him it was\nsomething beyond ordinary, for the fires were not lighted nor the shells\ntaken, but the bodiless voices kept posting up the beach, and hailing and\ndying away; and others following, and by the sound of them these wizards\nshould be angry.\n\n“It is not me they are angry at,” thought Keola, “for they pass me\nclose.”\n\nAs when hounds go by, or horses in a race, or city folk coursing to a\nfire, and all men join and follow after, so it was now with Keola; and he\nknew not what he did, nor why he did it, but there, lo and behold! he was\nrunning with the voices.\n\nSo he turned one point of the island, and this brought him in view of a\nsecond; and there he remembered the wizard trees to have been growing by\nthe score together in a wood.  From this point there went up a hubbub of\nmen crying not to be described; and by the sound of them, those that he\nran with shaped their course for the same quarter.  A little nearer, and\nthere began to mingle with the outcry the crash of many axes.  And at\nthis a thought came at last into his mind that the high chief had\nconsented; that the men of the tribe had set-to cutting down these trees;\nthat word had gone about the isle from sorcerer to sorcerer, and these\nwere all now assembling to defend their trees.  Desire of strange things\nswept him on.  He posted with the voices, crossed the beach, and came\ninto the borders of the wood, and stood astonished.  One tree had fallen,\nothers were part hewed away.  There was the tribe clustered.  They were\nback to back, and bodies lay, and blood flowed among their feet.  The hue\nof fear was on all their faces; their voices went up to heaven shrill as\na weasel’s cry.\n\nHave you seen a child when he is all alone and has a wooden sword, and\nfights, leaping and hewing with the empty air?  Even so the man-eaters\nhuddled back to back, and heaved up their axes, and laid on, and screamed\nas they laid on, and behold! no man to contend with them! only here and\nthere Keola saw an axe swinging over against them without hands; and time\nand again a man of the tribe would fall before it, clove in twain or\nburst asunder, and his soul sped howling.\n\nFor awhile Keola looked upon this prodigy like one that dreams, and then\nfear took him by the midst as sharp as death, that he should behold such\ndoings.  Even in that same flash the high chief of the clan espied him\nstanding, and pointed and called out his name.  Thereat the whole tribe\nsaw him also, and their eyes flashed, and their teeth clashed.\n\n“I am too long here,” thought Keola, and ran further out of the wood and\ndown the beach, not caring whither.\n\n“Keola!” said, a voice close by upon the empty sand.\n\n“Lehua! is that you?” he cried, and gasped, and looked in vain for her;\nbut by the eyesight he was stark alone.\n\n“I saw you pass before,” the voice answered: “but you would not hear me.\nQuick! get the leaves and the herbs, and let us free.”\n\n“You are there with the mat?” he asked.\n\n“Here, at your side;” said she.  And he felt her arms about him.  “Quick!\nthe leaves and the herbs, before my father can get back!”\n\nSo Keola ran for his life, and fetched the wizard fuel; and Lehua guided\nhim back, and set his feet upon the mat, and made the fire.  All the time\nof its burning, the sound of the battle towered out of the wood; the\nwizards and the man-eaters hard at fight; the wizards, the viewless ones,\nroaring out aloud like bulls upon a mountain, and the men of the tribe\nreplying shrill and savage out of the terror of their souls.  And all the\ntime of the burning, Keola stood there and listened, and shook, and\nwatched how the unseen hands of Lehua poured the leaves.  She poured them\nfast, and the flame burned high, and scorched Keola’s hands; and she\nspeeded and blew the burning with her breath.  The last leaf was eaten,\nthe flame fell, and the shock followed, and there were Keola and Lehua in\nthe room at home.\n\nNow, when Keola could see his wife at last he was mighty pleased, and he\nwas mighty pleased to be home again in Molokai and sit down beside a bowl\nof poi—for they make no poi on board ships, and there was none in the\nIsle of Voices—and he was out of the body with pleasure to be clean\nescaped out of the hands of the eaters of men.  But there was another\nmatter not so clear, and Lehua and Keola talked of it all night and were\ntroubled.  There was Kalamake left upon the isle.  If, by the blessing of\nGod, he could but stick there, all were well; but should he escape and\nreturn to Molokai, it would be an ill day for his daughter and her\nhusband.  They spoke of his gift of swelling, and whether he could wade\nthat distance in the seas.  But Keola knew by this time where that island\nwas—and that is to say, in the Low or Dangerous Archipelago.  So they\nfetched the atlas and looked upon the distance in the map, and by what\nthey could make of it, it seemed a far way for an old gentleman to walk.\nStill, it would not do to make too sure of a warlock like Kalamake, and\nthey determined at last to take counsel of a white missionary.\n\nSo the first one that came by, Keola told him everything.  And the\nmissionary was very sharp on him for taking the second wife in the low\nisland; but for all the rest, he vowed he could make neither head nor\ntail of it.\n\n“However,” says he, “if you think this money of your father’s ill gotten,\nmy advice to you would be, give some of it to the lepers and some to the\nmissionary fund.  And as for this extraordinary rigmarole, you cannot do\nbetter than keep it to yourselves.”\n\nBut he warned the police at Honolulu that, by all he could make out,\nKalamake and Keola had been coining false money, and it would not be\namiss to watch them.\n\nKeola and Lehua took his advice, and gave many dollars to the lepers and\nthe fund.  And no doubt the advice must have been good, for from that day\nto this, Kalamake has never more been heard of.  But whether he was slain\nin the battle by the trees, or whether he is still kicking his heels upon\nthe Isle of Voices, who shall say?\n\nFootnotes:\n\n{1}  Please pronounce _pappa_ throughout.\n\n{2}  Alas!\n\n{3}  Aeolian\n\n{4}  Yes.\n\n{5}  Leprosy.\n\n{6}  Whites.",
