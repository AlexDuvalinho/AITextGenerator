At a glance he might have been mistaken for a tramp, but he\nwas truly seeking work. He was intensely eager to belong somewhere and\nto be attached to almost any enterprise that would furnish him food and\nclothing.\n\nLong before he came in sight of the camp of the Grand Rapids Lumber\nCompany, he could hear the cheery voices of the men, the neighing of the\nhorses, and could scent the tempting odors of cooking food. A feeling\nof homeless friendlessness swept over him in a sickening wave. Without\nstopping to think, he turned into the newly made road and followed it to\nthe camp, where the gang was making ready for supper and bed.\n\nThe scene was intensely attractive. The thickness of the swamp made a\ndark, massive background below, while above towered gigantic trees.\nThe men were calling jovially back and forth as they unharnessed tired\nhorses that fell into attitudes of rest and crunched, in deep content,\nthe grain given them. Duncan, the brawny Scotch head-teamster, lovingly\nwiped the flanks of his big bays with handfuls of pawpaw leaves, as he\nsoftly whistled, “O wha will be my dearie, O!” and a cricket beneath\nthe leaves at his feet accompanied him. The green wood fire hissed and\ncrackled merrily. Wreathing tongues of flame wrapped around the big\nblack kettles, and when the cook lifted the lids to plunge in his\ntesting-fork, gusts of savory odors escaped.\n\nFreckles approached him.\n\n“I want to speak with the Boss,” he said.\n\nThe cook glanced at him and answered carelessly: “He can't use you.”\n\nThe color flooded Freckles' face, but he said simply: “If you will be\nhaving the goodness to point him out, we will give him a chance to do\nhis own talking.”\n\nWith a shrug of astonishment, the cook led the way to a rough board\ntable where a broad, square-shouldered man was bending over some\naccount-books.\n\n“Mr. McLean, here's another man wanting to be taken on the gang, I\nsuppose,” he said.\n\n“All right,” came the cheery answer. “I never needed a good man more\nthan I do just now.”\n\nThe manager turned a page and carefully began a new line.\n\n“No use of your bothering with this fellow,” volunteered the cook. “He\nhasn't but one hand.”\n\nThe flush on Freckles' face burned deeper. His lips thinned to a mere\nline. He lifted his shoulders, took a step forward, and thrust out his\nright arm, from which the sleeve dangled empty at the wrist.\n\n“That will do, Sears,” came the voice of the Boss sharply. “I will\ninterview my man when I finish this report.”\n\nHe turned to his work, while the cook hurried to the fires. Freckles\nstood one instant as he had braced himself to meet the eyes of the\nmanager; then his arm dropped and a wave of whiteness swept him. The\nBoss had not even turned his head. He had used the possessive. When he\nsaid “my man,” the hungry heart of Freckles went reaching toward him.\n\nThe boy drew a quivering breath. Then he whipped off his old hat and\nbeat the dust from it carefully. With his left hand he caught the right\nsleeve, wiped his sweaty face, and tried to straighten his hair with\nhis fingers. He broke a spray of ironwort beside him and used the purple\nbloom to beat the dust from his shoulders and limbs. The Boss, busy over\nhis report, was, nevertheless, vaguely alive to the toilet being made\nbehind him, and scored one for the man.\n\nMcLean was a Scotchman. It was his habit to work slowly and\nmethodically. The men of his camps never had known him to be in a hurry\nor to lose his temper. Discipline was inflexible, but the Boss was\nalways kind. His habits were simple. He shared camp life with his gangs.\nThe only visible signs of wealth consisted of a big, shimmering diamond\nstone of ice and fire that glittered and burned on one of his fingers,\nand the dainty, beautiful thoroughbred mare he rode between camps and\nacross the country on business.\n\nNo man of McLean's gangs could honestly say that he ever had been\noverdriven or underpaid. The Boss never had exacted any deference from\nhis men, yet so intense was his personality that no man of them ever had\nattempted a familiarity. They all knew him to be a thorough gentleman,\nand that in the great timber city several millions stood to his credit.\n\nHe was the only son of that McLean who had sent out the finest ships\never built in Scotland. That his son should carry on this business after\nthe father's death had been his ambition. He had sent the boy through\nthe universities of Oxford and Edinburgh, and allowed him several years'\ntravel before he should attempt his first commission for the firm.\n\nThen he was ordered to southern Canada and Michigan to purchase a\nconsignment of tall, straight timber for masts, and south to Indiana for\noak beams. The young man entered these mighty forests, parts of which\nlay untouched since the dawn of the morning of time. The clear, cool,\npungent atmosphere was intoxicating. The intense silence, like that of a\ngreat empty cathedral, fascinated him. He gradually learned that, to\nthe shy wood creatures that darted across his path or peeped inquiringly\nfrom leafy ambush, he was brother. He found himself approaching, with a\nfeeling of reverence, those majestic trees that had stood through ages\nof sun, wind, and snow. Soon it became difficult to fell them. When he\nhad filled his order and returned home, he was amazed to learn that in\nthe swamps and forests he had lost his heart and it was calling--forever\ncalling him.\n\nWhen he inherited his father's property, he promptly disposed of it,\nand, with his mother, founded a home in a splendid residence in the\noutskirts of Grand Rapids. With three partners, he organized a lumber\ncompany. His work was to purchase, fell, and ship the timber to the\nmills. Marshall managed the milling process and passed the lumber to the\nfactory. From the lumber, Barthol made beautiful and useful furniture,\nwhich Uptegrove scattered all over the world from a big wholesale house.\nOf the thousands who saw their faces reflected on the polished surfaces\nof that furniture and found comfort in its use, few there were to whom\nit suggested mighty forests and trackless swamps, and the man, big\nof soul and body, who cut his way through them, and with the eye of\nexperience doomed the proud trees that were now entering the homes of\ncivilization for service.\n\nWhen McLean turned from his finished report, he faced a young man,\nyet under twenty, tall, spare, heavily framed, closely freckled, and\nred-haired, with a homely Irish face, but in the steady gray eyes,\nstraightly meeting his searching ones of blue, there was unswerving\ncandor and the appearance of longing not to be ignored. He was dressed\nin the roughest of farm clothing, and seemed tired to the point of\nfalling.\n\n“You are looking for work?” questioned McLean.\n\n“Yis,” answered Freckles.\n\n“I am very sorry,” said the Boss with genuine sympathy in his every\ntone, “but there is only one man I want at present--a hardy, big fellow\nwith a stout heart and a strong body. I hoped that you would do, but I\nam afraid you are too young and scarcely strong enough.”\n\nFreckles stood, hat in hand, watching McLean.\n\n“And what was it you thought I might be doing?” he asked.\n\nThe Boss could scarcely repress a start. Somewhere before accident and\npoverty there had been an ancestor who used cultivated English, even\nwith an accent. The boy spoke in a mellow Irish voice, sweet and pure.\nIt was scarcely definite enough to be called brogue, yet there was a\ntrick in the turning of the sentence, the wrong sound of a letter here\nand there, that was almost irresistible to McLean, and presaged a misuse\nof infinitives and possessives with which he was very familiar and\nwhich touched him nearly. He was of foreign birth, and despite years of\nalienation, in times of strong feeling he committed inherited sins of\naccent and construction.\n\n“It's no child's job,” answered McLean. “I am the field manager of a\nbig lumber company. We have just leased two thousand acres of the\nLimberlost. Many of these trees are of great value. We can't leave our\ncamp, six miles south, for almost a year yet; so we have blazed a trail\nand strung barbed wires securely around this lease. Before we return to\nour work, I must put this property in the hands of a reliable, brave,\nstrong man who will guard it every hour of the day, and sleep with one\neye open at night. I shall require the entire length of the trail to be\nwalked at least twice each day, to make sure that our lines are up and\nthat no one has been trespassing.”\n\nFreckles was leaning forward, absorbing every word with such intense\neagerness that he was beguiling the Boss into explanations he had never\nintended making.\n\n“But why wouldn't that be the finest job in the world for me?” he\npleaded. “I am never sick. I could walk the trail twice, three times\nevery day, and I'd be watching sharp all the while.”\n\n“It's because you are scarcely more than a boy, and this will be a\ntrying job for a work-hardened man,” answered McLean. “You see, in the\nfirst place, you would be afraid. In stretching our lines, we killed six\nrattlesnakes almost as long as your body and as thick as your arm. It's\nthe price of your life to start through the marshgrass surrounding the\nswamp unless you are covered with heavy leather above your knees.\n\n“You should be able to swim in case high water undermines the temporary\nbridge we have built where Sleepy Snake Creek enters the swamp. The fall\nand winter changes of weather are abrupt and severe, while I would want\nstrict watch kept every day. You would always be alone, and I don't\nguarantee what is in the Limberlost. It is lying here as it has lain\nsince the beginning of time, and it is alive with forms and voices. I\ndon't pretend to say what all of them come from; but from a few slinking\nshapes I've seen, and hair-raising yells I've heard, I'd rather not\nconfront their owners myself; and I am neither weak nor fearful.\n\n“Worst of all, any man who will enter the swamp to mark and steal\ntimber is desperate. One of my employees at the south camp, John Carter,\ncompelled me to discharge him for a number of serious reasons. He came\nhere, entered the swamp alone, and succeeded in locating and marking\na number of valuable trees that he was endeavoring to sell to a rival\ncompany when we secured the lease. He has sworn to have these trees if\nhe has to die or to kill others to get them; and he is a man that the\nstrongest would not care to meet.”\n\n“But if he came to steal trees, wouldn't he bring teams and men enough:\nthat all anyone could do would be to watch and be after you?” queried\nthe boy.\n\n“Yes,” replied McLean.\n\n“Then why couldn't I be watching just as closely, and coming as fast, as\nan older, stronger man?” asked Freckles.\n\n“Why, by George, you could!” exclaimed McLean. “I don't know as the size\nof a man would be half so important as his grit and faithfulness, come\nto think of it. Sit on that log there and we will talk it over. What is\nyour name?”\n\nFreckles shook his head at the proffer of a seat, and folding his arms,\nstood straight as the trees around him. He grew a shade whiter, but his\neyes never faltered.\n\n“Freckles!” he said.\n\n“Good enough for everyday,” laughed McLean, “but I scarcely can put\n'Freckles' on the company's books. Tell me your name.”\n\n“I haven't any name,” replied the boy.\n\n“I don't understand,” said McLean.\n\n“I was thinking from the voice and the face of you that you wouldn't,”\n said Freckles slowly. “I've spent more time on it than I ever did on\nanything else in all me life, and I don't understand. Does it seem to\nyou that anyone would take a newborn baby and row over it, until it was\nbruised black, cut off its hand, and leave it out in a bitter night\non the steps of a charity home, to the care of strangers? That's what\nsomebody did to me.”\n\nMcLean stared aghast. He had no reply ready, and presently in a low\nvoice he suggested: “And after?”\n\n“The Home people took me in, and I was there the full legal age and\nseveral years over. For the most part we were a lot of little Irishmen\ntogether. They could always find homes for the other children, but\nnobody would ever be wanting me on account of me arm.”\n\n“Were they kind to you?” McLean regretted the question the minute it was\nasked.\n\n“I don't know,” answered Freckles. The reply sounded so hopeless, even\nto his own ears, that he hastened to qualify it by adding: “You see,\nit's like this, sir. Kindnesses that people are paid to lay off in job\nlots and that belong equally to several hundred others, ain't going to\nbe soaking into any one fellow so much.”\n\n“Go on,” said McLean, nodding comprehendingly.\n\n“There's nothing worth the taking of your time to tell,” replied\nFreckles. “The Home was in Chicago, and I was there all me life until\nthree months ago. When I was too old for the training they gave to the\nlittle children, they sent me to the closest ward school as long as the\nlaw would let them; but I was never like any of the other children, and\nthey all knew it. I'd to go and come like a prisoner, and be working\naround the Home early and late for me board and clothes. I always wanted\nto learn mighty bad, but I was glad when that was over.\n\n“Every few days, all me life, I'd to be called up, looked over, and\nrefused a home and love, on account of me hand and ugly face; but it was\nall the home I'd ever known, and I didn't seem to belong to any place\nelse.\n\n“Then a new superintendent was put in. He wasn't for being like any of\nthe others, and he swore he'd weed me out the first thing he did. He\nmade a plan to send me down the State to a man he said he knew who\nneeded a boy. He wasn't for remembering to tell that man that I was a\nhand short, and he knocked me down the minute he found I was the boy who\nhad been sent him. Between noon and that evening, he and his son close\nmy age had me in pretty much the same shape in which I was found in\nthe beginning, so I lay awake that night and ran away. I'd like to have\nsquared me account with that boy before I left, but I didn't dare for\nfear of waking the old man, and I knew I couldn't handle the two of\nthem; but I'm hoping to meet him alone some day before I die.”\n\nMcLean tugged at his mustache to hide the smile on his lips, but he\nliked the boy all the better for this confession.\n\n“I didn't even have to steal clothes to get rid of starting in me Home\nones,” Freckles continued, “for they had already taken all me clean,\nneat things for the boy and put me into his rags, and that went almost\nas sore as the beatings, for where I was we were always kept tidy and\nsweet-smelling, anyway. I hustled clear into this State before I learned\nthat man couldn't have kept me if he'd wanted to. When I thought I\nwas good and away from him, I commenced hunting work, but it is with\neverybody else just as it is with you, sir. Big, strong, whole men are\nthe only ones for being wanted.”\n\n“I have been studying over this matter,” answered McLean. “I am not so\nsure but that a man no older than you and similar in every way could do\nthis work very well, if he were not a coward, and had it in him to be\ntrustworthy and industrious.”\n\nFreckles came forward a step.\n\n“If you will give me a job where I can earn me food, clothes, and a\nplace to sleep,” he said, “if I can have a Boss to work for like other\nmen, and a place I feel I've a right to, I will do precisely what you\ntell me or die trying.”\n\nHe spoke so convincingly that McLean believed, although in his heart he\nknew that to employ a stranger would be wretched business for a man with\nthe interests he had involved.\n\n“Very well,” the Boss found himself answering, “I will enter you on my\npay rolls. We'll have supper, and then I will provide you with clean\nclothing, wading-boots, the wire-mending apparatus, and a revolver.\nThe first thing in the morning, I will take you the length of the trail\nmyself and explain fully what I want done. All I ask of you is to come\nto me at once at the south camp and tell me as a man if you find this\njob too hard for you. It will not surprise me. It is work that few men\nwould perform faithfully. What name shall I put down?”\n\nFreckles' gaze never left McLean's face, and the Boss saw the swift\nspasm of pain that swept his lonely, sensitive features.\n\n“I haven't any name,” he said stubbornly, “no more than one somebody\nclapped on to me when they put me on the Home books, with not the\nthought or care they'd name a house cat. I've seen how they enter those\npoor little abandoned devils often enough to know. What they called me\nis no more my name than it is yours. I don't know what mine is, and I\nnever will; but I am going to be your man and do your work, and I'll be\nglad to answer to any name you choose to call me. Won't you please be\ngiving me a name, Mr. McLean?”\n\nThe Boss wheeled abruptly and began stacking his books. What he was\nthinking was probably what any other gentleman would have thought in the\ncircumstances. With his eyes still downcast, and in a voice harsh with\nhuskiness, he spoke.\n\n“I will tell you what we will do, my lad,” he said. “My father was my\nideal man, and I loved him better than any other I have ever known. He\nwent out five years ago, but that he would have been proud to leave you\nhis name I firmly believe. If I give to you the name of my nearest kin\nand the man I loved best--will that do?”\n\nFreckles' rigid attitude relaxed suddenly. His head dropped, and big\ntears splashed on the soiled calico shirt. McLean was not surprised at\nthe silence, for he found that talking came none too easily just then.\n\n“All right,” he said. “I will write it on the roll--James Ross McLean.”\n\n“Thank you mightily,” said Freckles. “That makes me feel almost as if I\nbelonged, already.”\n\n“You do,” said McLean. “Until someone armed with every right comes to\nclaim you, you are mine. Now, come and take a bath, have some supper,\nand go to bed.”\n\nAs Freckles followed into the lights and sounds of the camp, his heart\nand soul were singing for joy.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER II\n\nWherein Freckles Proves His Mettle and Finds Friends\n\nNext morning found Freckles in clean, whole clothing, fed, and rested.\nThen McLean outfitted him and gave him careful instruction in the use of\nhis weapon. The Boss showed him around the timber-line, and engaged him\na place to board with the family of his head teamster, Duncan, whom he\nhad brought from Scotland with him, and who lived in a small clearing\nhe was working out between the swamp and the corduroy. When the gang was\nstarted for the south camp, Freckles was left to guard a fortune in the\nLimberlost. That he was under guard himself those first weeks he never\nknew.\n\nEach hour was torture to the boy. The restricted life of a great\ncity orphanage was the other extreme of the world compared with the\nLimberlost. He was afraid for his life every minute. The heat was\nintense. The heavy wading-boots rubbed his feet until they bled. He was\nsore and stiff from his long tramp and outdoor exposure. The seven\nmiles of trail was agony at every step. He practiced at night, under the\ndirection of Duncan, until he grew sure in the use of his revolver. He\ncut a stout hickory cudgel, with a knot on the end as big as his fist;\nthis never left his hand. What he thought in those first days he himself\ncould not recall clearly afterward.\n\nHis heart stood still every time he saw the beautiful marsh-grass begin\na sinuous waving AGAINST the play of the wind, as McLean had told him it\nwould. He bolted half a mile with the first boom of the bittern, and his\nhat lifted with every yelp of the sheitpoke. Once he saw a lean, shadowy\nform following him, and fired his revolver. Then he was frightened worse\nthan ever for fear it might have been Duncan's collie.\n\nThe first afternoon that he found his wires down, and he was compelled\nto plunge knee deep into the black swamp-muck to restring them, he\nbecame so ill from fear and nervousness that he scarcely could control\nhis shaking hand to do the work. With every step, he felt that he would\nmiss secure footing and be swallowed in that clinging sea of blackness.\nIn dumb agony he plunged forward, clinging to the posts and trees until\nhe had finished restringing and testing the wire. He had consumed\nmuch time. Night closed in. The Limberlost stirred gently, then shook\nherself, growled, and awoke around him.\n\nThere seemed to be a great owl hooting from every hollow tree, and\na little one screeching from every knothole. The bellowing of big\nbullfrogs was not sufficiently deafening to shut out the wailing of\nwhip-poor-wills that seemed to come from every bush. Nighthawks swept\npast him with their shivering cry, and bats struck his face. A prowling\nwildcat missed its catch and screamed with rage. A straying fox bayed\nincessantly for its mate.\n\nThe hair on the back of Freckles' neck arose as bristles, and his knees\nwavered beneath him. He could not see whether the dreaded snakes were on\nthe trail, or, in the pandemonium, hear the rattle for which McLean had\ncautioned him to listen. He stood motionless in an agony of fear. His\nbreath whistled between his teeth. The perspiration ran down his face\nand body in little streams.\n\nSomething big, black, and heavy came crashing through the swamp close\nto him, and with a yell of utter panic Freckles ran--how far he did not\nknow; but at last he gained control over himself and retraced his steps.\nHis jaws set stiffly and the sweat dried on his body. When he reached\nthe place from which he had started to run, he turned and with measured\nsteps made his way down the line. After a time he realized that he was\nonly walking, so he faced that sea of horrors again. When he came toward\nthe corduroy, the cudgel fell to test the wire at each step.\n\nSounds that curdled his blood seemed to encompass him, and shapes of\nterror to draw closer and closer. Fear had so gained the mastery that he\ndid not dare look behind him; and just when he felt that he would fall\ndead before he ever reached the clearing, came Duncan's rolling call:\n“Freckles! Freckles!” A shuddering sob burst in the boy's dry throat;\nbut he only told Duncan that finding the wire down had caused the delay.\n\nThe next morning he started on time. Day after day, with his heart\npounding, he ducked, dodged, ran when he could, and fought when he was\nbrought to bay. If he ever had an idea of giving up, no one knew it; for\nhe clung to his job without the shadow of wavering. All these things, in\nso far as he guessed them, Duncan, who had been set to watch the first\nweeks of Freckles' work, carried to the Boss at the south camp; but\nthe innermost, exquisite torture of the thing the big Scotchman never\nguessed, and McLean, with his finer perceptions, came only a little\ncloser.\n\nAfter a few weeks, when Freckles learned that he was still living, that\nhe had a home, and the very first money he ever had possessed was safe\nin his pockets, he began to grow proud. He yet side-stepped, dodged, and\nhurried to avoid being late again, but he was gradually developing the\nfearlessness that men ever acquire of dangers to which they are hourly\naccustomed.\n\nHis heart seemed to be leaping when his first rattler disputed the trail\nwith him, but he mustered courage to attack it with his club. After its\nhead had been crushed, he mastered an Irishman's inborn repugnance for\nsnakes sufficiently to cut off its rattles to show Duncan. With this\nvictory, his greatest fear of them was gone.\n\nThen he began to realize that with the abundance of food in the swamp,\nflesh-hunters would not come on the trail and attack him, and he had his\nrevolver for defence if they did. He soon learned to laugh at the big,\nfloppy birds that made horrible noises. One day, watching behind a tree,\nhe saw a crane solemnly performing a few measures of a belated nuptial\nsong-and-dance with his mate. Realizing that it was intended in\ntenderness, no matter how it appeared, the lonely, starved heart of the\nboy sympathized with them.\n\nBefore the first month passed, he was fairly easy about his job; by the\nnext he rather liked it. Nature can be trusted to work her own miracle\nin the heart of any man whose daily task keeps him alone among her\nsights, sounds, and silences.\n\nWhen day after day the only thing that relieved his utter loneliness was\nthe companionship of the birds and beasts of the swamp, it was the\nmost natural thing in the world that Freckles should turn to them for\nfriendship. He began by instinctively protecting the weak and helpless.\nHe was astonished at the quickness with which they became accustomed to\nhim and the disregard they showed for his movements, when they learned\nthat he was not a hunter, while the club he carried was used more\nfrequently for their benefit than his own. He scarcely could believe\nwhat he saw.\n\nFrom the effort to protect the birds and animals, it was only a short\nstep to the possessive feeling, and with that sprang the impulse to\ncaress and provide. Through fall, when brooding was finished and the\nupland birds sought the swamp in swarms to feast on its seeds and\nberries, Freckles was content with watching them and speculating about\nthem. Outside of half a dozen of the very commonest they were strangers\nto him. The likeness of their actions to humanity was an hourly\nsurprise.\n\nWhen black frost began stripping the Limberlost, cutting the ferns,\nshearing the vines from the trees, mowing the succulent green things\nof the swale, and setting the leaves swirling down, he watched the\ndeparting troops of his friends with dismay. He began to realize that he\nwould be left alone. He made especial efforts toward friendliness with\nthe hope that he could induce some of them to stay. It was then that he\nconceived the idea of carrying food to the birds; for he saw that they\nwere leaving for lack of it; but he could not stop them. Day after day,\nflocks gathered and departed: by the time the first snow whitened\nhis trail around the Limberlost, there were left only the little\nblack-and-white juncos, the sapsuckers, yellow-hammers, a few patriarchs\namong the flaming cardinals, the blue jays, the crows, and the quail.\n\nThen Freckles began his wizard work. He cleared a space of swale, and\ntwice a day he spread a birds' banquet. By the middle of December the\nstrong winds of winter had beaten most of the seed from the grass and\nbushes. The snow fell, covering the swamp, and food was very scarce and\ndifficult to find. The birds scarcely waited until Freckles' back was\nturned to attack his provisions. In a few weeks they flew toward the\nclearing to meet him. During the bitter weather of January they came\nhalfway to the cabin every morning, and fluttered around him as\ndoves all the way to the feeding-ground. Before February they were so\naccustomed to him, and so hunger-driven, that they would perch on\nhis head and shoulders, and the saucy jays would try to pry into his\npockets.\n\nThen Freckles added to wheat and crumbs, every scrap of refuse food he\ncould find at the cabin. He carried to his pets the parings of apples,\nturnips, potatoes, stray cabbage-leaves, and carrots, and tied to the\nbushes meat-bones having scraps of fat and gristle. One morning, coming\nto his feeding-ground unusually early, he found a gorgeous cardinal\nand a rabbit side by side sociably nibbling a cabbage-leaf, and that\ninstantly gave to him the idea of cracking nuts, from the store he had\ngathered for Duncan's children, for the squirrels, in the effort to add\nthem to his family. Soon he had them coming--red, gray, and black; then\nhe became filled with a vast impatience that he did not know their names\nor habits.\n\nSo the winter passed. Every week McLean rode to the Limberlost; never on\nthe same day or at the same hour. Always he found Freckles at his work,\nfaithful and brave, no matter how severe the weather.\n\nThe boy's earnings constituted his first money; and when the Boss\nexplained to him that he could leave them safe at a bank and carry away\na scrap of paper that represented the amount, he went straight on every\npayday and made his deposit, keeping out barely what was necessary for\nhis board and clothing. What he wanted to do with his money he did not\nknow, but it gave to him a sense of freedom and power to feel that it\nwas there--it was his and he could have it when he chose. In imitation\nof McLean, he bought a small pocket account-book, in which he carefully\nset down every dollar he earned and every penny he spent. As his\nexpenses were small and the Boss paid him generously, it was astonishing\nhow his little hoard grew.\n\nThat winter held the first hours of real happiness in Freckles' life. He\nwas free. He was doing a man's work faithfully, through every rigor of\nrain, snow, and blizzard. He was gathering a wonderful strength of body,\npaying his way, and saving money. Every man of the gang and of that\nlocality knew that he was under the protection of McLean, who was\na power, this had the effect of smoothing Freckles' path in many\ndirections.\n\nMrs. Duncan showed him that individual kindness for which his hungry\nheart was longing. She had a hot drink ready for him when he came from\na freezing day on the trail. She knit him a heavy mitten for his left\nhand, and devised a way to sew and pad the right sleeve that protected\nthe maimed arm in bitter weather. She patched his clothing--frequently\ntorn by the wire--and saved kitchen scraps for his birds, not because\nshe either knew or cared anything about them, but because she herself\nwas close enough to the swamp to be touched by its utter loneliness.\nWhen Duncan laughed at her for this, she retorted: “My God, mannie, if\nFreckles hadna the birds and the beasts he would be always alone. It was\nnever meant for a human being to be so solitary. He'd get touched in the\nhead if he hadna them to think for and to talk to.”\n\n“How much answer do ye think he gets to his talkin', lass?” laughed\nDuncan.\n\n“He gets the answer that keeps the eye bright, the heart happy, and the\nfeet walking faithful the rough path he's set them in,” answered Mrs.\nDuncan earnestly.\n\nDuncan walked away appearing very thoughtful. The next morning he gave\nan ear from the corn he was shelling for his chickens to Freckles, and\ntold him to carry it to his wild chickens in the Limberlost. Freckles\nlaughed delightedly.\n\n“Me chickens!” he said. “Why didn't I ever think of that before? Of\ncourse they are! They are just little, brightly colored cocks and hens!\nBut 'wild' is no good. What would you say to me 'wild chickens' being a\ngood deal tamer than yours here in your yard?”\n\n“Hoot, lad!” cried Duncan.\n\n“Make yours light on your head and eat out of your hands and pockets,”\n challenged Freckles.\n\n“Go and tell your fairy tales to the wee people! They're juist brash on\nbelievin' things,” said Duncan. “Ye canna invent any story too big to\nstop them from callin' for a bigger.”\n\n“I dare you to come see!” retorted Freckles.\n\n“Take ye!” said Duncan. “If ye make juist ane bird licht on your heid\nor eat frae your hand, ye are free to help yoursel' to my corn-crib and\nwheat bin the rest of the winter.”\n\nFreckles sprang in air and howled in glee.\n\n“Oh, Duncan! You're too, aisy” he cried. “When will you come?”\n\n“I'll come next Sabbath,” said Duncan. “And I'll believe the birds of\nthe Limberlost are tame as barnyard fowl when I see it, and no sooner!”\n\nAfter that Freckles always spoke of the birds as his chickens, and the\nDuncans followed his example. The very next Sabbath, Duncan, with his\nwife and children, followed Freckles to the swamp. They saw a sight so\nwonderful it will keep them talking all the remainder of their lives,\nand make them unfailing friends of all the birds.\n\nFreckles' chickens were awaiting him at the edge of the clearing. They\ncut the frosty air around his head into curves and circles of crimson,\nblue, and black. They chased each other from Freckles, and swept so\nclosely themselves that they brushed him with their outspread wings.\n\nAt their feeding-ground Freckles set down his old pail of scraps and\nswept the snow from a small level space with a broom improvised of\ntwigs. As soon as his back was turned, the birds clustered over the\nfood, snatching scraps to carry to the nearest bushes. Several of the\nboldest, a big crow and a couple of jays, settled on the rim and feasted\nat leisure, while a cardinal, that hesitated to venture, fumed and\nscolded from a twig overhead.\n\nThen Freckles scattered his store. At once the ground resembled the\nspread mantle of Montezuma, except that this mass of gaily colored\nfeathers was on the backs of living birds. While they feasted, Duncan\ngripped his wife's arm and stared in astonishment; for from the bushes\nand dry grass, with gentle cheeping and queer, throaty chatter, as if to\nencourage each other, came flocks of quail. Before anyone saw it arrive,\na big gray rabbit sat in the midst of the feast, contentedly gnawing a\ncabbage-leaf.\n\n“Weel, I be drawed on!” came Mrs. Duncan's tense whisper.\n\n“Shu-shu,” cautioned Duncan.\n\nLastly Freckles removed his cap. He began filling it with handfuls of\nwheat from his pockets. In a swarm the grain-eaters arose around him as\na flock of tame pigeons. They perched on his arms and the cap, and in\nthe stress of hunger, forgetting all caution, a brilliant cock cardinal\nand an equally gaudy jay fought for a perching-place on his head.\n\n“Weel, I'm beat,” muttered Duncan, forgetting the silence imposed on his\nwife. “I'll hae to give in. 'Seein' is believin'. A man wad hae to see\nthat to believe it. We mauna let the Boss miss that sight, for it's a\nchance will no likely come twice in a life. Everything is snowed under\nand thae craturs near starved, but trustin' Freckles that complete they\nare tamer than our chickens. Look hard, bairns!” he whispered. “Ye winna\nsee the like o' yon again, while God lets ye live. Notice their color\nagainst the ice and snow, and the pretty skippin' ways of them! And\nspunky! Weel, I'm heat fair!”\n\nFreckles emptied his cap, turned his pockets and scattered his last\ngrain. Then he waved his watching friends good-bye and started down the\ntimber-line.\n\nA week later, Duncan and Freckles arose from breakfast to face the\nbitterest morning of the winter. When Freckles, warmly capped and\ngloved, stepped to the corner of the kitchen for his scrap-pail, he\nfound a big pan of steaming boiled wheat on the top of it. He wheeled to\nMrs. Duncan with a shining face.\n\n“Were you fixing this warm food for me chickens or yours?” he asked.\n\n“It's for yours, Freckles,” she said. “I was afeared this cold weather\nthey wadna lay good without a warm bite now and then.”\n\nDuncan laughed as he stepped to the other room for his pipe; but\nFreckles faced Mrs. Duncan with a trace of every pang of starved\nmother-hunger he ever had suffered written large on his homely,\nsplotched, narrow features.\n\n“Oh, how I wish you were my mother!” he cried.\n\nMrs. Duncan attempted an echo of her husband's laugh.\n\n“Lord love the lad!” she exclaimed. “Why, Freckles, are ye no bright\nenough to learn without being taught by a woman that I am your mither?\nIf a great man like yoursel' dinna ken that, learn it now and ne'er\nforget it. Ance a woman is the wife of any man, she becomes wife to all\nmen for having had the wifely experience she kens! Ance a man-child has\nbeaten his way to life under the heart of a woman, she is mither to\nall men, for the hearts of mithers are everywhere the same. Bless ye,\nladdie, I am your mither!”\n\nShe tucked the coarse scarf she had knit for him closer over his chest\nand pulled his cap lower over his ears, but Freckles, whipping it\noff and holding it under his arm, caught her rough, reddened hand and\npressed it to his lips in a long kiss. Then he hurried away to hide the\nhappy, embarrassing tears that were coming straight from his swelling\nheart.\n\nMrs. Duncan, sobbing unrestrainedly, swept into the adjoining room and\nthrew herself into Duncan's arms.\n\n“Oh, the puir lad!” she wailed. “Oh, the puir mither-hungry lad! He\nbreaks my heart!”\n\nDuncan's arms closed convulsively around his wife. With a big, brown\nhand he lovingly stroked her rough, sorrel hair.\n\n“Sarah, you're a guid woman!” he said. “You're a michty guid woman! Ye\nhae a way o' speakin' out at times that's like the inspired prophets of\nthe Lord. If that had been put to me, now, I'd 'a' felt all I kent how\nto and been keen enough to say the richt thing; but dang it, I'd 'a'\nstuttered and stammered and got naething out that would ha' done onybody\na mite o' good. But ye, Sarah! Did ye see his face, woman? Ye sent him\noff lookin' leke a white light of holiness had passed ower and settled\non him. Ye sent the lad away too happy for mortal words, Sarah. And\nye made me that proud o' ye! I wouldna trade ye an' my share o' the\nLimberlost with ony king ye could mention.”\n\nHe relaxed his clasp, and setting a heavy hand on each shoulder, he\nlooked straight into her eyes.\n\n“Ye're prime, Sarah! Juist prime!” he said.\n\nSarah Duncan stood alone in the middle of her two-roomed log cabin and\nlifted a bony, clawlike pair of hands, reddened by frequent immersion\nin hot water, cracked and chafed by exposure to cold, black-lined by\nconstant battle with swamp-loam, calloused with burns, and stared at\nthem wonderingly.\n\n“Pretty-lookin' things ye are!” she whispered. “But ye hae juist been\nkissed. And by such a man! Fine as God ever made at His verra best.\nDuncan wouldna trade wi' a king! Na! Nor I wadna trade with a queen wi'\na palace, an' velvet gowns, an' diamonds big as hazelnuts, an' a hundred\nvisitors a day into the bargain. Ye've been that honored I'm blest if\nI can bear to souse ye in dish-water. Still, that kiss winna come off!\nNaething can take it from me, for it's mine till I dee. Lord, if I amna\nproud! Kisses on these old claws! Weel, I be drawed on!”\n\n\n\nCHAPTER III\n\nWherein a Feather Falls and a Soul Is Born\n\nSo Freckles fared through the bitter winter. He was very happy. He\nhad hungered for freedom, love, and appreciation so long! He had been\nunspeakably lonely at the Home; and the utter loneliness of a great\ndesert or forest is not so difficult to endure as the loneliness of\nbeing constantly surrounded by crowds of people who do not care in the\nleast whether one is living or dead.\n\nAll through the winter Freckles' entire energy was given to keeping up\nhis lines and his “chickens” from freezing or starving. When the first\nbreath of spring touched the Limberlost, and the snow receded before it;\nwhen the catkins began to bloom; when there came a hint of green to the\ntrees, bushes, and swale; when the rushes lifted their heads, and the\npulse of the newly resurrected season beat strongly in the heart of\nnature, something new stirred in the breast of the boy.\n\nNature always levies her tribute. Now she laid a powerful hand on the\nsoul of Freckles, to which the boy's whole being responded, though\nhe had not the least idea what was troubling him. Duncan accepted his\nwife's theory that it was a touch of spring fever, but Freckles knew\nbetter. He never had been so well. Clean, hot, and steady the blood\npulsed in his veins. He was always hungry, and his most difficult work\ntired him not at all. For long months, without a single intermission,\nhe had tramped those seven miles of trail twice each day, through every\nconceivable state of weather. With the heavy club he gave his wires a\nsure test, and between sections, first in play, afterward to keep his\ncirculation going, he had acquired the skill of an expert drum major.\nIn his work there was exercise for every muscle of his body each hour of\nthe day, at night a bath, wholesome food, and sound sleep in a room that\nnever knew fire. He had gained flesh and color, and developed a greater\nstrength and endurance than anyone ever could have guessed.\n\nNor did the Limberlost contain last year's terrors. He had been with\nher in her hour of desolation, when stripped bare and deserted, she had\nstood shivering, as if herself afraid. He had made excursions into the\ninterior until he was familiar with every path and road that ever\nhad been cut. He had sounded the depths of her deepest pools, and had\nlearned why the trees grew so magnificently. He had found that places\nof swamp and swale were few compared with miles of solid timber-land,\nconcealed by summer's luxuriant undergrowth.\n\nThe sounds that at first had struck cold fear into his soul he now knew\nhad left on wing and silent foot at the approach of winter. As flock\nafter flock of the birds returned and he recognized the old echoes\nreawakening, he found to his surprise that he had been lonely for\nthem and was hailing their return with great joy. All his fears were\nforgotten. Instead, he was possessed of an overpowering desire to know\nwhat they were, to learn where they had been, and whether they would\nmake friends with him as the winter birds had done; and if they did,\nwould they be as fickle? For, with the running sap, creeping worm, and\nwinging bug, most of Freckles' “chickens” had deserted him, entered the\nswamp, and feasted to such a state of plethora on its store that they\ncared little for his supply, so that in the strenuous days of mating and\nnest-building the boy was deserted.\n\nHe chafed at the birds' ingratitude, but he found speedy consolation in\nwatching and befriending the newcomers. He surely would have been proud\nand highly pleased if he had known that many of the former inhabitants\nof the interior swamp now grouped their nests beside the timber-line\nsolely for the sake of his protection and company.\n\nThe yearly resurrection of the Limberlost is a mighty revival. Freckles\nstood back and watched with awe and envy the gradual reclothing and\nrepopulation of the swamp. Keen-eyed and alert through danger and\nloneliness, he noted every stage of development, from the first piping\nfrog and unsheathing bud, to full leafage and the return of the last\nmigrant.\n\nThe knowledge of his complete loneliness and utter insignificance was\nhourly thrust upon him. He brooded and fretted until he was in a fever;\nyet he never guessed the cause. He was filled with a vast impatience, a\nlonging that he scarcely could endure.\n\nIt was June by the zodiac, June by the Limberlost, and by every delight\nof a newly resurrected season it should have been June in the hearts of\nall men. Yet Freckles scowled darkly as he came down the trail, and the\nrunning TAP, TAP that tested the sagging wire and telegraphed word\nof his coming to his furred and feathered friends of the swamp, this\nmorning carried the story of his discontent a mile ahead of him.\n\nFreckles' special pet, a dainty, yellow-coated, black-sleeved, cock\ngoldfinch, had remained on the wire for several days past the bravest\nof all; and Freckles, absorbed with the cunning and beauty of the tiny\nfellow, never guessed that he was being duped. For the goldfinch was\nskipping, flirting, and swinging for the express purpose of so holding\nhis attention that he would not look up and see a small cradle of\nthistledown and wool perilously near his head. In the beginning of\nbrooding, the spunky little homesteader had clung heroically to the wire\nwhen he was almost paralyzed with fright. When day after day passed\nand brought only softly whistled repetitions of his call, a handful of\ncrumbs on the top of a locust line-post, and gently worded coaxings, he\ngrew in confidence. Of late he had sung and swung during the passing of\nFreckles, who, not dreaming of the nest and the solemn-eyed little hen\nso close above, thought himself unusually gifted in his power to attract\nthe birds. This morning the goldfinch scarcely could believe his ears,\nand clung to the wire until an unusually vicious rap sent him spinning a\nfoot in air, and his “PTSEET” came with a squall of utter panic.\n\nThe wires were ringing with a story the birds could not translate, and\nFreckles was quite as ignorant of the trouble as they.\n\nA peculiar movement beneath a small walnut tree caught his attention.\nHe stopped to investigate. There was an unusually large Luna cocoon, and\nthe moth was bursting the upper end in its struggles to reach light and\nair. Freckles stood and stared.\n\n“There's something in there trying to get out,” he muttered. “Wonder if\nI could help it? Guess I best not be trying. If I hadn't happened along,\nthere wouldn't have been anyone to do anything, and maybe I'd only be\nhurting it. It's--it's----Oh, skaggany! It's just being born!”\n\nFreckles gasped with surprise. The moth cleared the opening, and with\nmany wabblings and contortions climbed up the tree. He stared speechless\nwith amazement as the moth crept around a limb and clung to the under\nside. There was a big pursy body, almost as large as his thumb, and of\nthe very snowiest white that Freckles ever had seen. There was a band\nof delicate lavender across its forehead, and its feet were of the same\ncolour; there were antlers, like tiny, straw-colored ferns, on its head,\nand from its shoulders hung the crumpled wet wings. As Freckles gazed,\ntense with astonishment, he saw that these were expanding, drooping,\ntaking on color, and small, oval markings were beginning to show.\n\nThe minutes passed. Freckles' steady gaze never wavered. Without\nrealizing it, he was trembling with eagerness and anxiety. As he saw\nwhat was taking place, “It's going to fly,” he breathed in hushed\nwonder. The morning sun fell on the moth and dried its velvet down,\nwhile the warm air made it fluffy. The rapidly growing wings began to\nshow the most delicate green, with lavender fore-ribs, transparent,\neye-shaped markings, edged with lines of red, tan, and black, and long,\ncrisp trailers.\n\nFreckles was whispering to himself for fear of disturbing the moth. It\nbegan a systematic exercise of raising and lowering its exquisite wings\nto dry them and to establish circulation. The boy realized that soon it\nwould be able to spread them and sail away. His long-coming soul sent up\nits first shivering cry.\n\n“I don't know what it is! Oh, I wish I knew! How I wish I knew! It must\nbe something grand! It can't be a butterfly! It's away too big. Oh, I\nwish there was someone to tell me what it is!”\n\nHe climbed on the locust post, and balancing himself with the wire,\nheld a finger in the line of the moth's advance up the twig. It\nunhesitatingly climbed on, so he stepped to the path, holding it to the\nlight and examining it closely. Then he held it in the shade and turned\nit, gloating over its markings and beautiful coloring. When he held the\nmoth to the limb, it climbed on, still waving those magnificent wings.\n\n“My, but I'd like to be staying with you!” he said. “But if I was to\nstand here all day you couldn't grow any prettier than you are right\nnow, and I wouldn't grow smart enough to tell what you are. I suppose\nthere's someone who knows. Of course there is! Mr. McLean said there\nwere people who knew every leaf, bird, and flower in the Limberlost. Oh\nLord! How I wish You'd be telling me just this one thing!”\n\nThe goldfinch had ventured back to the wire, for there was his mate,\nonly a few inches above the man-creature's head; and indeed, he simply\nmust not be allowed to look up, so the brave little fellow rocked on the\nwire and piped, as he had done every day for a week: “SEE ME? SEE ME?”\n\n“See you! Of course I see you,” growled Freckles. “I see you day after\nday, and what good is it doing me? I might see you every morning for a\nyear, and then not be able to be telling anyone about it. 'Seen a bird\nwith black silk wings--little, and yellow as any canary.' That's as far\nas I'd get. What you doing here, anyway? Have you a mate? What's your\nname? 'See you?' I reckon I see you; but I might as well be blind, for\nany good it's doing me!”\n\nFreckles impatiently struck the wire. With a screech of fear, the\ngoldfinch fled precipitately. His mate arose from the nest with a\nwhirr--Freckles looked up and saw it.\n\n“O--ho!” he cried. “So THAT'S what you are doing here! You have a\nwife. And so close my head I have been mighty near wearing a bird on my\nbonnet, and never knew it!”\n\nFreckles laughed at his own jest, while in better humor he climbed to\nexamine the neat, tiny cradle and its contents. The hen darted at him in\na frenzy. “Now, where do you come in?” he demanded, when he saw that she\nwas not similar to the goldfinch.\n\n“You be clearing out of here! This is none of your fry. This is the nest\nof me little, yellow friend of the wire, and you shan't be touching it.\nDon't blame you for wanting to see, though. My, but it's a fine nest and\nbeauties of eggs. Will you be keeping away, or will I fire this stick at\nyou?”\n\nFreckles dropped to the trail. The hen darted to the nest and settled on\nit with a tender, coddling movement. He of the yellow coat flew to the\nedge to make sure that everything was right. It would have been plain to\nthe veriest novice that they were partners in that cradle.\n\n“Well, I'll be switched!” muttered Freckles. “If that ain't both their\nnest! And he's yellow and she's green, or she's yellow and he's green.\nOf course, I don't know, and I haven't any way to find out, but it's\nplain as the nose on your face that they are both ready to be fighting\nfor that nest, so, of course, they belong. Doesn't that beat you? Say,\nthat's what's been sticking me all of this week on that grass nest in\nthe thorn tree down the line. One day a blue bird is setting, so I think\nit is hers. The next day a brown bird is on, and I chase it off because\nthe nest is blue's. Next day the brown bird is on again, and I let her\nbe, because I think it must be hers. Next day, be golly, blue's on, and\noff I send her because it's brown's; and now, I bet my hat, it's both\ntheir nest and I've only been bothering them and making a big fool of\nmesilf. Pretty specimen I am, pretending to be a friend to the birds,\nand so blamed ignorant I don't know which ones go in pairs, and blue and\nbrown are a pair, of course, if yellow and green are--and there's the\nred birds! I never thought of them! He's red and she's gray--and now\nI want to be knowing, are they all different? Why no! Of course, they\nain't! There's the jays all blue, and the crows all black.”\n\nThe tide of Freckles' discontent welled until he almost choked with\nanger and chagrin. He plodded down the trail, scowling blackly and\nviciously spanging the wire. At the finches' nest he left the line\nand peered into the thorn tree. There was no bird brooding. He pressed\ncloser to take a peep at the snowy, spotless little eggs he had found so\nbeautiful, when at the slight noise up raised four tiny baby heads with\nwide-open mouths, uttering hunger cries. Freckles stepped back. The\nbrown bird alighted on the edge and closed one cavity with a wiggling\ngreen worm, while not two minutes later the blue filled another with\na white. That settled it. The blue and brown were mates. Once again\nFreckles repeated his “How I wish I knew!”\n\nAround the bridge spanning Sleepy Snake Creek the swale spread widely,\nthe timber was scattering, and willows, rushes, marsh-grass, and\nsplendid wild flowers grew abundantly. Here lazy, big, black water\nsnakes, for which the creek was named, sunned on the bushes, wild ducks\nand grebe chattered, cranes and herons fished, and muskrats plowed the\nbank in queer, rolling furrows. It was always a place full of interest,\nso Freckles loved to linger on the bridge, watching the marsh and water\npeople. He also transacted affairs of importance with the wild flowers\nand sweet marsh-grass. He enjoyed splashing through the shallow pools on\neither side of the bridge.\n\nThen, too, where the creek entered the swamp was a place of unusual\nbeauty. The water spread in darksome, mossy, green pools. Water-plants\nand lilies grew luxuriantly, throwing up large, rank, green leaves.\nNowhere else in the Limberlost could be found frog-music to equal\nthat of the mouth of the creek. The drumming and piping rolled in\nnever-ending orchestral effect, while the full chorus rang to its\naccompaniment throughout the season.\n\nFreckles slowly followed the path leading from the bridge to the line.\nIt was the one spot at which he might relax his vigilance. The boldest\ntimber thief the swamp ever had known would not have attempted to enter\nit by the mouth of the creek, on account of the water and because there\nwas no protection from surrounding trees. He was bending the rank grass\nwith his cudgel, and thinking of the shade the denser swamp afforded,\nwhen he suddenly dodged sidewise; the cudgel whistled sharply through\nthe air and Freckles sprang back.\n\nFrom the clear sky above him, first level with his face, then skimming,\ndipping, tilting, whirling until it struck, quill down, in the path\nin front of him, came a glossy, iridescent, big black feather. As it\ntouched the ground, Freckles snatched it up with almost a continuous\nmovement facing the sky. There was not a tree of any size in a large\nopen space. There was no wind to carry it. From the clear sky it had\nfallen, and Freckles, gazing eagerly into the arch of June blue with a\nfew lazy clouds floating high in the sea of ether, had neither mind nor\nknowledge to dream of a bird hanging as if frozen there. He turned the\nbig quill questioningly, and again his awed eyes swept the sky.\n\n“A feather dropped from Heaven!” he breathed reverently. “Are the holy\nangels moulting? But no; if they were, it would be white. Maybe all the\nangels are not for being white. What if the angels of God are white and\nthose of the devil are black? But a black one has no business up there.\nMaybe some poor black angel is so tired of being punished it's for\nslipping to the gates, beating its wings trying to make the Master\nhear!”\n\nAgain and again Freckles searched the sky, but there was no answering\ngleam of golden gates, no form of sailing bird; then he went slowly\non his way, turning the feather and wondering about it. It was a wing\nquill, eighteen inches in length, with a heavy spine, gray at the base,\nshading to jet black at the tip, and it caught the play of the sun's\nrays in slanting gleams of green and bronze. Again Freckles' “old man\nof the sea” sat sullen and heavy on his shoulders and weighted him down\nuntil his step lagged and his heart ached.\n\n“Where did it come from? What is it? Oh, how I wish I knew!” he kept\nrepeating as he turned and studied the feather, with almost unseeing\neyes, so intently was he thinking.\n\nBefore him spread a large, green pool, filled with rotting logs and\nleaves, bordered with delicate ferns and grasses among which lifted the\ncreamy spikes of the arrow-head, the blue of water-hyacinth, and the\ndelicate yellow of the jewel-flower. As Freckles leaned, handling the\nfeather and staring at it, then into the depths of the pool, he once\nmore gave voice to his old query: “I wonder what it is!”\n\nStraight across from him, couched in the mosses of a soggy old log, a\nbig green bullfrog, with palpitant throat and batting eyes, lifted his\nhead and bellowed in answer. “FIN' DOUT! FIN' DOUT!”\n\n“Wha--what's that?” stammered Freckles, almost too much bewildered to\nspeak. “I--I know you are only a bullfrog, but, be jabbers, that sounded\nmightily like speech. Wouldn't you please to be saying it over?”\n\nThe bullfrog cuddled contentedly in the ooze. Then suddenly he lifted\nhis voice, and, as an imperative drumbeat, rolled it again: “FIN' DOUT!\nFIN' DOUT! FIN DOUT!”\n\nFreckles had the answer. Something seemed to snap in his brain. There\nwas a wavering flame before his eyes. Then his mind cleared. His\nhead lifted in a new poise, his shoulders squared, while his spine\nstraightened. The agony was over. His soul floated free. Freckles came\ninto his birthright.\n\n“Before God, I will!” He uttered the oath so impressively that the\nrecording angel never winced as he posted it in the prayer column.\n\nFreckles set his hat over the top of one of the locust posts used\nbetween trees to hold up the wire while he fastened the feather securely\nin the band. Then he started down the line, talking to himself as men\nwho have worked long alone always fall into the habit of doing.\n\n“What a fool I have been!” he muttered. “Of course that's what I have to\ndo! There wouldn't likely anybody be doing it for me. Of course I can!\nWhat am I a man for? If I was a four-footed thing of the swamp, maybe I\ncouldn't; but a man can do anything if he's the grit to work hard enough\nand stick at it, Mr. McLean is always saying, and here's the way I am to\ndo it. He said, too, that there were people that knew everything in the\nswamp. Of course they have written books! The thing for me to be doing\nis to quit moping and be buying some. Never bought a book in me life,\nor anything else of much account, for that matter. Oh, ain't I glad I\ndidn't waste me money! I'll surely be having enough to get a few. Let me\nsee.”\n\nFreckles sat on a log, took his pencil and account-book, and figured\non a back page. He had walked the timber-line ten months. His pay\nwas thirty dollars a month, and his board cost him eight. That left\ntwenty-two dollars a month, and his clothing had cost him very little.\nAt the least he had two hundred dollars in the bank. He drew a deep\nbreath and smiled at the sky with satisfaction.\n\n“I'll be having a book about all the birds, trees, flowers, butterflies,\nand----Yes, by gummy! I'll be having one about the frogs--if it takes\nevery cent I have,” he promised himself.\n\nHe put away the account-book, that was his most cherished possession,\ncaught up his stick, and started down the line. The even tap, tap, and\nthe cheery, gladsome whistle carried far ahead of him the message that\nFreckles was himself again.\n\nHe fell into a rapid pace, for he had lost time that morning; when he\nrounded the last curve he was almost running. There was a chance that\nthe Boss might be there for his weekly report.\n\nThen, wavering, flickering, darting here and there over the sweet\nmarsh-grass, came a large black shadow, sweeping so closely before him\nthat for the second time that morning Freckles dodged and sprang back.\nHe had seen some owls and hawks of the swamp that he thought might be\nclassed as large birds, but never anything like this, for six feet it\nspread its big, shining wings. Its strong feet could be seen drawn\namong its feathers. The sun glinted on its sharp, hooked beak. Its eyes\nglowed, caught the light, and seemed able to pierce the ground at his\nfeet. It cared no more for Freckles than if he had not been there; for\nit perched on a low tree, while a second later it awkwardly hopped to\nthe trunk of a lightning-riven elm, turned its back, and began searching\nthe blue.\n\nFreckles looked just in time to see a second shadow sweep the grass; and\nanother bird, a trifle smaller and not quite so brilliant in the light,\nslowly sailed down to perch beside the first. Evidently they were mates,\nfor with a queer, rolling hop the first-comer shivered his bronze wings,\nsidled to the new arrival, and gave her a silly little peck on her\nwing. Then he coquettishly drew away and ogled her. He lifted his head,\nwaddled from her a few steps, awkwardly ambled back, and gave her such\na simple sort of kiss on her beak that Freckles burst into a laugh, but\nclapped his hand over his mouth to stifle the sound.\n\nThe lover ducked and side-stepped a few feet. He spread his wings\nand slowly and softly waved them precisely as if he were fanning his\ncharmer, which was indeed the result he accomplished. Then a wave of\nuncontrollable tenderness moved him so he hobbled to his bombardment\nonce more. He faced her squarely this time, and turned his head from\nside to side with queer little jerks and indiscriminate peckings at her\nwings and head, and smirkings that really should have been irresistible.\nShe yawned and shuffled away indifferently. Freckles reached up, pulled\nthe quill from his hat, and looking from it to the birds, nodded in\nsettled conviction.\n\n“So you're me black angels, ye spalpeens! No wonder you didn't get in!\nBut I'll back you to come closer it than any other birds ever did. You\nfly higher than I can see. Have you picked the Limberlost for a good\nthing and come to try it? Well, you can be me chickens if you want to,\nbut I'm blest if you ain't cool for new ones. Why don't you take this\nstick for a gun and go skinning a mile?”\n\nFreckles broke into an unrestrained laugh, for the bird-lover was keen\nabout his courting, while evidently his mate was diffident. When he\napproached too boisterously, she relieved him of a goodly tuft of\nfeathers and sent him backward in a series of squirmy little jumps that\ngave the boy an idea of what had happened up-sky to send the falling\nfeather across his pathway.\n\n“Score one for the lady! I'll be umpiring this,” volunteered Freckles.\n\nWith a ravishing swagger, half-lifted wings, and deep, guttural hissing,\nthe lover approached again. He suddenly lifted his body, but she coolly\nrocked forward on the limb, glided gracefully beneath him, and slowly\nsailed into the Limberlost. He recovered himself and gazed after her in\nastonishment.\n\nFreckles hurried down the trail, shaking with laughter. When he neared\nthe path to the clearing and saw the Boss sitting motionless on the mare\nthat was the pride of his heart, the boy broke into a run.\n\n“Oh, Mr. McLean!” he cried. “I hope I haven't kept you waiting very\nlong! And the sun is getting hot! I have been so slow this morning! I\ncould have gone faster, only there were that many things to keep me, and\nI didn't know you would be here. I'll hurry after this. I've never had\nto be giving excuses before. The line wasn't down, and there wasn't a\nsign of trouble; it was other things that were making me late.”\n\nMcLean, smiling on the boy, immediately noticed the difference in him.\nThis flushed, panting, talkative lad was not the same creature who had\nsought him in despair and bitterness. He watched in wonder as Freckles\nmopped the perspiration from his forehead and began to laugh. Then,\nforgetting all his customary reserve with the Boss, the pent-up\nboyishness in the lad broke forth. With an eloquence of which he never\ndreamed he told his story. He talked with such enthusiasm that McLean\nnever took his eyes from his face or shifted in the saddle until he\ndescribed the strange bird-lover, and then the Boss suddenly bent over\nthe pommel and laughed with the boy.\n\nFreckles decorated his story with keen appreciation and rare touches\nof Irish wit and drollery that made it most interesting as well as very\nfunny. It was a first attempt at descriptive narration. With an inborn\ngift for striking the vital point, a naturalist's dawning enthusiasm for\nthe wonders of the Limberlost, and the welling joy of his newly found\nhappiness, he made McLean see the struggles of the moth and its freshly\npainted wings, the dainty, brilliant bird-mates of different colors, the\nfeather sliding through the clear air, the palpitant throat and batting\neyes of the frog; while his version of the big bird's courtship won for\nthe Boss the best laugh he had enjoyed for years.\n\n“They're in the middle of a swamp now” said Freckles. “Do you suppose\nthere is any chance of them staying with me chickens? If they do,\nthey'll be about the queerest I have; but I tell you, sir, I am finding\nsome plum good ones. There's a new kind over at the mouth of the creek\nthat uses its wings like feet and walks on all fours. It travels like a\nthrashing machine. There's another, tall as me waist, with a bill a\nfoot long, a neck near two, not the thickness of me wrist and an elegant\ncolor. He's some blue and gray, touched up with black, white, and brown.\nThe voice of him is such that if he'd be going up and standing beside\na tree and crying at it a few times he could be sawing it square off. I\ndon't know but it would be a good idea to try him on the gang, sir.”\n\nMcLean laughed. “Those must be blue herons, Freckles,” he said. “And\nit doesn't seem possible, but your description of the big black birds\nsounds like genuine black vultures. They are common enough in the South.\nI've seen them numerous around the lumber camps of Georgia, but I\nnever before heard of any this far north. They must be strays. You have\ndescribed perfectly our nearest equivalent to a branch of these birds\ncalled in Europe Pharaoh's Chickens, but if they are coming to the\nLimberlost they will have to drop Pharaoh and become Freckles' Chickens,\nlike the remainder of the birds; won't they? Or are they too odd and\nugly to interest you?”\n\n“Oh, not at all, at all!” cried Freckles, bursting into pure brogue in\nhis haste. “I don't know as I'd be calling them exactly pretty, and they\ndo move like a rocking-horse loping, but they are so big and fearless.\nThey have a fine color for black birds, and their feet and beaks seem so\nstrong. You never saw anything so keen as their eyes! And fly? Why, just\nthink, sir, they must be flying miles straight up, for they were out of\nsight completely when the feather fell. I don't suppose I've a chicken\nin the swamp that can go as close heaven as those big, black fellows,\nand then----”\n\nFreckles' voice dragged and he hesitated.\n\n“Then what?” interestedly urged McLean.\n\n“He was loving her so,” answered Freckles in a hushed voice. “I know it\nlooked awful funny, and I laughed and told on him, but if I'd taken time\nto think I don't believe I'd have done it. You see, I've seen such a\nlittle bit of loving in me life. You easily can be understanding that at\nthe Home it was every day the old story of neglect and desertion. Always\npeople that didn't even care enough for their children to keep them, so\nyou see, sir, I had to like him for trying so hard to make her know how\nhe loved her. Of course, they're only birds, but if they are caring for\neach other like that, why, it's just the same as people, ain't it?”\n\nFreckles lifted his brave, steady eyes to the Boss.\n\n“If anybody loved me like that, Mr. McLean, I wouldn't be spending any\ntime on how they looked or moved. All I'd be thinking of would be how\nthey felt toward me. If they will stay, I'll be caring as much for them\nas any chickens I have. If I did laugh at them I thought he was just\nfine!”\n\nThe face of McLean was a study; but the honest eyes of the boy were so\ncompelling that he found himself answering: “You are right, Freckles.\nHe's a gentleman, isn't he? And the only real chicken you have. Of\ncourse he'll remain! The Limberlost will be paradise for his family. And\nnow, Freckles, what has been the trouble all spring? You have done your\nwork as faithfully as anyone could ask, but I can't help seeing that\nthere is something wrong. Are you tired of your job?”\n\n“I love it,” answered Freckles. “It will almost break me heart when\nthe gang comes and begins tearing up the swamp and scaring away me\nchickens.”\n\n“Then what is the trouble?” insisted McLean.\n\n“I think, sir, it's been books,” answered Freckles. “You see, I didn't\nrealize it meself until the bullfrog told me this morning. I hadn't ever\neven heard about a place like this. Anyway, I wasn't understanding how\nit would be, if I had. Being among these beautiful things every day, I\ngot so anxious like to be knowing and naming them, that it got to eating\ninto me and went and made me near sick, when I was well as I could be.\nOf course, I learned to read, write, and figure some at school, but\nthere was nothing there, or in any of the city that I ever got to see,\nthat would make a fellow even be dreaming of such interesting things\nas there are here. I've seen the parks--but good Lord, they ain't even\nbeginning to be in it with the Limberlost! It's all new and strange to\nme. I don't know a thing about any of it. The bullfrog told me to 'find\nout,' plain as day, and books are the only way; ain't they?”\n\n“Of course,” said McLean, astonished at himself for his heartfelt\nrelief. He had not guessed until that minute what it would have meant\nto him to have Freckles give up. “You know enough to study out what you\nwant yourself, if you have the books; don't you?”\n\n“I am pretty sure I do,” said Freckles. “I learned all I'd the chance at\nin the Home, and me schooling was good as far as it went. Wouldn't let\nyou go past fourteen, you know. I always did me sums perfect, and loved\nme history books. I had them almost by heart. I never could get me\ngrammar to suit them. They said it was just born in me to go wrong\ntalking, and if it hadn't been I suppose I would have picked it up from\nthe other children; but I'd the best voice of any of them in the Home\nor at school. I could knock them all out singing. I was always leader in\nthe Home, and once one of the superintendents gave me carfare and let\nme go into the city and sing in a boys' choir. The master said I'd the\nswatest voice of them all until it got rough like, and then he made me\nquit for awhile, but he said it would be coming back by now, and I'm\nrailly thinking it is, sir, for I've tried on the line a bit of late and\nit seems to go smooth again and lots stronger. That and me chickens have\nbeen all the company I've been having, and it will be all I'll want if I\ncan have some books and learn the real names of things, where they come\nfrom, and why they do such interesting things. It's been fretting me\nmore than I knew to be shut up here among all these wonders and not\nknowing a thing. I wanted to ask you what some books would cost me, and\nif you'd be having the goodness to get me the right ones. I think I have\nenough money.”\n\nFreckles offered his account-book and the Boss studied it gravely.\n\n“You needn't touch your account, Freckles,” he said. “Ten dollars from\nthis month's pay will provide you everything you need to start on. I\nwill write a friend in Grand Rapids today to select you the very best\nand send them at once.”\n\nFreckles' eyes were shining.\n\n“Never owned a book in me life!” he said. “Even me schoolbooks were\nnever mine. Lord! How I used to wish I could have just one of them for\nme very own! Won't it be fun to see me sawbird and me little yellow\nfellow looking at me from the pages of a book, and their real names and\nall about them printed alongside? How long will it be taking, sir?”\n\n“Ten days should do it nicely,” said McLean. Then, seeing Freckles'\nlengthening face, he added: “I'll have Duncan bring you a ten-bushel\nstore-box the next time he goes to town. He can haul it to the west\nentrance and set it up wherever you want it. You can put in your spare\ntime filling it with the specimens you find until the books come,\nand then you can study out what you have. I suspect you could collect\nspecimens that I could send to naturalists in the city and sell for you;\nthings like that winged creature, this morning. I don't know much in\nthat line, but it must have been a moth, and it might have been rare.\nI've seen them by the thousand in museums, and in all nature I don't\nremember rarer coloring than their wings. I'll order you a butterfly-net\nand box and show you how scientists pin specimens. Possibly you can make\na fine collection of these swamp beauties. It will be all right for you\nto take a pair of different moths and butterflies, but I don't want to\nhear of your killing any birds. They are protected by heavy fines.”\n\nMcLean rode away leaving Freckles staring aghast. Then he saw the point\nand smiled. Standing on the trail, he twirled the feather and thought\nover the morning.\n\n“Well, if life ain't getting to be worth living!” he said wonderingly.\n“Biggest streak of luck I ever had! 'Bout time something was coming my\nway, but I wouldn't ever thought anybody could strike such magnificent\nprospects through only a falling feather.”\n\n\n\nCHAPTER IV\n\nWherein Freckles Faces Trouble Bravely and Opens the Way for New\nExperiences\n\nOn Duncan's return from his next trip to town there was a big store-box\nloaded on the back of his wagon. He drove to the west entrance of the\nswamp, set the box on a stump that Freckles had selected in a beautiful,\nsheltered place, and made it secure on its foundations with a tree at\nits back.\n\n“It seems most a pity to nail into that tree,” said Duncan. “I haena the\ntime to examine into the grain of it, but it looks as if it might be a\nrare ane. Anyhow, the nailin' winna hurt it deep, and havin' the case by\nit will make it safer if it is a guid ane.”\n\n“Isn't it an oak?” asked Freckles.\n\n“Ay,” said Duncan. “It looks like it might be ane of thae fine-grained\nwhite anes that mak' such grand furniture.”\n\nWhen the body of the case was secure, Duncan made a door from the lid\nand fastened it with hinges. He drove a staple, screwed on a latch, and\ngave Freckles a small padlock--so that he might fasten in his treasures\nsafely. He made a shelf at the top for his books, and last of all\ncovered the case with oil-cloth.\n\nIt was the first time in Freckles' life that anyone ever had done that\nmuch for his pleasure, and it warmed his heart with pure joy. If the\ninterior of the box already had been covered with the rarest treasures\nof the Limberlost he could have been no happier.\n\nWhen the big teamster stood back to look at his work he laughingly\nquoted, “'Neat, but no' gaudy,' as McLean says. All we're, needing now\nis a coat of paint to make a cupboard that would turn Sarah green with\nenvy. Ye'll find that safe an' dry, lad, an' that's all that's needed.”\n\n“Mr. Duncan,” said Freckles, “I don't know why you are being so mighty\ngood to me; but if you have any jobs at the cabin that I could do for\nyou or Mrs. Duncan, hours off the line, it would make me mighty happy.”\n\nDuncan laughed. “Ye needna feel ye are obliged to me, lad. Ye mauna\nthink I could take a half-day off in the best hauling season and go to\ntown for boxes to rig up, and spend of my little for fixtures.”\n\n“I knew Mr. McLean sent you,” said Freckles, his eyes wide and bright\nwith happiness. “It's so good of him. How I wish I could do something\nthat would please him as much!”\n\n“Why, Freckles,” said Duncan, as he knelt and began collecting his\ntools, “I canna see that it will hurt ye to be told that ye are doing\nevery day a thing that pleases the Boss as much as anything ye could\ndo. Ye're being uncommon faithful, lad, and honest as old Father Time.\nMcLean is trusting ye as he would his own flesh and blood.”\n\n“Oh, Duncan!” cried the happy boy. “Are you sure?”\n\n“Why I know,” answered Duncan. “I wadna venture to say so else. In those\nfirst days he cautioned me na to tell ye, but now he wadna care. D'ye\nken, Freckles, that some of the single trees ye are guarding are worth a\nthousand dollars?”\n\nFreckles caught his breath and stood speechless.\n\n“Ye see,” said Duncan, “that's why they maun be watched so closely. They\ntak', say, for instance, a burl maple--bird's eye they call it in the\nfactory, because it's full o' wee knots and twists that look like the\neye of a bird. They saw it out in sheets no muckle thicker than writin'\npaper. Then they make up the funiture out of cheaper wood and cover it\nwith the maple--veneer, they call it. When it's all done and polished ye\nnever saw onythin' grander. Gang into a retail shop the next time ye\nare in town and see some. By sawin' it thin that way they get finish for\nthousands of dollars' worth of furniture from a single tree. If ye dinna\nwatch faithful, and Black Jack gets out a few he has marked, it means\nthe loss of more money than ye ever dreamed of, lad. The other night,\ndown at camp, some son of Balaam was suggestin' that ye might be sellin'\nthe Boss out to Jack and lettin' him tak' the trees secretly, and nobody\nwad ever ken till the gang gets here.”\n\nA wave of scarlet flooded Freckles' face and he blazed hotly at the\ninsult.\n\n“And the Boss,” continued Duncan, coolly ignoring Freckles' anger, “he\nlays back just as cool as cowcumbers an' says: 'I'll give a thousand\ndollars to ony man that will show me a fresh stump when we reach the\nLimberlost,' says he. Some of the men just snapped him op that they'd\nfind some. So you see bow the Boss is trustin' ye, lad.”\n\n“I am gladder than I can ever expriss,” said Freckles. “And now will I\nbe walking double time to keep some of them from cutting a tree to get\nall that money!”\n\n“Mither o' Moses!” howled Duncan. “Ye can trust the Scotch to bungle\nthings a'thegither. McLean was only meanin' to show ye all confidence\nand honor. He's gone and set a high price for some dirty whelp to ruin\nye. I was just tryin' to show ye how he felt toward ye, and I've gone\nan' give ye that worry to bear. Damn the Scotch! They're so slow an' so\ndumb!”\n\n“Exciptin' prisint company?” sweetly inquired Freckles.\n\n“No!” growled Duncan. “Headin' the list! He'd nae business to set a\nprice on ye, lad, for that's about the amount of it, an' I'd nae right\nto tell ye. We've both done ye ill, an' both meanin' the verra best.\nJuist what I'm always sayin' to Sarah.”\n\n“I am mighty proud of what you have been telling me, Duncan,” said\nFreckles. “I need the warning, sure. For with the books coming I might\nbe timpted to neglect me work when double watching is needed. Thank you\nmore than I can say for putting me on to it. What you've told me may be\nthe saving of me. I won't stop for dinner now. I'll be getting along the\neast line, and when I come around about three, maybe Mother Duncan will\nlet me have a glass of milk and a bite of something.”\n\n“Ye see now!” cried Duncan in disgust. “Ye'll start on that seven-mile\ntramp with na bite to stay your stomach. What was it I told ye?”\n\n“You told me that the Scotch had the hardest heads and the softest\nhearts of any people that's living,” answered Freckles.\n\nDuncan grunted in gratified disapproval.\n\nFreckles picked up his club and started down the line, whistling\ncheerily, for he had an unusually long repertoire upon which to draw.\n\nDuncan went straight to the lower camp, and calling McLean aside,\nrepeated the conversation verbatim, ending: “And nae matter what happens\nnow or ever, dinna ye dare let onythin' make ye believe that Freckles\nhasna guarded faithful as ony man could.”\n\n“I don't think anything could shake my faith in the lad,” answered\nMcLean.\n\nFreckles was whistling merrily. He kept one eye religiously on the line.\nThe other he divided between the path, his friends of the wire, and a\nsearch of the sky for his latest arrivals. Every day since their coming\nhe had seen them, either hanging as small, black clouds above the swamp\nor bobbing over logs and trees with their queer, tilting walk. Whenever\nhe could spare time, he entered the swamp and tried to make friends\nwith them, for they were the tamest of all his unnumbered subjects. They\nducked, dodged, and ambled around him, over logs and bushes, and not\neven a near approach would drive them to flight.\n\nFor two weeks he had found them circling over the Limberlost regularly,\nbut one morning the female was missing and only the big black chicken\nhung sentinel above the swamp. His mate did not reappear in the\nfollowing days, and Freckles grew very anxious. He spoke of it to Mrs.\nDuncan, and she quieted his fears by raising a delightful hope in their\nstead.\n\n“Why, Freckles, if it's the hen-bird ye are missing, it's ten to one\nshe's safe,” she said. “She's laid, and is setting, ye silly! Watch him\nand mark whaur he lichts. Then follow and find the nest. Some Sabbath\nwe'll all gang see it.”\n\nAccepting this theory, Freckles began searching for the nest. Because\nthese “chickens” were large, as the hawks, he looked among the treetops\nuntil he almost sprained the back of his neck. He had half the crow and\nhawk nests in the swamp located. He searched for this nest instead of\ncollecting subjects for his case. He found the pair the middle of one\nforenoon on the elm where he had watched their love-making. The big\nblack chicken was feeding his mate; so it was proved that they were a\npair, they were both alive, and undoubtedly she was brooding. After that\nFreckles' nest-hunting continued with renewed zeal, but as he had no\nidea where to look and Duncan could offer no helpful suggestion, the\nnest was no nearer to being found.\n\nComing from a long day on the trail, Freckles saw Duncan's children\nawaiting him much closer the swale than they usually ventured, and from\ntheir wild gestures he knew that something had happened. He began to\nrun, but the cry that reached him was: “The books have come!”\n\nHow they hurried! Freckles lifted the youngest to his shoulder, the\nsecond took his club and dinner pail, and when they reached Mrs. Duncan\nthey found her at work on a big box. She had loosened the lid, and then\nshe laughingly sat on it.\n\n“Ye canna have a peep in here until ye have washed and eaten supper,”\n she said. “It's all ready on the table. Ance ye begin on this, ye'll\nno be willin' to tak' your nose o' it till bedtime, and I willna get my\nwork done the nicht. We've eaten long ago.”\n\nIt was difficult work, but Freckles smiled bravely. He made himself\nneat, swallowed a few bites, then came so eagerly that Mrs. Duncan\nyielded, although she said she very well knew all the time that his\nsupper would be spoiled.\n\nLifting the lid, they removed the packing and found in that box books\non birds, trees, flowers, moths, and butterflies. There was also one\ncontaining Freckles' bullfrog, true to life. Besides these were a\nbutterfly-net, a naturalist's tin specimen-box, a bottle of cyanide,\na box of cotton, a paper of long, steel specimen-pins, and a letter\ntelling what all these things were and how to use them.\n\nAt the discovery of each new treasure, Freckles shouted: “Will you be\nlooking at this, now?”\n\nMrs. Duncan cried: “Weel, I be drawed on!”\n\nThe eldest boy turned a somersault for every extra, while the baby,\ntrying to follow his example, bunched over in a sidewise sprawl and cut\nhis foot on the axe with which his mother had prized up the box-lid.\nThat sobered them, they carried the books indoors. Mrs. Duncan had a top\nshelf in her closet cleared for them, far above the reach of meddling\nlittle fingers.\n\nWhen Freckles started for the trail next morning, the shining new\nspecimen-box flashed on his back. The black “chicken,” a mere speck in\nthe blue, caught the gleam of it. The folded net hung beside the boy's\nhatchet, and the bird book was in the box. He walked the line and tested\neach section scrupulously, watching every foot of the trail, for he was\ndetermined not to slight his work; but if ever a boy “made haste slowly”\n in a hurry, it was Freckles that morning. When at last he reached the\nspace he had cleared and planted around his case, his heart swelled with\nthe pride of possessing even so much that he could call his own, while\nhis quick eyes feasted on the beauty of it.\n\nHe had made a large room with the door of the case set even with one\nside of it. On three sides, fine big bushes of wild rose climbed to the\nlower branches of the trees. Part of his walls were mallow, part alder,\nthorn, willow, and dogwood. Below there filled in a solid mass of pale\npink sheep-laurel, and yellow St. John's wort, while the amber threads\nof the dodder interlaced everywhere. At one side the swamp came close,\nhere cattails grew in profusion. In front of them he had planted a row\nof water-hyacinths without disturbing in the least the state of their\nazure bloom, and where the ground arose higher for his floor, a row of\nfoxfire, that soon would be open.\n\nTo the left he had discovered a queer natural arrangement of the trees,\nthat grew to giant size and were set in a gradually narrowing space so\nthat a long, open vista stretched away until lost in the dim recesses\nof the swamp. A little trimming of underbush, rolling of dead logs,\nlevelling of floor and carpeting with moss, made it easy to understand\nwhy Freckles had named this the “cathedral”; yet he never had been\ntaught that “the groves were God's first temples.”\n\nOn either side of the trees that constituted the first arch of this dim\nvista of the swamp he planted ferns that grew waist-high thus early in\nthe season, and so skilfully the work had been done that not a frond\ndrooped because of the change. Opposite, he cleared a space and made a\nflower bed. He filled one end with every delicate, lacy vine and fern he\ncould transplant successfully. The body of the bed was a riot of color.\nHere he set growing dainty blue-eyed-Marys and blue-eyed grass side\nby side. He planted harebells; violets, blue, white, and yellow; wild\ngeranium, cardinal-flower, columbine, pink snake's mouth, buttercups,\npainted trilliums, and orchis. Here were blood-root, moccasin-flower,\nhepatica, pitcher-plant, Jack-in-the-pulpit, and every other flower of\nthe Limberlost that was in bloom or bore a bud presaging a flower. Every\nday saw the addition of new specimens. The place would have driven a\nbotanist wild with envy.\n\nOn the line side he left the bushes thick for concealment, entering by a\nnarrow path he and Duncan had cleared in setting up the case. He called\nthis the front door, though he used every precaution to hide it. He\nbuilt rustic seats between several of the trees, leveled the floor, and\nthickly carpeted it with rank, heavy, woolly-dog moss. Around the case\nhe planted wild clematis, bittersweet, and wild-grapevines, and trained\nthem over it until it was almost covered. Every day he planted new\nflowers, cut back rough bushes, and coaxed out graceful ones. His\npride in his room was very great, but he had no idea how surprisingly\nbeautiful it would appear to anyone who had not witnessed its growth and\nconstruction.\n\nThis morning Freckles walked straight to his case, unlocked it, and set\nhis apparatus and dinner inside. He planted a new specimen he had found\nclose the trail, and, bringing his old scrap-bucket from the corner in\nwhich it was hidden, from a near-by pool he dipped water to pour over\nhis carpet and flowers.\n\nThen he took out the bird book, settled comfortably on a bench, and\nwith a deep sigh of satisfaction turned to the section headed. “V.” Past\n“veery” and “vireo” he went, down the line until his finger, trembling\nwith eagerness, stopped at “vulture.”\n\n“'Great black California vulture,'” he read.\n\n“Humph! This side the Rockies will do for us.”\n\n“'Common turkey-buzzard.'”\n\n“Well, we ain't hunting common turkeys. McLean said chickens, and what\nhe says goes.”\n\n“'Black vulture of the South.'”\n\n“Here we are arrived at once.”\n\nFreckles' finger followed the line, and he read scraps aloud.\n\n“'Common in the South. Sometimes called Jim Crow. Nearest equivalent to\nC-a-t-h-a-r-t-e-s A-t-r-a-t-a.'”\n\n“How the divil am I ever to learn them corkin' big words by mesel'?”\n\n“'--the Pharaoh's Chickens of European species. Sometimes stray north as\nfar as Virginia and Kentucky----'”\n\n“And sometimes farther,” interpolated Freckles, “'cos I got them right\nhere in Indiana so like these pictures I can just see me big chicken\nbobbing up to get his ears boxed. Hey?”\n\n“'Light-blue eggs'----”\n\n“Golly! I got to be seeing them!”\n\n“'--big as a common turkey's, but shaped like a hen's, heavily splotched\nwith chocolate----'”\n\n“Caramels, I suppose. And----”\n\n“'--in hollow logs or stumps.'”\n\n“Oh, hagginy! Wasn't I barking up the wrong tree, though? Ought to been\nlooking close the ground all this time. Now it's all to do over, and I\nsuspect the sooner I start the sooner I'll be likely to find them.”\n\nFreckles put away his book, dampened the smudge-fire, without which the\nmosquitoes made the swamp almost unbearable, took his cudgel and lunch,\nand went to the line. He sat on a log, ate at dinner-time and drank his\nlast drop of water. The heat of June was growing intense. Even on the\nwest of the swamp, where one had full benefit of the breeze from the\nupland, it was beginning to be unpleasant in the middle of the day.\n\nHe brushed the crumbs from his knees and sat resting awhile and watching\nthe sky to see if his big chicken were hanging up there. But he came to\nthe earth abruptly, for there were steps coming down the trail that\nwere neither McLean's nor Duncan's--and there never had been others.\nFreckles' heart leaped hotly. He ran a quick hand over his belt to feel\nif his revolver and hatchet were there, caught up his cudgel and laid\nit across his knees--then sat quietly, waiting. Was it Black Jack,\nor someone even worse? Forced to do something to brace his nerves, he\npuckered his stiffening lips and began whistling a tune he had led in\nhis clear tenor every year of his life at the Home Christmas exercises.\n\n     “Who comes this way, so blithe and gay,\n     Upon a merry Christmas day?”\n\nHis quick Irish wit roused to the ridiculousness of it until he broke\ninto a laugh that steadied him amazingly.\n\nThrough the bushes he caught a glimpse of the oncoming figure. His heart\nflooded with joy, for it was a man from the gang. Wessner had been his\nbunk-mate the night he came down the corduroy. He knew him as well as\nany of McLean's men. This was no timber-thief. No doubt the Boss had\nsent him with a message. Freckles sprang up and called cheerily, a warm\nwelcome on his face.\n\n“Well, it's good telling if you're glad to see me,” said Wessner, with\nsomething very like a breath of relief. “We been hearing down at the\ncamp you were so mighty touchy you didn't allow a man within a rod of\nthe line.”\n\n“No more do I,” answered Freckles, “if he's a stranger, but you're from\nMcLean, ain't you?”\n\n“Oh, damn McLean!” said Wessner.\n\nFreckles gripped the cudgel until his knuckles slowly turned purple.\n\n“And are you railly saying so?” he inquired with elaborate politeness.\n\n“Yes, I am,” said Wessner. “So would every man of the gang if they\nwasn't too big cowards to say anything, unless maybe that other\nslobbering old Scotchman, Duncan. Grinding the lives out of us! Working\nus like dogs, and paying us starvation wages, while he rolls up his\nmillions and lives like a prince!”\n\nGreen lights began to play through the gray of Freckles' eyes.\n\n“Wessner,” he said impressively, “you'd make a fine pattern for the\nfather of liars! Every man on that gang is strong and hilthy, paid all\nhe earns, and treated with the courtesy of a gentleman! As for the Boss\nliving like a prince, he shares fare with you every day of your lives!”\n\nWessner was not a born diplomat, but he saw he was on the wrong tack, so\nhe tried another.\n\n“How would you like to make a good big pile of money, without even\nlifting your hand?” he asked.\n\n“Humph!” said Freckles. “Have you been up to Chicago and cornered wheat,\nand are you offering me a friendly tip on the invistment of me fortune?”\n\nWessner came close.\n\n“Freckles, old fellow,” he said, “if you let me give you a pointer, I\ncan put you on to making a cool five hundred without stepping out of\nyour tracks.”\n\nFreckles drew back.\n\n“You needn't be afraid of speaking up,” he said. “There isn't a soul in\nthe Limberlost save the birds and the beasts, unless some of your sort's\ncome along and's crowding the privileges of the legal tinints.”\n\n“None of my friends along,” said Wessner. “Nobody knew I came but Black,\nI--I mean a friend of mine. If you want to hear sense and act with\nreason, he can see you later, but it ain't necessary. We can make all\nthe plans needed. The trick's so dead small and easy.”\n\n“Must be if you have the engineering of it,” said Freckles. But he\nheard, with a sigh of relief, that they were alone.\n\nWessner was impervious. “You just bet it is! Why, only think, Freckles,\nslavin' away at a measly little thirty dollars a month, and here is a\nchance to clear five hundred in a day! You surely won't be the fool to\nmiss it!”\n\n“And how was you proposing for me to stale it?” inquired Freckles. “Or\nam I just to find it laying in me path beside the line?”\n\n“That's it, Freckles,” blustered the Dutchman, “you're just to find it.\nYou needn't do a thing. You needn't know a thing. You name a morning\nwhen you will walk up the west side of the swamp and then turn round\nand walk back down the same side again and the money is yours. Couldn't\nanything be easier than that, could it?”\n\n“Depinds entirely on the man,” said Freckles. The lilt of a lark hanging\nabove the swale beside them was not sweeter than the sweetness of his\nvoice. “To some it would seem to come aisy as breathing; and to some,\nwringin' the last drop of their heart's blood couldn't force thim! I'm\nnot the man that goes into a scheme like that with the blindfold over\nme eyes, for, you see, it manes to break trust with the Boss; and I've\nserved him faithful as I knew. You'll have to be making the thing very\nclear to me understanding.”\n\n“It's so dead easy,” repeated Wessner, “it makes me tired of the\nsimpleness of it. You see there's a few trees in the swamp that's real\ngold mines. There's three especial. Two are back in, but one's square on\nthe line. Why, your pottering old Scotch fool of a Boss nailed the\nwire to it with his own hands! He never noticed where the bark had been\npeeled, or saw what it was. If you will stay on this side of the trail\njust one day we can have it cut, loaded, and ready to drive out at\nnight. Next morning you can find it, report, and be the busiest man\nin the search for us. We know where to fix it all safe and easy. Then\nMcLean has a bet up with a couple of the gang that there can't be a raw\nstump found in the Limberlost. There's plenty of witnesses to swear to\nit, and I know three that will. There's a cool thousand, and this tree\nis worth all of that, raw. Say, it's a gold mine, I tell you, and just\nfive hundred of it is yours. There's no danger on earth to you, for\nyou've got McLean that bamboozled you could sell out the whole swamp and\nhe'd never mistrust you. What do you say?”\n\nFreckles' soul was satisfied. “Is that all?” he asked.\n\n“No, it ain't,” said Wessner. “If you really want to brace up and be a\nman and go into the thing for keeps, you can make five times that in a\nweek. My friend knows a dozen others we could get out in a few days, and\nall you'd have to do would be to keep out of sight. Then you could\ntake your money and skip some night, and begin life like a gentleman\nsomewhere else. What do you think about it?”\n\nFreckles purred like a kitten.\n\n“'Twould be a rare joke on the Boss,” he said, “to be stalin' from him\nthe very thing he's trusted me to guard, and be getting me wages all\nwinter throwed in free. And you're making the pay awful high. Me to\nbe getting five hundred for such a simple little thing as that. You're\ntrating me most royal indade! It's away beyond all I'd be expecting.\nSivinteen cints would be a big price for that job. It must be looked\ninto thorough. Just you wait here until I do a minute's turn in the\nswamp, and then I'll be eschorting you out of the clearing and giving\nyou the answer.”\n\nFreckles lifted the overhanging bushes and hurried to the case. He\nunslung the specimen-box and laid it inside with his hatchet and\nrevolver. He slipped the key in his pocket and went back to Wessner.\n\n“Now for the answer,” he said. “Stand up!”\n\nThere was iron in his voice, and he was commanding as an outraged\ngeneral. “Anything, you want to be taking off?” he questioned.\n\nWessner looked the astonishment he felt. “Why, no, Freckles,” he said.\n\n“Have the goodness to be calling me Mister McLean,” snapped Freckles.\n“I'm after resarvin' me pet name for the use of me friends! You may\nstand with your back to the light or be taking any advantage you want.”\n\n“Why, what do you mean?” spluttered Wessner.\n\n“I'm manin',” said Freckles tersely, “to lick a quarter-section of hell\nout of you, and may the Holy Vargin stay me before I leave you here\ncarrion, for your carcass would turn the stummicks of me chickens!”\n\nAt the camp that morning, Wessner's conduct had been so palpable an\nexcuse to force a discharge that Duncan moved near McLean and whispered,\n“Think of the boy, sir?”\n\nMcLean was so troubled that, an hour later, he mounted Nellie and\nfollowed Wessner to his home in Wildcat Hollow, only to find that he had\nleft there shortly before, heading for the Limberlost. McLean rode at\ntop speed. When Mrs. Duncan told him that a man answering Wessner's\ndescription had gone down the west side of the swamp close noon, he left\nthe mare in her charge and followed on foot. When he heard voices he\nentered the swamp and silently crept close just in time to hear Wessner\nwhine: “But I can't fight you, Freckles. I hain't done nothing to you.\nI'm away bigger than you, and you've only one hand.”\n\nThe Boss slid off his coat and crouched among the bushes, ready to\nspring; but as Freckles' voice reached him he held himself, with a\nstrong effort, to learn what mettle was in the boy.\n\n“Don't you be wasting of me good time in the numbering of me hands,”\n cried Freckles. “The stringth of me cause will make up for the weakness\nof me mimbers, and the size of a cowardly thief doesn't count. You'll\nthink all the wildcats of the Limberlost are turned loose on you whin I\ncome against you, and as for me cause----I slept with you, Wessner, the\nnight I came down the corduroy like a dirty, friendless tramp, and the\nBoss was for taking me up, washing, clothing, and feeding me, and giving\nme a home full of love and tinderness, and a master to look to, and\ngood, well-earned money in the bank. He's trusting me his heartful, and\nhere comes you, you spotted toad of the big road, and insults me, as is\nan honest Irish gintleman, by hinting that you concaive I'd be willing\nto shut me eyes and hold fast while you rob him of the thing I was set\nand paid to guard, and then act the sneak and liar to him, and ruin and\neternally blacken the soul of me. You damned rascal,” raved Freckles,\n“be fighting before I forget the laws of a gintlemin's game and split\nyour dirty head with me stick!”\n\nWessner backed away, mumbling, “But I don't want to hurt you, Freckles!”\n\n“Oh, don't you!” raged the boy, now fairly frothing. “Well, you ain't\nresembling me none, for I'm itching like death to git me fingers in the\nface of you.”\n\nHe danced up, and as Wessner lunged in self-defense, ducked under his\narm as a bantam and punched him in the pit of the stomach so that he\ndoubled with a groan. Before Wessner could straighten himself, Freckles\nwas on him, fighting like the wildest fury that ever left the beautiful\nisland. The Dutchman dealt thundering blows that sometimes landed and\nsent Freckles reeling, and sometimes missed, while he went plunging into\nthe swale with the impetus of them. Freckles could not strike with half\nWessner's force, but he could land three blows to the Dutchman's one.\nIt was here that the boy's days of alert watching on the line, the\nperpetual swinging of the heavy cudgel, and the endurance of all weather\nstood him in good stead; for he was tough, and agile. He skipped,\nducked, and dodged. For the first five minutes he endured fearful\npunishment. Then Wessner's breath commenced to whistle between his\nteeth, when Freckles only had begun fighting. He sprang back with shrill\nlaughter.\n\n“Begolly! and will your honor be whistling the hornpipe for me to be\ndancing of?” he cried.\n\nSPANG! went his fist into Wessner's face, and he was past him into the\nswale.\n\n“And would you be pleased to tune up a little livelier?” he gasped, and\nclipped his ear as he sprang back. Wessner lunged at him in blind fury.\nFreckles, seeing an opening, forgot the laws of a gentleman's game and\ndrove the toe of his heavy wading-boot in Wessner's middle until he\ndoubled and fell heavily. In a flash Freckles was on him. For a time\nMcLean could not see what was happening. “Go! Go to him now!” he\ncommanded himself, but so intense was his desire to see the boy win\nalone that he did not stir.\n\nAt last Freckles sprang up and backed away. “Time!” he yelled as a fury.\n“Be getting up, Mr. Wessner, and don't be afraid of hurting me. I'll let\nyou throw in an extra hand and lick you to me complate satisfaction all\nthe same. Did you hear me call the limit? Will you get up and be facing\nme?”\n\nAs Wessner struggled to his feet, he resembled a battlefield, for his\nclothing was in ribbons and his face and hands streaming blood.\n\n“I--I guess I got enough,” he mumbled.\n\n“Oh, you do?” roared Freckles. “Well this ain't your say. You come on\nto me ground, lying about me Boss and intimatin' I'd stale from his very\npockets. Now will you be standing up and taking your medicine like a\nman, or getting it poured down the throat of you like a baby? I ain't\ngot enough! This is only just the beginning with me. Be looking out\nthere!”\n\nHe sprang against Wessner and sent him rolling. He attacked the\nunresisting figure and fought him until he lay limp and quiet and\nFreckles had no strength left to lift an arm. Then he arose and stepped\nback, gasping for breath. With his first lungful of air he shouted:\n“Time!” But the figure of Wessner lay motionless.\n\nFreckles watched him with regardful eye and saw at last that he was\ncompletely exhausted. He bent over him, and catching him by the back of\nthe neck, jerked him to his knees. Wessner lifted the face of a whipped\ncur, and fearing further punishment, burst into shivering sobs, while\nthe tears washed tiny rivulets through the blood and muck. Freckles\nstepped back, glaring at Wessner, but suddenly the scowl of anger and\nthe ugly disfiguring red faded from the boy's face. He dabbed at a cut\non his temple from which issued a tiny crimson stream, and jauntily\nshook back his hair. His face took on the innocent look of a cherub,\nand his voice rivaled that of a brooding dove, but into his eyes crept a\nlook of diabolical mischief.\n\nHe glanced vaguely around him until he saw his club, seized and twirled\nit as a drum major, stuck it upright in the muck, and marched on tiptoe\nto Wessner, mechanically, as a puppet worked by a string. Bending over,\nFreckles reached an arm around Wessner's waist and helped him to his\nfeet.\n\n“Careful, now” he cautioned, “be careful, Freddy; there's danger of you\nhurting me.”\n\nDrawing a handkerchief from a back pocket, Freckles tenderly wiped\nWessner's eyes and nose.\n\n“Come, Freddy, me child,” he admonished Wessner, “it's time little boys\nwere going home. I've me work to do, and can't be entertaining you any\nmore today. Come back tomorrow, if you ain't through yet, and we'll\nrepate the perfarmance. Don't be staring at me so wild like! I would eat\nyou, but I can't afford it. Me earnings, being honest, come slow, and\nI've no money to be squanderin' on the pailful of Dyspeptic's Delight it\nwould be to taking to work you out of my innards!”\n\nAgain an awful wrenching seized McLean. Freckles stepped back as\nWessner, tottering and reeling, as a thoroughly drunken man, came toward\nthe path, appearing indeed as if wildcats had attacked him.\n\nThe cudgel spun high in air, and catching it with an expertness acquired\nby long practice on the line, the boy twirled it a second, shook back\nhis thick hair bonnily, and stepping into the trail, followed Wessner.\nBecause Freckles was Irish, it was impossible to do it silently, so\npresently his clear tenor rang out, though there were bad catches where\nhe was hard pressed for breath:\n\n     “It was the Dutch.  It was the Dutch.\n     Do you think it was the Irish hollered help?\n     Not much!\n     It was the Dutch.  It was the Dutch----”\n\nWessner turned and mumbled: “What you following me for? What are you\ngoing to do with me?”\n\nFreckles called the Limberlost to witness: “How's that for the\ningratitude of a beast? And me troubling mesilf to show him off me\nterritory with the honors of war!”\n\nThen he changed his tone completely and added: “Belike it's this,\nFreddy. You see, the Boss might come riding down this trail any minute,\nand the little mare's so wheedlesome that if she'd come on to you in\nyour prisint state all of a sudden, she'd stop that short she'd send Mr.\nMcLean out over the ears of her. No disparagement intinded to the sinse\nof the mare!” he added hastily.\n\nWessner belched a fearful oath, while Freckles laughed merrily.\n\n“That's a sample of the thanks a generous act's always for getting,” he\ncontinued. “Here's me neglictin' me work to eschort you out proper, and\nyou saying such awful words Freddy,” he demanded sternly, “do you want\nme to soap out your mouth? You don't seem to be realizing it, but if you\nwas to buck into Mr. McLean in your prisint state, without me there\nto explain matters the chance is he'd cut the liver out of you; and I\nshouldn't think you'd be wanting such a fine gintleman as him to see\nthat it's white!”\n\nWessner grew ghastly under his grime and broke into a staggering run.\n\n“And now will you be looking at the manners of him?” questioned Freckles\nplaintively. “Going without even a 'thank you,' right in the face of all\nthe pains I've taken to make it interesting for him!”\n\nFreckles twirled the club and stood as a soldier at attention\nuntil Wessner left the clearing, but it was the last scene of that\nperformance. When the boy turned, there was deathly illness on his face,\nwhile his legs wavered beneath his weight. He staggered to the case, and\nopening it he took out a piece of cloth. He dipped it into the water,\nand sitting on a bench, he wiped the blood and grime from his face,\nwhile his breath sucked between his clenched teeth. He was shivering\nwith pain and excitement in spite of himself. He unbuttoned the band of\nhis right sleeve, and turning it back, exposed the blue-lined, calloused\nwhiteness of his maimed arm, now vividly streaked with contusions, while\nin a series of circular dots the blood oozed slowly. Here Wessner had\nsucceeded in setting his teeth. When Freckles saw what it was he forgave\nhimself the kick in the pit of Wessner's stomach, and cursed fervently\nand deep.\n\n“Freckles, Freckles,” said McLean's voice.\n\nFreckles snatched down his sleeve and arose to his feet.\n\n“Excuse me, sir,” he said. “You'll surely be belavin' I thought meself\nalone.”\n\nMcLean pushed him carefully to the seat, and bending over him, opened a\npocket-case that he carried as regularly as his revolver and watch, for\ncuts and bruises were of daily occurrence among the gang.\n\nTaking the hurt arm, he turned back the sleeve and bathed and bound the\nwounds. He examined Freckles' head and body and convinced himself that\nthere was no permanent injury, although the cruelty of the punishment\nthe boy had borne set the Boss shuddering. Then he closed the\ncase, shoved it into his pocket, and sat beside Freckles. All the\nindescribable beauty of the place was strong around him, but he saw\nonly the bruised face of the suffering boy, who had hedged for the\ninformation he wanted as a diplomat, argued as a judge, fought as a\nsheik, and triumphed as a devil.\n\nWhen the pain lessened and breath relieved Freckles' pounding heart, he\nwatched the Boss covertly. How had McLean gotten there and how long had\nhe been there? Freckles did not dare ask. At last he arose, and going\nto the case, took out his revolver and the wire-mending apparatus and\nlocked the door. Then he turned to McLean.\n\n“Have you any orders, sir?” he asked.\n\n“Yes,” said McLean, “I have, and you are to follow them to the letter.\nTurn over that apparatus to me and go straight home. Soak yourself in\nthe hottest bath your skin will bear and go to bed at once. Now hurry.”\n\n“Mr. McLean,” said Freckles, “it's sorry I am to be telling you, but\nthe afternoon's walking of the line ain't done. You see, I was just\nfor getting to me feet to start, and I was on time, when up came\na gintleman, and we got into a little heated argument. It's either\nsettled, or it's just begun, but between us, I'm that late I haven't\nstarted for the afternoon yet. I must be going at once, for there's a\ntree I must find before the day's over.”\n\n“You plucky little idiot,” growled McLean. “You can't walk the line! I\ndoubt if you can reach Duncan's. Don't you know when you are done up?\nYou go to bed; I'll finish your work.”\n\n“Niver!” protested Freckles. “I was just a little done up for the\nprisint, a minute ago. I'm all right now. Riding-boots are far too low.\nThe day's hot and the walk a good seven miles, sir. Niver!”\n\nAs he reached for the outfit he pitched forward and his eyes closed.\nMcLean stretched him on the moss and applied restoratives. When Freckles\nreturned to consciousness, McLean ran to the cabin to tell Mrs. Duncan\nto have a hot bath ready, and to bring Nellie. That worthy woman\npromptly filled the wash-boiler, starting a roaring fire under it. She\npushed the horse-trough from its base and rolled it to the kitchen.\n\nBy the time McLean came again, leading Nelie and holding Freckles on her\nback, Mrs. Duncan was ready for business. She and the Boss laid Freckles\nin the trough and poured on hot water until he squirmed. They soaked and\nmassaged him. Then they drew off the hot water and closed his pores with\ncold. Lastly they stretched him on the floor and chafed, rubbed, and\nkneaded him until he cried out for mercy. As they rolled him into bed,\nhis eyes dropped shut, but a little later they flared open.\n\n“Mr. McLean,” he cried, “the tree! Oh, do be looking after the tree!”\n\nMcLean bent over him. “Which tree, Freckles?”\n\n“I don't know exact sir; but it's on the east line, and the wire is\nfastened to it. He bragged that you nailed it yourself, sir. You'll know\nit by the bark having been laid open to the grain somewhere low down.\nFive hundred dollars he offered me--to be--selling you out--sir!”\n\nFreckles' head rolled over and his eyes dropped shut. McLean towered\nabove the lad. His bright hair waved on the pillow. His face was\nswollen, and purple with bruises. His left arm, with the hand battered\nalmost out of shape, stretched beside him, and the right, with no hand\nat all, lay across a chest that was a mass of purple welts. McLean's\nmind traveled to the night, almost a year before, when he had engaged\nFreckles, a stranger.\n\nThe Boss bent, covering the hurt arm with one hand and laying the other\nwith a caress on the boy's forehead. Freckles stirred at his touch, and\nwhispered as softly as the swallows under the eaves: “If you're coming\nthis way--tomorrow--be pleased to step over--and we'll repate--the\nchorus softly!”\n\n“Bless the gritty devil,” muttered McLean.\n\nThen he went out and told Mrs. Duncan to keep close watch on Freckles,\nalso to send Duncan to him at the swamp the minute he came home.\nFollowing the trail to the line and back to the scent of the fight, the\nBoss entered Freckles' study quietly, as if his spirit, keeping there,\nmight be roused, and gazed around with astonished eyes.\n\nHow had the boy conceived it? What a picture he had wrought in living\ncolors! He had the heart of a painter. He had the soul of a poet. The\nBoss stepped carefully over the velvet carpet to touch the walls of\ncrisp verdure with gentle fingers. He stood long beside the flower\nbed, and gazed at the banked wall of bright bloom as if he doubted its\nreality.\n\nWhere had Freckles ever found, and how had he transplanted such ferns?\nAs McLean turned from them he stopped suddenly.\n\nHe had reached the door of the cathedral. That which Freckles had\nattempted would have been patent to anyone. What had been in the heart\nof the shy, silent boy when he had found that long, dim stretch of\nforest, decorated its entrance, cleared and smoothed its aisle, and\ncarpeted its altar? What veriest work of God was in these mighty living\npillars and the arched dome of green! How similar to stained cathedral\nwindows were the long openings between the trees, filled with rifts of\nblue, rays of gold, and the shifting emerald of leaves! Where could be\nfound mosaics to match this aisle paved with living color and glowing\nlight? Was Freckles a devout Christian, and did he worship here? Or was\nhe an untaught heathen, and down this vista of entrancing loveliness did\nPan come piping, and dryads, nymphs, and fairies dance for him?\n\nWho can fathom the heart of a boy? McLean had been thinking of Freckles\nas a creature of unswerving honesty, courage, and faithfulness. Here was\nevidence of a heart aching for beauty, art, companionship, worship. It\nwas writ large all over the floor, walls, and furnishing of that little\nLimberlost clearing.\n\nWhen Duncan came, McLean told him the story of the fight, and they\nlaughed until they cried. Then they started around the line in search of\nthe tree.\n\nSaid Duncan: “Now the boy is in for sore trouble!”\n\n“I hope not,” answered McLean. “You never in all your life saw a cur\nwhipped so completely. He won't come back for the repetition of the\nchorus. We surely can find the tree. If we can't, Freckles can. I will\nbring enough of the gang to take it out at once. That will insure peace\nfor a time, at least, and I am hoping that in a month more the whole\ngang may be moved here. It soon will be fall, and then, if he will go, I\nintend to send Freckles to my mother to be educated. With his quickness\nof mind and body and a few years' good help he can do anything. Why,\nDuncan, I'd give a hundred-dollar bill if you could have been here and\nseen for yourself.”\n\n“Yes, and I'd 'a' done murder,” muttered the big teamster. “I hope, sir,\nye will make good your plans for Freckles, though I'd as soon see\nony born child o' my ain taken from our home. We love the lad, me and\nSarah.”\n\nLocating the tree was easy, because it was so well identified. When\nthe rumble of the big lumber wagons passing the cabin on the way to the\nswamp wakened Freckles next morning, he sprang up and was soon following\nthem. He was so sore and stiff that every movement was torture at first,\nbut he grew easier, and shortly did not suffer so much. McLean scolded\nhim for coming, yet in his heart triumphed over every new evidence of\nfineness in the boy.\n\nThe tree was a giant maple, and so precious that they almost dug it out\nby the roots. When it was down, cut in lengths, and loaded, there was\nyet an empty wagon. As they were gathering up their tools to go, Duncan\nsaid: “There's a big hollow tree somewhere mighty close here that I've\nbeen wanting for a watering-trough for my stock; the one I have is so\nsmall. The Portland company cut this for elm butts last year, and it's\nsix feet diameter and hollow for forty feet. It was a buster! While the\nmen are here and there is an empty wagon, why mightn't I load it on and\ntak' it up to the barn as we pass?”\n\nMcLean said he was very willing, ordered the driver to break line and\nload the log, detailing men to assist. He told Freckles to ride on a\nsection of the maple with him, but now the boy asked to enter the swamp\nwith Duncan.\n\n“I don't see why you want to go,” said McLean. “I have no business to\nlet you out today at all.”\n\n“It's me chickens,” whispered Freckles in distress. “You see, I was just\nafter finding yesterday, from me new book, how they do be nesting in\nhollow trees, and there ain't any too many in the swamp. There's just a\nchance that they might be in that one.”\n\n“Go ahead,” said McLean. “That's a different story. If they happen to be\nthere, why tell Duncan he must give up the tree until they have finished\nwith it.”\n\nThen he climbed on a wagon and was driven away. Freckles hurried into\nthe swamp. He was a little behind, yet he could see the men. Before he\novertook them, they had turned from the west road and had entered the\nswamp toward the east.\n\nThey stopped at the trunk of a monstrous prostrate log. It had been cut\nthree feet from the ground, over three-fourths of the way through, and\nhad fallen toward the east, the body of the log still resting on the\nstump. The underbrush was almost impenetrable, but Duncan plunged in and\nwith a crowbar began tapping along the trunk to decide how far it\nwas hollow, so that they would know where to cut. As they waited his\ndecision, there came from the mouth of it--on wings--a large black bird\nthat swept over their heads.\n\nFreckles danced wildly. “It's me chickens! Oh, it's me chickens!” he\nshouted. “Oh, Duncan, come quick! You've found the nest of me precious\nchickens!”\n\nDuncan hurried to the mouth of the log, but Freckles was before him. He\ncrashed through poison-vines and underbrush regardless of any danger,\nand climbed on the stump. When Duncan came he was shouting like a wild\nman.\n\n“It's hatched!” he yelled. “Oh, me big chicken has hatched out me little\nchicken, and there's another egg. I can see it plain, and oh, the funny\nlittle white baby! Oh, Duncan, can you see me little white chicken?”\n\nDuncan could easily see it; so could everyone else. Freckles crept into\nthe log and tenderly carried the hissing, blinking little bird to the\nlight in a leaf-lined hat. The men found it sufficiently wonderful to\nsatisfy even Freckles, who had forgotten he was ever sore or stiff, and\ncoddled over it with every blarneying term of endearment he knew.\n\nDuncan gathered his tools. “Deal's off, boys!” he said cheerfully. “This\nlog mauna be touched until Freckles' chaukies have finished with it. We\nmight as weel gang. Better put it back, Freckles. It's just out, and it\nmay chill. Ye will probably hae twa the morn.”\n\nFreckles crept into the log and carefully deposited the baby beside\nthe egg. When he came back, he said: “I made a big mistake not to be\nbringing the egg out with the baby, but I was fearing to touch it.\nIt's shaped like a hen's egg, and it's big as a turkey's, and the\nbeautifulest blue--just splattered with big brown splotches, like me\nbook said, precise. Bet you never saw such a sight as it made on the\nyellow of the rotten wood beside that funny leathery-faced little white\nbaby.”\n\n“Tell you what, Freckles,” said one of the teamsters. “Have you ever\nheard of this Bird Woman who goes all over the country with a camera and\nmakes pictures? She made some on my brother Jim's place last summer, and\nJim's so wild about them he quits plowing and goes after her about every\nnest he finds. He helps her all he can to take them, and then she gives\nhim a picture. Jim's so proud of what he has he keeps them in the Bible.\nHe shows them to everybody that comes, and brags about how he helped.\nIf you're smart, you'll send for her and she'll come and make a picture\njust like life. If you help her, she will give you one. It would be\nuncommon pretty to keep, after your birds are gone. I dunno what they\nare. I never see their like before. They must be something rare. Any you\nfellows ever see a bird like that hereabouts?”\n\nNo one ever had.\n\n“Well,” said the teamster, “failing to get this log lets me off till\nnoon, and I'm going to town. I go right past her place. I've a big\nnotion to stop and tell her. If she drives straight back in the swamp\non the west road, and turns east at this big sycamore, she can't miss\nfinding the tree, even if Freckles ain't here to show her. Jim says\nher work is a credit to the State she lives in, and any man is a measly\ncreature who isn't willing to help her all he can. My old daddy used to\nsay that all there was to religion was doing to the other fellow what\nyou'd want him to do to you, and if I was making a living taking bird\npictures, seems to me I'd be mighty glad for a chance to take one like\nthat. So I'll just stop and tell her, and by gummy! maybe she will give\nme a picture of the little white sucker for my trouble.”\n\nFreckles touched his arm.\n\n“Will she be rough with it?” he asked.\n\n“Government land! No!” said the teamster. “She's dead down on anybody\nthat shoots a bird or tears up a nest. Why, she's half killing herself\nin all kinds of places and weather to teach people to love and protect\nthe birds. She's that plum careful of them that Jim's wife says she has\nJim a standin' like a big fool holding an ombrelly over them when they\nare young and tender until she gets a focus, whatever that is. Jim says\nthere ain't a bird on his place that don't actually seem to like having\nher around after she has wheedled them a few days, and the pictures she\ntakes nobody would ever believe who didn't stand by and see.”\n\n“Will you he sure to tell her to come?” asked Freckles.\n\nDuncan slept at home that night. He heard Freckles slipping out early\nthe next morning, but he was too sleepy to wonder why, until he came to\ndo his morning chores. When he found that none of his stock was at all\nthirsty, and saw the water-trough brimming, he knew that the boy was\ntrying to make up to him for the loss of the big trough that he had been\nso anxious to have.\n\n“Bless his fool little hot heart!” said Duncan. “And him so sore it is\ntearing him to move for anything. Nae wonder he has us all loving him!”\n\nFreckles was moving briskly, and his heart was so happy that he forgot\nall about the bruises. He hurried around the trail, and on his way down\nthe east side he went to see the chickens. The mother bird was on the\nnest. He was afraid the other egg might be hatching, so he did not\nventure to disturb her. He made the round and reached his study early.\nHe ate his lunch, but did not need to start on the second trip until the\nmiddle of the afternoon. He would have long hours to work on his flower\nbed, improve his study, and learn about his chickens. Lovingly he set\nhis room in order and watered the flowers and carpet. He had chosen for\nhis resting-place the coolest spot on the west side, where there was\nalmost always a breeze; but today the heat was so intense that it\npenetrated even there.\n\n“I'm mighty glad there's nothing calling me inside!” he said. “There's\nno bit of air stirring, and it will just be steaming. Oh, but it's\nluck Duncan found the nest before it got so unbearing hot! I might have\nmissed it altogether. Wouldn't it have been a shame to lose that sight?\nThe cunning little divil! When he gets to toddling down that log to meet\nme, won't he be a circus? Wonder if he'll be as graceful a performer\nafoot as his father and mother?”\n\nThe heat became more insistent. Noon came; Freckles ate his dinner and\nsettled for an hour or two on a bench with a book.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER V\n\nWherein an Angel Materializes and a Man Worships\n\nPerhaps there was a breath of sound--Freckles never afterward could\nremember--but for some reason he lifted his head as the bushes parted\nand the face of an angel looked between. Saints, nymphs, and fairies\nhad floated down his cathedral aisle for him many times, with forms and\nvoices of exquisite beauty.\n\nParting the wild roses at the entrance was beauty of which Freckles\nnever had dreamed. Was it real or would it vanish as the other dreams?\nHe dropped his book, and rising to his feet, went a step closer, gazing\nintently. This was real flesh and blood. It was in every way kin to the\nLimberlost, for no bird of its branches swung with easier grace than\nthis dainty young thing rocked on the bit of morass on which she stood.\nA sapling beside her was not straighter or rounder than her slender\nform. Her soft, waving hair clung around her face from the heat, and\ncurled over her shoulders. It was all of one piece with the gold of the\nsun that filtered between the branches. Her eyes were the deepest blue\nof the iris, her lips the reddest red of the foxfire, while her cheeks\nwere exactly of the same satin as the wild rose petals caressing them.\nShe was smiling at Freckles in perfect confidence, and she cried:\n\n“Oh, I'm so delighted that I've found you!”\n\nThe wildly leaping heart of Freckles burst from his body and fell in the\nblack swamp-muck at her feet with such a thud that he did not understand\nhow she could avoid hearing. He really felt that if she looked down she\nwould see.\n\nIncredulous, he quavered: “An'--an' was you looking for me?”\n\n“I hoped I might find you,” said the Angel. “You see, I didn't do as\nI was told, and I'm lost. The Bird Woman said I should wait in the\ncarriage until she came back. She's been gone hours. It's a perfect\nTurkish bath in there, and I'm all lumpy with mosquito bites. Just when\nI thought that I couldn't bear it another minute, along came the biggest\nPapilio Ajax you ever saw. I knew how pleased she'd be, so I ran after\nit. It flew so slow and so low that I thought a dozen times I had it.\nThen all at once it went from sight above the trees, and I couldn't find\nmy way back to save me. I think I've walked more than an hour. I have\nbeen mired to my knees. A thorn raked my arm until it is bleeding, and\nI'm so tired and warm.”\n\nShe parted the bushes farther. Freckles saw that her blue cotton frock\nclung to her, limp with perspiration. It was torn across the breast. One\nsleeve hung open from shoulder to elbow. A thorn had torn her arm until\nit was covered with blood, and the gnats and mosquitoes were clustering\naround it. Her feet were in lace hose and low shoes. Freckles gasped. In\nthe Limberlost in low shoes! He caught an armful of moss from his carpet\nand buried it in the ooze in front of her for a footing.\n\n“Come out here so I can see where you are stepping. Quick, for the life\nof you!” he ordered.\n\nShe smiled on him indulgently.\n\n“Why?” she inquired.\n\n“Did anybody let you come here and not be telling you of the snakes?”\n urged Freckles.\n\n“We met Mr. McLean on the corduroy, and he did say something about\nsnakes, I believe. The Bird Woman put on leather leggings, and a nice,\nparboiled time she must be having! Worst dose I ever endured, and I'd\nnothing to do but swelter.”\n\n“Will you be coming out of there?” groaned Freckles.\n\nShe laughed as if it were a fine joke.\n\n“Maybe if I'd be telling you I killed a rattler curled upon that same\nplace you're standing, as long as me body and the thickness of me arm,\nyou'd be moving where I can see your footing,” he urged insistently.\n\n“What a perfectly delightful little brogue you speak,” she said. “My\nfather is Irish, and half should be enough to entitle me to that much.\n'Maybe--if I'd--be telling you,'” she imitated, rounding and accenting\neach word carefully.\n\nFreckles was beginning to feel a wildness in his head. He had derided\nWessner at that same hour yesterday. Now his own eyes were filling with\ntears.\n\n“If you were understanding the danger!” he continued desperately.\n\n“Oh, I don't think there is much!”\n\nShe tilted on the morass.\n\n“If you killed one snake here, it's probably all there is near; and\nanyway, the Bird Woman says a rattlesnake is a gentleman and always\ngives warning before he strikes. I don't hear any rattling. Do you?”\n\n“Would you be knowing it if you did?” asked Freckles, almost\nimpatiently.\n\nHow the laugh of the young thing rippled!\n\n“'Would I be knowing it?'” she mocked. “You should see the swamps of\nMichigan where they dump rattlers from the marl-dredgers three and four\nat a time!”\n\nFreckles stood astounded. She did know. She was not in the least afraid.\nShe was depending on a rattlesnake to live up to his share of the\ncontract and rattle in time for her to move. The one characteristic\nan Irishman admires in a woman, above all others, is courage. Freckles\nworshiped anew. He changed his tactics.\n\n“I'd be pleased to be receiving you at me front door,” he said, “but as\nyou have arrived at the back, will you come in and be seated?”\n\nHe waved toward a bench. The Angel came instantly.\n\n“Oh, how lovely and cool!” she cried.\n\nAs she moved across his room, Freckles had difficult work to keep from\nfalling on his knees; for they were very weak, while he was hard driven\nby an impulse to worship.\n\n“Did you arrange this?” she asked.\n\n“Yis,” said Freckles simply.\n\n“Someone must come with a big canvas and copy each side of it,” she\nsaid. “I never saw anything so beautiful! How I wish I might remain\nhere with you! I will, some day, if you will let me; but now, if you can\nspare the time, will you help me find the carriage? If the Bird Woman\ncomes back and I am gone, she will be almost distracted.”\n\n“Did you come on the west road?” asked Freckles.\n\n“I think so,” she said. “The man who told the Bird Woman said that\nwas the only place the wires were down. We drove away in, and it was\ndreadful--over stumps and logs, and we mired to the hubs. I suppose you\nknow, though. I should have stayed in the carriage, but I was so tired.\nI never dreamed of getting lost. I suspect I will be scolded finely.\nI go with the Bird Woman half the time during the summer vacations. My\nfather says I learn a lot more than I do at school, and get it straight.\nI never came within a smell of being lost before. I thought, at first,\nit was going to be horrid; but since I've found you, maybe it will be\ngood fun after all.”\n\nFreckles was amazed to hear himself excusing: “It was so hot in there.\nYou couldn't be expected to bear it for hours and not be moving. I can\ntake you around the trail almost to where you were. Then you can sit in\nthe carriage, and I will go find the Bird Woman.”\n\n“You'll be killed if you do! When she stays this long, it means that she\nhas a focus on something. You see, when she has a focus, and lies in the\nweeds and water for hours, and the sun bakes her, and things crawl over\nher, and then someone comes along and scares her bird away just as she\nhas it coaxed up--why, she kills them. If I melt, you won't go after\nher. She's probably blistered and half eaten up; but she never will quit\nuntil she is satisfied.”\n\n“Then it will be safer to be taking care of you,” suggested Freckles.\n\n“Now you're talking sense!” said the Angel.\n\n“May I try to help your arm?” he asked.\n\n“Have you any idea how it hurts?” she parried.\n\n“A little,” said Freckles.\n\n“Well, Mr. McLean said We'd probably find his son here”\n\n“His son!” cried Freckles.\n\n“That's what he said. And that you would do anything you could for us;\nand that we could trust you with our lives. But I would have trusted\nyou anyway, if I hadn't known a thing about you. Say, your father is\nrampaging proud of you, isn't he?”\n\n“I don't know,” answered the dazed Freckles.\n\n“Well, call on me if you want reliable information. He's so proud of you\nhe is all swelled up like the toad in AEsop's Fables. If you have ever\nhad an arm hurt like this, and can do anything, why, for pity sake, do\nit!”\n\nShe turned back her sleeve, holding toward Freckles an arm of palest\ncameo, shaped so exquisitely that no sculptor could have chiseled it.\n\nFreckles unlocked his case, and taking out some cotton cloth, he tore it\nin strips. Then he brought a bucket of the cleanest water he could find.\nShe yielded herself to his touch as a baby, and he bathed away the blood\nand bandaged the ugly, ragged wound. He finished his surgery by lapping\nthe torn sleeve over the cloth and binding it down with a piece of\ntwine, with the Angel's help about the knots.\n\nFreckles worked with trembling fingers and a face tense with\nearnestness.\n\n“Is it feeling any better?” he asked.\n\n“Oh, it's well now!” cried the Angel. “It doesn't hurt at all, any\nmore.”\n\n“I'm mighty glad,” said Freckles. “But you had best go and be having\nyour doctor fix it right; the minute you get home.”\n\n“Oh, bother! A little scratch like that!” jeered the Angel. “My blood is\nperfectly pure. It will heal in three days.”\n\n“It's cut cruel deep. It might be making a scar,” faltered Freckles, his\neyes on the ground. “'Twould--'twould be an awful pity. A doctor might\nknow something to prevent it.”\n\n“Why, I never thought of that!” exclaimed the Angel.\n\n“I noticed you didn't,” said Freckles softly. “I don't know much about\nit, but it seems as if most girls would.”\n\nThe Angel thought intently, while Freckles still knelt beside her.\nSuddenly she gave herself an impatient little shake, lifted her glorious\neyes full to his, and the smile that swept her sweet, young face was the\nloveliest thing that Freckles ever had seen.\n\n“Don't let's bother about it,” she proposed, with the faintest hint of\na confiding gesture toward him. “It won't make a scar. Why, it couldn't,\nwhen you have dressed it so nicely.”\n\nThe velvety touch of her warm arm was tingling in Freckles' fingertips.\nDainty lace and fine white ribbon peeped through her torn dress. There\nwere beautiful rings on her fingers. Every article she wore was of\nthe finest material and in excellent taste. There was the trembling\nLimberlost guard in his coarse clothing, with his cotton rags and\nhis old pail of swamp water. Freckles was sufficiently accustomed to\ncontrasts to notice them, and sufficiently fine to be hurt by them\nalways.\n\nHe lifted his eyes with a shadowy pain in them to hers, and found them\nof serene, unconscious purity. What she had said was straight from a\nkind, untainted, young heart. She meant every word of it. Freckles' soul\nsickened. He scarcely knew whether he could muster strength to stand.\n\n“We must go and hunt for the carriage,” said the Angel, rising.\n\nIn instant alarm for her, Freckles sprang up, grasped the cudgel, and\nled the way, sharply watching every step. He went as close the log as he\nfelt that he dared, and with a little searching found the carriage. He\ncleared a path for the Angel, and with a sigh of relief saw her enter it\nsafely. The heat was intense. She pushed the damp hair from her temples.\n\n“This is a shame!” said Freckles. “You'll never be coming here again.”\n\n“Oh yes I shall!” said the Angel. “The Bird Woman says that these birds\nremain over a month in the nest and she would like to make a picture\nevery few days for seven or eight weeks, perhaps.”\n\nFreckles barely escaped crying aloud for joy.\n\n“Then don't you ever be torturing yourself and your horse to be coming\nin here again,” he said. “I'll show you a way to drive almost to the\nnest on the east trail, and then you can come around to my room and stay\nwhile the Bird Woman works. It's nearly always cool there, and there's\ncomfortable seats, and water.”\n\n“Oh! did you have drinking-water there?” she cried. “I was never so\nthirsty or so hungry in my life, but I thought I wouldn't mention it.”\n\n“And I had not the wit to be seeing!” wailed Freckles. “I can be getting\nyou a good drink in no time.”\n\nHe turned to the trail.\n\n“Please wait a minute,” called the Angel. “What's your name? I want to\nthink about you while you are gone.” Freckles lifted his face with the\nbrown rift across it and smiled quizzically.\n\n“Freckles?” she guessed, with a peal of laughter. “And mine is----”\n\n“I'm knowing yours,” interrupted Freckles.\n\n“I don't believe you do. What is it?” asked the girl.\n\n“You won't be getting angry?”\n\n“Not until I've had the water, at least.”\n\nIt was Freckles' turn to laugh. He whipped off his big, floppy straw\nhat, stood uncovered before her, and said, in the sweetest of all the\nsweet tones of his voice: “There's nothing you could be but the Swamp\nAngel.”\n\nThe girl laughed happily.\n\nOnce out of her sight, Freckles ran every step of the way to the cabin.\nMrs. Duncan gave him a small bucket of water, cool from the well. He\ncarried it in the crook of his right arm, and a basket filled with bread\nand butter, cold meat, apple pie, and pickles, in his left hand.\n\n“Pickles are kind o' cooling,” said Mrs. Duncan.\n\nThen Freckles ran again.\n\nThe Angel was on her knees, reaching for the bucket, as he came up.\n\n“Be drinking slow,” he cautioned her.\n\n“Oh!” she cried, with a long breath of satisfaction. “It's so good! You\nare more than kind to bring it!”\n\nFreckles stood blinking in the dazzling glory of her smile until he\nscarcely could see to lift the basket.\n\n“Mercy!” she exclaimed. “I think I had better be naming you the 'Angel.'\nMy Guardian Angel.”\n\n“Yis,” said Freckles. “I look the character every day--but today most\nemphatic!”\n\n“Angels don't go by looks,” laughed the girl. “Your father told us you\nhad been scrapping. But he told us why. I'd gladly wear all your cuts\nand bruises if I could do anything that would make my father look as\npeacocky as yours did. He strutted about proper. I never saw anyone look\nprouder.”\n\n“Did he say he was proud of me?” marveled Freckles.\n\n“He didn't need to,” answered the Angel. “He was radiating pride from\nevery pore. Now, have you brought me your dinner?”\n\n“I had my dinner two hours ago,” answered Freckles.\n\n“Honest Injun?” bantered the Angel.\n\n“Honest! I brought that on purpose for you.”\n\n“Well, if you knew how hungry I am, you would know how thankful I am, to\nthe dot,” said the Angel.\n\n“Then you be eating,” cried the happy Freckles.\n\nThe Angel sat on a big camera, spread the lunch on the carriage seat,\nand divided it in halves. The daintiest parts she could select she\ncarefully put back into the basket. The remainder she ate. Again\nFreckles found her of the swamp, for though she was almost ravenous,\nshe managed her food as gracefully as his little yellow fellow, and her\nevery movement was easy and charming. As he watched her with famished\neyes, Freckles told her of his birds, flowers, and books, and never\nrealized what he was doing.\n\nHe led the horse to a deep pool that he knew of, and the tortured\ncreature drank greedily, and lovingly rubbed him with its nose as he\nwiped down its welted body with grass. Suddenly the Angel cried: “There\ncomes the Bird Woman!”\n\nFreckles had intended leaving before she came, but now he was glad\nindeed to be there, for a warmer, more worn, and worse bitten creature\nhe never had seen. She was staggering under a load of cameras and\nparaphernalia. Freckles ran to her aid. He took all he could carry of\nher load, stowed it in the back of the carriage, and helped her in.\nThe Angel gave her water, knelt and unfastened the leggings, bathed her\nface, and offered the lunch.\n\nFreckles brought the horse. He was not sure about the harness, but the\nAngel knew, and soon they left the swamp. Then he showed them how to\nreach the chicken tree from the outside, indicated a cooler place for\nthe horse, and told them how, the next time they came, the Angel could\nfind his room while she waited.\n\nThe Bird Woman finished her lunch, and lay back, almost too tired to\nspeak.\n\n“Were you for getting Little Chicken's picture?” Freckles asked.\n\n“Finely!” she answered. “He posed splendidly. But I couldn't do anything\nwith his mother. She will require coaxing.”\n\n“The Lord be praised!” muttered Freckles under his breath.\n\nThe Bird Woman began to feel better.\n\n“Why do you call the baby vulture 'Little Chicken'?” she asked, leaning\ntoward Freckles in an interested manner.\n\n“'Twas Duncan began it,” said Freckles. “You see, through the fierce\ncold of winter the birds of the swamp were almost starving. It is\nmighty lonely here, and they were all the company I was having. I got to\ncarrying scraps and grain down to them. Duncan was that ginerous he was\ngiving me of his wheat and corn from his chickens' feed, and he called\nthe birds me swamp chickens. Then when these big black fellows came,\nMr. McLean said they were our nearest kind to some in the old world\nthat they called 'Pharaoh's Chickens,' and he called mine 'Freckles'\nChickens.'”\n\n“Good enough!” cried the Bird Woman, her splotched purple face lighting\nwith interest. “You must shoot something for them occasionally, and I'll\nbring more food when I come. If you will help me keep them until I\nget my series, I'll give you a copy of each study I make, mounted in a\nbook.”\n\nFreckles drew a deep breath.\n\n“I'll be doing me very best,” he promised, and from the deeps he meant\nit.\n\n“I wonder if that other egg is going to hatch?” mused the Bird Woman. “I\nam afraid not. It should have pipped today. Isn't it a beauty! I never\nbefore saw either an egg or the young. They are rare this far north.”\n\n“So Mr. McLean said,” answered Freckles.\n\nBefore they drove away, the Bird Woman thanked him for his kindness to\nthe Angel and to her. She gave him her hand at parting, and Freckles\njoyfully realized that this was going to be another person for him to\nlove. He could not remember, after they had driven away, that they even\nhad noticed his missing hand, and for the first time in his life he had\nforgotten it.\n\nWhen the Bird Woman and the Angel were on the home road, she told of\nthe little corner of paradise into which she had strayed and of her new\nname. The Bird Woman looked at the girl and guessed its appropriateness.\n\n“Did you know Mr. McLean had a son?” asked the Angel. “Isn't the little\naccent he has, and the way he twists a sentence, too dear? And isn't it\ntoo old-fashioned and funny to hear him call his father 'mister'?”\n\n“It sounds too good to be true,” said the Bird Woman, answering the\nlast question first. “I am so tired of these present-day young men who\npatronizingly call their fathers 'Dad,' 'Governor,' 'Old Man' and 'Old\nChap,' that the boy's attitude of respect and deference appealed to me\nas being fine as silk. There must be something rare about that young\nman.”\n\nShe did not find it necessary to tell the Angel that for several years\nshe had known the man who so proudly proclaimed himself Freckles' father\nto be a bachelor and a Scotchman. The Bird Woman had a fine way of\nattending strictly to her own business.\n\nFreckles turned to the trail, but he stopped at every wild brier to\nstudy the pink satin of the petals. She was not of his world, and\nbetter than any other he knew it; but she might be his Angel, and he was\ndreaming of naught but blind, silent worship. He finished the happiest\nday of his life, and that night he returned to the swamp as if drawn by\ninvisible force. That Wessner would try for his revenge, he knew. That\nhe would be abetted by Black Jack was almost certain, but fear had\nfled the happy heart of Freckles. He had kept his trust. He had won the\nrespect of the Boss. No one ever could wipe from his heart the flood of\nholy adoration that had welled with the coming of his Angel. He would do\nhis best, and trust for strength to meet the dark day of reckoning that\nhe knew would come sooner or later. He swung round the trail, briskly\ntapping the wire, and singing in a voice that scarcely could have been\nsurpassed for sweetness.\n\nAt the edge of the clearing he came into the bright moonlight and there\nsat McLean on his mare. Freckles hurried to him.\n\n“Is there trouble?” he inquired anxiously.\n\n“That's what I wanted to ask you,” said the Boss. “I stopped at the\ncabin to see you a minute, before I turned in, and they said you had\ncome down here. You must not do it, Freckles. The swamp is none too\nhealthful at any time, and at night it is rank poison.”\n\nFreckles stood combing his fingers through Nellie's mane, while the\ndainty creature was twisting her head for his caresses. He pushed back\nhis hat and looked into McLean's face. “It's come to the 'sleep with one\neye open,' sir. I'm not looking for anything to be happening for a week\nor two, but it's bound to come, and soon. If I'm to keep me trust as\nI've promised you and meself, I've to live here mostly until the gang\ncomes. You must be knowing that, sir.”\n\n“I'm afraid it's true, Freckles,” said McLean. “And I've decided to\ndouble the guard until we come. It will be only a few weeks, now; and\nI'm so anxious for you that you must not be left alone further. If\nanything should happen to you, Freckles, it would spoil one of the very\ndearest plans of my life.”\n\nFreckles heard with dismay the proposition to place a second guard.\n\n“Oh! no, no, Mr. McLean,” he cried. “Not for the world! I wouldn't be\nhaving a stranger around, scaring me birds and tramping up me study, and\ndisturbing all me ways, for any money! I am all the guard you need! I\nwill be faithful! I will turn over the lease with no tree missing--on\nme life, I will! Oh, don't be sending another man to set them saying\nI turned coward and asked for help. It will just kill the honor of me\nheart if you do it. The only thing I want is another gun. If it railly\ncomes to trouble, six cartridges ain't many, and you know I am slow-like\nabout reloading.” McLean reached into his hip pocket and handed a\nshining big revolver to Freckles, who slipped it beside the one already\nin his belt.\n\nThen the Boss sat brooding.\n\n“Freckles,” he said at last, “we never know the timber of a man's soul\nuntil something cuts into him deeply and brings the grain out strong.\nYou've the making of a mighty fine piece of furniture, my boy, and you\nshall have your own way these few weeks yet. Then, if you will go, I\nintend to take you to the city and educate you, and you are to be my\nson, my lad--my own son!”\n\nFreckles twisted his finger in Nellie's mane to steady himself.\n\n“But why should you be doing that, sir?” he faltered.\n\nMcLean slid his arm around the boy's shoulder and gathered him close.\n\n“Because I love you, Freckles,” he said simply.\n\nFreckles lifted a white face. “My God, sir!” he whispered. “Oh, my God!”\n\nMcLean tightened his clasp a second longer, then he rode down the trail.\n\nFreckles lifted his hat and faced the sky. The harvest moon looked down,\nsheeting the swamp in silver glory. The Limberlost sang her night song.\nThe swale softly rustled in the wind. Winged things of night brushed\nhis face; and still Freckles gazed upward, trying to fathom these things\nthat had come to him. There was no help from the sky. It seemed far\naway, cold, and blue. The earth, where flowers blossomed, angels walked,\nand love could be found, was better. But to One, above, he must make\nacknowledgment for these miracles. His lips moved and he began talking\nsoftly.\n\n“Thank You for each separate good thing that has come to me,” he said,\n“and above all for the falling of the feather. For if it didn't really\nfall from an angel, its falling brought an Angel, and if it's in the\ngreat heart of you to exercise yourself any further about me, oh, do\nplease to be taking good care of her!”\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VI\n\nWherein a Fight Occurs and Women Shoot Straight\n\nThe following morning Freckles, inexpressibly happy, circled the\nLimberlost. He kept snatches of song ringing, as well as the wires. His\nheart was so full that tears of joy glistened in his eyes. He rigorously\nstrove to divide his thought evenly between McLean and the Angel.\nHe realized to the fullest the debt he already owed the Boss and the\nmagnitude of last night's declaration and promises. He was hourly\nplanning to deliver his trust and then enter with equal zeal on whatever\ntask his beloved Boss saw fit to set him next. He wanted to be ready to\nmeet every device that Wessner and Black Jack could think of to outwit\nhim. He recognized their double leverage, for if they succeeded in\nfelling even one tree McLean became liable for his wager.\n\nFreckles' brow wrinkled in his effort to think deeply and strongly, but\nfrom every swaying wild rose the Angel beckoned to him. When he crossed\nSleepy Snake Creek and the goldfinch, waiting as ever, challenged: “SEE\nME?” Freckles saw the dainty swaying grace of the Angel instead. What\nis a man to do with an Angel who dismembers herself and scatters over a\nwhole swamp, thrusting a vivid reminder upon him at every turn?\n\nFreckles counted the days. This first one he could do little but test\nhis wires, sing broken snatches, and dream; but before the week would\nbring her again he could do many things. He would carry all his books\nto the swamp to show to her. He would complete his flower bed, arrange\nevery detail he had planned for his room, and make of it a bower fairies\nmight envy. He must devise a way to keep water cool. He would ask Mrs.\nDuncan for a double lunch and an especially nice one the day of her next\ncoming, so that if the Bird Woman happened to be late, the Angel might\nnot suffer from thirst and hunger. He would tell her to bring heavy\nleather leggings, so that he might take her on a trip around the trail.\nShe should make friends with all of his chickens and see their nests.\n\nOn the line he talked of her incessantly.\n\n“You needn't be thinking,” he said to the goldfinch, “that because I'm\ncoming down this line alone day after day, it's always to be so. Some of\nthese times you'll be swinging on this wire, and you'll see me coming,\nand you'll swing, skip, and flirt yourself around, and chip up right\nspunky: 'SEE ME?' I'll be saying 'See you? Oh, Lord! See her!' You'll\nlook, and there she'll stand. The sunshine won't look gold any more, or\nthe roses pink, or the sky blue, because she'll be the pinkest, bluest,\ngoldest thing of all. You'll be yelling yourself hoarse with the\njealousy of her. The sawbird will stretch his neck out of joint, and\nshe'll turn the heads of all the flowers. Wherever she goes, I can\ngo back afterward and see the things she's seen, walk the path she's\nwalked, hear the grasses whispering over all she's said; and if there's\na place too swampy for her bits of feet; Holy Mother! Maybe--maybe she'd\nbe putting the beautiful arms of her around me neck and letting me carry\nher over!”\n\nFreckles shivered as with a chill. He sent the cudgel whirling skyward,\ndexterously caught it, and set it spinning.\n\n“You damned presumptuous fool!” he cried. “The thing for you to be\nthinking of would be to stretch in the muck for the feet of her to be\nwalking over, and then you could hold yourself holy to be even of that\nservice to her.\n\n“Maybe she'll be wanting the cup me blue-and-brown chickens raised their\nbabies in. Perhaps she'd like to stop at the pool and see me bullfrog\nthat had the goodness to take on human speech to show me the way out of\nme trouble. If there's any feathers falling that day, why, it's from the\nwings of me chickens--it's sure to be, for the only Angel outside the\ngates will be walking this timberline, and every step of the way I'll be\nholding me breath and praying that she don't unfold wings and sail away\nbefore the hungry eyes of me.”\n\nSo Freckles dreamed his dreams, made his plans, and watched his line.\nHe counted not only the days, but the hours of each day. As he told them\noff, every one bringing her closer, he grew happier in the prospect of\nher coming. He managed daily to leave some offering at the big elm log\nfor his black chickens. He slipped under the line at every passing, and\nwent to make sure that nothing was molesting them. Though it was a long\ntrip, he paid them several extra visits a day for fear a snake, hawk, or\nfox might have found the baby. For now his chickens not only represented\nall his former interest in them, but they furnished the inducement that\nwas bringing his Angel.\n\nPossibly he could find other subjects that the Bird Woman wanted. The\nteamster had said that his brother went after her every time he found\na nest. He never had counted the nests that he knew of, and it might be\nthat among all the birds of the swamp some would be rare to her.\n\nThe feathered folk of the Limberlost were practically undisturbed save\nby their natural enemies. It was very probable that among his chickens\nothers as odd as the big black ones could be found. If she wanted\npictures of half-grown birds, he could pick up fifty in one morning's\ntrip around the line, for he had fed, handled, and made friends with\nthem ever since their eyes opened.\n\nHe had gathered bugs and worms all spring as he noticed them on the\ngrass and bushes, and dropped them into the first little open mouth he\nhad found. The babies gladly had accepted this queer tri-parent addition\nto their natural providers.\n\nWhen the week had passed, Freckles had his room crisp and glowing\nwith fresh living things that represented every color of the swamp. He\ncarried bark and filled all the muckiest places of the trail.\n\nIt was middle July. The heat of the past few days had dried the water\naround and through the Limberlost, so that it was possible to cross it\non foot in almost any direction--if one had an idea of direction and did\nnot become completely lost in its rank tangle of vegetation and bushes.\nThe brighter-hued flowers were opening. The trumpet-creepers were\nflaunting their gorgeous horns of red and gold sweetness from the tops\nof lordly oak and elm, and below entire pools were pink-sheeted in\nmallow bloom.\n\nThe heat was doing one other thing that was bound to make Freckles, as a\ngood Irishman, shiver. As the swale dried, its inhabitants were seeking\nthe cooler depths of the swamp. They liked neither the heat nor leaving\nthe field mice, moles, and young rabbits of their chosen location. He\nsaw them crossing the trail every day as the heat grew intense. The\nrattlers were sadly forgetting their manners, for they struck on no\nprovocation whatever, and did not even remember to rattle afterward.\nDaily Freckles was compelled to drive big black snakes and blue racers\nfrom the nests of his chickens. Often the terrified squalls of the\nparent birds would reach him far down the line and he would run to\nrescue the babies.\n\nHe saw the Angel when the carriage turned from the corduroy into the\nclearing. They stopped at the west entrance to the swamp, waiting for\nhim to precede them down the trail, as he had told them it was safest\nfor the horse that he should do. They followed the east line to a point\nopposite the big chickens' tree, and Freckles carried in the cameras and\nshowed the Bird Woman a path he had cleared to the log. He explained to\nher the effect the heat was having on the snakes, and creeping back to\nLittle Chicken, brought him to the light. As she worked at setting up\nher camera, he told her of the birds of the line, while she stared at\nhim, wide-eyed and incredulous.\n\nThey arranged that Freckles should drive the carriage into the east\nentrance in the shade and then take the horse toward the north to a\nbetter place he knew. Then he was to entertain the Angel at his study or\non the line until the Bird Woman finished her work and came to them.\n\n“This will take only a little time,” she said. “I know where to set the\ncamera now, and Little Chicken is big enough to be good and too small\nto run away or to act very ugly, so I will be coming soon to see about\nthose nests. I have ten plates along, and I surely won't use more\nthan two on him; so perhaps I can get some nests or young birds this\nmorning.”\n\nFreckles almost flew, for his dream had come true so soon. He was\nwalking the timber-line and the Angel was following him. He asked to be\nexcused for going first, because he wanted to be sure the trail was safe\nfor her. She laughed at his fears, telling him that it was the polite\nthing for him to do, anyway.\n\n“Oh!” said Freckles, “so you was after knowing that? Well, I didn't\ns'pose you did, and I was afraid you'd think me wanting in respect to be\npreceding you!”\n\nThe astonished Angel looked at him, caught the irrepressible gleam of\nIrish fun in his eyes, so they stood and laughed together.\n\nFreckles did not realize how he was talking that morning. He showed her\nmany of the beautiful nests and eggs of the line. She could identify a\nnumber of them, but of some she was ignorant, so they made notes of the\nnumber and color of the eggs, material, and construction of nest, color,\nsize, and shape of the birds, and went to find them in the book.\n\nAt his room, when Freckles had lifted the overhanging bushes and stepped\nback for her to enter, his heart was all out of time and place. The\nstudy was vastly more beautiful than a week previous. The Angel drew a\ndeep breath and stood gazing first at one side, then at another,\nthen far down the cathedral aisle. “It's just fairyland!” she cried\necstatically. Then she turned and stared at Freckles as she had at his\nhandiwork.\n\n“What are you planning to be?” she asked wonderingly.\n\n“Whatever Mr. McLean wants me to,” he replied.\n\n“What do you do most?” she asked.\n\n“Watch me lines.”\n\n“I don't mean work!”\n\n“Oh, in me spare time I keep me room and study in me books.”\n\n“Do you work on the room or the books most?”\n\n“On the room only what it takes to keep it up, and the rest of the time\non me books.”\n\nThe Angel studied him closely. “Well, maybe you are going to be a great\nscholar,” she said, “but you don't look it. Your face isn't right for\nthat, but it's got something big in it--something really great. I\nmust find out what it is and then you must work on it. Your father is\nexpecting you to do something. One can tell by the way he talks. You\nshould begin right away. You've wasted too much time already.”\n\nPoor Freckles hung his head. He never had wasted an hour in his life.\nThere never had been one that was his to waste.\n\nThe Angel, studying him intently, read the thought in his face. “Oh,\nI don't mean that!” she cried, with the frank dismay of sixteen.\n“Of course, you're not lazy! No one ever would think that from your\nappearance. It's this I mean: there is something fine, strong, and full\nof power in your face. There is something you are to do in this\nworld, and no matter how you work at all these other things, or how\nsuccessfully you do them, it is all wasted until you find the ONE THING\nthat you can do best. If you hadn't a thing in the world to keep you,\nand could go anywhere you please and do anything you want, what would\nyou do?” persisted the Angel.\n\n“I'd go to Chicago and sing in the First Episcopal choir,” answered\nFreckles promptly.\n\nThe Angel dropped on a seat--the hat she had removed and held in her\nfingers rolled to her feet. “There!” she exclaimed vehemently. “You can\nsee what I'm going to be. Nothing! Absolutely nothing! You can sing? Of\ncourse you can sing! It is written all over you.”\n\n“Anyone with half wit could have seen he could sing, without having to\nbe told,” she thought. “It's in the slenderness of his fingers and his\nquick nervous touch. It is in the brightness of his hair, the fire of\nhis eyes, the breadth of his chest, the muscles of his throat and neck;\nand above all, it's in every tone of his voice, for even as he speak\nit's the sweetest sound I ever heard from the throat of a mortal.”\n\n“Will you do something for me?” she asked.\n\n“I'll do anything in the world you want me to,” said Freckles largely,\n“and if I can't do what you want, I'll go to work at once and I'll try\n'til I can.”\n\n“Good! That's business!” said the Angel. “You go over there and stand\nbefore that hedge and sing something. Just anything you think of first.”\n\nFreckles faced the Angel from his banked wall of brown, blue, and\ncrimson, with its background of solid green, and lifting his face to\nthe sky, he sang the first thing that came into his mind. It was a\nchildren's song that he had led for the little folks at the Home many\ntimes, recalled to his mind by the Angel's exclamation:\n\n     “To fairyland we go,\n     With a song of joy, heigh-o.\n     In dreams we'll stand upon that shore\n     And all the realm behold;\n     We'll see the sights so grand\n     That belong to fairyland,\n     Its mysteries we will explore,\n     Its beauties will unfold.\n\n     “Oh, tra, la, la, oh, ha, ha, ha!\n     We're happy now as we can be,\n     Our welcome song we will prolong,\n     And greet you with our melody.\n     O fairyland, sweet fairyland,\n     We love to sing----”\n\n\nNo song could have given the intense sweetness and rollicking quality\nof Freckles' voice better scope. He forgot everything but pride in his\nwork. He was singing the chorus, and the Angel was shivering in ecstasy,\nwhen clip! clip! came the sharply beating feet of a swiftly ridden horse\ndown the trail from the north. They both sprang toward the entrance.\n\n“Freckles! Freckles!” called the voice of the Bird Woman.\n\nThey were at the trail on the instant.\n\n“Both those revolvers loaded?” she asked.\n\n“Yes,” said Freckles.\n\n“Is there a way you can cut across the swamp and reach the chicken tree\nin a few minutes, and with little noise?”\n\n“Yes.”\n\n“Then go flying,” said the Bird Woman. “Give the Angel a lift behind me,\nand we will ride the horse back where you left him and wait for you. I\nfinished Little Chicken in no time and put him back. His mother came so\nclose, I felt sure she would enter the log. The light was fine, so I set\nand focused the camera and covered it with branches, attached the long\nhose, and went away over a hundred feet and hid in some bushes to wait.\nA short, stout man and a tall, dark one passed me so closely I almost\ncould have reached out and touched them. They carried a big saw on their\nshoulders. They said they could work until near noon, and then they must\nlay off until you passed and then try to load and get out at night. They\nwent on--not entirely from sight--and began cutting a tree. Mr. McLean\ntold me the other day what would probably happen here, and if they fell\nthat tree he loses his wager on you. Keep to the east and north and\nhustle. We'll meet you at the carriage. I always am armed. Give Angel\none of your revolvers, and you keep the other. We will separate and\ncreep toward them from different sides and give them a fusillade that\nwill send them flying. You hurry, now!”\n\nShe lifted the reins and started briskly down the trail. The Angel,\nhatless and with sparkling eyes, was clinging around her waist.\n\nFreckles wheeled and ran. He worked his way with much care, dodging\nlimbs and bushes with noiseless tread, and cutting as closely where\nhe thought the men were as he felt that he dared if he were to remain\nunseen. As he ran he tried to think. It was Wessner, burning for his\nrevenge, aided by the bully of the locality, that he was going to meet.\nHe was accustomed to that thought but not to the complication of having\ntwo women on his hands who undoubtedly would have to be taken care of in\nspite of the Bird Woman's offer to help him. His heart was jarring as it\nnever had before with running. He must follow the Bird Woman's plan and\nmeet them at the carriage, but if they really did intend to try to help\nhim, he must not allow it. Allow the Angel to try to handle a revolver\nin his defence? Never! Not for all the trees in the Limberlost! She\nmight shoot herself. She might forget to watch sharply and run across\na snake that was not particularly well behaved that morning. Freckles\npermitted himself a grim smile as he went speeding on.\n\nWhen he reached the carriage, the Bird Woman and the Angel had the horse\nhitched, the outfit packed, and were calmly waiting. The Bird Woman held\na revolver in her hand. She wore dark clothing. They had pinned a big\nfocusing cloth over the front of the Angel's light dress.\n\n“Give Angel one of your revolvers, quick!” said the Bird Woman. “We will\ncreep up until we are in fair range. The underbrush is so thick and they\nare so busy that they will never notice us, if we don't make a noise.\nYou fire first, then I will pop in from my direction, and then you,\nAngel, and shoot quite high, or else very low. We mustn't really hit\nthem. We'll go close enough to the cowards to make it interesting, and\nkeep it up until we have them going.”\n\nFreckles protested.\n\nThe Bird Woman reached over, and, taking the smaller revolver from his\nbelt, handed it to the Angel. “Keep your nerve steady, dear; watch where\nyou step, and shoot high,” she said. “Go straight at them from where you\nare. Wait until you hear Freckles' first shot, then follow me as closely\nas you can, to let them know that we outnumber them. If you want to save\nMcLean's wager on you, now you go!” she commanded Freckles, who, with an\nagonized glance at the Angel, ran toward the east.\n\nThe Bird Woman chose the middle distance, and for a last time cautioned\nthe Angel as she moved away to lie down and shoot high.\n\nThrough the underbrush the Bird Woman crept even more closely than she\nhad intended, found a clear range, and waited for Freckles' shot. There\nwas one long minute of sickening suspense. The men straightened for\nbreath. Work was difficult with a handsaw in the heat of the swamp. As\nthey rested, the big dark fellow took a bottle from his pocket and began\noiling the saw.\n\n“We got to keep mighty quiet,” he said, “and wait to fell it until that\ndamned guard has gone to his dinner.”\n\nAgain they bent to their work. Freckles' revolver spat fire. Lead\nspanged on steel. The saw-handle flew from Wessner's hand and he reeled\nfrom the jar of the shock. Black Jack straightened, uttering a fearful\noath. The hat sailed from his head from the far northeast. The Angel\nhad not waited for the Bird Woman, and her shot scarcely could have been\ncalled high. At almost the same instant the third shot whistled from the\neast. Black Jack sprang into the air with a yell of complete panic, for\nit ripped a heel from his boot. Freckles emptied his second chamber, and\nthe earth spattered over Wessner. Shots poured in rapidly. Without\neven reaching for a weapon, both men ran toward the east road in great\nleaping bounds, while leaden slugs sung and hissed around them in deadly\nearnest.\n\nFreckles was trimming his corners as closely as he dared, but if the\nAngel did not really intend to hit, she was taking risks in a scandalous\nmanner.\n\nWhen the men reached the trail, Freckles yelled at the top of his voice:\n“Head them off on the south, boys! Fire from the south!”\n\nAs he had hoped, Jack and Wessner instantly plunged into the swale. A\nspattering of lead followed them. They crossed the swale, running low,\nwith not even one backward glance, and entered the woods beyond the\ncorduroy.\n\nThen the little party gathered at the tree.\n\n“I'd better fix this saw so they can't be using it if they come back,”\n said Freckles, taking out his hatchet and making saw-teeth fly.\n\n“Now we must leave here without being seen,” said the Bird Woman to the\nAngel. “It won't do for me to make enemies of these men, for I am likely\nto meet them while at work any day.”\n\n“You can do it by driving straight north on this road,” said Freckles.\n“I will go ahead and cut the wires for you. The swale is almost dry.\nYou will only be sinking a little. In a few rods you will strike a\ncornfield. I will take down the fence and let you into that. Follow the\nfurrows and drive straight across it until you come to the other side.\nBe following the fence south until you come to a road through the woods\neast of it. Then take that road and follow east until you reach the\npike. You will come out on your way back to town, and two miles north\nof anywhere they are likely to be. Don't for your lives ever let it out\nthat you did this,” he earnestly cautioned, “for it's black enemies you\nwould be making.”\n\nFreckles clipped the wires and they drove through. The Angel leaned\nfrom the carriage and held out his revolver. Freckles looked at her in\nsurprise. Her eyes were black, while her face was a deeper rose than\nusual. He felt that his own was white.\n\n“Did I shoot high enough?” she asked sweetly. “I really forgot about\nlying down.”\n\nFreckles winced. Did the child know how close she had gone? Surely she\ncould not! Or was it possible that she had the nerve and skill to fire\nlike that purposely?\n\n“I will send the first reliable man I meet for McLean,” said the Bird\nWoman, gathering up the lines. “If I don't meet one when we reach town,\nwe will send a messenger. If it wasn't for having the gang see me, I\nwould go myself; but I will promise you that you will have help in a\nlittle over two hours. You keep well hidden. They must think some of the\ngang is with you now. There isn't a chance that they will be back,\nbut don't run any risks. Remain under cover. If they should come, it\nprobably would be for their saw.” She laughed as at a fine joke.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VII\n\nWherein Freckles Wins Honor and Finds a Footprint on the Trail\n\nRound-eyed, Freckles watched the Bird Woman and the Angel drive away.\nAfter they were from sight and he was safely hidden among the branches\nof a small tree, he remembered that he neither had thanked them nor said\ngood-bye. Considering what they had been through, they never would come\nagain. His heart sank until he had palpitation in his wading-boots.\n\nStretching the length of the limb, he thought deeply, though he was not\nthinking of Black Jack or Wessner. Would the Bird Woman and the Angel\ncome again? No other woman whom he ever had known would. But did they\nresemble any other women he ever had known? He thought of the Bird\nWoman's unruffled face and the Angel's revolver practice, and presently\nhe was not so sure that they would not return.\n\nWhat were the people in the big world like? His knowledge was so very\nlimited. There had been people at the Home, who exchanged a stilted,\nperfunctory kindness for their salaries. The visitors who called on\nreceiving days he had divided into three classes: the psalm-singing\nkind, who came with a tear in the eye and hypocrisy in every feature\nof their faces; the kind who dressed in silks and jewels, and handed to\nthose poor little mother-hungry souls worn toys that their children\nno longer cared for, in exactly the same spirit in which they pitched\nbiscuits to the monkeys at the zoo, and for the same reason--to see how\nthey would take them and be amused by what they would do; and the third\nclass, whom he considered real people. They made him feel they cared\nthat he was there, and that they would have been glad to see him\nelsewhere.\n\nNow here was another class, that had all they needed of the world's best\nand were engaged in doing work that counted. They had things worth while\nto be proud of; and they had met him as a son and brother. With them he\ncould, for the only time in his life, forget the lost hand that every\nday tortured him with a new pang. What kind of people were they and\nwhere did they belong among the classes he knew? He failed to decide,\nbecause he never had known others similar to them; but how he loved\nthem!\n\nIn the world where he was going soon, were the majority like them, or\nwere they of the hypocrite and bun-throwing classes?\n\nHe had forgotten the excitement of the morning and the passing of time\nwhen distant voices aroused him, and he gently lifted his head. Nearer\nand nearer they came, and as the heavy wagons rumbled down the east\ntrail he could hear them plainly. The gang were shouting themselves\nhoarse for the Limberlost guard. Freckles did not feel that he deserved\nit. He would have given much to be able to go to the men and explain,\nbut to McLean only could he tell his story.\n\nAt the sight of Freckles the men threw up their hats and cheered. McLean\nshook hands with him warmly, but big Duncan gathered him into his arms\nand hugged him as a bear and choked over a few words of praise. The gang\ndrove in and finished felling the tree. McLean was angry beyond measure\nat this attempt on his property, for in their haste to fell the tree\nthe thieves had cut too high and wasted a foot and a half of valuable\ntimber.\n\nWhen the last wagon rolled away, McLean sat on the stump and Freckles\ntold the story he was aching to tell. The Boss scarcely could believe\nhis senses. Also, he was much disappointed.\n\n“I have been almost praying all the way over, Freckles,” he said, “that\nyou would have some evidence by which we could arrest those fellows and\nget them out of our way, but this will never do. We can't mix up those\nwomen in it. They have helped you save me the tree and my wager as well.\nGoing across the country as she does, the Bird Woman never could be\nexpected to testify against them.”\n\n“No, indeed; nor the Angel, either, sir,” said Freckles.\n\n“The Angel?” queried the astonished McLean.\n\nThe Boss listened in silence while Freckles told of the coming and\nchristening of the Angel.\n\n“I know her father well,” said McLean at last, “and I have often seen\nher. You are right; she is a beautiful young girl, and she appears to be\nutterly free from the least particle of false pride or foolishness. I do\nnot understand why her father risks such a jewel in this place.”\n\n“He's daring it because she is a jewel, sir,” said Freckles, eagerly.\n“Why, she's trusting a rattlesnake to rattle before it strikes her, and\nof course, she thinks she can trust mankind as well. The man isn't made\nwho wouldn't lay down the life of him for her. She doesn't need any\ncare. Her face and the pretty ways of her are all the protection she\nwould need in a band of howling savages.”\n\n“Did you say she handled one of the revolvers?” asked McLean.\n\n“She scared all the breath out of me body,” admitted Freckles. “Seems\nthat her father has taught her to shoot. The Bird Woman told her\ndistinctly to lie low and blaze away high, just to help scare them. The\nspunky little thing followed them right out into the west road, spitting\nlead like hail, and clipping all around the heads and heels of them; and\nI'm damned, sir, if I believe she'd cared a rap if she'd hit. I never\nsaw much shooting, but if that wasn't the nearest to miss I ever want to\nsee! Scared the life near out of me body with the fear that she'd drop\none of them. As long as I'd no one to help me but a couple of women that\ndidn't dare be mixed up in it, all I could do was to let them get away.”\n\n“Now, will they come back?” asked McLean.\n\n“Of course!” said Freckles. “They're not going to be taking that. You\ncould stake your life on it, they'll be coming back. At least, Black\nJack will. Wessner may not have the pluck, unless he is half drunk. Then\nhe'd be a terror. And the next time--” Freckles hesitated.\n\n“What?”\n\n“It will be a question of who shoots first and straightest.”\n\n“Then the only thing for me to do is to double the guard and bring the\ngang here the first minute possible. As soon as I feel that we have the\nrarest of the stuff out below, we will come. The fact is, in many cases,\nuntil it is felled it's difficult to tell what a tree will prove to\nbe. It won't do to leave you here longer alone. Jack has been shooting\ntwenty years to your one, and it stands to reason that you are no match\nfor him. Who of the gang would you like best to have with you?”\n\n“No one, sir,” said Freckles emphatically. “Next time is where I run.\nI won't try to fight them alone. I'll just be getting wind of them, and\nthen make tracks for you. I'll need to come like lightning, and Duncan\nhas no extra horse, so I'm thinking you'd best get me one--or perhaps a\nwheel would be better. I used to do extra work for the Home doctor, and\nhe would let me take his bicycle to ride around the place. And at times\nthe head nurse would loan me his for an hour. A wheel would cost less\nand be faster than a horse, and would take less care. I believe, if you\nare going to town soon, you had best pick up any kind of an old one\nat some second-hand store, for if I'm ever called to use it in a hurry\nthere won't be the handlebars left after crossing the corduroy.”\n\n“Yes,” said McLean; “and if you didn't have a first-class wheel, you\nnever could cross the corduroy on it at all.”\n\nAs they walked to the cabin, McLean insisted on another guard, but\nFreckles was stubbornly set on fighting his battle alone. He made one\nmental condition. If the Bird Woman was going to give up the Little\nChicken series, he would yield to the second guard, solely for the sake\nof her work and the presence of the Angel in the Limberlost. He did not\npropose to have a second man unless it were absolutely necessary, for\nhe had been alone so long that he loved the solitude, his chickens,\nand flowers. The thought of having a stranger to all his ways come and\nmeddle with his arrangements, frighten his pets, pull his flowers,\nand interrupt him when he wanted to study, so annoyed him that he was\nblinded to his real need for help.\n\nWith McLean it was a case of letting his sober, better judgment be\noverridden by the boy he was growing so to love that he could not endure\nto oppose him, and to have Freckles keep his trust and win alone meant\nmore than any money the Boss might lose.\n\nThe following morning McLean brought the wheel, and Freckles took it to\nthe trail to test it. It was new, chainless, with as little as possible\nto catch in hurried riding, and in every way the best of its kind.\nFreckles went skimming around the trail on it on a preliminary trip\nbefore he locked it in his case and started his minute examination of\nhis line on foot. He glanced around his room as he left it, and then\nstood staring.\n\nOn the moss before his prettiest seat lay the Angel's hat. In the\nexcitement of yesterday all of them had forgotten it. He went and picked\nit up, oh! so carefully, gazing at it with hungry eyes, but touching it\nonly to carry it to his case, where he hung it on the shining handlebar\nof the new wheel and locked it among his treasures. Then he went to the\ntrail, with a new expression on his face and a strange throbbing in his\nheart. He was not in the least afraid of anything that morning. He felt\nhe was the veriest Daniel, but all his lions seemed weak and harmless.\n\nWhat Black Jack's next move would be he could not imagine, but that\nthere would be a move of some kind was certain. The big bully was not a\nman to give up his purpose, or to have the hat swept from his head\nwith a bullet and bear it meekly. Moreover, Wessner would cling to his\nrevenge with a Dutchman's singleness of mind.\n\nFreckles tried to think connectedly, but there were too many places on\nthe trail where the Angel's footprints were vet visible. She had stepped\nin one mucky spot and left a sharp impression. The afternoon sun had\nbaked it hard, and the horses' hoofs had not obliterated any part of it,\nas they had in so many places. Freckles stood fascinated, gazing at\nit. He measured it lovingly with his eye. He would not have ventured a\ncaress on her hat any more than on her person, but this was different.\nSurely a footprint on a trail might belong to anyone who found and\nwanted it. He stooped under the wires and entered the swamp. With a\nlittle searching, he found a big piece of thick bark loose on a log and\ncarefully peeling it, carried it out and covered the print so that the\nfirst rain would not obliterate it.\n\nWhen he reached his room, he tenderly laid the hat upon his bookshelf,\nand to wear off his awkwardness, mounted his wheel and went spinning on\ntrail again. It was like flying, for the path was worn smooth with his\nfeet and baked hard with the sun almost all the way. When he came to the\nbark, he veered far to one side and smiled at it in passing. Suddenly\nhe was off the wheel, kneeling beside it. He removed his hat, carefully\nlifted the bark, and gazed lovingly at the imprint.\n\n“I wonder what she was going to say of me voice,” he whispered. “She\nnever got it said, but from the face of her, I believe she was liking it\nfairly well. Perhaps she was going to say that singing was the big thing\nI was to be doing. That's what they all thought at the Home. Well, if\nit is, I'll just shut me eyes, think of me little room, the face of her\nwatching, and the heart of her beating, and I'll raise them. Damn them,\nif singing will do it, I'll raise them from the benches!”\n\nWith this dire threat, Freckles knelt, as at a wayside spring, and\ndeliberately laid his lips on the footprint. Then he arose, appearing as\nif he had been drinking at the fountain of gladness.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VIII\n\nWherein Freckles Meets a Man of Affairs and Loses Nothing by the\nEncounter\n\n“Weel, I be drawed on!” exclaimed Mrs. Duncan.\n\nFreckles stood before her, holding the Angel's hat.\n\n“I've been thinking this long time that ye or Duncan would see that\nsunbonnets werena braw enough for a woman of my standing, and ye're a\nguid laddie to bring me this beautiful hat.”\n\nShe turned it around, examining the weave of the straw and the foliage\ntrimmings, passing her rough fingers over the satin ties delightedly. As\nshe held it up, admiring it, Freckles' astonished eyes saw a new side of\nSarah Duncan. She was jesting, but under the jest the fact loomed strong\nthat, though poor, overworked, and with none but God-given refinement,\nthere was something in her soul crying after that bit of feminine\nfinery, and it made his heart ache for her. He resolved that when he\nreached the city he would send her a hat, if it took fifty dollars to do\nit.\n\nShe lingeringly handed it back to him.\n\n“It's unco guid of ye to think of me,” she said lightly, “but I maun\nquestion your taste a wee. D'ye no think ye had best return this and get\na woman with half her hair gray a little plainer headdress? Seems like\nthat's far ower gay for me. I'm no' saying that it's no' exactly what\nI'd like to hae, but I mauna mak mysel' ridiculous. Ye'd best give this\nto somebody young and pretty, say about sixteen. Where did ye come by\nit, Freckles? If there's anything been dropping lately, ye hae forgotten\nto mention it.”\n\n“Do you see anything heavenly about that hat?” queried Freckles, holding\nit up.\n\nThe morning breeze waved the ribbons gracefully, binding one around\nFreckles' sleeve and the other across his chest, where they caught and\nclung as if magnetized.\n\n“Yes,” said Sarah Duncan. “It's verra plain and simple, but it juist\nmakes ye feel that it's all of the finest stuff. It's exactly what I'd\ncall a heavenly hat.”\n\n“Sure,” said Freckles, “for it's belonging to an Angel!”\n\nThen he told her about the hat and asked her what he should do with it.\n\n“Take it to her, of course!” said Sarah Duncan. “Like it's the only ane\nshe has and she may need it badly.”\n\nFreckles smiled. He had a clear idea about the hat being the only one\nthe Angel had. However, there was a thing he felt he should do and\nwanted to do, but he was not sure.\n\n“You think I might be taking it home?” he said.\n\n“Of course ye must,” said Mrs. Duncan. “And without another hour's\ndelay. It's been here two days noo, and she may want it, and be too busy\nor afraid to come.”\n\n“But how can I take it?” asked Freckles.\n\n“Gang spinning on your wheel. Ye can do it easy in an hour.”\n\n“But in that hour, what if----?”\n\n“Nonsense!” interrupted Sarah Duncan. “Ye've watched that timber-line\nuntil ye're grown fast to it, lad. Give me your boots and club and I'll\ngae walk the south end and watch doon the east and west sides until ye\ncome back.”\n\n“Mrs. Duncan! You never would be doing it,” cried Freckles.\n\n“Why not?” inquired she.\n\n“But you know you're mortal afraid of snakes and a lot of other things\nin the swamp.”\n\n“I am afraid of snakes,” said Mrs. Duncan, “but likely they've gone into\nthe swamp this hot weather. I'll juist stay on the trail and watch, and\nye might hurry the least bit. The day's so bright it feels like storm. I\ncan put the bairns on the woodpile to play until I get back. Ye gang awa\nand take the blessed little angel her beautiful hat.”\n\n“Are you sure it will be all right?” urged Freckles. “Do you think if\nMr. McLean came he would care?”\n\n“Na,” said Mrs. Duncan; “I dinna. If ye and me agree that a thing ought\nto be done, and I watch in your place, why, it's bound to be all right\nwith McLean. Let me pin the hat in a paper, and ye jump on your wheel\nand gang flying. Ought ye put on your Sabbath-day clothes?”\n\nFreckles shook his head. He knew what he should do, but there was no\nuse in taking time to try to explain it to Mrs. Duncan while he was so\nhurried. He exchanged his wading-boots for shoes, gave her his club, and\nwent spinning toward town. He knew very well where the Angel lived.\nHe had seen her home many times, and he passed it again without even\nraising his eyes from the street, steering straight for her father's\nplace of business.\n\nCarrying the hat, Freckles passed a long line of clerks, and at the door\nof the private office asked to see the proprietor. When he had waited\na moment, a tall, spare, keen-eyed man faced him, and in brisk, nervous\ntones asked: “How can I serve you, sir?”\n\nFreckles handed him the package and answered, “By delivering to your\ndaughter this hat, which she was after leaving at me place the other\nday, when she went away in a hurry. And by saying to her and the Bird\nWoman that I'm more thankful than I'll be having words to express for\nthe brave things they was doing for me. I'm McLean's Limberlost guard,\nsir.”\n\n“Why don't you take it yourself?” questioned the Man of Affairs.\n\nFreckles' clear gray eyes met those of the Angel's father squarely, and\nhe asked: “If you were in my place, would you take it to her yourself?”\n\n“No, I would not,” said that gentleman quickly.\n\n“Then why ask why I did not?” came Freckles' lamb-like query.\n\n“Bless me!” said the Angel's father. He stared at the package, then at\nthe lifted chin of the boy, and then at the package again, and muttered,\n“Excuse me!”\n\nFreckles bowed.\n\n“It would be favoring me greatly if you would deliver the hat and the\nmessage. Good morning, sir,” and he turned away.\n\n“One minute,” said the Angel's father. “Suppose I give you permission to\nreturn this hat in person and make your own acknowledgments.”\n\nFreckles stood one moment thinking intently, and then he lifted those\neyes of unswerving truth and asked: “Why should you, sir? You are\nkind, indade, to mention it, and it's thanking you I am for your good\nintintions, but my wanting to go or your being willing to have me ain't\nproving that your daughter would be wanting me or care to bother with\nme.”\n\nThe Angel's father looked keenly into the face of this extraordinary\nyoung man, for he found it to his liking.\n\n“There's one other thing I meant to say,” said Freckles. “Every day I\nsee something, and at times a lot of things, that I think the Bird Woman\nwould be wanting pictures of badly, if she knew. You might be speaking\nof it to her, and if she'd want me to, I can send her word when I find\nthings she wouldn't likely get elsewhere.”\n\n“If that's the case,” said the Angel's father, “and you feel under\nobligations for her assistance the other day, you can discharge them in\nthat way. She is spending all her time in the fields and woods searching\nfor subjects. If you run across things, perhaps rarer than she may find,\nabout your work, it would save her the time she spends searching for\nsubjects, and she could work in security under your protection. By all\nmeans let her know if you find subjects you think she could use, and we\nwill do anything we can for you, if you will give her what help you can\nand see that she is as safe as possible.”\n\n“It's hungry for human beings I am,” said Freckles, “and it's like\nHeaven to me to have them come. Of course, I'll be telling or sending\nher word every time me work can spare me. Anything I can do it would\nmake me uncommon happy, but”--again truth had to be told, because it was\nFreckles who was speaking--“when it comes to protecting them, I'd risk\nme life, to be sure, but even that mightn't do any good in some cases.\nThere are many dangers to be reckoned with in the swamp, sir, that call\nfor every person to look sharp. If there wasn't really thieving to guard\nagainst, why, McLean wouldn't need be paying out good money for a guard.\nI'd love them to be coming, and I'll do all I can, but you must be told\nthat there's danger of them running into timber thieves again any day,\nsir.”\n\n“Yes,” said the Angel's father, “and I suppose there's danger of the\nearth opening up and swallowing the town any day, but I'm damned if\nI quit business for fear it will, and the Bird Woman won't, either.\nEveryone knows her and her work, and there is no danger in the world\nof anyone in any way molesting her, even if he were stealing a few of\nMcLean's gold-plated trees. She's as safe in the Limberlost as she is at\nhome, so far as timber thieves are concerned. All I am ever uneasy about\nare the snakes, poison-vines, and insects; and those are risks she must\nrun anywhere. You need not hesitate a minute about that. I shall be glad\nto tell them what you wish. Thank you very much, and good day, sir.”\n\nThere was no way in which Freckles could know it, but by following his\nbest instincts and being what he conceived a gentleman should be, he\nsurprised the Man of Affairs into thinking of him and seeing his face\nover his books many times that morning; whereas, if he had gone to the\nAngel as he had longed to do, her father never would have given him a\nsecond thought.\n\nOn the street he drew a deep breath. How had he acquitted himself? He\nonly knew that he had lived up to his best impulse, and that is all\nanyone can do. He glanced over his wheel to see that it was all right,\nand just as he stepped to the curb to mount he heard a voice that\nthrilled him through and through: “Freckles! Oh Freckles!”\n\nThe Angel separated from a group of laughing, sweet-faced girls and came\nhurrying to him. She was in snowy white--a quaint little frock, with\na marvel of soft lace around her throat and wrists. Through the sheer\nsleeves of it her beautiful, rounded arms showed distinctly, and it was\ncut just to the base of her perfect neck. On her head was a pure white\ncreation of fancy braid, with folds on folds of tulle, soft and silken\nas cobwebs, lining the brim; while a mass of white roses clustered\nagainst the gold of her hair, crept around the crown, and fell in a riot\nto her shoulders at the back. There were gleams of gold with settings\nof blue on her fingers, and altogether she was the daintiest, sweetest\nsight he ever had seen. Freckles, standing on the curb, forgot himself\nin his cotton shirt, corduroys, and his belt to which his wire-cutter\nand pliers were hanging, and gazed as a man gazes when first he sees\nthe woman he adores with all her charms enhanced by appropriate and\nbeautiful clothing.\n\n“Oh Freckles,” she cried as she came to him. “I was wondering about you\nthe other day. Do you know I never saw you in town before. You watch\nthat old line so closely! Why did you come? Is there any trouble? Are\nyou just starting to the Limberlost?”\n\n“I came to bring your hat,” said Freckles. “You forgot it in the rush\nthe other day. I have left it with your father, and a message trying\nto ixpriss the gratitude of me for how you and the Bird Woman were for\nhelping me out.”\n\nThe Angel nodded gravely, then Freckles saw that he had done the proper\nthing in going to her father. His heart bounded until it jarred his\nbody, for she was saying that she scarcely could wait for the time to\ncome for the next picture of the Little Chicken series. “I want to hear\nthe remainder of that song, and I hadn't even begun seeing your room\nyet,” she complained. “As for singing, if you can sing like that every\nday, I never can get enough of it. I wonder if I couldn't bring my banjo\nand some of the songs I like best. I'll play and you sing, and we'll put\nthe birds out of commission.”\n\nFreckles stood on the curb with drooped eyes, for he felt that if\nhe lifted them the tumult of tender adoration in them would show and\nfrighten her.\n\n“I was afraid your ixperience the other day would scare you so that\nyou'd never be coming again,” he found himself saying.\n\nThe Angel laughed gaily.\n\n“Did I seem scared?” she questioned.\n\n“No,” said Freckles, “you did not.”\n\n“Oh, I just enjoyed that,” she cried. “Those hateful, stealing old\nthings! I had a big notion to pink one of them, but I thought maybe\nsomeway it would be best for you that I shouldn't. They needed it. That\ndidn't scare me; and as for the Bird Woman, she's accustomed to finding\nsnakes, tramps, cross dogs, sheep, cattle, and goodness knows what! You\ncan't frighten her when she's after a picture. Did they come back?”\n\n“No,” said Freckles. “The gang got there a little after noon and took\nout the tree, but I must tell you, and you must tell the Bird Woman,\nthat there's no doubt but they will be coming back, and they will have\nto make it before long now, for it's soon the gang will be there to work\non the swamp.”\n\n“Oh, what a shame!” cried the Angel. “They'll clear out roads, cut down\nthe beautiful trees, and tear up everything. They'll drive away the\nbirds and spoil the cathedral. When they have done their worst, then\nall these mills close here will follow in and take out the cheap timber.\nThen the landowners will dig a few ditches, build some fires, and in two\nsummers more the Limberlost will be in corn and potatoes.”\n\nThey looked at each other, and groaned despairingly in unison.\n\n“You like it, too,” said Freckles.\n\n“Yes,” said the Angel, “I love it. Your room is a little piece right out\nof the heart of fairyland, and the cathedral is God's work, not yours.\nYou only found it and opened the door after He had it completed. The\nbirds, flowers, and vines are all so lovely. The Bird Woman says it is\nreally a fact that the mallows, foxfire, iris, and lilies are larger and\nof richer coloring there than in the remainder of the country. She says\nit's because of the rich loam and muck. I hate seeing the swamp torn up,\nand to you it will be like losing your best friend; won't it?”\n\n“Something like,” said Freckles. “Still, I've the Limberlost in me heart\nso that all of it will be real to me while I live, no matter what they\ndo to it. I'm glad past telling if you will be coming a few more times,\nat least until the gang arrives. Past that time I don't allow mesilf to\nbe thinking.”\n\n“Come, have a cool drink before you start back,” said the Angel.\n\n“I couldn't possibly,” said Freckles. “I left Mrs. Duncan on the trail,\nand she's terribly afraid of a lot of things. If she even sees a big\nsnake, I don't know what she'll do.”\n\n“It won't take but a minute, and you can ride fast enough to make up\nfor it. Please. I want to think of something fine for you, to make up a\nlittle for what you did for me that first day.”\n\nFreckles looked in sheer wonderment into the beautiful face of the\nAngel. Did she truly mean it? Would she walk down that street with him,\ncrippled, homely, in mean clothing, with the tools of his occupation on\nhim, and share with him the treat she was offering? He could not believe\nit, even of the Angel. Still, in justice to the candor of her pure,\nsweet face, he would not think that she would make the offer and not\nmean it. She really did mean just what she said, but when it came to\ncarrying out her offer and he saw the stares of her friends, the\nsneers of her enemies--if such as she could have enemies--and heard the\nwhispered jeers of the curious, then she would see her mistake and be\nsorry. It would be only a manly thing for him to think this out, and\nsave her from the results of her own blessed bigness of heart.\n\n“I railly must be off,” said Freckles earnestly, “but I'm thanking you\nmore than you'll ever know for your kindness. I'll just be drinking\nbowls of icy things all me way home in the thoughts of it.”\n\nDown came the Angel's foot. Her eyes flashed indignantly. “There's no\nsense in that,” she said. “How do you think you would have felt when you\nknew I was warm and thirsty and you went and brought me a drink and\nI wouldn't take it because--because goodness knows why! You can ride\nfaster to make up for the time. I've just thought out what I want to fix\nfor you.”\n\nShe stepped to his side and deliberately slipped her hand under his\narm--that right arm that ended in an empty sleeve.\n\n“You are coming,” she said firmly. “I won't have it.”\n\nFreckles could not have told how he felt, neither could anyone else. His\nblood rioted and his head swam, but he kept his wits. He bent over her.\n\n“Please don't, Angel,” he said softly. “You don't understand.”\n\nHow Freckles came to understand was a problem.\n\n“It's this,” he persisted. “If your father met me on the street, in\nmy station and dress, with you on me arm, he'd have every right to be\ncaning me before the people, and not a finger would I lift to stay him.”\n\nThe Angel's eyes snapped. “If you think my father cares about my doing\nanything that is right and kind, and that makes me happy to do--why,\nthen you completely failed in reading my father, and I'll ask him and\njust show you.”\n\nShe dropped Freckles' arm and turned toward the entrance to the\nbuilding. “Why, look there!” she exclaimed.\n\nHer father stood in a big window fronting the street, a bundle of papers\nin his hand, interestedly watching the little scene, with eyes that\ncomprehended quite as thoroughly as if he had heard every word. The\nAngel caught his glance and made a despairing little gesture toward\nFreckles. The Man of Affairs answered her with a look of infinite\ntenderness. He nodded his head and waved the papers in the direction she\nhad indicated, and the veriest dolt could have read the words his lips\nformed: “Take him along!”\n\nA sudden trembling seized Freckles. At sight of the Angel's father he\nhad stepped back as far from her as he could, leaned the wheel against\nhim, and snatched off his hat.\n\nThe Angel turned on him with triumphing eyes.\n\nShe was highly strung and not accustomed to being thwarted. “Did You see\nthat?” she demanded. “Now are you satisfied? Will you come, or must I\ncall a policeman to bring you?”\n\nFreckles went. There was nothing else to do. Guiding his wheel, he\nwalked down the street beside her. On every hand she was kept busy\ngiving and receiving the cheeriest greetings. She walked into the\nparlors exactly as if she owned them. A clerk came hurrying to meet her.\n\n“There's a table vacant beside a window where it is cool. I'll save it\nfor you,” and he started back.\n\n“Please not,” said the Angel. “I've taken this man unawares, when\nhe's in a rush. I'm afraid if we sit down we'll take too much time and\nafterward he will blame me.”\n\nShe walked to the fountain, and a long row of people stared with all the\nvarying degrees of insolence and curiosity that Freckles had felt they\nwould. He glanced at the Angel. NOW would she see?\n\n“On my soul!” he muttered under his breath. “They don't aven touch her!”\n\nShe laid down her sunshade and gloves. She walked to the end of the\ncounter and turned the full battery of her eyes on the attendant.\n\n“Please,” she said.\n\nThe white-aproned individual stepped back and gave delighted assent. The\nAngel stepped beside him, and selecting a tall, flaring glass, of almost\npaper thinness, she stooped and rolled it in a tray of cracked ice.\n\n“I want to mix a drink for my friend,” she said. “He has a long, hot\nride before him, and I don't want him started off with one of those old\npalate-teasing sweetnesses that you mix just on purpose to drive a man\nback in ten minutes.” There was an appreciative laugh from the line at\nthe counter.\n\n“I want a clear, cool, sparkling drink that has a tang of acid in it.\nWhere's the cherry phosphate? That, not at all sweet, would be good;\ndon't you think?”\n\nThe attendant did think. He pointed out the different taps, and the\nAngel compounded the drink, while Freckles, standing so erect he almost\nleaned backward, gazed at her and paid no attention to anyone else. When\nshe had the glass brimming, she tilted a little of its contents into a\nsecond glass and tasted it.\n\n“That's entirely too sweet for a thirsty man,” she said.\n\nShe poured out half the mixture, and refilling the glass, tasted it a\nsecond time. She submitted that result to the attendant. “Isn't that\nabout the thing?” she asked.\n\nHe replied enthusiastically. “I'd get my wages raised ten a month if I\ncould learn that trick.”\n\nThe Angel carried the brimming, frosty glass to Freckles. He removed his\nhat, and lifting the icy liquid even with her eyes and looking straight\ninto them, he said in the mellowest of all the mellow tones of his\nvoice: “I'll be drinking it to the Swamp Angel.”\n\nAs he had said to her that first day, she now cautioned him: “Be\ndrinking slowly.”\n\nWhen the screen-door swung behind them, one of the men at the counter\nasked of the attendant: “Now, what did that mean?”\n\n“Exactly what you saw,” replied he, rather curtly. “We're accustomed\nto it here. Hardly a day passes, this hot weather, but she's picking\nup some poor, god-forsaken mortal and bringing him in. Then she comes\nbehind the counter herself and fixes up a drink to suit the occasion.\nShe's all sorts of fancies about what's what for all kinds of times and\nconditions, and you bet she can just hit the spot! Ain't a clerk here\ncan put up a drink to touch her. She's a sort of knack at it. Every once\nin a while, when the Boss sees her, he calls out to her to mix him a\ndrink.”\n\n“And does she?” asked the man with an interested grin.\n\n“Well, I guess! But first she goes back and sees how long it is since\nhe's had a drink. What he drank last. How warm he is. When he ate last.\nThen she comes here and mixes a glass of fizz with a little touch of\nacid, and a bit of cherry, lemon, grape, pineapple, or something sour\nand cooling, and it hits the spot just as no spot was ever hit before.\nI honestly believe that the INTEREST she takes in it is half the\ntrick, for I watch her closely and I can't come within gunshot of her\nconcoctions. She has a running bill here. Her father settles once a\nmonth. She gives nine-tenths of it away. Hardly ever touches it herself,\nbut when she does she makes me mix it. She's just old persimmons. Even\nthe scrub-boy of this establishment would fight for her. It lasts the\nyear round, for in winter it's some poor, frozen cuss that she's warming\nup on hot coffee or chocolate.”\n\n“Mighty queer specimen she had this time,” volunteered another. “Irish,\nhand off, straight as a ramrod, and something worth while in his face.\nNotice that hat peel off, and the eyes of him? There's a case of 'fight\nfor her!' Wonder who he is?”\n\n“I think,” said a third, “that he's McLean's Limberlost guard, and I\nsuspect she's gone to the swamp with the Bird Woman for pictures and\nknows him that way. I've heard that he is a master hand with the birds,\nand that would just suit the Bird Woman to a T.”\n\nOn the street the Angel walked beside Freckles to the first crossing and\nthere she stopped. “Now, will you promise to ride fast enough to make up\nfor the five minutes that took?” she asked. “I am a little uneasy about\nMrs. Duncan.”\n\nFreckles turned his wheel into the street. It seemed to him he had\npoured that delicious icy liquid into every vein in his body instead of\nhis stomach. It even went to his brain.\n\n“Did you insist on fixing that drink because you knew how intoxicating\n'twould be?” he asked.\n\nThere was subtlety in the compliment and it delighted the Angel. She\nlaughed gleefully.\n\n“Next time, maybe you won't take so much coaxing,” she teased.\n\n“I wouldn't this, if I had known your father and been understanding you\nbetter. Do you really think the Bird Woman will be coming again?”\n\nThe Angel jeered. “Wild horses couldn't drag her away,” she cried. “She\nwill have hard work to wait the week out. I shouldn't be in the least\nsurprised to see her start any hour.”\n\nFreckles could not endure the suspense; it had to come.\n\n“And you?” he questioned, but he dared not lift his eyes.\n\n“Wild horses me, too,” she laughed, “couldn't keep me away either! I\ndearly love to come, and the next time I am going to bring my banjo,\nand I'll play, and you sing for me some of the songs I like best; won't\nyou?”\n\n“Yis,” said Freckles, because it was all he was capable of saying just\nthen.\n\n“It's beginning to act stormy,” she said. “If you hurry you will just\nabout make it. Now, good-bye.”\n\n\n\nCHAPTER IX\n\nWherein the Limberlost Falls upon Mrs. Duncan and Freckles Comes to the\nRescue\n\nFreckles was halfway to the Limberlost when he dismounted. He could ride\nno farther, because he could not see the road. He sat under a tree, and,\nleaning against it, sobs shook, twisted, and rent him. If they would\nremind him of his position, speak condescendingly, or notice his hand,\nhe could endure it, but this--it surely would kill him! His hot, pulsing\nIrish blood was stirred deeply. What did they mean? Why did they do it?\nWere they like that to everyone? Was it pity?\n\nIt could not be, for he knew that the Bird Woman and the Angel's father\nmust know that he was not really McLean's son, and it did not matter\nto them in the least. In spite of accident and poverty, they evidently\nexpected him to do something worth while in the world. That must be his\nremedy. He must work on his education. He must get away. He must find\nand do the great thing of which the Angel talked. For the first time,\nhis thoughts turned anxiously toward the city and the beginning of his\nstudies. McLean and the Duncans spoke of him as “the boy,” but he was\na man. He must face life bravely and act a man's part. The Angel was a\nmere child. He must not allow her to torture him past endurance with her\nfrank comradeship that meant to him high heaven, earth's richness, and\nall that lay between, and NOTHING to her.\n\nThere was an ominous growl of thunder, and amazed at himself, Freckles\nsnatched up his wheel and raced toward the swamp. He was worried to find\nhis boots lying at the cabin door; the children playing on the woodpile\ntold him that “mither” said they were so heavy she couldn't walk in\nthem, and she had come back and taken them off. Thoroughly frightened,\nhe stopped only long enough to slip them on, and then sped with all his\nstrength for the Limberlost. To the west, the long, black, hard-beaten\ntrail lay clear; but far up the east side, straight across the path, he\ncould see what was certainly a limp, brown figure. Freckles spun with\nall his might.\n\nFace down, Sarah Duncan lay across the trail. When Freckles turned her\nover, his blood chilled at the look of horror settled on her face. There\nwas a low humming and something spatted against him. Glancing around,\nFreckles shivered in terror, for there was a swarm of wild bees settled\non a scrub-thorn only a few yards away. The air was filled with excited,\nunsettled bees making ready to lead farther in search of a suitable\nlocation. Then he thought he understood, and with a prayer of\nthankfulness in his heart that she had escaped, even so narrowly, he\ncaught her up and hurried down the trail until they were well out of\ndanger. He laid her in the shade, and carrying water from the swamp\nin the crown of his hat, he bathed her face and hands; but she lay in\nunbroken stillness, without a sign of life.\n\nShe had found Freckles' boots so large and heavy that she had gone back\nand taken them off, although she was mortally afraid to approach the\nswamp without them. The thought of it made her nervous, and the fact\nthat she never had been there alone added to her fears. She had not\nfollowed the trail many rods when her trouble began. She was not\nFreckles, so not a bird of the line was going to be fooled into thinking\nshe was.\n\nThey began jumping from their nests and darting from unexpected places\naround her head and feet, with quick whirs, that kept her starting and\ndodging. Before Freckles was halfway to the town, poor Mrs. Duncan was\nhysterical, and the Limberlost had neither sung nor performed for her.\n\nBut there was trouble brewing. It was quiet and intensely hot, with that\nstifling stillness that precedes a summer storm, and feathers and\nfur were tense and nervous. The birds were singing only a few broken\nsnatches, and flying around, seeking places of shelter. One moment\neverything seemed devoid of life, the next there was an unexpected\nwhir, buzz, and sharp cry. Inside, a pandemonium of growling, spatting,\nsnarling, and grunting broke loose.\n\nThe swale bent flat before heavy gusts of wind, and the big black\nchicken swept lower and lower above the swamp. Patches of clouds\ngathered, shutting out the sun and making it very dark, and the next\nmoment were swept away. The sun poured with fierce, burning brightness,\nand everything was quiet. It was at the first growl of thunder that\nFreckles really had noticed the weather, and putting his own troubles\naside resolutely, raced for the swamp.\n\nSarah Duncan paused on the line. “Weel, I wouldna stay in this place for\na million a month,” she said aloud, and the sound of her voice brought\nno comfort, for it was so little like she had thought it that she\nglanced hastily around to see if it had really been she that spoke. She\ntremblingly wiped the perspiration from her face with the skirt of her\nsunbonnet.\n\n“Awfu' hot,” she panted huskily. “B'lieve there's going to be a big\nstorm. I do hope Freckles will hurry.”\n\nHer chin was quivering as a terrified child's. She lifted her bonnet to\nreplace it and brushed against a bush beside her. WHIRR, almost into her\nface, went a nighthawk stretched along a limb for its daytime nap. Mrs.\nDuncan cried out and sprang down the trail, alighting on a frog that was\nhopping across. The horrible croak it gave as she crushed it sickened\nher. She screamed wildly and jumped to one side. That carried her into\nthe swale, where the grasses reached almost to her waist, and her horror\nof snakes returning, she made a flying leap for an old log lying beside\nthe line. She alighted squarely, but it was so damp and rotten that she\nsank straight through it to her knees. She caught at the wire as she\nwent down, and missing, raked her wrist across a barb until she tore a\nbleeding gash. Her fingers closed convulsively around the second strand.\nShe was too frightened to scream now. Her tongue stiffened. She clung\nfrantically to the sagging wire, and finally managed to grasp it with\nthe other hand. Then she could reach the top wire, and so she drew\nherself up and found solid footing. She picked up the club that she\nhad dropped in order to extricate herself. Leaning heavily on it,\nshe managed to return to the trail, but she was trembling so that she\nscarcely could walk. Going a few steps farther, she came to the stump of\nthe first tree that had been taken out.\n\nShe sat bolt upright and very still, trying to collect her thoughts and\nreason away her terror. A squirrel above her dropped a nut, and as it\ncame rattling down, bouncing from branch to branch, every nerve in her\ntugged wildly. When the disgusted squirrel barked loudly, she sprang to\nthe trail.\n\nThe wind arose higher, the changes from light to darkness were more\nabrupt, while the thunder came closer and louder at every peal. In\nswarms the blackbirds arose from the swale and came flocking to the\ninterior, with a clamoring cry: “T'CHECK, T'CHECK.” Grackles marshaled\nto the tribal call: “TRALL-A-HEE, TRALL-A-HEE.” Red-winged blackbirds\nswept low, calling to belated mates: “FOL-LOW-ME, FOL-LOW-ME.” Big,\njetty crows gathered close to her, crying, as if warning her to flee\nbefore it was everlastingly too late. A heron, fishing the near-by pool\nfor Freckles' “find-out” frog, fell into trouble with a muskrat and\nuttered a rasping note that sent Mrs. Duncan a rod down the line without\nrealizing that she had moved. She was too shaken to run far. She stopped\nand looked around her fearfully.\n\nSeveral bees struck her and were angrily buzzing before she noticed\nthem. Then the humming swelled on all sides. A convulsive sob shook her,\nand she ran into the bushes, now into the swale, anywhere to avoid the\nswarming bees, ducking, dodging, fighting for her very life. Presently\nthe humming seemed to become a little fainter. She found the trail\nagain, and ran with all her might from a few of her angry pursuers.\n\nAs she ran, straining every muscle, she suddenly became aware that,\ncrossing the trail before her, was a big, round, black body, with brown\nmarkings on its back, like painted geometrical patterns. She tried to\nstop, but the louder buzzing behind warned her she dared not. Gathering\nher skirts higher, with hair flying around her face and her eyes almost\nbursting from their sockets, she ran straight toward it. The sound of\nher feet and the humming of the bees alarmed the rattler, so it stopped\nacross the trail, lifting its head above the grasses of the swale and\nrattling inquiringly--rattled until the bees were outdone.\n\nStraight toward it went the panic-stricken woman, running wildly and\nuncontrollably. She took one leap, clearing its body on the path, then\nflew ahead with winged feet. The snake, coiled to strike, missed Mrs.\nDuncan and landed among the bees instead. They settled over and around\nit, and realizing that it had found trouble, it sank among the grasses\nand went threshing toward its den in the deep willow-fringed low ground.\nThe swale appeared as if a reaper were cutting a wide swath. The mass of\nenraged bees darted angrily around, searching for it, and striking the\nscrub-thorn, began a temporary settling there to discover whether it\nwere a suitable place. Completely exhausted, Mrs. Duncan staggered on a\nfew steps farther, fell facing the path, where Freckles found her, and\nlay quietly.\n\nFreckles worked over her until she drew a long, quivering breath and\nopened her eyes.\n\nWhen she saw him bending above her, she closed them tightly, and\ngripping him, struggled to her feet. He helped her, and with his arm\naround and half carrying her, they made their way to the clearing. She\nclung to him with all her remaining strength, but open her eyes she\nwould not until her children came clustering around her. Then, brawny,\nbig Scotswoman though she was, she quietly keeled over again. The\nchildren added their wailing to Freckles' panic.\n\nThis time he was so close the cabin that he could carry her into the\nhouse and lay her on the bed. He sent the oldest boy scudding down the\ncorduroy for the nearest neighbor, and between them they undressed Mrs.\nDuncan and discovered that she was not bitten. They bathed and bound the\nbleeding wrist and coaxed her back to consciousness. She lay sobbing and\nshuddering. The first intelligent word she said was: “Freckles, look at\nthat jar on the kitchen table and see if my yeast is no running ower.”\n\nSeveral days passed before she could give Duncan and Freckles any\ndetailed account of what had happened to her, even then she could not\ndo it without crying as the least of her babies. Freckles was almost\nheartbroken, and nursed her as well as any woman could have done; while\nbig Duncan, with a heart full for them both, worked early and late to\nchink every crack of the cabin and examine every spot that possibly\ncould harbor a snake. The effects of her morning on the trail kept her\nshivering half the time. She could not rest until she sent for McLean\nand begged him to save Freckles from further risk, in that place of\nhorrors. The Boss went to the swamp with his mind fully determined to do\nso.\n\nFreckles stood and laughed at him. “Why, Mr. McLean, don't you let a\nwoman's nervous system set you worrying about me,” he said. “I'm not\ndenying how she felt, because I've been through it meself, but that's\nall over and gone. It's the height of me glory to fight it out with the\nold swamp, and all that's in it, or will be coming to it, and then\nto turn it over to you as I promised you and meself I'd do, sir. You\ncouldn't break the heart of me entire quicker than to be taking it from\nme now, when I'm just on the home-stretch. It won't be over three or\nfour weeks yet, and when I've gone it almost a year, why, what's that\nto me, sir? You mustn't let a woman get mixed up with business, for I've\nalways heard about how it's bringing trouble.”\n\nMcLean smiled. “What about that last tree?” he said.\n\nFreckles blushed and grinned appreciatively.\n\n“Angels and Bird Women don't count in the common run, sir,” he affirmed\nshamelessly.\n\nMcLean sat in the saddle and laughed.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER X\n\nWherein Freckles Strives Mightily and the Swamp Angel Rewards Him\n\nThe Bird Woman and the Angel did not seem to count in the common run,\nfor they arrived on time for the third of the series and found McLean on\nthe line talking to Freckles. The Boss was filled with enthusiasm over a\nmarsh article of the Bird Woman's that he just had read. He begged to\nbe allowed to accompany her into the swamp and watch the method by which\nshe secured an illustration in such a location.\n\nThe Bird Woman explained to him that it was an easy matter with the\nsubject she then had in hand; and as Little Chicken was too small to\nbe frightened by him, and big enough to be growing troublesome, she was\nglad for his company. They went to the chicken log together, leaving to\nthe happy Freckles the care of the Angel, who had brought her banjo and\na roll of songs that she wanted to hear him sing. The Bird Woman told\nthem that they might practice in Freckles' room until she finished with\nLittle Chicken, and then she and McLean would come to the concert.\n\nIt was almost three hours before they finished and came down the west\ntrail for their rest and lunch. McLean walked ahead, keeping sharp watch\non the trail and clearing it of fallen limbs from overhanging trees. He\nsent a big piece of bark flying into the swale, and then stopped short\nand stared at the trail.\n\nThe Bird Woman bent forward. Together they studied that imprint of\nthe Angel's foot. At last their eyes met, the Bird Woman's filled with\nastonishment, and McLean's humid with pity. Neither said a word, but\nthey knew. McLean entered the swale and hunted up the bark. He replaced\nit, and the Bird Woman carefully stepped over. As they reached the\nbushes at the entrance, the voice of the Angel stopped them, for it was\ncommanding and filled with much impatience.\n\n“Freckles James Ross McLean!” she was saying. “You fill me with\ndark-blue despair! You're singing as if your voice were glass and might\nbreak at any minute. Why don't you sing as you did a week ago? Answer me\nthat, please.”\n\nFreckles smiled confusedly at the Angel, who sat on one of his fancy\nseats, playing his accompaniment on her banjo.\n\n“You are a fraud,” she said. “Here you went last week and led me to\nthink that there was the making of a great singer in you, and now you\nare singing--do you know how badly you are singing?”\n\n“Yis,” said Freckles meekly. “I'm thinking I'm too happy to be singing\nwell today. The music don't come right only when I'm lonesome and sad.\nThe world's for being all sunshine at prisint, for among you and Mr.\nMcLean and the Bird Woman I'm after being THAT happy that I can't keep\nme thoughts on me notes. It's more than sorry I am to be disappointing\nyou. Play it over, and I'll be beginning again, and this time I'll hold\nhard.”\n\n“Well,” said the Angel disgustedly, “it seems to me that if I had all\nthe things to be proud of that you have, I'd lift up my head and sing!”\n\n“And what is it I've to be proud of, ma'am?” politely inquired Freckles.\n\n“Why, a whole worldful of things,” cried the Angel explosively. “For\none thing, you can be good and proud over the way you've kept the timber\nthieves out of this lease, and the trust your father has in you. You can\nbe proud that you've never even once disappointed him or failed in what\nhe believed you could do. You can be proud over the way everyone speaks\nof you with trust and honor, and about how brave of heart and strong of\nbody you are I heard a big man say a few days ago that the Limberlost\nwas full of disagreeable things--positive dangers, unhealthful as it\ncould be, and that since the memory of the first settlers it has been a\nrendezvous for runaways, thieves, and murderers. This swamp is named for\na man that was lost here and wandered around 'til he starved. That man I\nwas talking with said he wouldn't take your job for a thousand dollars\na month--in fact, he said he wouldn't have it for any money, and you've\nnever missed a day or lost a tree. Proud! Why, I should think you would\njust parade around about proper over that!\n\n“And you can always be proud that you are born an Irishman. My father\nis Irish, and if you want to see him get up and strut give him a teeny\nopening to enlarge on his race. He says that if the Irish had decent\nterritory they'd lead the world. He says they've always been handicapped\nby lack of space and of fertile soil. He says if Ireland had been as big\nand fertile as Indiana, why, England wouldn't ever have had the upper\nhand. She'd only be an appendage. Fancy England an appendage! He says\nIreland has the finest orators and the keenest statesmen in Europe\ntoday, and when England wants to fight, with whom does she fill her\ntrenches? Irishmen, of course! Ireland has the greenest grass and trees,\nthe finest stones and lakes, and they've jaunting-cars. I don't know\njust exactly what they are, but Ireland has all there are, anyway.\nThey've a lot of great actors, and a few singers, and there never was a\nsweeter poet than one of theirs. You should hear my father recite 'Dear\nHarp of My Country.' He does it this way.”\n\nThe Angel arose, made an elaborate old-time bow, and holding up the\nbanjo, recited in clipping feet and meter, with rhythmic swing and a\ntouch of brogue that was simply irresistible:\n\n“Dear harp of my country” [The Angel ardently clasped the banjo],\n\n“In darkness I found thee” [She held it to the light],\n\n“The cold chain of silence had hung o'er thee long” [She muted the\nstrings with her rosy palm];\n\n“Then proudly, my own Irish harp, I unbound thee” [She threw up her head\nand swept a ringing harmony];\n\n“And gave all thy chords to light, freedom, and song” [She crashed into\nthe notes of the accompaniment she had been playing for Freckles].\n\n“That's what you want to be thinking of!” she cried. “Not darkness, and\nlonesomeness, and sadness, but 'light, freedom, and song.' I can't begin\nto think offhand of all the big, splendid things an Irishman has to be\nproud of; but whatever they are, they are all yours, and you are a part\nof them. I just despise that 'saddest-when-I-sing' business. You can\nsing! Now you go over there and do it! Ireland has had her statesmen,\nwarriors, actors, and poets; now you be her voice! You stand right out\nthere before the cathedral door, and I'm going to come down the aisle\nplaying that accompaniment, and when I stop in front of you--you sing!”\n\nThe Angel's face wore an unusual flush. Her eyes were flashing and she\nwas palpitating with earnestness.\n\nShe parted the bushes and disappeared. Freckles, straight and tense,\nstood waiting. Presently, before he saw she was there, she was coming\ndown the aisle toward him, playing compellingly, and rifts of light were\ntouching her with golden glory. Freckles stood as if transfixed.\n\nThe cathedral was majestically beautiful, from arched dome of frescoed\ngold, green, and blue in never-ending shades and harmonies, to the\nmosaic aisle she trod, richly inlaid in choicest colors, and gigantic\npillars that were God's handiwork fashioned and perfected through ages\nof sunshine and rain. But the fair young face and divinely molded form\nof the Angel were His most perfect work of all. Never had she appeared\nso surpassingly beautiful. She was smiling encouragingly now, and as she\ncame toward him, she struck the chords full and strong.\n\nThe heart of poor Freckles almost burst with dull pain and his great\nlove for her. In his desire to fulfill her expectations he forgot\neverything else, and when she reached his initial chord he was ready. He\nliterally burst forth:\n\n     “Three little leaves of Irish green,\n     United on one stem,\n     Love, truth, and valor do they mean,\n     They form a magic gem.”\n\nThe Angel's eyes widened curiously and her lips parted. A deep color\nswept into her cheeks. She had intended to arouse him. She had more than\nsucceeded. She was too young to know that in the effort to rouse a man,\nwomen frequently kindle fires that they neither can quench nor control.\nFreckles was looking over her head now and singing that song, as it\nnever had been sung before, for her alone; and instead of her helping\nhim, as she had intended, he was carrying her with him on the waves\nof his voice, away, away into another world. When he struck into the\nchorus, wide-eyed and panting, she was swaying toward him and playing\nwith all her might.\n\n     “Oh, do you love?  Oh, say you love\n     You love the shamrock green!”\n\nAt the last note, Freckles' voice ceased and he looked at the Angel. He\nhad given his best and his all. He fell on his knees and folded his arms\nacross his breast. The Angel, as if magnetized, walked straight down the\naisle to him, and running her fingers into the crisp masses of his red\nhair, tilted his head back and laid her lips on his forehead.\n\nThen she stepped back and faced him. “Good boy!” she said, in a voice\nthat wavered from the throbbing of her shaken heart. “Dear boy! I knew\nyou could do it! I knew it was in you! Freckles, when you go into the\nworld, if you can face a big audience and sing like that, just once, you\nwill be immortal, and anything you want will be yours.”\n\n“Anything!” gasped Freckles.\n\n“Anything,” said the Angel.\n\nFreckles arose, muttered something, and catching up his old bucket,\nplunged into the swamp blindly on a pretence of bringing water. The\nAngel walked slowly across the study, sat on the rustic bench, and,\nthrough narrowed lids, intently studied the tip of her shoe.\n\nOn the trail the Bird Woman wheeled to McLean with a dumbfounded look.\n\n“God!” muttered he.\n\nAt last the Bird Woman spoke.\n\n“Do you think the Angel knew she did that?” she asked softly.\n\n“No,” said McLean; “I do not. But the poor boy knew it. Heaven help\nhim!”\n\nThe Bird Woman stared across the gently waving swale. “I don't see how I\nam going to blame her,” she said at last. “It's so exactly what I would\nhave done myself.”\n\n“Say the remainder,” demanded McLean hoarsely. “Do him justice.”\n\n“He was born a gentleman,” conceded the Bird Woman. “He took no\nadvantage. He never even offered to touch her. Whatever that kiss meant\nto him, he recognized that it was the loving impulse of a child under\nstress of strong emotion. He was fine and manly as any man ever could\nhave been.”\n\nMcLean lifted his hat. “Thank you,” he said simply, and parted the\nbushes for her to enter Freckles' room.\n\nIt was her first visit. Before she left she sent for her cameras and\nmade studies of each side of it and of the cathedral. She was entranced\nwith the delicate beauty of the place, while her eyes kept following\nFreckles as if she could not believe that it could be his conception and\nwork.\n\nThat was a happy day. The Bird Woman had brought a lunch, and they\nspread it, with Freckles' dinner, on the study floor and sat, resting\nand enjoying themselves. But the Angel put her banjo into its case,\nsilently gathered her music, and no one mentioned the concert.\n\nThe Bird Woman left McLean and the Angel to clear away the lunch, and\nwith Freckles examined the walls of his room and told him all she knew\nabout his shrubs and flowers. She analyzed a cardinal-flower and\nshowed him what he had wanted to know all summer--why the bees\nbuzzed ineffectually around it while the humming-birds found in it\nan ever-ready feast. Some of his specimens were so rare that she was\nunfamiliar with them, and with the flower book between them they\nknelt, studying the different varieties. She wandered the length of the\ncathedral aisle with him, and it was at her suggestion that he lighted\nhis altar with a row of flaming foxfire.\n\nAs Freckles came to the cabin from his long day at the swamp he saw\nMrs. Chicken sweeping to the south and wondered where she was going. He\nstepped into the bright, cosy little kitchen, and as he reached down the\nwash-basin he asked Mrs. Duncan a question.\n\n“Mother Duncan, do kisses wash off?”\n\nSo warm a wave swept her heart that a half-flush mantled her face. She\nstraightened her shoulders and glanced at her hands tenderly.\n\n“Lord, na! Freckles,” she cried. “At least, the anes ye get from people\nye love dinna. They dinna stay on the outside. They strike in until they\nfind the center of your heart and make their stopping-place there, and\nnaething can take them from ye--I doubt if even death----Na, lad, ye can\nbe reet sure kisses dinna wash off!”\n\nFreckles set the basin down and muttered as he plunged his hot, tired\nface into the water, “I needn't be afraid to be washing, then, for that\none struck in.”\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XI\n\nWherein the Butterflies Go on a Spree and Freckles Informs the Bird\nWoman\n\n“I wish,” said Freckles at breakfast one morning, “that I had some way\nto be sending a message to the Bird Woman. I've something at the swamp\nthat I'm believing never happened before, and surely she'll be wanting\nit.”\n\n“What now, Freckles?” asked Mrs. Duncan.\n\n“Why, the oddest thing you ever heard of,” said Freckles; “the whole\ninsect tribe gone on a spree. I'm supposing it's my doings, but it all\nhappened by accident, like. You see, on the swale side of the line,\nright against me trail, there's one of these scrub wild crabtrees. Where\nthe grass grows thick around it, is the finest place you ever conceived\nof for snakes. Having women about has set me trying to clean out those\nfellows a bit, and yesterday I noticed that tree in passing. It struck\nme that it would be a good idea to be taking it out. First I thought I'd\ntake me hatchet and cut it down, for it ain't thicker than me upper arm.\nThen I remembered how it was blooming in the spring and filling all the\nair with sweetness. The coloring of the blossoms is beautiful, and I\nhated to be killing it. I just cut the grass short all around it. Then\nI started at the ground, trimmed up the trunk near the height of\nme shoulder, and left the top spreading. That made it look so truly\nornamental that, idle like, I chips off the rough places neat, and this\nmorning, on me soul, it's a sight! You see, cutting off the limbs and\ntrimming up the trunk sets the sap running. In this hot sun it ferments\nin a few hours. There isn't much room for more things to crowd on that\ntree than there are, and to get drunker isn't noways possible.”\n\n“Weel, I be drawed on!” exclaimed Mrs. Duncan. “What kind of things do\nye mean, Freckles?”\n\n“Why, just an army of black ants. Some of them are sucking away like\nold topers. Some of them are setting up on their tails and hind legs,\nfiddling with their fore-feet and wiping their eyes. Some are rolling\naround on the ground, contented. There are quantities of big blue-bottle\nflies over the bark and hanging on the grasses around, too drunk to\nsteer a course flying; so they just buzz away like flying, and all\nthe time sitting still. The snake-feeders are too full to feed\nanything--even more sap to themselves. There's a lot of hard-backed\nbugs--beetles, I guess--colored like the brown, blue, and black of a\npeacock's tail. They hang on until the legs of them are so wake they\ncan't stick a minute longer, and then they break away and fall to the\nground. They just lay there on their backs, fably clawing air. When it\nwears off a bit, up they get, and go crawling back for more, and they so\nfull they bump into each other and roll over. Sometimes they can't climb\nthe tree until they wait to sober up a little. There's a lot of big\nblack-and-gold bumblebees, done for entire, stumbling over the bark and\nrolling on the ground. They just lay there on their backs, rocking from\nside to side, singing to themselves like fat, happy babies. The wild\nbees keep up a steady buzzing with the beating of their wings.\n\n“The butterflies are the worst old topers of them all. They're just a\ncircus! You never saw the like of the beauties! They come every color\nyou could be naming, and every shape you could be thinking up. They\ndrink and drink until, if I'm driving them away, they stagger as they\nfly and turn somersaults in the air. If I lave them alone, they cling to\nthe grasses, shivering happy like; and I'm blest, Mother Duncan, if\nthe best of them could be unlocking the front door with a lead pencil,\neven.”\n\n“I never heard of anything sae surprising,” said Mrs. Duncan.\n\n“It's a rare sight to watch them, and no one ever made a picture of a\nthing like that before, I'm for thinking,” said Freckles earnestly.\n\n“Na,” said Mrs. Duncan. “Ye can be pretty sure there didna. The Bird\nWoman must have word in some way, if ye walk the line and I walk to town\nand tell her. If ye think ye can wait until after supper, I am most\nsure ye can gang yoursel', for Duncan is coming home and he'd be glad to\nwatch for ye. If he does na come, and na ane passes that I can send\nword with today, I really will gang early in the morning and tell her\nmysel'.”\n\nFreckles took his lunch and went to the swamp. He walked and watched\neagerly. He could find no trace of anything, yet he felt a tense\nnervousness, as if trouble might be brooding. He examined every section\nof the wire, and kept watchful eyes on the grasses of the swale, in\nan effort to discover if anyone had passed through them; but he could\ndiscover no trace of anything to justify his fears.\n\nHe tilted his hat brim to shade his face and looked for his chickens.\nThey were hanging almost beyond sight in the sky.\n\n“Gee!” he said. “If I only had your sharp eyes and convenient location\nnow, I wouldn't need be troubling so.”\n\nHe reached his room and cautiously scanned the entrance before he\nstepped in. Then he pushed the bushes apart with his right arm and\nentered, his left hand on the butt of his favorite revolver. Instantly\nhe knew that someone had been there. He stepped to the center of the\nroom, closely scanning each wall and the floor. He could find no trace\nof a clue to confirm his belief, yet so intimate was he with the spirit\nof the place that he knew.\n\nHow he knew he could not have told, yet he did know that someone had\nentered his room, sat on his benches, and walked over his floor. He was\nsurest around the case. Nothing was disturbed, yet it seemed to Freckles\nthat he could see where prying fingers had tried the lock. He stepped\nbehind the case, carefully examining the ground all around it, and close\nbeside the tree to which it was nailed he found a deep, fresh footprint\nin the spongy soil--a long, narrow print, that was never made by the\nfoot of Wessner. His heart tugged in his breast as he mentally measured\nthe print, but he did not linger, for now the feeling arose that he\nwas being watched. It seemed to him that he could feel the eyes of some\nintruder at his back. He knew he was examining things too closely: if\nanyone were watching, he did not want him to know that he felt it.\n\nHe took the most open way, and carried water for his flowers and moss\nas usual; but he put himself into no position in which he was fully\nexposed, and his hand was close his revolver constantly. Growing restive\nat last under the strain, he plunged boldly into the swamp and searched\nminutely all around his room, but he could not discover the least thing\nto give him further cause for alarm. He unlocked his case, took out his\nwheel, and for the remainder of the day he rode and watched as he never\nhad before. Several times he locked the wheel and crossed the swamp on\nfoot, zigzagging to cover all the space possible. Every rod he traveled\nhe used the caution that sprang from knowledge of danger and the\ndirection from which it probably would come. Several times he thought of\nsending for McLean, but for his life he could not make up his mind to do\nit with nothing more tangible than one footprint to justify him.\n\nHe waited until he was sure Duncan would be at home, if he were coming\nfor the night, before he went to supper. The first thing he saw as he\ncrossed the swale was the big bays in the yard.\n\nThere had been no one passing that day, and Duncan readily agreed to\nwatch until Freckles rode to town. He told Duncan of the footprint, and\nurged him to guard closely. Duncan said he might rest easy, and filling\nhis pipe and taking a good revolver, the big man went to the Limberlost.\n\nFreckles made himself clean and neat, and raced to town, but it was\nnight and the stars were shining before he reached the home of the Bird\nWoman. From afar he could see that the house was ablaze with lights. The\nlawn and veranda were strung with fancy lanterns and alive with people.\nHe thought his errand important, so to turn back never occurred to\nFreckles. This was all the time or opportunity he would have. He must\nsee the Bird Woman, and see her at once. He leaned his wheel inside the\nfence and walked up the broad front entrance. As he neared the steps, he\nsaw that the place was swarming with young people, and the Angel, with\nan excuse to a group that surrounded her, came hurrying to him.\n\n“Oh Freckles!” she cried delightedly. “So you could come? We were so\nafraid you could not! I'm as glad as I can be!”\n\n“I don't understand,” said Freckles. “Were you expecting me?”\n\n“Why of course!” exclaimed the Angel. “Haven't you come to my party?\nDidn't you get my invitation? I sent you one.”\n\n“By mail?” asked Freckles.\n\n“Yes,” said the Angel. “I had to help with the preparations, and I\ncouldn't find time to drive out; but I wrote you a letter, and told\nyou that the Bird Woman was giving a party for me, and we wanted you\nto come, surely. I told them at the office to put it with Mr. Duncan's\nmail.”\n\n“Then that's likely where it is at present,” said Freckles. “Duncan\ncomes to town only once a week, and at times not that. He's home tonight\nfor the first in a week. He's watching an hour for me until I come to\nthe Bird Woman with a bit of work I thought she'd be caring to hear\nabout bad. Is she where I can see her?”\n\nThe Angel's face clouded.\n\n“What a disappointment!” she cried. “I did so want all my friends to\nknow you. Can't you stay anyway?”\n\nFreckles glanced from his wading-boots to the patent leathers of some of\nthe Angel's friends, and smiled whimsically, but there was no danger of\nhis ever misjudging her again.\n\n“You know I cannot, Angel,” he said.\n\n“I am afraid I do,” she said ruefully. “It's too bad! But there is a\nthing I want for you more than to come to my party, and that is to hang\non and win with your work. I think of you every day, and I just pray\nthat those thieves are not getting ahead of you. Oh, Freckles, do watch\nclosely!”\n\nShe was so lovely a picture as she stood before him, ardent in his\ncause, that Freckles could not take his eyes from her to notice what her\nfriends were thinking. If she did not mind, why should he? Anyway,\nif they really were the Angel's friends, probably they were better\naccustomed to her ways than he.\n\nHer face and bared neck and arms were like the wild rose bloom. Her\nsoft frock of white tulle lifted and stirred around her with the gentle\nevening air. The beautiful golden hair, that crept around her temples\nand ears as if it loved to cling there, was caught back and bound with\nbroad blue satin ribbon. There was a sash of blue at her waist, and\nknots of it catching up her draperies.\n\n“Must I go after the Bird Woman?” she pleaded.\n\n“Indade, you must,” answered Freckles firmly.\n\nThe Angel went away, but returned to say that the Bird Woman was telling\na story to those inside and she could not come for a short time.\n\n“You won't come in?” she pleaded.\n\n“I must not,” said Freckles. “I am not dressed to be among your friends,\nand I might be forgetting meself and stay too long.”\n\n“Then,” said the Angel, “we mustn't go through the house, because it\nwould disturb the story; but I want you to come the outside way to the\nconservatory and have some of my birthday lunch and some cake to take to\nMrs. Duncan and the babies. Won't that be fun?”\n\nFreckles thought that it would be more than fun, and followed\ndelightedly.\n\nThe Angel gave him a big glass, brimming with some icy, sparkling liquid\nthat struck his palate as it never had been touched before, because a\ncombination of frosty fruit juices had not been a frequent beverage with\nhim. The night was warm, and the Angel most beautiful and kind. A triple\ndelirium of spirit, mind, and body seized upon him and developed a\nboldness all unnatural. He slightly parted the heavy curtains that\nseparated the conservatory from the company and looked between. He\nalmost stopped breathing. He had read of things like that, but he never\nhad seen them.\n\nThe open space seemed to stretch through half a dozen rooms, all ablaze\nwith lights, perfumed with flowers, and filled with elegantly dressed\npeople. There were glimpses of polished floors, sparkling glass, and\nfine furnishings. From somewhere, the voice of his beloved Bird Woman\narose and fell.\n\nThe Angel crowded beside him and was watching also.\n\n“Doesn't it look pretty?” she whispered.\n\n“Do you suppose Heaven is any finer than that?” asked Freckles.\n\nThe Angel began to laugh.\n\n“Do you want to be laughing harder than that?” queried Freckles.\n\n“A laugh is always good,” said the Angel. “A little more avoirdupois\nwon't hurt me. Go ahead.”\n\n“Well then,” said Freckles, “it's only that I feel all over as if I\nbelonged there. I could wear fine clothes, and move over those floors,\nand hold me own against the best of them.”\n\n“But where does my laugh come in?” demanded the Angel, as if she had\nbeen defrauded.\n\n“And you ask me where the laugh comes in, looking me in the face after\nthat,” marveled Freckles.\n\n“I wouldn't be so foolish as to laugh at such a manifest truth as that,”\n said the Angel. “Anyone who knows you even half as well as I do, knows\nthat you are never guilty of a discourtesy, and you move with twice the\ngrace of any man here. Why shouldn't you feel as if you belonged where\npeople are graceful and courteous?”\n\n“On me soul!” said Freckles, “you are kind to be thinking it. You are\ndoubly kind to be saying it.”\n\nThe curtains parted and a woman came toward them. Her silks and laces\ntrailed across the polished floors. The lights gleamed on her neck and\narms, and flashed from rare jewels. She was smiling brightly; and until\nshe spoke, Freckles had not realized fully that it was his loved Bird\nWoman.\n\nNoticing his bewilderment, she cried: “Why, Freckles! Don't you know me\nin my war clothes?”\n\n“I do in the uniform in which you fight the Limberlost,” said Freckles.\n\nThe Bird Woman laughed. Then he told her why he had come, but she\nscarcely could believe him. She could not say exactly when she would go,\nbut she would make it as soon as possible, for she was most anxious for\nthe study.\n\nWhile they talked, the Angel was busy packing a box of sandwiches,\ncake, fruit, and flowers. She gave him a last frosty glass, thanked him\nrepeatedly for bringing news of new material; then Freckles went into\nthe night. He rode toward the Limberlost with his eyes on the stars.\nPresently he removed his hat, hung it to his belt, and ruffled his\nhair to the sweep of the night wind. He filled the air all the way with\nsnatches of oratorios, gospel hymns, and dialect and coon songs, in a\nstartlingly varied programme. The one thing Freckles knew that he could\ndo was to sing. The Duncans heard him coming a mile up the corduroy and\ncould not believe their senses. Freckles unfastened the box from\nhis belt, and gave Mrs. Duncan and the children all the eatables\nit contained, except one big piece of cake that he carried to the\nsweet-loving Duncan. He put the flowers back in the box and set it among\nhis books. He did not say anything, but they understood it was not to be\ntouched.\n\n“Thae's Freckles' flow'rs,” said a tiny Scotsman, “but,” he added\ncheerfully, “it's oor sweeties!”\n\nFreckles' face slowly flushed as he took Duncan's cake and started\ntoward the swamp. While Duncan ate, Freckles told him something about\nthe evening, as well as he could find words to express himself, and the\nbig man was so amazed he kept forgetting the treat in his hands.\n\nThen Freckles mounted his wheel and began a spin that terminated only\nwhen the biggest Plymouth Rock in Duncan's coop saluted a new day, and\nlong lines of light reddened the east. As he rode he sang, while he\nsang he worshiped, but the god he tried to glorify was a dim and faraway\nmystery. The Angel was warm flesh and blood.\n\nEvery time he passed the little bark-covered imprint on the trail he\ndismounted, removed his hat, solemnly knelt and laid his lips on the\nimpression. Because he kept no account himself, only the laughing-faced\nold man of the moon knew how often it happened; and as from the\nbeginning, to the follies of earth that gentleman has ever been kind.\n\nWith the near approach of dawn Freckles tuned his last note. Wearied\nalmost to falling, he turned from the trail into the path leading to the\ncabin for a few hours' rest.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XII\n\nWherein Black Jack Captures Freckles and the Angel Captures Jack\n\nAs Freckles left the trail, from the swale close the south entrance,\nfour large muscular men arose and swiftly and carefully entered the\nswamp by the wagon road. Two of them carried a big saw, the third, coils\nof rope and wire, and all of them were heavily armed. They left one man\non guard at the entrance. The other three made their way through the\ndarkness as best they could, and were soon at Freckles' room. He had\nleft the swamp on his wheel from the west trail. They counted on his\nreturning on the wheel and circling the east line before he came there.\n\nA little below the west entrance to Freckles' room, Black Jack stepped\ninto the swale, and binding a wire tightly around a scrub oak, carried\nit below the waving grasses, stretched it taut across the trail, and\nfastened it to a tree in the swamp. Then he obliterated all signs of his\nwork, and arranged the grass over the wire until it was so completely\ncovered that only minute examination would reveal it. They entered\nFreckles' room with coarse oaths and jests. In a few moments, his\nspecimen case with its precious contents was rolled into the swamp,\nwhile the saw was eating into one of the finest trees of the Limberlost.\n\nThe first report from the man on watch was that Duncan had driven to the\nSouth camp; the second, that Freckles was coming. The man watching was\nsent to see on which side the boy turned into the path; as they had\nexpected, he took the east. He was a little tired and his head was\nrather stupid, for he had not been able to sleep as he had hoped, but he\nwas very happy. Although he watched until his eyes ached, he could see\nno sign of anyone having entered the swamp.\n\nHe called a cheery greeting to all his chickens. At Sleepy Snake Creek\nhe almost fell from his wheel with surprise: the saw-bird was surrounded\nby four lanky youngsters clamoring for breakfast. The father was\nstrutting with all the importance of a drum major.\n\n“No use to expect the Bird Woman today,” said Freckles; “but now\nwouldn't she be jumping for a chance at that?”\n\nAs soon as Freckles was far down the east line, the watch was posted\nbelow the room on the west to report his coming. It was only a few\nmoments before the signal came. Then the saw stopped, and the rope was\nbrought out and uncoiled close to a sapling. Wessner and Black Jack\ncrowded to the very edge of the swamp a little above the wire, and\ncrouched, waiting.\n\nThey heard Freckles before they saw him. He came gliding down the line\nswiftly, and as he rode he was singing softly:\n\n     “Oh, do you love,\n     Oh, say you love----”\n\nHe got no farther. The sharply driven wheel struck the tense wire and\nbounded back. Freckles shot over the handlebar and coasted down the\ntrail on his chest. As he struck, Black Jack and Wessner were upon him.\nWessner caught off an old felt hat and clapped it over Freckles' mouth,\nwhile Black Jack twisted the boy's arms behind him and they rushed him\ninto his room. Almost before he realized that anything had happened, he\nwas trussed to a tree and securely gagged.\n\nThen three of the men resumed work on the tree. The other followed\nthe path Freckles had worn to Little Chicken's tree, and presently\nhe reported that the wires were down and two teams with the loading\napparatus coming to take out the timber. All the time the saw was slowly\neating, eating into the big tree.\n\nWessner went to the trail and removed the wire. He picked up Freckles'\nwheel, that did not seem to be injured, and leaned it against the bushes\nso that if anyone did pass on the trail he would not see it doubled in\nthe swamp-grass.\n\nThen he came and stood in front of Freckles and laughed in devilish\nhate. To his own amazement, Freckles found himself looking fear in the\nface, and marveled that he was not afraid. Four to one! The tree halfway\neaten through, the wagons coming up the inside road--he, bound and\ngagged! The men with Black Jack and Wessner had belonged to McLean's\ngang when last he had heard of them, but who those coming with the\nwagons might be he could not guess.\n\nIf they secured that tree, McLean lost its value, lost his wager, and\nlost his faith in him. The words of the Angel hammered in his ears. “Oh,\nFreckles, do watch closely!”\n\nThe saw worked steadily.\n\nWhen the tree was down and loaded, what would they do? Pull out, and\nleave him there to report them? It was not to be hoped for. The place\nalways had been lawless. It could mean but one thing.\n\nA mist swept before his eyes, while his head swam. Was it only last\nnight that he had worshiped the Angel in a delirium of happiness? And\nnow, what? Wessner, released from a turn at the saw, walked to the\nflower bed, and tearing up a handful of rare ferns by the roots, started\ntoward Freckles. His intention was obvious. Black Jack stopped him, with\nan oath.\n\n“You see here, Dutchy,” he bawled, “mebby you think you'll wash his face\nwith that, but you won't. A contract's a contract. We agreed to take out\nthese trees and leave him for you to dispose of whatever way you please,\nprovided you shut him up eternally on this deal. But I'll not see a tied\nman tormented by a fellow that he can lick up the ground with, loose,\nand that's flat. It raises my gorge to think what he'll get when we're\ngone, but you needn't think you're free to begin before. Don't you lay a\nhand on him while I'm here! What do you say, boys?”\n\n“I say yes,” growled one of McLean's latest deserters. “What's more,\nwe're a pack of fools to risk the dirty work of silencing him. You had\nhim face down and you on his back; why the hell didn't you cover his\nhead and roll him into the bushes until we were gone? When I went into\nthis, I didn't understand that he was to see all of us and that there\nwas murder on the ticket. I'm not up to it. I don't mind lifting trees\nwe came for, but I'm cursed if I want blood on my hands.”\n\n“Well, you ain't going to get it,” bellowed Jack. “You fellows only\ncontracted to help me get out my marked trees. He belong to Wessner, and\nit ain't in our deal what happens to him.”\n\n“Yes, and if Wessner finishes him safely, we are practically in for\nmurder as well as stealing the trees; and if he don't, all hell's to\npay. I think you've made a damnable bungle of this thing; that's what I\nthink!”\n\n“Then keep your thoughts to yourself,” cried Jack. “We're doing this,\nand it's all planned safe and sure. As for killing that buck--come to\nthink of it, killing is what he needs. He's away too good for this world\nof woe, anyhow. I tell you, it's all safe enough. His dropping out won't\nbe the only secret the old Limberlost has never told. It's too dead easy\nto make it look like he helped take the timber and then cut. Why, he's\nplayed right into our hands. He was here at the swamp all last night,\nand back again in an hour or so. When we get our plan worked out, even\nold fool Duncan won't lift a finger to look for his carcass. We couldn't\nhave him going in better shape.”\n\n“You just bet,” said Wessner. “I owe him all he'll get, and be damned to\nyou, but I'll pay!” he snarled at Freckles.\n\nSo it was killing, then. They were not only after this one tree, but\nmany, and with his body it was their plan to kill his honor. To brand\nhim a thief, with them, before the Angel, the Bird Woman, the dear Boss,\nand the Duncans--Freckles, in sick despair, sagged against the ropes.\n\nThen he gathered his forces and thought swiftly. There was no hope\nof McLean's coming. They had chosen a day when they knew he had a big\ncontract at the South camp. The Boss could not come before tomorrow by\nany possibility, and there would be no tomorrow for the boy. Duncan was\non his way to the South camp, and the Bird Woman had said she would come\nas soon as she could. After the fatigue of the party, it was useless\nto expect her and the Angel today, and God save them from coming! The\nAngel's father had said they would be as safe in the Limberlost as at\nhome. What would he think of this?\n\nThe sweat broke on Freckles' forehead. He tugged at the ropes whenever\nhe felt that he dared, but they were passed around the tree and his body\nseveral times, and knotted on his chest. He was helpless. There was no\nhope, no help. And after they had conspired to make him appear a runaway\nthief to his loved ones, what was it that Wessner would do to him?\n\nWhatever it was, Freckles lifted his head and resolved that he would\nbear in mind what he had once heard the Bird Woman say. He would go out\nbonnily. Never would he let them see, if he grew afraid. After all, what\ndid it matter what they did to his body if by some scheme of the devil\nthey could encompass his disgrace?\n\nThen hope suddenly rose high in Freckles' breast. They could not do\nthat! The Angel would not believe. Neither would McLean. He would keep\nup his courage. Kill him they could; dishonor him they could not.\n\nYet, summon all the fortitude he might, that saw eating into the tree\nrasped his nerves worse and worse. With whirling brain he gazed into\nthe Limberlost, searching for something, he knew not what, and in blank\nhorror found his eyes focusing on the Angel. She was quite a distance\naway, but he could see her white lips and angry expression.\n\nLast week he had taken her and the Bird Woman across the swamp over the\npath he followed in going from his room to the chicken tree. He had told\nthem the night before, that the butterfly tree was on the line close to\nthis path. In figuring on their not coming that day, he failed to reckon\nwith the enthusiasm of the Bird Woman. They must be there for the study,\nand the Angel had risked crossing the swamp in search of him. Or was\nthere something in his room they needed? The blood surged in his ears as\nthe roar of the Limberlost in the wrath of a storm.\n\nHe looked again, and it had been a dream. She was not there. Had she\nbeen? For his life, Freckles could not tell whether he really had seen\nthe Angel, or whether his strained senses had played him the most cruel\ntrick of all. Or was it not the kindest? Now he could go with the vision\nof her lovely face fresh with him.\n\n“Thank You for that, oh God!” whispered Freckles. “'Twas more than kind\nof You and I don't s'pose I ought to be wanting anything else; but\nif You can, oh, I wish I could know before this ends, if 'twas me\nmother”--Freckles could not even whisper the words, for he hesitated a\nsecond and ended--“IF 'TWAS ME MOTHER DID IT!”\n\n“Freckles! Freckles! Oh, Freckles!” the voice of the Angel came calling.\nFreckles swayed forward and wrenched at the rope until it cut deeply\ninto his body.\n\n“Hell!” cried Black Jack. “Who is that? Do you know?”\n\nFreckles nodded.\n\nJack whipped out a revolver and snatched the gag from Freckles' mouth.\n\n“Say quick, or it's up with you right now, and whoever that is with\nyou!”\n\n“It's the girl the Bird Woman takes with her,” whispered Freckles\nthrough dry, swollen lips.\n\n“They ain't due here for five days yet,” said Wessner. “We got on to\nthat last week.”\n\n“Yes,” said Freckles, “but I found a tree covered with butterflies and\nthings along the east line yesterday that I thought the Bird Woman would\nwant extra, and I went to town to tell her last night. She said she'd\ncome soon, but she didn't say when. They must be here. I take care of\nthe girl while the Bird Woman works. Untie me quick until she is gone.\nI'll try to send her back, and then you can go on with your dirty work.”\n\n“He ain't lying,” volunteered Wessner. “I saw that tree covered with\nbutterflies and him watching around it when we were spying on him\nyesterday.”\n\n“No, he leaves lying to your sort,” snapped Black Jack, as he undid the\nrope and pitched it across the room. “Remember that you're covered every\nmove you make, my buck,” he cautioned.\n\n“Freckles! Freckles!” came the Angel's impatient voice, closer and\ncloser.\n\n“I must be answering,” said Freckles, and Jack nodded. “Right here!”\n he called, and to the men: “You go on with your work, and remember\none thing yourselves. The work of the Bird Woman is known all over the\nworld. This girl's father is a rich man, and she is all he has. If you\noffer hurt of any kind to either of them, this world has no place far\nenough away or dark enough for you to be hiding in. Hell will be easy to\nwhat any man will get if he touches either of them!”\n\n“Freckles, where are you?” demanded the Angel.\n\nSoulsick with fear for her, Freckles went toward her and parted the\nbushes that she might enter. She came through without apparently giving\nhim a glance, and the first words she said were: “Why have the gang come\nso soon? I didn't know you expected them for three weeks yet. Or is this\nsome especial tree that Mr. McLean needs to fill an order right now?”\n\nFreckles hesitated. Would a man dare lie to save himself? No. But to\nsave the Angel--surely that was different. He opened his lips, but the\nAngel was capable of saving herself. She walked among them, exactly as\nif she had been reared in a lumber camp, and never waited for an answer.\n\n“Why, your specimen case!” she cried. “Look! Haven't you noticed that\nit's tipped over? Set it straight, quickly!”\n\nA couple of the men stepped out and carefully righted the case.\n\n“There! That's better,” she said. “Freckles, I'm surprised at your being\nso careless. It would be a shame to break those lovely butterflies for\none old tree! Is that a valuable tree? Why didn't you tell us last night\nyou were going to take out a tree this morning? Oh, say, did you put\nyour case there to protect that tree from that stealing old Black Jack\nand his gang? I bet you did! Well, if that wasn't bright! What kind of a\ntree is it?”\n\n“It's a white oak,” said Freckles.\n\n“Like those they make dining-tables and sideboards from?”\n\n“Yes.”\n\n“My! How interesting!” she cried. “I don't know a thing about timber,\nbut my father wants me to learn just everything I can. I am going to ask\nhim to let me come here and watch you until I know enough to boss a gang\nmyself. Do you like to cut trees, gentlemen?” she asked with angelic\nsweetness of the men.\n\nSome of them appeared foolish and some grim, but one managed to say they\ndid.\n\nThen the Angel's eyes turned full on Black Jack, and she gave the most\nnatural little start of astonishment.\n\n“Oh! I almost thought that you were a ghost!” she cried. “But I see now\nthat you are really and truly. Were you ever in Colorado?”\n\n“No,” said Jack.\n\n“I see you aren't the same man,” said the Angel. “You know, we were in\nColorado last year, and there was a cowboy who was the handsomest man\nanywhere around. He'd come riding into town every night, and all we\ngirls just adored him! Oh, but he was a beauty! I thought at first\nglance you were really he, but I see now he wasn't nearly so tall nor so\nbroad as you, and only half as handsome.”\n\nThe men began to laugh while Jack flushed crimson. The Angel joined in\nthe laugh.\n\n“Well, I'll leave it to you! Isn't he handsome?” she challenged. “As for\nthat cowboy's face, it couldn't be compared with yours. The only trouble\nwith you is that your clothes are spoiling you. It's the dress those\ncowboys wear that makes half their attraction. If you were properly\nclothed, you could break the heart of the prettiest girl in the\ncountry.”\n\nWith one accord the other men looked at Black Jack, and for the first\ntime realized that he was a superb specimen of manhood, for he stood six\nfeet tall, was broad, well-rounded, and had dark, even skin, big black\neyes, and full red lips.\n\n“I'll tell you what!” exclaimed the Angel. “I'd just love to see you on\nhorseback. Nothing sets a handsome man off so splendidly. Do you ride?”\n\n“Yes,” said Jack, and his eyes were burning on the Angel as if he would\nfathom the depths of her soul.\n\n“Well,” said the Angel winsomely, “I know what I just wish you'd do.\nI wish you would let your hair grow a little longer. Then wear a\nblue flannel shirt a little open at the throat, a red tie, and a\nbroad-brimmed felt hat, and ride past my house of evenings. I'm always\nat home then, and almost always on the veranda, and, oh! but I would\nlike to see you! Will you do that for me?” It is impossible to describe\nthe art with which the Angel asked the question. She was looking\nstraight into Jack's face, coarse and hardened with sin and careless\nliving, which was now taking on a wholly different expression. The evil\nlines of it were softening and fading under her clear gaze. A dull red\nflamed into his bronze cheeks, while his eyes were growing brightly\ntender.\n\n“Yes,” he said, and the glance he gave the men was of such a nature that\nno one saw fit even to change countenance.\n\n“Oh, goody!” she cried, tilting on her toes. “I'll ask all the girls\nto come see, but they needn't stick in! We can get along without them,\ncan't we?”\n\nJack leaned toward her. He was the charmed fluttering bird, while the\nAngel was the snake.\n\n“Well, I rather guess!” he cried.\n\nThe Angel drew a deep breath and surveyed him rapturously.\n\n“My, but you're tall!” she commented. “Do you suppose I ever will grow\nto reach your shoulders?”\n\nShe stood on tiptoe and measured the distance with her eyes. Then she\ndeveloped timid confusion, while her glance sought the ground.\n\n“I wish I could do something,” she half whispered.\n\nJack seemed to increase an inch in height.\n\n“What?” he asked hoarsely.\n\n“Lariat Bill used always to have a bunch of red flowers in his shirt\npocket. The red lit up his dark eyes and olive cheeks and made him\nsplendid. May I put some red flowers on you?”\n\nFreckles stared as he wheezed for breath. He wished the earth would open\nand swallow him. Was he dead or alive? Since his Angel had seen Black\nJack she never had glanced his way. Was she completely bewitched? Would\nshe throw herself at the man's feet before them all? Couldn't she give\nhim even one thought? Hadn't she seen that he was gagged and bound? Did\nshe truly think that these were McLean's men? Why, she could not! It was\nonly a few days ago that she had been close enough to this man and angry\nenough with him to peel the hat from his head with a shot! Suddenly a\nthing she had said jestingly to him one day came back with startling\nforce: “You must take Angels on trust.” Of course you must! She was his\nAngel. She must have seen! His life, and what was far more, her own, was\nin her hands. There was nothing he could do but trust her. Surely she\nwas working out some plan.\n\nThe Angel knelt beside his flower bed and recklessly tore up by the\nroots a big bunch of foxfire.\n\n“These stems are so tough and sticky,” she said. “I can't break them.\nLoan me your knife,” she ordered Freckles.\n\nAs she reached for the knife, her back was for one second toward the\nmen. She looked into his eyes and deliberately winked.\n\nShe severed the stems, tossed the knife to Freckles, and walking to\nJack, laid the flowers over his heart.\n\nFreckles broke into a sweat of agony. He had said she would be safe in\na herd of howling savages. Would she? If Black Jack even made a motion\ntoward touching her, Freckles knew that from somewhere he would muster\nthe strength to kill him. He mentally measured the distance to where his\nclub lay and set his muscles for a spring. But no--by the splendor of\nGod! The big fellow was baring his head with a hand that was unsteady.\nThe Angel pulled one of the long silver pins from her hat and fastened\nher flowers securely.\n\nFreckles was quaking. What was to come next? What was she planning, and\noh! did she understand the danger of her presence among those men; the\nreal necessity for action?\n\nAs the Angel stepped from Jack, she turned her head to one side and\npeered at him, quite as Freckles had seen the little yellow fellow do\non the line a hundred times, and said: “Well, that does the trick! Isn't\nthat fine? See how it sets him off, boys? Don't you forget the tie is to\nbe red, and the first ride soon. I can't wait very long. Now I must go.\nThe Bird Woman will be ready to start, and she will come here hunting me\nnext, for she is busy today. What did I come here for anyway?”\n\nShe glanced inquiringly around, and several of the men laughed. Oh, the\ndelight of it! She had forgotten her errand for him! Jack had a second\nincrease in height. The Angel glanced helplessly as if seeking a clue.\nThen her eyes fell, as if by accident, on Freckles, and she cried, “Oh,\nI know now! It was those magazines the Bird Woman promised you. I came\nto tell you that we put them under the box where we hide things, at\nthe entrance to the swamp as we came in. I knew I would need my hands\ncrossing the swamp, so I hid them there. You'll find them at the same\nold place.”\n\nThen Freckles spoke.\n\n“It's mighty risky for you to be crossing the swamp alone,” he said.\n“I'm surprised that the Bird Woman would be letting you try it. I know\nit's a little farther, but it's begging you I am to be going back by the\ntrail. That's bad enough, but it's far safer than the swamp.”\n\nThe Angel laughed merrily.\n\n“Oh stop your nonsense!” she cried. “I'm not afraid! Not in the least!\nThe Bird Woman didn't want me to try following a path that I'd been over\nonly once, but I was sure I could do it, and I'm rather proud of the\nperformance. Now, don't go babying! You know I'm not afraid!”\n\n“No,” said Freckles gently, “I know you're not; but that has nothing to\ndo with the fact that your friends are afraid for you. On the trail you\ncan see your way a bit ahead, and you've all the world a better chance\nif you meet a snake.”\n\nThen Freckles had an inspiration. He turned to Jack imploringly.\n\n“You tell her!” he pleaded. “Tell her to go by the trail. She will for\nyou.”\n\nThe implication of this statement was so gratifying to Black Jack that\nhe seemed again to expand and take on increase before their very eyes.\n\n“You bet!” exclaimed Jack. And to the Angel: “You better take Freckles'\nword for it, miss. He knows the old swamp better than any of us, except\nme, and if he says 'go by the trail,' you'd best do it.”\n\nThe Angel hesitated. She wanted to recross the swamp and try to reach\nthe horse. She knew Freckles would brave any danger to save her crossing\nthe swamp alone, but she really was not afraid, while the trail added\nover a mile to the walk. She knew the path. She intended to run for dear\nlife the instant she felt herself from their sight, and tucked in the\nfolds of her blouse was a fine little 32-caliber revolver that her\nfather had presented her for her share in what he was pleased to call\nher military exploit. One last glance at Freckles showed her the agony\nin his eyes, and immediately she imagined he had some other reason. She\nwould follow the trail.\n\n“All right,” she said, giving Jack a thrilling glance. “If you say so,\nI'll return by the trail to please you. Good-bye, everybody.”\n\nShe lifted the bushes and started toward the entrance.\n\n“You damned fool! Stop her!” growled Wessner. “Keep her till we're\nloaded, anyhow. You're playing hell! Can't you see that when this thing\nis found out, there she'll be to ruin all of us. If you let her go,\nevery man of us has got to cut, and some of us will be caught sure.”\n\nJack sprang forward. Freckles' heart muffled in his throat. The Angel\nseemed to divine Jack's coming. She was humming a little song. She\ndeliberately stopped and began pulling the heads of the curious grasses\nthat grew all around her. When she straightened, she took a step\nbackward and called: “Ho! Freckles, the Bird Woman wants that natural\nhistory pamphlet returned. It belongs to a set she is going to have\nbound. That's one of the reasons we put it under the box. You be sure to\nget them as you go home tonight, for fear it rains or becomes damp with\nthe heavy dews.”\n\n“All right,” said Freckles, but it was in a voice that he never had\nheard before.\n\nThen the Angel turned and sent a parting glance at Jack. She was\noverpoweringly human and bewitchingly lovely.\n\n“You won't forget that ride and the red tie,” she half asserted, half\nquestioned.\n\nJack succumbed. Freckles was his captive, but he was the Angel's, soul\nand body. His face wore the holiest look it ever had known as he softly\nre-echoed Freckles' “All right.” With her head held well up, the Angel\nwalked slowly away, and Jack turned to the men.\n\n“Drop your damned staring and saw wood,” he shouted. “Don't you know\nanything at all about how to treat a lady?” It might have been a\nquestion which of the cronies that crouched over green wood fires in the\ncabins of Wildcat Hollow, eternally sucking a corncob pipe and stirring\nthe endless kettles of stewing coon and opossum, had taught him to do\neven as well as he had by the Angel.\n\nThe men muttered and threatened among themselves, but they began working\ndesperately. Someone suggested that a man be sent to follow the Angel\nand to watch her and the Bird Woman leave the swamp. Freckles' heart\nsank within him, but Jack was in a delirium and past all caution.\n\n“Yes,” he sneered. “Mebby all of you had better give over on the saw and\nrun after the girl. I guess not! Seems to me I got the favors. I didn't\nsee no bouquets on the rest of you! If anybody follows her, I do, and\nI'm needed here among such a pack of idiots. There's no danger in that\nbaby face. She wouldn't give me away! You double and work like forty,\nwhile me and Wessner will take the axes and begin to cut in on the other\nside.”\n\n“What about the noise?” asked Wessner.\n\n“No difference about the noise,” answered Jack. “She took us to be from\nMcLean's gang, slick as grease. Make the chips fly!”\n\nSo all of them attacked the big tree.\n\nFreckles sat on one of his benches and waited. In their haste to fell\nthe tree and load it, so that the teamsters could start, and leave them\nfree to attack another, they had forgotten to rebind him.\n\nThe Angel was on the trail and safely started. The cold perspiration\nmade Freckles' temples clammy and ran in little streams down his chest.\nIt would take her more time to follow the trail, but her safety was\nFreckles' sole thought in urging her to go that way. He tried to figure\non how long it would require to walk to the carriage. He wondered if the\nBird Woman had unhitched. He followed the Angel every step of the way.\nHe figured on when she would cross the path of the clearing, pass the\ndeep pool where his “find-out” frog lived, cross Sleepy Snake Creek, and\nreach the carriage.\n\nHe wondered what she would say to the Bird Woman, and how long it would\ntake them to pack and start. He knew now that they would understand, and\nthe Angel would try to get the Boss there in time to save his wager.\nShe could never do it, for the saw was over half through, and Jack and\nWessner cutting into the opposite side of the tree. It appeared as if\nthey could fell at least that tree, before McLean could come, and if\nthey did he lost his wager.\n\nWhen it was down, would they rebind him and leave him for Wessner to\nwreak his insane vengeance on, or would they take him along to the next\ntree and dispose of him when they had stolen all the timber they could?\nJack had said that he should not be touched until he left. Surely he\nwould not run all that risk for one tree, when he had many others of far\ngreater value marked. Freckles felt that he had some hope to cling to\nnow, but he found himself praying that the Angel would hurry.\n\nOnce Jack came to Freckles and asked if he had any water. Freckles arose\nand showed him where he kept his drinking-water. Jack drank in great\ngulps, and as he passed back the bucket, he said: “When a man's got a\nchance of catching a fine girl like that, he ought not be mixed up in\nany dirty business. I wish to God I was out of this!”\n\nFreckles answered heartily: “I wish I was, too!”\n\nJack stared at him a minute and then broke into a roar of rough\nlaughter.\n\n“Blest if I blame you,” he said. “But you had your chance! We offered\nyou a fair thing and you gave Wessner his answer. I ain't envying you\nwhen he gives you his.”\n\n“You're six to one,” answered Freckles. “It will be easy enough for you\nto be killing the body of me, but, curse you all, you can't blacken me\nsoul!”\n\n“Well, I'd give anything you could name if I had your honesty,” said\nJack.\n\nWhen the mighty tree fell, the Limberlost shivered and screamed with the\necho. Freckles groaned in despair, but the gang took heart. That was\nso much accomplished. They knew where to dispose of it safely, with\nno questions asked. Before the day was over, they could remove three\nothers, all suitable for veneer and worth far more than this. Then they\nwould leave Freckles to Wessner and scatter for safety, with more money\nthan they had ever hoped for in their possession.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XIII\n\nWherein the Angel Releases Freckles, and the Curse of Black Jack Falls\nupon Her\n\nOn the line, the Angel gave one backward glance at Black Jack, to see\nthat he had returned to his work. Then she gathered her skirts above her\nknees and leaped forward on the run. In the first three yards she passed\nFreckles' wheel. Instantly she imagined that was why he had insisted on\nher coming by the trail. She seized it and sprang on. The saddle was\ntoo high, but she was an expert rider and could catch the pedals as\nthey came up. She stopped at Duncan's cabin long enough to remedy this,\ntelling Mrs. Duncan while working what was happening, and for her to\nfollow the east trail until she found the Bird Woman, and told her that\nshe had gone after McLean and for her to leave the swamp as quickly as\npossible.\n\nEven with her fear for Freckles to spur her, Sarah Duncan blanched and\nbegan shivering at the idea of facing the Limberlost. The Angel looked\nher in the eyes.\n\n“No matter how afraid you are, you have to go,” she said. “If you don't\nthe Bird Woman will go to Freckles' room, hunting me, and they will have\ntrouble with her. If she isn't told to leave at once, they may follow\nme, and, finding I'm gone, do some terrible thing to Freckles. I can't\ngo--that's flat--for if they caught me, then there'd be no one to go\nfor help. You don't suppose they are going to take out the trees they're\nafter and then leave Freckles to run and tell? They are going to murder\nthe boy; that's what they are going to do. You run, and run for life!\nFor Freckles' life! You can ride back with the Bird Woman.”\n\nThe Angel saw Mrs. Duncan started; then began her race.\n\nThose awful miles of corduroy! Would they never end? She did not dare\nuse the wheel too roughly, for if it broke she never could arrive on\ntime afoot. Where her way was impassable for the wheel, she jumped off,\nand pushing it beside her or carrying it, she ran as fast as she could.\nThe day was fearfully warm. The sun poured with the fierce baking heat\nof August. The bushes claimed her hat, and she did not stop for it.\n\nWhere it was at all possible, the Angel mounted and pounded over the\ncorduroy again. She was panting for breath and almost worn out when she\nreached the level pike. She had no idea how long she had been--and only\ntwo miles covered. She leaned over the bars, almost standing on the\npedals, racing with all the strength in her body. The blood surged in\nher ears while her head swam, but she kept a straight course, and rode\nand rode. It seemed to her that she was standing still, while the trees\nand houses were racing past her.\n\nOnce a farmer's big dog rushed angrily into the road and she swerved\nuntil she almost fell, but she regained her balance, and setting her\nmuscles, pedaled as fast as she could. At last she lifted her head.\nSurely it could not be over a mile more. She had covered two of corduroy\nand at least three of gravel, and it was only six in all.\n\nShe was reeling in the saddle, but she gripped the bars with new energy,\nand raced desperately. The sun beat on her bare head and hands. Just\nwhen she was choking with dust, and almost prostrate with heat and\nexhaustion--crash, she ran into a broken bottle. Snap! went the tire;\nthe wheel swerved and pitched over. The Angel rolled into the thick\nyellow dust of the road and lay quietly.\n\nFrom afar, Duncan began to notice a strange, dust-covered object in the\nroad, as he headed toward town with the first load of the day's felling.\n\nHe chirruped to the bays and hurried them all he could. As he neared the\nAngel, he saw it was a woman and a broken wheel. He was beside her in an\ninstant. He carried her to a shaded fence-corner, stretched her on\nthe grass, and wiped the dust from the lovely face all dirt-streaked,\ncrimson, and bearing a startling whiteness around the mouth and nose.\n\nWheels were common enough. Many of the farmers' daughters owned and\nrode them, but he knew these same farmers' daughters; this face was a\nstranger's. He glanced at the Angel's tumbled clothing, the silkiness of\nher hair, with its pale satin ribbon, and noticed that she had lost her\nhat. Her lips tightened in an ominous quiver. He left her and picked\nup the wheel: as he had surmised, he knew it. This, then, was Freckles'\nSwamp Angel. There was trouble in the Limberlost, and she had broken\ndown racing to McLean. Duncan turned the bays into a fence-corner, tied\none of them, unharnessed the other, fastened up the trace chains, and\nhurried to the nearest farmhouse to send help to the Angel. He found a\nwoman, who took a bottle of camphor, a jug of water, and some towels,\nand started on the run.\n\nThen Duncan put the bay to speed and raced to camp.\n\nThe Angel, left alone, lay still for a second, then she shivered and\nopened her eyes. She saw that she was on the grass and the broken wheel\nbeside her. Instantly she realized that someone had carried her there\nand gone after help. She sat up and looked around. She noticed the load\nof logs and the one horse. Someone was riding after help for her!\n\n“Oh, poor Freckles!” she wailed. “They may be killing him by now. Oh,\nhow much time have I wasted?”\n\nShe hurried to the other bay, her fingers flying as she set him free.\nSnatching up a big blacksnake whip that lay on the ground, she caught\nthe hames, stretched along the horse's neck, and, for the first time,\nthe fine, big fellow felt on his back the quality of the lash that\nDuncan was accustomed to crack over him. He was frightened, and ran at\ntop speed.\n\nThe Angel passed a wildly waving, screaming woman on the road, and a\nlittle later a man riding as if he, too, were in great haste. The man\ncalled to her, but she only lay lower and used the whip. Soon the feet\nof the man's horse sounded farther and farther away.\n\nAt the South camp they were loading a second wagon, when the Angel\nappeared riding one of Duncan's bays, lathered and dripping, and cried:\n“Everybody go to Freckles! There are thieves stealing trees, and they\nhad him bound. They're going to kill him!”\n\nShe wheeled the horse toward the Limberlost. The alarm sounded through\ncamp. The gang were not unprepared. McLean sprang to Nellie's back and\nraced after the Angel. As they passed Duncan, he wheeled and followed.\nSoon the pike was an irregular procession of barebacked riders, wildly\ndriving flying horses toward the swamp.\n\nThe Boss rode neck-and-neck with the Angel. He repeatedly commanded her\nto stop and fall out of line, until he remembered that he would need her\nto lead him to Freckles. Then he gave up and rode beside her, for she\nwas sending the bay at as sharp a pace as the other horses could keep\nand hold out. He could see that she was not hearing him. He glanced back\nand saw that Duncan was close. There was something terrifying in the\nappearance of the big man, and the manner in which he sat his beast and\nrode. It would be a sad day for the man on whom Duncan's wrath broke.\nThere were four others close behind him, and the pike filling with the\nremainder of the gang; so McLean took heart and raced beside the Angel.\nOver and over he asked her where the trouble was, but she only gripped\nthe hames, leaned along the bay's neck, and slashed away with the\nblacksnake. The steaming horse, with crimson nostrils and heaving sides,\nstretched out and ran for home with all the speed there was in him.\n\nWhen they passed the cabin, the Bird Woman's carriage was there and Mrs.\nDuncan in the door wringing her hands, but the Bird Woman was nowhere to\nbe seen. The Angel sent the bay along the path and turned into the west\ntrail, while the men bunched and followed her. When she reached the\nentrance to Freckles' room, there were four men with her, and two more\nvery close behind. She slid from the horse, and snatching the little\nrevolver from her pocket, darted toward the bushes. McLean caught them\nback, and with drawn weapon, pressed beside her. There they stopped in\nastonishment.\n\nThe Bird Woman blocked the entrance. Over a small limb lay her revolver.\nIt was trained at short range on Black Jack and Wessner, who stood with\ntheir hands above their heads.\n\nFreckles, with the blood trickling down his face, from an ugly cut in\nhis temple, was gagged and bound to the tree again; the remainder of the\nmen were gone. Black Jack was raving as a maniac, and when they looked\ncloser it was only the left arm that he raised. His right, with the\nhand shattered, hung helpless at his side, while his revolver lay\nat Freckles' feet. Wessner's weapon was in his belt, and beside him\nFreckles' club.\n\nFreckles' face was white, with colorless lips, but in his eyes was the\nstrength of undying courage. McLean pushed past the Bird Woman crying.\n“Hold steady on them only one minute more!”\n\nHe snatched the revolver from Wessner's belt, and stooped for Jack's.\n\nAt that instant the Angel rushed past. She tore the gag from Freckles,\nand seizing the rope knotted on his chest, she tugged at it desperately.\nUnder her fingers it gave way, and she hurled it to McLean. The men were\ncrowding in, and Duncan seized Wessner. As the Angel saw Freckles stand\nout, free, she reached her arms to him and pitched forward. A fearful\noath burst from the lips of Black Jack. To have saved his life, Freckles\ncould not have avoided the glance of triumph he gave Jack, when folding\nthe Angel in his arms and stretching her on the mosses.\n\nThe Bird Woman cried out sharply for water as she ran to them. Someone\nsprang to bring that, and another to break open the case for brandy.\nAs McLean arose from binding Wessner, there was a cry that Jack was\nescaping.\n\nHe was already far in the swamp, running for its densest part in leaping\nbounds. Every man who could be spared plunged after him.\n\nOther members of the gang arriving, were sent to follow the tracks\nof the wagons. The teamsters had driven from the west entrance, and\ncrossing the swale, had taken the same route the Bird Woman and the\nAngel had before them. There had been ample time for the drivers to\nreach the road; after that they could take any one of four directions.\nTraffic was heavy, and lumber wagons were passing almost constantly,\nso the men turned back and joined the more exciting hunt for a man.\nThe remainder of the gang joined them, also farmers of the region and\ntravelers attracted by the disturbance.\n\nWatchers were set along the trail at short intervals. They patrolled the\nline and roads through the swamp that night, with lighted torches, and\nthe next day McLean headed as thorough a search as he felt could be made\nof one side, while Duncan covered the other; but Black Jack could not be\nfound. Spies were set around his home, in Wildcat Hollow, to ascertain\nif he reached there or aid was being sent in any direction to him; but\nit was soon clear that his relatives were ignorant of his hiding-place,\nand were searching for him.\n\nGreat is the elasticity of youth. A hot bath and a sound night's sleep\nrenewed Freckles' strength, and it needed but little more to work the\nsame result with the Angel. Freckles was on the trail early the next\nmorning. Besides a crowd of people anxious to witness Jack's capture,\nhe found four stalwart guards, one at each turn. In his heart he was\ncompelled to admit that he was glad to have them there. Close noon,\nMcLean placed his men in charge of Duncan, and taking Freckles, drove to\ntown to see how the Angel fared. McLean visited a greenhouse and bought\nan armload of its finest products; but Freckles would have none of them.\nHe would carry his message in a glowing mass of the Limberlost's first\ngoldenrod.\n\nThe Bird Woman received them, and in answer to their eager inquiries,\nsaid that the Angel was in no way seriously injured, only so bruised\nand shaken that their doctor had ordered her to lie quietly for the day.\nThough she was sore and stiff, they were having work to keep her in bed.\nHer callers sent up their flowers with their grateful regards, and the\nAngel promptly returned word that she wanted to see them.\n\nShe reached both hands to McLean. “What if one old tree is gone? You\ndon't care, sir? You feel that Freckles has kept his trust as nobody\never did before, don't you? You won't forget all those long first days\nof fright that you told us of, the fearful cold of winter, the rain,\nheat, and lonesomeness, and the brave days, and lately, nights, too, and\nlet him feel that his trust is broken? Oh, Mr. McLean,” she begged,\n“say something to him! Do something to make him feel that it isn't for\nnothing he has watched and suffered it out with that old Limberlost.\nMake him see how great and fine it is, and how far, far better he has\ndone than you or any of us expected! What's one old tree, anyway?” she\ncried passionately.\n\n“I was thinking before you came. Those other men were rank big cowards.\nThey were scared for their lives. If they were the drivers, I wager you\ngloves against gloves they never took those logs out to the pike. My\ncoming upset them. Before you feel bad any more, you go look and see if\nthey didn't lose courage the minute they left Wessner and Black Jack,\ndump that timber and run. I don't believe they ever had the grit to\ndrive out with it in daylight. Go see if they didn't figure on leaving\nthe way we did the other morning, and you'll find the logs before you\nreach the road. They never risked taking them into the open, when they\ngot away and had time to think. Of course they didn't!\n\n“And, then, another thing. You haven't lost your wager! It never will\nbe claimed, because you made it with a stout, dark, red-faced man who\ndrives a bay and a gray. He was right back of you, Mr. McLean, when I\ncame yesterday. He went deathly white and shook on his feet when he saw\nthose men probably would be caught. Some one of them was something to\nhim, and you can just spot him for one of the men at the bottom of your\ntroubles, and urging those younger fellows to steal from you. I suppose\nhe'd promised to divide. You settle with him, and that business will\nstop.”\n\nShe turned to Freckles. “And you be the happiest man alive, because you\nhave kept your trust. Go look where I tell you and you'll find the logs.\nI can see just about where they are. When they go up that steep little\nhill, into the next woods after the cornfield, why, they could unloose\nthe chains and the logs would roll from the wagons themselves. Now, you\ngo look; and Mr. McLean, you do feel that Freckles has been brave and\nfaithful? You won't love him any the less even if you don't find the\nlogs.”\n\nThe Angel's nerve gave way and she began to cry. Freckles could not\nendure it. He almost ran from the room, with the tears in his eyes; but\nMcLean took the Angel from the Bird Woman's arms, and kissed her brave\nlittle face, stroked her hair, and petted her into quietness before he\nleft.\n\nAs they drove to the swamp, McLean so earnestly seconded all that the\nAngel had said that he soon had the boy feeling much better.\n\n“Freckles, your Angel has a spice of the devil in her, but she's superb!\nYou needn't spend any time questioning or bewailing anything she does.\nJust worship blindly, my boy. By heaven! she's sense, courage, and\nbeauty for half a dozen girls,” said McLean.\n\n“It's altogether right you are, sir,” affirmed Freckles heartily.\nPresently he added, “There's no question but the series is over now.”\n\n“Don't think it!” answered McLean. “The Bird Woman is working for\nsuccess, and success along any line is not won by being scared out. She\nwill be back on the usual day, and ten to one, the Angel will be with\nher. They are made of pretty stern stuff, and they don't scare worth\na cent. Before I left, I told the Bird Woman it would be safe; and it\nwill. You may do your usual walking, but those four guards are there to\nremain. They are under your orders absolutely. They are prohibited from\nfiring on any bird or molesting anything that you want to protect, but\nthere they remain, and this time it is useless for you to say one word.\nI have listened to your pride too long. You are too precious to me, and\nthat voice of yours is too precious to the world to run any more risks.”\n\n“I am sorry to have anything spoil the series,” said Freckles, “and I'd\nlove them to be coming, the Angel especial, but it can't be. You'll have\nto tell them so. You see, Jack would have been ready to stake his life\nshe meant what she said and did to him. When the teams pulled out,\nWessner seized me; then he and Jack went to quarreling over whether they\nshould finish me then or take me to the next tree they were for felling.\nBetween them they were pulling me around and hurting me bad. Wessner\nwanted to get at me right then, and Jack said he shouldn't be touching\nme till the last tree was out and all the rest of them gone. I'm\nbelaying Jack really hated to see me done for in the beginning; and\nI think, too, he was afraid if Wessner finished me then he'd lose his\nnerve and cut, and they couldn't be managing the felling without him;\nanyway, they were hauling me round like I was already past all feeling,\nand they tied me up again. To keep me courage up, I twits Wessner about\nhaving to tie me and needing another man to help handle me. I told him\nwhat I'd do to him if I was free, and he grabs up me own club and lays\nopen me head with it. When the blood came streaming, it set Jack raving,\nand he cursed and damned Wessner for a coward and a softy. Then Wessner\nturned on Jack and gives it to him for letting the Angel make a fool of\nhim. Tells him she was just playing with him, and beyond all manner of\ndoubt she'd gone after you, and there was nothing to do on account of\nhis foolishness but finish me, get out, and let the rest of the timber\ngo, for likely you was on the way right then. That drove Jack plum\ncrazy.\n\n“I don't think he was for having a doubt of the Angel before, but then\nhe just raved. He grabbed out his gun and turned on Wessner. Spang! It\nwent out of his fist, and the order comes: 'Hands up!' Wessner reached\nfor kingdom come like he was expecting to grab hold and pull himself\nup. Jack puts up what he has left. Then he leans over to me and tells me\nwhat he'll do to me if he ever gets out of there alive. Then, just like\na snake hissing, he spits out what he'll do to her for playing him. He\ndid get away, and with his strength, that wound in his hand won't be\nbothering him long. He'll do to me just what he said, and when he hears\nit really was she that went after you, why, he'll keep his oath about\nher.\n\n“He's lived in the swamp all his life, sir, and everybody says it's\nalways been the home of cutthroats, outlaws, and runaways. He knows its\nmost secret places as none of the others. He's alive. He's in there now,\nsir. Some way he'll keep alive. If you'd seen his face, all scarlet with\npassion, twisted with pain, and black with hate, and heard him swearing\nthat oath, you'd know it was a sure thing. I ain't done with him yet,\nand I've brought this awful thing on her.”\n\n“And I haven't begun with him yet,” said McLean, setting his teeth.\n“I've been away too slow and too easy, believing there'd be no greater\nharm than the loss of a tree. I've sent for a couple of first-class\ndetectives. We will put them on his track, and rout him out and rid the\ncountry of him. I don't propose for him to stop either our work or our\npleasure. As for his being in the swamp now, I don't believe it. He'd\nfind a way out last night, in spite of us. Don't you worry! I am at the\nhelm now, and I'll see to that gentleman in my own way.”\n\n“I wish to my soul you had seen and heard him!” said Freckles,\nunconvinced.\n\nThey entered the swamp, taking the route followed by the Bird Woman and\nthe Angel. They really did find the logs, almost where the Angel had\npredicted they would be. McLean went to the South camp and had an\ninterview with Crowen that completely convinced him that the Angel\nwas correct there also. But he had no proof, so all he could do was to\ndischarge the man, although his guilt was so apparent that he offered to\nwithdraw the wager.\n\nThen McLean sent for a pack of bloodhounds and put them on the trail of\nBlack Jack. They clung to it, on and on, into the depths of the swamp,\nleading their followers through what had been considered impassable and\nimpenetrable ways, and finally, around near the west entrance and into\nthe swale. Here the dogs bellowed, raved, and fell over each other in\ntheir excitement. They raced back and forth from swamp to swale, but\nfollow the scent farther they would not, even though cruelly driven. At\nlast their owner attributed their actions to snakes, and as they were\nvery valuable dogs, abandoned the effort to urge them on. So that all\nthey really established was the fact that Black Jack had eluded their\nvigilance and crossed the trail some time in the night. He had escaped\nto the swale; from there he probably crossed the corduroy, and reaching\nthe lower end of the swamp, had found friends. It was a great relief to\nfeel that he was not in the swamp, and it raised the spirits of every\nman on the line, though many of them expressed regrets that he who\nwas undoubtedly most to blame should escape, while Wessner, who in the\nbeginning was only his tool, should be left to punishment.\n\nBut for Freckles, with Jack's fearful oath ringing in his ears, there\nwas neither rest nor peace. He was almost ill when the day for the next\nstudy of the series arrived and he saw the Bird Woman and the Angel\ncoming down the corduroy. The guards of the east line he left at their\ncustomary places, but those of the west he brought over and placed, one\nnear Little Chicken's tree, and the other at the carriage. He was firm\nabout the Angel's remaining in the carriage, that he did not offer to\nhave unhitched. He went with the Bird Woman to secure the picture,\nwhich was the easiest matter it had been at any time yet, for the simple\nreason that the placing of the guards and the unusual movement around\nthe swamp had made Mr. and Mrs. Chicken timid, and they had not carried\nLittle Chicken the customary amount of food. Freckles, in the anxiety of\nthe past few days, had neglected him, and he had been so hungry, much\nof the time, that when the Bird Woman held up a sweet-bread, although\nhe had started toward the recesses of the log at her coming, he stopped;\nwith slightly opened beak, he waited anxiously for the treat, and gave a\nstudy of great value, showing every point of his head, also his wing and\ntail development.\n\nWhen the Bird Woman proposed to look for other subjects close about the\nline, Freckles went so far as to tell her that Jack had made fearful\nthreats against the Angel. He implored her to take the Angel home and\nkeep her under unceasing guard until Jack was located. He wanted to\ntell her all about it, but he knew how dear the Angel was to her, and he\ndreaded to burden her with his fears when they might prove groundless.\nHe allowed her to go, but afterward blamed himself severely for having\ndone so.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XIV\n\nWherein Freckles Nurses a Heartache and Black Jack Drops Out\n\n“McLean,” said Mrs. Duncan, as the Boss paused to greet her in passing\nthe cabin, “do you know that Freckles hasna been in bed the past five\nnights and all he's eaten in that many days ye could pack into a pint\ncup?”\n\n“Why, what does the boy mean?” demanded McLean. “There's no necessity\nfor him being on guard, with the watch I've set on the line. I had no\nidea he was staying down there.”\n\n“He's no there,” said Mrs. Duncan. “He goes somewhere else. He leaves\non his wheel juist after we're abed and rides in close cock-crow or a\nlittle earlier, and he's looking like death and nothing short of it.”\n\n“But where does he go?” asked McLean in astonishment.\n\n“I'm no given to bearing tales out of school,” said Sarah Duncan, “but\nin this case I'd tell ye if I could. What the trouble is I dinna ken. If\nit is no' stopped, he's in for dreadful sickness, and I thought ye could\nfind out and help him. He's in sair trouble; that's all I know.”\n\nMcLean sat brooding as he stroked Nellie's neck.\n\nAt last he said: “I suspect I understand. At any rate, I think I can\nfind out. Thank you for telling me.”\n\n“Ye'll no need telling, once ye clap your eyes on him,” prophesied\nMrs. Duncan. “His face is all a glist'ny yellow, and he's peaked as a\nstarving caged bird.”\n\nMcLean rode to the Limberlost, and stopping in the shade, sat waiting\nfor Freckles, whose hour for passing the foot of the lease had come.\n\nAlong the north line came Freckles, fairly staggering. When he turned\neast and reached Sleepy Snake Creek, sliding through the swale as the\nlong black snake for which it was named, he sat on the bridge and closed\nhis burning eyes, but they would not remain shut. As if pulled by wires,\nthe heavy lids flew open, while the outraged nerves and muscles of his\nbody danced, twitched, and tingled.\n\nHe bent forward and idly watched the limpid little stream flowing\nbeneath his feet. Stretching into the swale, it came creeping between\nan impenetrable wall of magnificent wild flowers, vines, and ferns.\nMilkweed, goldenrod, ironwort, fringed gentians, cardinal-flowers, and\nturtle-head stood on the very edge of the creek, and every flower of\nthem had a double in the water. Wild clematis crowned with snow the\nheads of trees scattered here and there on the bank.\n\nFrom afar the creek appeared to be murky, dirty water. Really it was\nclear and sparkling. The tinge of blackness was gained from its bed of\nmuck showing through the transparent current. He could see small and\nwonderfully marked fish. What became of them when the creek spread into\nthe swamp? For one thing, they would make mighty fine eating for the\nfamily of that self-satisfied old blue heron.\n\nFreckles sat so quietly that soon the brim of his hat was covered with\nsnake-feeders, rasping their crisp wings and singing while they rested.\nSome of them settled on the club, and one on his shoulder. He was so\nmotionless; feathers, fur, and gauze were so accustomed to him, that\nall through the swale they continued their daily life and forgot he was\nthere.\n\nThe heron family were wading the mouth of the creek. Freckles idly\nwondered whether the nerve-racking rasps they occasionally emitted\nindicated domestic felicity or a raging quarrel. He could not decide. A\nsheitpoke, with flaring crest, went stalking across a bare space\nclose to the creek's mouth. A stately brown bittern waded into the\nclear-flowing water, lifting his feet high at every step, and setting\nthem down carefully, as if he dreaded wetting them, and with slightly\nparted beak, stood eagerly watching around him for worms. Behind him\nwere some mighty trees of the swamp above, and below the bank glowed a\nsolid wall of goldenrod.\n\nNo wonder the ancients had chosen yellow as the color to represent\nvictory, for the fierce, conquering hue of the sun was in it. They had\ndone well, too, in selecting purple as the emblem of royalty. It was a\ndignified, compelling color, while in its warm tone there was a hint of\nblood.\n\nIt was the Limberlost's hour to proclaim her sovereignty and triumph.\nEverywhere she flaunted her yellow banner and trailed the purple of her\nmantle, that was paler in the thistle-heads, took on strength in the\nfirst opening asters, and glowed and burned in the ironwort.\n\nHe gazed into her damp, mossy recesses where high-piled riven trees\ndecayed under coats of living green, where dainty vines swayed and\nclambered, and here and there a yellow leaf, fluttering down, presaged\nthe coming of winter. His love of the swamp laid hold of him and shook\nhim with its force.\n\nCompellingly beautiful was the Limberlost, but cruel withal; for inside\nbleached the uncoffined bones of her victims, while she had missed\ncradling him, oh! so narrowly.\n\nHe shifted restlessly; the movement sent the snake-feeders skimming. The\nhum of life swelled and roared in his strained ears. Small turtles, that\nhad climbed on a log to sun, splashed clumsily into the water. Somewhere\nin the timber of the bridge a bloodthirsty little frog cried sharply.\n“KEEL'IM! KEEL'IM!”\n\nFreckles muttered: “It's worse than that Black Jack swore to do to me,\nlittle fellow.”\n\nA muskrat waddled down the bank and swam for the swamp, its pointed nose\nriffling the water into a shining trail in its wake.\n\nThen, below the turtle-log, a dripping silver-gray head, with shining\neyes, was cautiously lifted, and Freckles' hand slid to his revolver.\nHigher and higher came the head, a long, heavy, furcoated body arose,\nnow half, now three-fourths from the water. Freckles looked at his\nshaking hand and doubted, but he gathered his forces, the shot rang, and\nthe otter lay quiet. He hurried down and tried to lift it. He scarcely\ncould muster strength to carry it to the bridge. The consciousness that\nhe really could go no farther with it made Freckles realize the fact\nthat he was close the limit of human endurance. He could bear it little,\nif any, longer. Every hour the dear face of the Angel wavered before\nhim, and behind it the awful distorted image of Black Jack, as he had\nsworn to the punishment he would mete out to her. He must either see\nMcLean, or else make a trip to town and find her father. Which should\nhe do? He was almost a stranger, so the Angel's father might not be\nimpressed with what he said as he would if McLean went to him. Then he\nremembered that McLean had said he would come that morning. Freckles\nnever had forgotten before. He hurried on the east trail as fast as his\ntottering legs would carry him.\n\nHe stopped when he came to the first guard, and telling him of his luck,\nasked him to get the otter and carry it to the cabin, as he was anxious\nto meet McLean.\n\nFreckles passed the second guard without seeing him, and hurried to the\nBoss. He took off his hat, wiped his forehead, and stood silent under\nthe eyes of McLean.\n\nThe Boss was dumbfounded. Mrs. Duncan had led him to expect that he\nwould find a change in Freckles, but this was almost deathly. The fact\nwas apparent that the boy scarcely knew what he was doing. His eyes had\na glazed, far-sighted appearance, that wrung the heart of the man who\nloved him. Without a thought of preliminaries, McLean leaned in the\nsaddle and drew Freckles to him.\n\n“My poor lad!” he said. “My poor, dear lad! tell me, and we will try to\nright it!”\n\nFreckles had twisted his fingers in Nellie's mane. At the kind words his\nface dropped on McLean's thigh and he shook with a nervous chill. McLean\ngathered him closer and waited.\n\nWhen the guard came with the otter, McLean without a word motioned him\nto lay it down and leave them.\n\n“Freckles,” said McLean at last, “will you tell me, or must I set to\nwork in the dark and try to find the trouble?”\n\n“Oh, I want to tell you! I must tell you, sir,” shuddered Freckles.\n“I cannot be bearing it the day out alone. I was coming to you when I\nremimbered you would be here.”\n\nHe lifted his face and gazed across the swale, with his jaws set firmly\na minute, as if gathering his forces. Then he spoke.\n\n“It's the Angel, sir,” he said.\n\nInstinctively McLean's grip on him tightened, and Freckles looked into\nthe Boss's face in wonder.\n\n“I tried, the other day,” said Freckles, “and I couldn't seem to make\nyou see. It's only that there hasn't been an hour, waking or sleeping,\nsince the day she parted the bushes and looked into me room, that the\nface of her hasn't been before me in all the tinderness, beauty, and\nmischief of it. She talked to me friendly like. She trusted me entirely\nto take right care of her. She helped me with things about me books. She\ntraited me like I was born a gintleman, and shared with me as if I were\nof her own blood. She walked the streets of the town with me before her\nfriends with all the pride of a queen. She forgot herself and didn't\nmind the Bird Woman, and run big risks to help me out that first day,\nsir. This last time she walked into that gang of murderers, took their\nleader, and twisted him to the will of her. She outdone him and raced\nthe life almost out of her trying to save me.\n\n“Since I can remimber, whatever the thing was that happened to me in the\nbeginning has been me curse. I've been bitter, hard, and smarting under\nit hopelessly. She came by, and found me voice, and put hope of life and\nsuccess like other men into me in spite of it.”\n\nFreckles held up his maimed arm.\n\n“Look at it, sir!” he said. “A thousand times I've cursed it, hanging\nthere helpless. She took it on the street, before all the people, just\nas if she didn't see that it was a thing to hide and shrink from. Again\nand again I've had the feeling with her, if I didn't entirely forget it,\nthat she didn't see it was gone and I must he pointing it out to her.\nHer touch on it was so sacred-like, at times since I've caught meself\nlooking at the awful thing near like I was proud of it, sir. If I had\nbeen born your son she couldn't be traiting me more as her equal, and\nshe can't help knowing you ain't truly me father. Nobody can know the\nhomeliness or the ignorance of me better than I do, and all me lack of\nbirth, relatives, and money, and what's it all to her?”\n\nFreckles stepped back, squared his shoulders, and with a royal lift of\nhis head looked straight into the Boss's eyes.\n\n“You saw her in the beautiful little room of her, and you can't be\nforgetting how she begged and plead with you for me. She touched me\nbody, and 'twas sanctified. She laid her lips on my brow, and 'twas\nsacrament. Nobody knows the height of her better than me. Nobody's\nstudied my depths closer. There's no bridge for the great distance\nbetween us, sir, and clearest of all, I'm for realizing it: but she\nrisked terrible things when she came to me among that gang of thieves.\nShe wore herself past bearing to save me from such an easy thing as\ndeath! Now, here's me, a man, a big, strong man, and letting her live\nunder that fearful oath, so worse than any death 'twould be for her, and\nlifting not a finger to save her. I cannot hear it, sir. It's killing me\nby inches! Black Jack's hand may not have been hurt so bad. Any hour he\nmay be creeping up behind her! Any minute the awful revenge he swore\nto be taking may in some way fall on her, and I haven't even warned her\nfather. I can't stay here doing nothing another hour. The five nights\ngone I've watched under her windows, but there's the whole of the day.\nShe's her own horse and little cart, and's free to be driving through\nthe town and country as she pleases. If any evil comes to her through\nBlack Jack, it comes from her angel-like goodness to me. Somewhere he's\nhiding! Somewhere he is waiting his chance! Somewhere he is reaching out\nfor her! I tell you I cannot, I dare not be bearing it longer!”\n\n“Freckles, be quiet!” said McLean, his eyes humid and his voice\nquivering with the pity of it all. “Believe me, I did not understand.\nI know the Angel's father well. I will go to him at once. I have\ntransacted business with him for the past three years. I will make him\nsee! I am only beginning to realize your agony, and the real danger\nthere is for the Angel. Believe me, I will see that she is fully\nprotected every hour of the day and night until Jack is located and\ndisposed of. And I promise you further, that if I fail to move her\nfather or make him understand the danger, I will maintain a guard over\nher until Jack is caught. Now will you go bathe, drink some milk, go to\nbed, and sleep for hours, and then be my brave, bright old boy again?”\n\n“Yis,” said Freckles simply.\n\nBut McLean could see the flesh was twitching on the lad's bones.\n\n“What was it the guard brought there?” McLean asked in an effort to\ndistract Freckles' thoughts.\n\n“Oh!” Freckles said, glancing where the Boss pointed, “I forgot it! 'Tis\nan otter, and fine past believing, for this warm weather. I shot it at\nthe creek this morning. 'Twas a good shot, considering. I expected to\nmiss.”\n\nFreckles picked up the animal and started toward McLean with it, but\nNellie pricked up her dainty little ears, danced into the swale, and\nsnorted with fright. Freckles dropped the otter and ran to her head.\n\n“For pity's sake, get her on the trail, sir,” he begged. “She's just\nabout where the old king rattler crosses to go into the swamp--the old\nbuster Duncan and I have been telling you of. I haven't a doubt but it\nwas the one Mother Duncan met. 'Twas down the trail there, just a little\nfarther on, that I found her, and it's sure to be close yet.”\n\nMcLean slid from Nellie's back, led her into the trail farther down the\nline, and tied her to a bush. Then he went to examine the otter. It was\na rare, big specimen, with exquisitely fine, long, silky hair.\n\n“What do you want to do with it, Freckles?” asked McLean, as he stroked\nthe soft fur lingeringly. “Do you know that it is very valuable?”\n\n“I was for almost praying so, sir,” said Freckles. “As I saw it coming\nup the bank I thought this: Once somewhere in a book there was a picture\nof a young girl, and she was just a breath like the beautifulness of the\nAngel. Her hands were in a muff as big as her body, and I thought it\nwas so pretty. I think she was some queen, or the like. Do you suppose\nI could have this skin tanned and made into such a muff as that?--an\nenormous big one, sir?”\n\n“Of course you can,” said McLean. “That's a fine idea and it's easy\nenough. We must box and express the otter, cold storage, by the first\ntrain. You stand guard a minute and I'll tell Hall to carry it to the\ncabin. I'll put Nellie to Duncan's rig, and we'll drive to town and call\non the Angel's father. Then we'll start the otter while it is fresh, and\nI'll write your instructions later. It would be a mighty fine thing for\nyou to give to the Angel as a little reminder of the Limberlost before\nit is despoiled, and as a souvenir of her trip for you.”\n\nFreckles lifted a face with a glow of happy color creeping into it and\neyes lighting with a former brightness. Throwing his arms around McLean,\nhe cried: “Oh, how I love you! Oh, I wish I could make you know how I\nlove you!”\n\nMcLean strained him to his breast.\n\n“God bless you, Freckles,” he said. “I do know! We're going to have some\ngood old times out of this world together, and we can't begin too soon.\nWould you rather sleep first, or have a bite of lunch, take the drive\nwith me, and then rest? I don't know but sleep will come sooner and\ndeeper to take the ride and have your mind set at ease before you lie\ndown. Suppose you go.”\n\n“Suppose I do,” said Freckles, with a glimmer of the old light in his\neyes and newly found strength to shoulder the otter. Together they\nturned into the trail.\n\nMcLean noticed and spoke of the big black chickens.\n\n“They've been hanging round out there for several days past,” said\nFreckles. “I'll tell you what I think it means. I think the old rattler\nhas killed something too big for him to swallow, and he's keeping guard\nand won't let me chickens have it. I'm just sure, from the way the birds\nhave acted out there all summer, that it is the rattler's den. You watch\nthem now. See the way they dip and then rise, frightened like!”\n\nSuddenly McLean turned toward him with blanching face\n\n“Freckles!” he cried.\n\n“My God, sir!” shuddered Freckles.\n\nHe dropped the otter, caught up his club, and plunged into the swale.\nReaching for his revolver, McLean followed. The chickens circled higher\nat their coming, and the big snake lifted his head and rattled angrily.\nIt sank in sinuous coils at the report of McLean's revolver, and\ntogether he and Freckles stood beside Black Jack. His fate was evident\nand most horrible.\n\n“Come,” said the Boss at last. “We don't dare touch him. We will get\na sheet from Mrs. Duncan and tuck over him, to keep these swarms of\ninsects away, and set Hall on guard, while we find the officers.”\n\nFreckles' lips closed resolutely. He deliberately thrust his club under\nBlack Jack's body, and, raising him, rested it on his knee. He pulled\na long silver pin from the front of the dead man's shirt and sent it\nspinning into the swale. Then he gathered up a few crumpled bright\nflowers and dropped them into the pool far away.\n\n“My soul is sick with the horror of this thing,” said McLean, as he\nand Freckles drove toward town. “I can't understand how Jack dared risk\ncreeping through the swale, even in desperation. No one knew its dangers\nbetter than he. And why did he choose the rankest, muckiest place to\ncross the swamp?”\n\n“Don't you think, sir, it was because it was on a line with the\nLimberlost south of the corduroy? The grass was tallest there, and he\ncounted on those willows to screen him. Once he got among them, he would\nhave been safe to walk by stooping. If he'd made it past that place,\nhe'd been sure to get out.”\n\n“Well, I'm as sorry for Jack as I know how to be,” said McLean, “but\nI can't help feeling relieved that our troubles are over, for now they\nare. With so dreadful a punishment for Jack, Wessner under arrest, and\nwarrants for the others, we can count on their going away and remaining.\nAs for anyone else, I don't think they will care to attempt stealing\nmy timber after the experience of these men. There is no other man here\nwith Jack's fine ability in woodcraft. He was an expert.”\n\n“Did you ever hear of anyone who ever tried to locate any trees\nexcepting him?” asked Freckles.\n\n“No, I never did,” said McLean. “I am sure there was no one besides\nhim. You see, it was only with the arrival of our company that the other\nfellows scented good stuff in the Limberlost, and tried to work in. Jack\nknew the swamp better than anyone here. When he found there were two\ncompanies trying to lease, he wanted to stand in with the one from which\nhe could realize the most. Even then he had trees marked that he was\ntrying to dispose of. I think his sole intention in forcing me to\ndischarge him from my gang was to come here and try to steal timber. We\nhad no idea, when we took the lease, what a gold mine it was.”\n\n“That's exactly what Wessner said that first day,” said Freckles\neagerly. “That 'twas a 'gold mine'! He said he didn't know where the\nmarked trees were, but he knew a man who did, and if I would hold off\nand let them get the marked ones, there were a dozen they could get out\nin a few days.”\n\n“Freckles!” cried McLean. “You don't mean a dozen!”\n\n“That's what he said, sir--a dozen. He said they couldn't tell how the\ngrain of all of them would work up, of course, but they were all worth\ntaking out, and five or six were real gold mines. This makes three\nthey've tried, so there must be nine more marked, and several of them\nfor being just fine.”\n\n“Well, I wish I knew which they are,” said McLean, “so I could get them\nout first.”\n\n“I have been thinking,” said Freckles. “I believe if you will leave one\nof the guards on the line--say Hall--that I will begin on the swamp,\nat the north end, and lay it off in sections, and try to hunt out the\nmarked trees. I suppose they are all marked something like that first\nmaple on the line was. Wessner mentioned another good one not so far\nfrom that. He said it was best of all. I'd be having the swelled head if\nI could find that. Of course, I don't know a thing about the trees, but\nI could hunt for the marks. Jack was so good at it he could tell some of\nthem by the bark, but all he wanted to take that we've found so far have\njust had a deep chip cut out, rather low down, and where the bushes were\nthick over it. I believe I could be finding some of them.”\n\n“Good head!” said McLean. “We will do that. You may begin as soon as you\nare rested. And about things you come across in the swamp, Freckles--the\nmost trifling little thing that you think the Bird Woman would want,\ntake your wheel and go after her at any time. I'll leave two men on the\nline, so that you will have one on either side, and you can come and go\nas you please. Have you stopped to think of all we owe her, my boy?”\n\n“Yis; and the Angel--we owe her a lot, too,” said Freckles. “I owe her\nme life and honor. It's lying awake nights I'll have to be trying to\nthink how I'm ever to pay her up.”\n\n“Well, begin with the muff,” suggested McLean. “That should be fine.”\n\nHe bent down and ruffled the rich fur of the otter lying at his feet.\n\n“I don't exactly see how it comes to be in such splendid fur in summer.\nTheir coats are always thick in cold weather, but this scarcely could\nbe improved. I'll wire Cooper to be watching for it. They must have it\nfresh. When it's tanned we won't spare any expense in making it up. It\nshould be a royal thing, and some way I think it will exactly suit the\nAngel. I can't think of anything that would be more appropriate for\nher.”\n\n“Neither can I,” agreed Freckles heartily. “When I reach the city\nthere's one other thing, if I've the money after the muff is finished.”\n\nHe told McLean of Mrs. Duncan's desire for a hat similar to the Angel's.\nHe hesitated a little in the telling, keeping sharp watch on McLean's\nface. When he saw the Boss's eyes were full of comprehension and\nsympathy, he loved him anew, for, as ever, McLean was quick to\nunderstand. Instead of laughing, he said: “I think you'll have to let\nme in on that, too. You mustn't be selfish, you know. I'll tell you what\nwe'll do. Send it for Christmas. I'll be home then, and we can fill a\nbox. You get the hat. I'll add a dress and wrap. You buy Duncan a hat\nand gloves. I'll send him a big overcoat, and we'll put in a lot of\nlittle stuff for the babies. Won't that be fun?”\n\nFreckles fairly shivered with delight.\n\n“That would be away too serious for fun,” he said. “That would be\nheavenly. How long will it be?”\n\nHe began counting the time, and McLean deliberately set himself to\nencourage Freckles and keep his thoughts from the trouble of the past\nfew days, for he had been overwrought and needed quiet and rest.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XV\n\nWherein Freckles and the Angel Try Taking a Picture, and Little Chicken\nFurnishes the Subject\n\nA week later everything at the Limberlost was precisely as it had been\nbefore the tragedy, except the case in Freckles' room now rested on the\nstump of the newly felled tree. Enough of the vines were left to cover\nit prettily, and every vestige of the havoc of a few days before was\ngone. New guards were patrolling the trail. Freckles was roughly laying\noff the swamp in sections and searching for marked trees. In that time\nhe had found one deeply chipped and the chip cunningly replaced and\ntacked in. It promised to be quite rare, so he was jubilant. He also\nfound so many subjects for the Bird Woman that her coming was of almost\ndaily occurrence, and the hours he spent with her and the Angel were\nnothing less than golden.\n\nThe Limberlost was now arrayed as the Queen of Sheba in all her glory.\nThe first frosts of autumn had bejewelled her crown in flashing topaz,\nruby, and emerald. Around her feet trailed the purple of her garments,\nwhile in her hand was her golden scepter. Everything was at full tide.\nIt seemed as if nothing could grow lovelier, and it was all standing\nstill a few weeks, waiting coming destruction.\n\nThe swamp was palpitant with life. Every pair of birds that had flocked\nto it in the spring was now multiplied by from two to ten. The young\nwere tame from Freckles' tri-parenthood, and so plump and sleek that\nthey were quite as beautiful as their elders, even if in many cases\nthey lacked their brilliant plumage. It was the same story of increase\neverywhere. There were chubby little ground-hogs scudding on the trail.\nThere were cunning baby coons and opossums peeping from hollow logs and\ntrees. Young muskrats followed their parents across the lagoons.\n\nIf you could come upon a family of foxes that had not yet disbanded, and\nsee the young playing with a wild duck's carcass that their mother had\nbrought, and note the pride and satisfaction in her eyes as she lay\nat one side guarding them, it would be a picture not to be forgotten.\nFreckles never tired of studying the devotion of a fox mother to her\nbabies. To him, whose early life had been so embittered by continual\nproof of neglect and cruelty in human parents toward their children, the\nlove of these furred and feathered folk of the Limberlost was even more\nof a miracle than to the Bird Woman and the Angel.\n\nThe Angel liked the baby rabbits and squirrels. Earlier in the season,\nwhen the young were yet very small, it so happened that at times\nFreckles could give into her hands one of these little ones. Then it was\npure joy to stand back and watch her heaving breast, flushed cheek, and\nshining eyes. Hers were such lovely eyes. Freckles had discovered lately\nthat they were not so dark as he had thought them at first, but that\nthe length and thickness of lash, by which they were shaded, made them\nappear darker than they really were. They were forever changing. Now\nsparkling and darkling with wit, now humid with sympathy, now burning\nwith the fire of courage, now taking on strength of color with ambition,\nnow flashing indignantly at the abuse of any creature.\n\nShe had carried several of the squirrel and bunny babies home, and had\nlittered the conservatory with them. Her care of them was perfect. She\nwas learning her natural history from nature, and having much healthful\nexercise. To her, they were the most interesting of all, but the\nBird Woman preferred the birds, with a close second in the moths and\nbutterflies.\n\nBrown butterfly time had come. The edge of the swale was filled with\nmilkweed, and other plants beloved of them, and the air was golden with\nthe flashing satin wings of the monarch, viceroy, and argynnis. They\noutnumbered those of any other color three to one.\n\nAmong the birds it really seemed as if the little yellow fellows were\nin the preponderance. At least, they were until the redwinged blackbirds\nand bobolinks, that had nested on the upland, suddenly saw in the\nswamp the garden of the Lord and came swarming by hundreds to feast and\nadventure upon it these last few weeks before migration. Never was there\na finer feast spread for the birds. The grasses were filled with seeds:\nso, too, were weeds of every variety. Fall berries were ripe. Wild\ngrapes and black haws were ready. Bugs were creeping everywhere. The\nmuck was yeasty with worms. Insects filled the air. Nature made glorious\npause for holiday before her next change, and by none of the frequenters\nof the swamp was this more appreciated than by the big black chickens.\n\nThey seemed to feel the new reign of peace and fullness most of all. As\nfor food, they did not even have to hunt for themselves these days,\nfor the feasts now being spread before Little Chicken were more than he\ncould use, and he was glad to have his parents come down and help him.\n\nHe was a fine, big, overgrown fellow, and his wings, with quills of\njetty black, gleaming with bronze, were so strong they almost lifted his\nbody. He had three inches of tail, and his beak and claws were sharp.\nHis muscles began to clamor for exercise. He raced the forty feet of his\nhome back and forth many times every hour of the day. After a few days\nof that, he began lifting and spreading his wings, and flopping them\nuntil the down on his back was filled with elm fiber. Then he commenced\njumping. The funny little hops, springs, and sidewise bounds he gave\nset Freckles and the Angel, hidden in the swamp, watching him, into\nsmothered chuckles of delight.\n\nSometimes he fell to coquetting with himself; and that was the funniest\nthing of all, for he turned his head up, down, from side to side, and\ndrew in his chin with prinky little jerks and tilts. He would stretch\nhis neck, throw up his head, turn it to one side and smirk--actually\nsmirk, the most complacent and self-satisfied smirk that anyone ever\nsaw on the face of a bird. It was so comical that Freckles and the Angel\ntold the Bird Woman of it one day.\n\nWhen she finished her work on Little Chicken, she left them the camera\nready for use, telling them they might hide in the bushes and watch. If\nLittle Chicken came out and truly smirked, and they could squeeze the\nbulb at the proper moment to snap him, she would be more than delighted.\n\nFreckles and the Angel quietly curled beside a big log, and with eager\neyes and softest breathing they patiently waited; but Little Chicken had\nfeasted before they told of his latest accomplishment. He was tired\nand sleepy, so he went into the log to bed, and for an hour he never\nstirred.\n\nThey were becoming anxious, for the light soon would be gone, and they\nhad so wanted to try for the picture. At last Little Chicken lifted his\nhead, opened his beak, and gaped widely. He dozed a minute or two more.\nThe Angel said that was his beauty sleep. Then he lazily gaped again\nand stood up, stretching and yawning. He ambled leisurely toward the\ngateway, and the Angel said: “Now, we may have a chance, at last.”\n\n“I do hope so,” shivered Freckles.\n\nWith one accord they arose to their knees and trained their eyes on\nthe mouth of the log. The light was full and strong. Little Chicken\nprospected again with no results. He dressed his plumage, polished his\nbeak, and when he felt fine and in full toilet he began to flirt with\nhimself. Freckles' eyes snapped and his breath sucked between his\nclenched teeth.\n\n“He's going to do it!” whispered the Angel. “That will come next. You'll\nbest give me that bulb!”\n\n“Yis,” assented Freckles, but he was looking at the log and he made no\nmove to relinquish the bulb.\n\nLittle Chicken nodded daintily and ruffled his feathers. He gave his\nhead sundry little sidewise jerks and rapidly shifted his point of\nvision. Once there was the fleeting little ghost of a smirk.\n\n“Now!--No!” snapped the Angel.\n\nFreckles leaned toward the bird. Tensely he waited. Unconsciously the\nhand of the Angel clasped his. He scarcely knew it was there. Suddenly\nLittle Chicken sprang straight in the air and landed with a thud. The\nAngel started slightly, but Freckles was immovable. Then, as if in\napproval of his last performance, the big, overgrown baby wheeled until\nhe was more than three-quarters, almost full side, toward the camera,\nstraightened on his legs, squared his shoulders, stretched his neck full\nheight, drew in his chin and smirked his most pronounced smirk, directly\nin the face of the lens.\n\nFreckles' fingers closed on the bulb convulsively, and the Angel's\nclosed on his at the instant. Then she heaved a great sigh of relief and\nlifted her hands to push back the damp, clustering hair from her face.\n\n“How soon do you s'pose it will be finished?” came Freckles' strident\nwhisper.\n\nFor the first time the Angel looked at him. He was on his knees, leaning\nforward, his eyes directed toward the bird, the perspiration running in\nlittle streams down his red, mosquito-bitten face. His hat was awry, his\nbright hair rampant, his breast heaving with excitement, while he yet\ngripped the bulb with every ounce of strength in his body.\n\n“Do you think we were for getting it?” he asked.\n\nThe Angel could only nod. Freckles heaved a deep sigh of relief.\n\n“Well, if that ain't the hardest work I ever did in me life!” he\nexclaimed. “It's no wonder the Bird Woman's for coming out of the swamp\nlooking as if she's been through a fire, a flood, and a famine, if\nthat's what she goes through day after day. But if you think we got it,\nwhy, it's worth all it took, and I'm glad as ever you are, sure!”\n\nThey put the holders in the case, carefully closed the camera, set it in\nalso, and carried it to the road.\n\nThen Freckles exulted.\n\n“Now, let's be telling the Bird Woman about it!” he shouted, wildly\ndancing and swinging his hat.\n\n“We got it! We got it! I bet a farm we got it!”\n\nHand in hand they ran to the north end of the swamp, yelling “We got\nit!” like young Comanches, and never gave a thought to what they might\ndo until a big blue-gray bird, with long neck and trailing legs, arose\non flapping wings and sailed over the Limberlost.\n\nThe Angel became white to the lips and gripped Freckles with both hands.\nHe gulped with mortification and turned his back.\n\nTo frighten her subject away carelessly! It was the head crime in the\nBird Woman's category. She extended her hands as she arose, baked,\nblistered, and dripping, and exclaimed: “Bless you, my children! Bless\nyou!” And it truly sounded as if she meant it.\n\n“Why, why----” stammered the bewildered Angel.\n\nFreckles hurried into the breach.\n\n“You must be for blaming it every bit on me. I was thinking we got\nLittle Chicken's picture real good. I was so drunk with the joy of it I\nlost all me senses and, 'Let's run tell the Bird Woman,' says I. Like a\nfool I was for running, and I sort of dragged the Angel along.”\n\n“Oh Freckles!” expostulated the Angel. “Are you loony? Of course, it\nwas all my fault! I've been with her hundreds of times. I knew perfectly\nwell that I wasn't to let anything--NOT ANYTHING--scare her bird away!\nI was so crazy I forgot. The blame is all mine, and she'll never forgive\nme.”\n\n“She will, too!” cried Freckles. “Wasn't you for telling me that very\nfirst day that when people scared her birds away she just killed them!\nIt's all me foolishness, and I'll never forgive meself!”\n\nThe Bird Woman plunged into the swale at the mouth of Sleepy Snake\nCreek, and came wading toward them, with a couple of cameras and\ndripping tripods.\n\n“If you will permit me a word, my infants,” she said, “I will explain to\nyou that I have had three shots at that fellow.”\n\nThe Angel heaved a deep sigh of relief, and Freckles' face cleared a\nlittle.\n\n“Two of them,” continued the Bird Woman, “in the rushes--one facing,\ncrest lowered; one light on back, crest flared; and the last on wing,\nwhen you came up. I simply had been praying for something to make him\narise from that side, so that he would fly toward the camera, for he had\nwaded around until in my position I couldn't do it myself. See? Behold\nin yourselves the answer to the prayers of the long-suffering!”\n\nFreckles took a step toward her.\n\n“Are you really meaning that?” he asked wonderingly. “Only think,\nAngel, we did the right thing! She won't lose her picture through the\ncarelessness of us, when she's waited and soaked nearly two hours. She's\nnot angry with us!”\n\n“Never was in a sweeter temper in my life,” said the Bird Woman, busily\ncleaning and packing the cameras.\n\nFreckles removed his hat and solemnly held out his hand. With equal\nsolemnity the Angel grasped it. The Bird Woman laughed alone, for to\nthem the situation had been too serious to develop any of the elements\nof fun.\n\nThen they loaded the carriage, and the Bird Woman and the Angel started\nfor their homes. It had been a difficult time for all of them, so they\nwere very tired, but they were joyful. Freckles was so happy it seemed\nto him that life could hold little more. As the Bird Woman was ready to\ndrive away he laid his hand on the lines and looked into her face.\n\n“Do you suppose we got it?” he asked, so eagerly that she would have\ngiven much to be able to say yes with conviction.\n\n“Why, my dear, I don't know,” she said. “I've no way to judge. If you\nmade the exposure just before you came to me, there was yet a fine\nlight. If you waited until Little Chicken was close the entrance, you\nshould have something good, even if you didn't catch just the fleeting\nexpression for which you hoped. Of course, I can't say surely, but I\nthink there is every reason to believe that you have it all right. I\nwill develop the plate tonight, make you a proof from it early in the\nmorning, and bring it when we come. It's only a question of a day or\ntwo now until the gang arrives. I want to work in all the studies I can\nbefore that time, for they are bound to disturb the birds. Mr. McLean\nwill need you then, and I scarcely see how we are to do without you.”\n\nMoved by an impulse she never afterward regretted, she bent and laid her\nlips on Freckles' forehead, kissing him gently and thanking him for his\nmany kindnesses to her in her loved work. Freckles started away so happy\nthat he felt inclined to keep watching behind to see if the trail were\nnot curling up and rolling down the line after him.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XVI\n\nWherein the Angel Locates a Rare Tree and Dines with the Gang\n\nFrom afar Freckles saw them coming. The Angel was standing, waving her\nhat. He sprang on his wheel and raced, jolting and pounding, down the\ncorduroy to meet them. The Bird Woman stopped the horse and the Angel\ngave him the bit of print paper. Freckles leaned the wheel against a\ntree and took the proof with eager fingers. He never before had seen\na study from any of his chickens. He stood staring. When he turned his\nface toward them it was transfigured with delight.\n\n“You see!” he exclaimed, and began gazing again. “Oh, me Little\nChicken!” he cried. “Oh me ilegant Little Chicken! I'd be giving all me\nmoney in the bank for you!”\n\nThen he thought of the Angel's muff and Mrs. Duncan's hat, and added,\n“or at least, all but what I'm needing bad for something else. Would you\nmind stopping at the cabin a minute and showing this to Mother Duncan?”\n he asked.\n\n“Give me that little book in your pocket,” said the Bird Woman.\n\nShe folded the outer edges of the proof so that it would fit into the\nbook, explaining as she did so its perishable nature in that state.\nFreckles went hurrying ahead, and they arrived in time to see Mrs.\nDuncan gazing as if awestruck, and to hear her bewildered “Weel I be\ndrawed on!”\n\nFreckles and the Angel helped the Bird Woman to establish herself for a\nlong day at the mouth of Sleepy Snake Creek. Then she sent them away and\nwaited what luck would bring to her.\n\n“Now, what shall we do?” inquired the Angel, who was a bundle of nerves\nand energy.\n\n“Would you like to go to me room awhile?” asked Freckles.\n\n“If you don't care to very much, I'd rather not,” said the Angel. “I'll\ntell you. Let's go help Mrs. Duncan with dinner and play with the baby.\nI love a nice, clean baby.”\n\nThey started toward the cabin. Every few minutes they stopped to\ninvestigate something or to chatter over some natural history wonder.\nThe Angel had quick eyes; she seemed to see everything, but Freckles'\nwere even quicker; for life itself had depended on their sharpness ever\nsince the beginning of his work at the swamp. They saw it at the same\ntime.\n\n“Someone has been making a flagpole,” said the Angel, running the toe of\nher shoe around the stump, evidently made that season. “Freckles, what\nwould anyone cut a tree as small as that for?”\n\n“I don't know,” said Freckles.\n\n“Well, but I want to know!” said the Angel. “No one came away here and\ncut it for fun. They've taken it away. Let's go back and see if we can\nsee it anywhere around there.”\n\nShe turned, retraced her footsteps, and began eagerly searching.\nFreckles did the same.\n\n“There it is!” he exclaimed at last, “leaning against the trunk of that\nbig maple.”\n\n“Yes, and leaning there has killed a patch of dried bark,” said the\nAngel. “See how dried it appears?”\n\nFreckles stared at her.\n\n“Angel!” he shouted, “I bet you it's a marked tree!”\n\n“Course it is!” cried the Angel. “No one would cut that sapling and\ncarry it away there and lean it up for nothing. I'll tell you! This is\none of Jack's marked trees. He's climbed up there above anyone's head,\npeeled the bark, and cut into the grain enough to be sure. Then he's\nlaid the bark back and fastened it with that pole to mark it. You see,\nthere're a lot of other big maples close around it. Can you climb to\nthat place?”\n\n“Yes,” said Freckles; “if I take off my wading-boots I can.”\n\n“Then take them off,” said the Angel, “and do hurry! Can't you see that\nI am almost crazy to know if this tree is a marked one?”\n\nWhen they pushed the sapling over, a piece of bark as big as the crown\nof Freckles' hat fell away.\n\n“I believe it looks kind of nubby,” encouraged the Angel, backing away,\nwith her face all screwed into a twist in an effort to intensify her\nvision.\n\nFreckles reached the opening, then slid rapidly to the ground. He was\nalmost breathless while his eyes were flashing.\n\n“The bark's been cut clean with a knife, the sap scraped away, and a big\nchip taken out deep. The trunk is the twistiest thing you ever saw. It's\nfull of eyes as a bird is of feathers!”\n\nThe Angel was dancing and shaking his hand.\n\n“Oh, Freckles,” she cried, “I'm so delighted that you found it!”\n\n“But I didn't,” said the astonished Freckles. “That tree isn't my find;\nit's yours. I forgot it and was going on; you wouldn't give up, and kept\ntalking about it, and turned back. You found it!”\n\n“You'd best be looking after your reputation for truth and veracity,”\n said the Angel. “You know you saw that sapling first!”\n\n“Yes, after you took me back and set me looking for it,” scoffed\nFreckles.\n\nThe clear, ringing echo of strongly swung axes came crashing through the\nLimberlost.\n\n“'Tis the gang!” shouted Freckles. “They're clearing a place to make the\ncamp. Let's go help!”\n\n“Hadn't we better mark that tree again?” cautioned the Angel. “It's away\nin here. There's such a lot of them, and all so much alike. We'd feel\ngood and green to find it and then lose it.”\n\nFreckles lifted the sapling to replace it, but the Angel motioned him\naway.\n\n“Use your hatchet,” she said. “I predict this is the most valuable tree\nin the swamp. You found it. I'm going to play that you're my knight.\nNow, you nail my colors on it.”\n\nShe reached up, and pulling a blue bow from her hair, untied and doubled\nit against the tree. Freckles turned his eyes from her and managed the\nfastening with shaking fingers. The Angel had called him her knight!\nDear Lord, how he loved her! She must not see his face, or surely her\nquick eyes would read what he was fighting to hide. He did not dare lay\nhis lips on that ribbon then, but that night he would return to it. When\nthey had gone a little distance, they both looked back, and the morning\nbreeze set the bit of blue waving them a farewell.\n\nThey walked at a rapid pace.\n\n“I am sorry about scaring the birds,” said the Angel, “but it's almost\ntime for them to go anyway. I feel dreadfully over having the swamp\nruined, but isn't it a delight to hear the good, honest ring of those\naxes, instead of straining your ears for stealthy sounds? Isn't it\nfine to go openly and freely, with nothing worse than a snake or a\npoison-vine to fear?”\n\n“Ah!” said Freckles, with a long breath, “it's better than you can\ndream, Angel. Nobody will ever be guessing some of the things I've been\nthrough trying to keep me promise to the Boss, and to hold out until\nthis day. That it's come with only one fresh stump, and the log from\nthat saved, and this new tree to report, isn't it grand? Maybe Mr.\nMcLean will be forgetting that stump when he sees this tree, Angel!”\n\n“He can't forget it,” said the Angel; and in answer to Freckles'\nstartled eyes she added, “because he never had any reason to remember\nit. He couldn't have done a whit better himself. My father says so.\nYou're all right, Freckles!”\n\nShe reached him her hand, and as two children, they broke into a run\nwhen they came closer the gang. They left the swamp by the west road\nand followed the trail until they found the men. To the Angel it seemed\ncomplete charm. In the shadiest spot on the west side of the line, at\nthe edge of the swamp and very close Freckles' room, they were\ncutting bushes and clearing space for a big tent for the men's\nsleeping-quarters, another for a dining-hall, and a board shack for the\ncook. The teamsters were unloading, the horses were cropping leaves from\nthe bushes, while each man was doing his part toward the construction of\nthe new Limberlost quarters.\n\nFreckles helped the Angel climb on a wagonload of canvas in the shade.\nShe removed her leggings, wiped her heated face, and glowed with\nhappiness and interest.\n\nThe gang had been sifted carefully. McLean now felt that there was not a\nman in it who was not trustworthy.\n\nThey all had heard of the Angel's plucky ride for Freckles' relief;\nseveral of them had been in the rescue party. Others, new since that\ntime, had heard the tale rehearsed in its every aspect around the\nsmudge-fires at night. Almost all of them knew the Angel by sight from\nher trips with the Bird Woman to their leases. They all knew her father,\nher position, and the luxuries of her home. Whatever course she had\nchosen with them they scarcely would have resented it, but the Angel\nnever had been known to choose a course. Her spirit of friendliness was\ninborn and inbred. She loved everyone, so she sympathized with everyone.\nHer generosity was only limited by what was in her power to give.\n\nShe came down the trail, hand in hand with the red-haired, freckled\ntimber guard whom she had worn herself past the limit of endurance to\nsave only a few weeks before, racing in her eagerness to reach them,\nand laughing her “Good morning, gentlemen,” right and left. When she was\nensconced on the wagonload of tenting, she sat on a roll of canvas as a\nqueen on her throne. There was not a man of the gang who did not respect\nher. She was a living exponent of universal brotherhood. There was no\nman among them who needed her exquisite face or dainty clothing to teach\nhim that the deference due a gentlewoman should be paid her. That the\nspirit of good fellowship she radiated levied an especial tribute of its\nown, and it became their delight to honor and please her.\n\nAs they raced toward the wagon--“Let me tell about the tree, please?”\n she begged Freckles.\n\n“Why, sure!” said Freckles.\n\nHe probably would have said the same to anything she suggested. When\nMcLean came, he found the Angel flushed and glowing, sitting on the\nwagon, her hands already filled. One of the men, who was cutting a\nscrub-oak, had carried to her a handful of crimson leaves. Another had\ngathered a bunch of delicate marsh-grass heads for her. Someone else,\nin taking out a bush, had found a daintily built and lined little nest,\nfresh as when made.\n\nShe held up her treasures and greeted McLean, “Good morning, Mr. Boss of\nthe Limberlost!”\n\nThe gang shouted, while he bowed profoundly before her.\n\n“Everyone listen!” cried the Angel, climbing a roll of canvas. “I have\nsomething to say! Freckles has been guarding here over a year now, and\nhe presents the Limberlost to you, with every tree in it saved; for good\nmeasure he has this morning located the rarest one of them all: the one\nin from the east line, that Wessner spoke of the first day--nearest the\none you took out. All together! Everyone! Hurrah for Freckles!”\n\nWith flushing cheeks and gleaming eyes, gaily waving the grass above\nher head, she led in three cheers and a tiger. Freckles slipped into the\nswamp and hid himself, for fear he could not conceal his pride and his\ngreat surging, throbbing love for her.\n\nThe Angel subsided on the canvas and explained to McLean about the\nmaple. The Boss was mightily pleased. He took Freckles and set out to\nre-locate and examine the tree. The Angel was interested in the making\nof the camp, so she preferred to remain with the men. With her sharp\neyes she was watching every detail of construction; but when it came to\nthe stretching of the dining-hall canvas she proceeded to take command.\nThe men were driving the rope-pins, when the Angel arose on the wagon\nand, leaning forward, spoke to Duncan, who was directing the work.\n\n“I believe if you will swing that around a few feet farther, you will\nfind it better, Mr. Duncan,” she said. “That way will let the hot sun in\nat noon, while the sides will cut off the best breeze.”\n\n“That's a fact,” said Duncan, studying the conditions.\n\nSo, by shifting the pins a little, they obtained comfort for which they\nblessed the Angel every day. When they came to the sleeping-tent, they\nconsulted her about that. She explained the general direction of the\nnight breeze and indicated the best position for the tent. Before anyone\nknew how it happened, the Angel was standing on the wagon, directing\nthe location and construction of the cooking-shack, the erection of the\ncrane for the big boiling-pots, and the building of the store-room. She\nsuperintended the laying of the floor of the sleeping-tent lengthwise,\nSo that it would be easier to sweep, and suggested a new arrangement of\nthe cots that would afford all the men an equal share of night breeze.\nShe left the wagon, and climbing on the newly erected dining-table,\nadvised with the cook in placing his stove, table, and kitchen utensils.\n\nWhen Freckles returned from the tree to join in the work around the\ncamp, he caught glimpses of her enthroned on a soapbox, cleaning beans.\nShe called to him that they were invited for dinner, and that they had\naccepted the invitation.\n\nWhen the beans were steaming in the pot, the Angel advised the cook to\nsoak them overnight the next time, so that they would cook more quickly\nand not burst. She was sure their cook at home did that way, and the\nCHEF of the gang thought it would be a good idea. The next Freckles saw\nof her she was paring potatoes. A little later she arranged the table.\n\nShe swept it with a broom, instead of laying a cloth; took the hatchet\nand hammered the deepest dents from the tin plates, and nearly skinned\nher fingers scouring the tinware with rushes. She set the plates an even\ndistance apart, and laid the forks and spoons beside them. When the cook\nthrew away half a dozen fruit-cans, she gathered them up and melted off\nthe tops, although she almost blistered her face and quite blistered her\nfingers doing it. Then she neatly covered these improvised vases with\nthe Manila paper from the groceries, tying it with wisps of marshgrass.\nThese she filled with fringed gentians, blazing-star, asters, goldenrod,\nand ferns, placing them the length of the dining-table. In one of the\nend cans she arranged her red leaves, and in the other the fancy grass.\nTwo men, watching her, went away proud of themselves and said that she\nwas “a born lady.” She laughingly caught up a paper bag and fitted it\njauntily to her head in imitation of a cook's cap. Then she ground the\ncoffee, and beat a couple of eggs to put in, “because there is company,”\n she gravely explained to the cook. She asked that delighted individual\nif he did not like it best that way, and he said he did not know,\nbecause he never had a chance to taste it. The Angel said that was\nher case exactly--she never had, either; she was not allowed anything\nstronger than milk. Then they laughed together.\n\nShe told the cook about camping with her father, and explained that\nhe made his coffee that way. When the steam began to rise from the big\nboiler, she stuffed the spout tightly with clean marshgrass, to keep the\naroma in, placed the boiler where it would only simmer, and explained\nwhy. The influence of the Angel's visit lingered with the cook through\nthe remainder of his life, while the men prayed for her frequent return.\n\nShe was having a happy time, when McLean came back jubilant, from his\ntrip to the tree. How jubilant he told only the Angel, for he had been\nobliged to lose faith in some trusted men of late, and had learned\ndiscretion by what he suffered. He planned to begin clearing out a road\nto the tree that same afternoon, and to set two guards every night, for\nit promised to be a rare treasure, so he was eager to see it on the way\nto the mills.\n\n“I am coming to see it felled,” cried the Angel. “I feel a sort of\nmotherly interest in that tree.”\n\nMcLean was highly amused. He would have staked his life on the honesty\nof either the Angel or Freckles; yet their versions of the finding of\nthe tree differed widely.\n\n“Tell me, Angel,” the Boss said jestingly. “I think I have a right to\nknow. Who really did locate that tree?”\n\n“Freckles,” she answered promptly and emphatically.\n\n“But he says quite as positively that it was you. I don't understand.”\n\nThe Angel's legal look flashed into her face. Her eyes grew tense with\nearnestness. She glanced around, and seeing no towel or basin, held out\nher hand for Sears to pour water over them. Then, using the skirt of her\ndress to dry them, she climbed on the wagon.\n\n“I'll tell you, word for word, how it happened,” she said, “and then you\nshall decide, and Freckles and I will agree with you.”\n\nWhen she had finished her version, “Tell us, 'oh, most learned judge!'”\n she laughingly quoted, “which of us located that tree?”\n\n“Blest if I know who located it!” exclaimed McLean. “But I have a fairly\naccurate idea as to who put the blue ribbon on it.”\n\nThe Boss smiled significantly at Freckles, who just had come, for they\nhad planned that they would instruct the company to reserve enough of\nthe veneer from that very tree to make the most beautiful dressing table\nthey could design for the Angel's share of the discovery.\n\n“What will you have for yours?” McLean had asked of Freckles.\n\n“If it's all the same to you, I'll be taking mine out in music\nlessons--begging your pardon--voice culture,” said Freckles with a\ngrimace.\n\nMcLean laughed, for Freckles needed to see or hear only once to absorb\nlearning as the thirsty earth sucks up water.\n\nThe Angel placed McLean at the head of the table. She took the foot,\nwith Freckles on her right, while the lumber gang, washed, brushed, and\nstraightened until they felt unfamiliar with themselves and each other,\nfilled the sides. That imposed a slight constraint. Then, too, the men\nwere afraid of the flowers, the polished tableware, and above all, of\nthe dainty grace of the Angel. Nowhere do men so display lack of good\nbreeding and culture as in dining. To sprawl on the table, scoop\nwith their knives, chew loudly, gulp coffee, and duck their heads as\nsnapping-turtles for every bite, had not been noticed by them until the\nAngel, sitting straightly, suddenly made them remember that they,\ntoo, were possessed of spines. Instinctively every man at the table\nstraightened.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XVII\n\nWherein Freckles Offers His Life for His Love and Gets a Broken Body\n\nTo reach the tree was a more difficult task than McLean had supposed.\nThe gang could approach nearest on the outside toward the east, but\nafter they reached the end of the east entrance there was yet a mile\nof most impenetrable thicket, trees big and little, and bushes of every\nvariety and stage of growth. In many places the muck had to be filled to\ngive the horses and wagons a solid foundation over which to haul heavy\nloads. It was several days before they completed a road to the noble,\nbig tree and were ready to fell it.\n\nWhen the sawing began, Freckles was watching down the road where it met\nthe trail leading from Little Chicken's tree. He had gone to the tree\nahead of the gang to remove the blue ribbon. Carefully folded, it now\nlay over his heart. He was promising himself much comfort with that\nribbon, when he would leave for the city next month to begin his studies\nand dream the summer over again. It would help to make things tangible.\nWhen he was dressed as other men, and at his work, he knew where he\nmeant to home that precious bit of blue. It should be his good-luck\ntoken, and he would wear it always to keep bright in memory the day on\nwhich the Angel had called him her knight.\n\nHow he would study, and oh, how he would sing! If only he could fulfill\nMcLean's expectations, and make the Angel proud of him! If only he could\nbe a real knight!\n\nHe could not understand why the Angel had failed to come. She had wanted\nto see their tree felled. She would be too late if she did not arrive\nsoon. He had told her it would be ready that morning, and she had said\nshe surely would be there. Why, of all mornings, was she late on this?\n\nMcLean had ridden to town. If he had been there, Freckles would have\nasked that they delay the felling, but he scarcely liked to ask the\ngang. He really had no authority, although he thought the men would\nwait; but some way he found such embarrassment in framing the request\nthat he waited until the work was practically ended. The saw was out,\nand the men were cutting into the felling side of the tree when the Boss\nrode in.\n\nHis first word was to inquire for the Angel. When Freckles said she\nhad not yet come, the Boss at once gave orders to stop work on the tree\nuntil she arrived; for he felt that she virtually had located it, and\nif she desired to see it felled, she should. As the men stepped back,\na stiff morning breeze caught the top, that towered high above its\nfellows. There was an ominous grinding at the base, a shiver of the\nmighty trunk, then directly in line of its fall the bushes swung apart\nand the laughing face of the Angel looked on them.\n\nA groan of horror burst from the dry throats of the men, and reading the\nagony in their faces, she stopped short, glanced up, and understood.\n\n“South!” shouted McLean. “Run south!”\n\nThe Angel was helpless. It was apparent that she did not know which way\nsouth was. There was another slow shiver of the big tree. The remainder\nof the gang stood motionless, but Freckles sprang past the trunk and\nwent leaping in big bounds. He caught up the Angel and dashed through\nthe thicket for safety. The swaying trunk was half over when, for an\ninstant, a near-by tree stayed its fall. They saw Freckles' foot catch,\nand with the Angel he plunged headlong.\n\nA terrible cry broke from the men, while McLean covered his face.\nInstantly Freckles was up, with the Angel in his arms, struggling on.\nThe outer limbs were on them when they saw Freckles hurl the Angel,\nface down, in the muck, as far from him as he could send her. Springing\nafter, in an attempt to cover her body with his own, he whirled to see\nif they were yet in danger, and with outstretched arms braced himself\nfor the shock. The branches shut them from sight, and the awful crash\nrocked the earth.\n\nMcLean and Duncan ran with axes and saws. The remainder of the gang\nfollowed, and they worked desperately. It seemed a long time before they\ncaught a glimpse of the Angel's blue dress, but it renewed their vigor.\nDuncan fell on his knees beside her and tore the muck from underneath\nher with his hands. In a few seconds he dragged her out, choking and\nstunned, but surely not fatally hurt.\n\nFreckles lay a little farther under the tree, a big limb pinning him\ndown. His eyes were wide open. He was perfectly conscious. Duncan began\nmining beneath him, but Freckles stopped him.\n\n“You can't be moving me,” he said. “You must cut off the limb and lift\nit. I know.”\n\nTwo men ran for the big saw. A number of them laid hold of the limb and\nbore up. In a short time it was removed, and Freckles lay free.\n\nThe men bent over to lift him, but he motioned them away.\n\n“Don't be touching me until I rest a bit,” he pleaded.\n\nThen he twisted his head until he saw the Angel, who was wiping muck\nfrom her eyes and face on the skirt of her dress.\n\n“Try to get up,” he begged.\n\nMcLean laid hold of the Angel and helped her to her feet.\n\n“Do you think any bones are broken?” gasped Freckles.\n\nThe Angel shook her head and wiped muck.\n\n“You see if you can find any, sir,” Freckles commanded.\n\nThe Angel yielded herself to McLean's touch, and he assured Freckles\nthat she was not seriously injured.\n\nFreckles settled back, a smile of ineffable tenderness on his face.\n\n“Thank the Lord!” he hoarsely whispered.\n\nThe Angel leaned toward him.\n\n“Now, Freckles, you!” she cried. “It's your turn. Please get up!”\n\nA pitiful spasm swept Freckles' face. The sight of it washed every\nvestige of color from the Angel's. She took hold of his hands.\n\n“Freckles, get up!” It was half command, half entreaty.\n\n“Easy, Angel, easy! Let me rest a bit first!” implored Freckles.\n\nShe knelt beside him. He reached his arm around her and drew her\nclosely. He looked at McLean in an agony of entreaty that brought the\nBoss to his knees on the other side.\n\n“Oh, Freckles!” McLean cried. “Not that! Surely we can do something! We\nmust! Let me see!”\n\nHe tried to unfasten Freckles' neckband, but his fingers shook so\nclumsily that the Angel pushed them away and herself laid Freckles'\nchest bare. With one hasty glance she gathered the clothing together\nand slipped her arm under his head. Freckles lifted his eyes of agony to\nhers.\n\n“You see?” he said.\n\nThe Angel nodded dumbly.\n\nFreckles turned to McLean.\n\n“Thank you for everything,” he panted. “Where are the boys?”\n\n“They are all here,” said the Boss, “except a couple who have gone for\ndoctors, Mrs. Duncan and the Bird Woman.”\n\n“It's no use trying to do anything,” said Freckles. “You won't forget\nthe muff and the Christmas box. The muff especial?”\n\nThere was a movement above them so pronounced that it attracted\nFreckles' attention, even in that extreme hour. He looked up, and a\npleased smile flickered on his drawn face.\n\n“Why, if it ain't me Little Chicken!” he cried hoarsely. “He must be\nmaking his very first trip from the log. Now Duncan can have his big\nwatering-trough.”\n\n“It was Little Chicken that made me late,” faltered the Angel. “I was\nso anxious to get here early I forgot to bring his breakfast from the\ncarriage. He must have been hungry, for when I passed the log he started\nafter me. He was so wabbly, and so slow flying from tree to tree and\nthrough the bushes, I just had to wait on him, for I couldn't drive him\nback.”\n\n“Of course you couldn't! Me bird has too amazing good sinse to go back\nwhen he could be following you,” exulted Freckles, exactly as if he did\nnot realize what the delay had cost him. Then he lay silently thinking,\nbut presently he asked slowly: “And so 'twas me Little Chicken that was\nmaking you late, Angel?”\n\n“Yes,” said the Angel.\n\nA spasm of fierce pain shook Freckles, and a look of uncertainty crossed\nhis face.\n\n“All summer I've been thanking God for the falling of the feather and\nall the delights it's brought me,” he muttered, “but this looks as\nif----”\n\nHe stopped short and raised questioning eyes to McLean.\n\n“I can't help being Irish, but I can help being superstitious,” he said.\n“I mustn't be laying it to the Almighty, or to me bird, must I?”\n\n“No, dear lad,” said McLean, stroking the brilliant hair. “The choice\nlay with you. You could have stood a rooted dolt like all the remainder\nof us. It was through your great love and your high courage that you\nmade the sacrifice.”\n\n“Don't you be so naming it, sir!” cried Freckles. “It's just the\nreverse. If I could be giving me body the hundred times over to save\nhers from this, I'd be doing it and take joy with every pain.”\n\nHe turned with a smile of adoring tenderness to the Angel. She was\nghastly white, and her eyes were dull and glazed. She scarcely seemed to\nhear or understand what was coming, but she bravely tried to answer that\nsmile.\n\n“Is my forehead covered with dirt?” he asked.\n\nShe shook her head.\n\n“You did once,” he gasped.\n\nInstantly she laid her lips on his forehead, then on each cheek, and\nthen in a long kiss on his lips.\n\nMcLean bent over him.\n\n“Freckles,” he said brokenly, “you will never know how I love you. You\nwon't go without saying good-bye to me?”\n\nThat word stung the Angel to quick comprehension. She started as if\narousing from sleep.\n\n“Good-bye?” she cried sharply, her eyes widening and the color rushing\ninto her white face. “Good-bye! Why, what do you mean? Who's saying\ngood-bye? Where could Freckles go, when he is hurt like this, save to\nthe hospital? You needn't say good-bye for that. Of course, we will all\ngo with him! You call up the men. We must start right away.”\n\n“It's no use, Angel,” said Freckles. “I'm thinking ivry bone in me\nbreast is smashed. You'll have to be letting me go!”\n\n“I will not,” said the Angel flatly. “It's no use wasting precious time\ntalking about it. You are alive. You are breathing; and no matter how\nbadly your bones are broken, what are great surgeons for but to fix you\nup and make you well again? You promise me that you'll just grit your\nteeth and hang on when we hurt you, for we must start with you as\nquickly as it can be done. I don't know what has been the matter with\nme. Here's good time wasted already.”\n\n“Oh, Angel!” moaned Freckles, “I can't! You don't know how bad it is.\nI'll die the minute you are for trying to lift me!”\n\n“Of course you will, if you make up your mind to do it,” said the Angel.\n“But if you are determined you won't, and set yourself to breathing deep\nand strong, and hang on to me tight, I can get you out. Really you must,\nFreckles, no matter how it hurts, for you did this for me, and now I\nmust save you, so you might as well promise.”\n\nShe bent over him, trying to smile encouragement with her fear-stiffened\nlips.\n\n“You will promise, Freckles?”\n\nBig drops of cold sweat ran together on Freckles' temples.\n\n“Angel, darlin' Angel,” he pleaded, taking her hand in his. “You ain't\nunderstanding, and I can't for the life of me be telling you, but\nindade, it's best to be letting me go. This is my chance. Please say\ngood-bye, and let me slip off quick!”\n\nHe appealed to McLean.\n\n“Dear Boss, you know! You be telling her that, for me, living is far\nworse pain than dying. Tell her you know death is the best thing that\ncould ever be happening to me!”\n\n“Merciful Heaven!” burst in the Angel. “I can't endure this delay!”\n\nShe caught Freckles' hand to her breast, and bending over him, looked\ndeeply into his stricken eyes.\n\n“'Angel, I give you my word of honor that I will keep right on\nbreathing.' That's what you are going to promise me,” she said. “Do you\nsay it?”\n\nFreckles hesitated.\n\n“Freckles!” imploringly commanded the Angel, “YOU DO SAY IT!”\n\n“Yis,” gasped Freckles.\n\nThe Angel sprang to her feet.\n\n“Then that's all right,” she said, with a tinge of her old-time\nbriskness. “You just keep breathing away like a steam engine, and I will\ndo all the remainder.”\n\nThe eager men gathered around her.\n\n“It's going to be a tough pull to get Freckles out,” she said, “but it's\nour only chance, so listen closely and don't for the lives of you fail\nme in doing quickly what I tell you. There's no time to spend falling\ndown over each other; we must have some system. You four there get on\nthose wagon horses and ride to the sleeping-tent. Get the stoutest cot,\na couple of comforts, and a pillow. Ride back with them some way to\nsave time. If you meet any other men of the gang, send them here to help\ncarry the cot. We won't risk the jolt of driving with him. The others\nclear a path out to the road; and Mr. McLean, you take Nellie and ride\nto town. Tell my father how Freckles is hurt and that he risked it to\nsave me. Tell him I'm going to take Freckles to Chicago on the noon\ntrain, and I want him to hold it if we are a little late. If he can't,\nthen have a special ready at the station and another on the Pittsburgh\nat Fort Wayne, so we can go straight through. You needn't mind leaving\nus. The Bird Woman will be here soon. We will rest awhile.”\n\nShe dropped into the muck beside Freckles and began stroking his hair\nand hand. He lay with his face of agony turned to hers, and fought to\nsmother the groans that would tell her what he was suffering.\n\nWhen they stood ready to lift him, the Angel bent over him in a passion\nof tenderness.\n\n“Dear old Limberlost guard, we're going to lift you now,” she said. “I\nsuspect you will faint from the pain of it, but we will be as easy as\never we can, and don't you dare forget your promise!”\n\nA whimsical half-smile touched Freckles' quivering lips.\n\n“Angel, can a man be remembering a promise when he ain't knowing?” he\nasked.\n\n“You can,” said the Angel stoutly, “because a promise means so much more\nto you than it does to most men.”\n\nA look of strength flashed into Freckles' face at her words.\n\n“I am ready,” he said.\n\nWith the first touch his eyes closed, a mighty groan was wrenched from\nhim, and he lay senseless. The Angel gave Duncan one panic-stricken\nlook. Then she set her lips and gathered her forces again.\n\n“I guess that's a good thing,” she said. “Maybe he won't feel how we are\nhurting him. Oh boys, are you being quick and gentle?”\n\nShe stepped to the side of the cot and bathed Freckles' face. Taking his\nhand in hers, she gave the word to start. She told the men to ask every\nable-bodied man they met to join them so that they could change carriers\noften and make good time.\n\nThe Bird Woman insisted upon taking the Angel into the carriage and\nfollowing the cot, but she refused to leave Freckles, and suggested\nthat the Bird Woman drive ahead, pack them some clothing, and be at the\nstation ready to accompany them to Chicago. All the way the Angel walked\nbeside the cot, shading Freckles' face with a branch, and holding his\nhand. At every pause to change carriers she moistened his face and lips\nand watched each breath with heart-breaking anxiety.\n\nShe scarcely knew when her father joined them, and taking the branch\nfrom her, slipped an arm around her waist and almost carried her. To the\ncity streets and the swarm of curious, staring faces she paid no more\nattention than she had to the trees of the Limberlost. When the train\ncame and the gang placed Freckles aboard, big Duncan made a place for\nthe Angel beside the cot.\n\nWith the best physician to be found, and with the Bird Woman and\nMcLean in attendance, the four-hours' run to Chicago began. The Angel\nconstantly watched over Freckles; bathed his face, stroked his hand,\nand gently fanned him. Not for an instant would she yield her place,\nor allow anyone else to do anything for him. The Bird Woman and McLean\nregarded her in amazement. There seemed to be no end to her resources\nand courage. The only time she spoke was to ask McLean if he were sure\nthe special would be ready on the Pittsburgh road. He replied that it\nwas made up and waiting.\n\nAt five o'clock Freckles lay stretched on the operating-table of Lake\nView Hospital, while three of the greatest surgeons in Chicago bent over\nhim. At their command, McLean picked up the unwilling Angel and carried\nher to the nurses to be bathed, have her bruises attended, and to be put\nto bed.\n\nIn a place where it is difficult to surprise people, they were\nastonished women as they removed the Angel's dainty stained and torn\nclothing, drew off hose muck-baked to her limbs, soaked the dried loam\nfrom her silken hair, and washed the beautiful scratched, bruised,\ndirt-covered body. The Angel fell fast asleep long before they had\nfinished, and lay deeply unconscious, while the fight for Freckles' life\nwas being waged.\n\nThree days later she was the same Angel as of old, except that Freckles\nwas constantly in her thoughts. The anxiety and responsibility that\nshe felt for his condition had bred in her a touch of womanliness and\nauthority that was new. That morning she arose early and hovered near\nFreckles' door. She had been allowed to remain with him constantly, for\nthe nurses and surgeons had learned, with his returning consciousness,\nthat for her alone would the active, highly strung, pain-racked sufferer\nbe quiet and obey orders. When she was dropping from loss of sleep, the\nthreat that she would fall ill had to be used to send her to bed. Then\nby telling Freckles that the Angel was asleep and they would waken her\nthe moment he moved, they were able to control him for a short time.\n\nThe surgeon was with Freckles. The Angel had been told that the word\nhe brought that morning would be final, so she curled in a window seat,\ndropped the curtains behind her, and in dire anxiety, waited the opening\nof the door.\n\nJust as it unclosed, McLean came hurrying down the hall and to the\nsurgeon, but with one glance at his face he stepped back in dismay;\nwhile the Angel, who had arisen, sank to the seat again, too dazed to\ncome forward. The men faced each other. The Angel, with parted lips and\nfrightened eyes, bent forward in tense anxiety.\n\n“I--I thought he was doing nicely?” faltered McLean.\n\n“He bore the operation well,” replied the surgeon, “and his wounds are\nnot necessarily fatal. I told you that yesterday, but I did not tell you\nthat something else probably would kill him; and it will. He need not\ndie from the accident, but he will not live the day out.”\n\n“But why? What is it?” asked McLean hurriedly. “We all dearly love the\nboy. We have millions among us to do anything that money can accomplish.\nWhy must he die, if those broken bones are not the cause?”\n\n“That is what I am going to give you the opportunity to tell me,”\n replied the surgeon. “He need not die from the accident, yet he is\ndying as fast as his splendid physical condition will permit, and it is\nbecause he so evidently prefers death to life. If he were full of hope\nand ambition to live, my work would be easy. If all of you love him as\nyou prove you do, and there is unlimited means to give him anything he\nwants, why should he desire death?”\n\n“Is he dying?” demanded McLean.\n\n“He is,” said the surgeon. “He will not live this day out, unless some\nstrong reaction sets in at once. He is so low, that preferring death to\nlife, nature cannot overcome his inertia. If he is to live, he must be\nmade to desire life. Now he undoubtedly wishes for death, and that it\ncome quickly.”\n\n“Then he must die,” said McLean.\n\nHis broad shoulders shook convulsively. His strong hands opened and\nclosed mechanically.\n\n“Does that mean that you know what he desires and cannot, or will not,\nsupply it?”\n\nMcLean groaned in misery.\n\n“It means,” he said desperately, “that I know what he wants, but it is\nas far removed from my power to help him as it would be to give him a\nstar. The thing for which he will die, he can never have.”\n\n“Then you must prepare for the end very shortly” said the surgeon,\nturning abruptly away.\n\nMcLean caught his arm roughly.\n\n“You look here!” he cried in desperation. “You say that as if I could do\nsomething if I would. I tell you the boy is dear to me past expression.\nI would do anything--spend any sum. You have noticed and repeatedly\ncommented on the young girl with me. It is that child that he wants! He\nworships her to adoration, and knowing he can never be anything to her,\nhe prefers death to life. In God's name, what can I do about it?”\n\n“Barring that missing hand, I never examined a finer man,” said the\nsurgeon, “and she seemed perfectly devoted to him; why cannot he have\nher?”\n\n“Why?” echoed McLean. “Why? Well, for many reasons! I told you he was my\nson. You probably knew that he was not. A little over a year ago I never\nhad seen him. He joined one of my lumber gangs from the road. He is a\nstray, left at one of your homes for the friendless here in Chicago.\nWhen he grew up the superintendent bound him to a brutal man. He ran\naway and landed in one of my lumber camps. He has no name or knowledge\nof legal birth. The Angel--we have talked of her. You see what she is,\nphysically and mentally. She has ancestors reaching back to Plymouth\nRock, and across the sea for generations before that. She is an\nidolized, petted only child, and there is great wealth. Life holds\neverything for her, nothing for him. He sees it more plainly than anyone\nelse could. There is nothing for the boy but death, if it is the Angel\nthat is required to save him.”\n\nThe Angel stood between them.\n\n“Well, I just guess not!” she cried. “If Freckles wants me, all he has\nto do is to say so, and he can have me!”\n\nThe amazed men stepped back, staring at her.\n\n“That he will never say,” said McLean at last, “and you don't\nunderstand, Angel. I don't know how you came here. I wouldn't have had\nyou hear that for the world, but since you have, dear girl, you must be\ntold that it isn't your friendship or your kindness Freckles wants; it\nis your love.”\n\nThe Angel looked straight into the great surgeon's eyes with her clear,\nsteady orbs of blue, and then into McLean's with unwavering frankness.\n\n“Well, I do love him,” she said simply.\n\nMcLean's arms dropped helplessly.\n\n“You don't understand,” he reiterated patiently. “It isn't the love of\na friend, or a comrade, or a sister, that Freckles wants from you; it\nis the love of a sweetheart. And if to save the life he has offered\nfor you, you are thinking of being generous and impulsive enough to\nsacrifice your future--in the absence of your father, it will become\nmy plain duty, as the protector in whose hands he has placed you, to\nprevent such rashness. The very words you speak, and the manner in which\nyou say them, prove that you are a mere child, and have not dreamed what\nlove is.”\n\nThen the Angel grew splendid. A rosy flush swept the pallor of fear\nfrom her face. Her big eyes widened and dilated with intense lights. She\nseemed to leap to the height and the dignity of superb womanhood before\ntheir wondering gaze.\n\n“I never have had to dream of love,” she said proudly. “I never have\nknown anything else, in all my life, but to love everyone and to have\neveryone love me. And there never has been anyone so dear as Freckles.\nIf you will remember, we have been through a good deal together. I do\nlove Freckles, just as I say I do. I don't know anything about the love\nof sweethearts, but I love him with all the love in my heart, and I\nthink that will satisfy him.”\n\n“Surely it should!” muttered the man of knives and lancets.\n\nMcLean reached to take hold of the Angel, but she saw the movement and\nswiftly stepped back.\n\n“As for my father,” she continued, “he at once told me what he learned\nfrom you about Freckles. I've known all you know for several weeks. That\nknowledge didn't change your love for him a particle. I think the Bird\nWoman loved him more. Why should you two have all the fine perceptions\nthere are? Can't I see how brave, trustworthy, and splendid he is? Can't\nI see how his soul vibrates with his music, his love of beautiful things\nand the pangs of loneliness and heart hunger? Must you two love him\nwith all the love there is, and I give him none? My father is never\nunreasonable. He won't expect me not to love Freckles, or not to tell\nhim so, if the telling will save him.”\n\nShe darted past McLean into Freckles' room, closed the door, and turned\nthe key.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XVIII\n\nWherein Freckles refuses Love Without Knowledge of Honorable Birth, and\nthe Angel Goes in Quest of it\n\nFreckles lay on a flat pillow, his body immovable in a plaster cast, his\nmaimed arm, as always, hidden. His greedy gaze fastened at once on the\nAngel's face. She crossed to him with light step and bent over him with\ninfinite tenderness. Her heart ached at the change in his appearance. He\nseemed so weak, heart hungry, so utterly hopeless, so alone. She could\nsee that the night had been one long terror.\n\nFor the first time she tried putting herself in Freckles' place. What\nwould it mean to have no parents, no home, no name? No name! That was\nthe worst of all. That was to be lost--indeed--utterly and hopelessly\nlost. The Angel lifted her hands to her dazed head and reeled, as she\ntried to face that proposition. She dropped on her knees beside the bed,\nslipped her arm under the pillow, and leaning over Freckles, set her\nlips on his forehead. He smiled faintly, but his wistful face appeared\nworse for it. It hurt the Angel to the heart.\n\n“Dear Freckles,” she said, “there is a story in your eyes this morning,\ntell me?”\n\nFreckles drew a long, wavering breath.\n\n“Angel,” he begged, “be generous! Be thinking of me a little. I'm so\nhomesick and worn out, dear Angel, be giving me back me promise. Let me\ngo?”\n\n“Why Freckles!” faltered the Angel. “You don't know what you are asking.\n'Let you go!' I cannot! I love you better than anyone, Freckles. I\nthink you are the very finest person I ever knew. I have our lives all\nplanned. I want you to be educated and learn all there is to know about\nsinging, just as soon as you are well enough. By the time you have\ncompleted your education I will have finished college, and then I want,”\n she choked a second, “I want you to be my real knight, Freckles, and\ncome to me and tell me that you--like me--a little. I have been counting\non you for my sweetheart from the very first, Freckles. I can't give you\nup, unless you don't like me. But you do like me--just a little--don't\nyou, Freckles?”\n\nFreckles lay whiter than the coverlet, his staring eyes on the ceiling\nand his breath wheezing between dry lips. The Angel awaited his answer\na second, and when none came, she dropped her crimsoning face beside him\non the pillow and whispered in his ear:\n\n“Freckles, I--I'm trying to make love to you. Oh, can't you help me only\na little bit? It's awful hard all alone! I don't know how, when I really\nmean it, but Freckles, I love you. I must have you, and now I guess--I\nguess maybe I'd better kiss you next.”\n\nShe lifted her shamed face and bravely laid her feverish, quivering lips\non his. Her breath, like clover-bloom, was in his nostrils, and her hair\ntouched his face. Then she looked into his eyes with reproach.\n\n“Freckles,” she panted, “Freckles! I didn't think it was in you to be\nmean!”\n\n“Mean, Angel! Mean to you?” gasped Freckles.\n\n“Yes,” said the Angel. “Downright mean. When I kiss you, if you had any\nmercy at all you'd kiss back, just a little bit.”\n\nFreckles' sinewy fist knotted into the coverlet. His chin pointed\nceilingward while his head rocked on the pillow.\n\n“Oh, Jesus!” burst from him in agony. “You ain't the only one that was\ncrucified!”\n\nThe Angel caught Freckles' hand and carried it to her breast.\n\n“Freckles!” she wailed in terror, “Freckles! It is a mistake? Is it that\nyou don't want me?”\n\nFreckles' head rolled on in wordless suffering.\n\n“Wait a bit, Angel?” he panted at last. “Be giving me a little time!”\n\nThe Angel arose with controlled features. She bathed his face,\nstraightened his hair, and held water to his lips. It seemed a long time\nbefore he reached toward her. Instantly she knelt again, carried his\nhand to her breast, and leaned her cheek upon it.\n\n“Tell me, Freckles,” she whispered softly.\n\n“If I can,” said Freckles in agony. “It's just this. Angels are\nfrom above. Outcasts are from below. You've a sound body and you're\nbeautifulest of all. You have everything that loving, careful raising\nand money can give you. I have so much less than nothing that I don't\nsuppose I had any right to be born. It's a sure thing--nobody wanted me\nafterward, so of course, they didn't before. Some of them should have\nbeen telling you long ago.”\n\n“If that's all you have to say, Freckles, I've known that quite a\nwhile,” said the Angel stoutly. “Mr. McLean told my father, and he told\nme. That only makes me love you more, to pay for all you've missed.”\n\n“Then I'm wondering at you,” said Freckles in a voice of awe. “Can't you\nsee that if you were willing and your father would come and offer you\nto me, I couldn't be touching the soles of your feet, in love--me, whose\npeople brawled over me, cut off me hand, and throwed me away to freeze\nand to die! Me, who has no name just as much because I've no RIGHT to\nany, as because I don't know it. When I was little, I planned to find me\nfather and mother when I grew up. Now I know me mother deserted me, and\nme father was maybe a thief and surely a liar. The pity for me suffering\nand the watching over me have gone to your head, dear Angel, and it's me\nmust be thinking for you. If you could be forgetting me lost hand, where\nI was raised, and that I had no name to give you, and if you would be\ntaking me as I am, some day people such as mine must be, might come upon\nyou. I used to pray ivery night and morning and many times the day to\nsee me mother. Now I only pray to die quickly and never risk the sight\nof her. 'Tain't no ways possible, Angel! It's a wildness of your dear\nhead. Oh, do for mercy sake, kiss me once more and be letting me go!”\n\n“Not for a minute!” cried the Angel. “Not for a minute, if those are\nall the reasons you have. It's you who are wild in your head, but I can\nunderstand just how it happened. Being shut in that Home most of your\nlife, and seeing children every day whose parents did neglect and desert\nthem, makes you sure yours did the same; and yet there are so many other\nthings that could have happened so much more easily than that. There are\nthousands of young couples who come to this country and start a family\nwith none of their relatives here. Chicago is a big, wicked city, and\ngrown people could disappear in many ways, and who would there ever be\nto find to whom their little children belonged? The minute my father\ntold me how you felt, I began to study this thing over, and I've made up\nmy mind you are dead wrong. I meant to ask my father or the Bird Woman\nto talk to you before you went away to school, but as matters are right\nnow I guess I'll just do it myself. It's all so plain to me. Oh, if I\ncould only make you see!”\n\nShe buried her face in the pillow and presently lifted it, transfigured.\n\n“Now I have it!” she cried. “Oh, dear heart! I can make it so plain!\nFreckles, can you imagine you see the old Limberlost trail? Well when\nwe followed it, you know there were places where ugly, prickly thistles\novergrew the path, and you went ahead with your club and bent them back\nto keep them from stinging through my clothing. Other places there were\nbig shining pools where lovely, snow-white lilies grew, and you waded\nin and gathered them for me. Oh dear heart, don't you see? It's this!\nEverywhere the wind carried that thistledown, other thistles sprang up\nand grew prickles; and wherever those lily seeds sank to the mire, the\npure white of other lilies bloomed. But, Freckles, there was never\na place anywhere in the Limberlost, or in the whole world, where the\nthistledown floated and sprang up and blossomed into white lilies!\nThistles grow from thistles, and lilies from other lilies. Dear\nFreckles, think hard! You must see it! You are a lily, straight through.\nYou never, never could have drifted from the thistle-patch.\n\n“Where did you find the courage to go into the Limberlost and face its\nterrors? You inherited it from the blood of a brave father, dear heart.\nWhere did you get the pluck to hold for over a year a job that few men\nwould have taken at all? You got it from a plucky mother, you bravest\nof boys. You attacked single-handed a man almost twice your size, and\nfought as a demon, merely at the suggestion that you be deceptive and\ndishonest. Could your mother or your father have been untruthful? Here\nyou are, so hungry and starved that you are dying for love. Where\ndid you get all that capacity for loving? You didn't inherit it from\nhardened, heartless people, who would disfigure you and purposely leave\nyou to die, that's one sure thing. You once told me of saving your big\nbullfrog from a rattlesnake. You knew you risked a horrible death when\nyou did it. Yet you will spend miserable years torturing yourself with\nthe idea that your own mother might have cut off that hand. Shame on\nyou, Freckles! Your mother would have done this----”\n\nThe Angel deliberately turned back the cover, slipped up the sleeve, and\nlaid her lips on the scars.\n\n“Freckles! Wake up!” she cried, almost shaking him. “Come to your\nsenses! Be a thinking, reasoning man! You have brooded too much, and\nbeen all your life too much alone. It's all as plain as plain can be to\nme. You must see it! Like breeds like in this world! You must be some\nsort of a reproduction of your parents, and I am not afraid to vouch for\nthem, not for a minute!\n\n“And then, too, if more proof is needed, here it is: Mr. McLean says\nthat you never once have failed in tact and courtesy. He says that you\nare the most perfect gentleman he ever knew, and he has traveled the\nworld over. How does it happen, Freckles? No one at that Home taught\nyou. Hundreds of men couldn't be taught, even in a school of etiquette;\nso it must be instinctive with you. If it is, why, that means that it is\nborn in you, and a direct inheritance from a race of men that have been\ngentlemen for ages, and couldn't be anything else.\n\n“Then there's your singing. I don't believe there ever was a mortal with\na sweeter voice than yours, and while that doesn't prove anything, there\nis a point that does. The little training you had from that choirmaster\nwon't account for the wonderful accent and ease with which you sing.\nSomewhere in your close blood is a marvelously trained vocalist; we\nevery one of us believe that, Freckles.\n\n“Why does my father refer to you constantly as being of fine perceptions\nand honor? Because you are, Freckles. Why does the Bird Woman leave her\nprecious work and come here to help look after you? I never heard of her\nlosing any time over anyone else. It's because she loves you. And why\ndoes Mr. McLean turn all of his valuable business over to hired men and\nwatch you personally? And why is he hunting excuses every day to spend\nmoney on you? My father says McLean is full Scotch-close with a dollar.\nHe is a hard-headed business man, Freckles, and he is doing it because\nhe finds you worthy of it. Worthy of all we all can do and more than we\nknow how to do, dear heart! Freckles, are you listening to me? Oh! won't\nyou see it? Won't you believe it?”\n\n“Oh, Angel!” chattered the bewildered Freckles, “are you truly maning\nit? Could it be?”\n\n“Of course it could,” flashed the Angel, “because it just is!”\n\n“But you can't prove it,” wailed Freckles. “It ain't giving me a name,\nor me honor!”\n\n“Freckles,” said the Angel sternly, “you are unreasonable! Why, I did\nprove every word I said! Everything proves it! You look here! If you\nknew for sure that I could give you a name and your honor, and prove\nto you that your mother did love you, why, then, would you just go to\nbreathing like perpetual motion and hang on for dear life and get well?”\n\nA bright light shone in Freckles' eyes.\n\n“If I knew that, Angel,” he said solemnly, “you couldn't be killing me\nif you felled the biggest tree in the Limberlost smash on me!”\n\n“Then you go right to work,” said the Angel, “and before night I'll\nprove one thing to you: I can show you easily enough how much your\nmother loved you. That will be the first step, and then the remainder\nwill all come. If my father and Mr. McLean are so anxious to spend some\nmoney, I'll give them a chance. I don't see why we haven't comprehended\nhow you felt and so have been at work weeks ago. We've been awfully\nselfish. We've all been so comfortable, we never stopped to think what\nother people were suffering before our eyes. None of us has understood.\nI'll hire the finest detective in Chicago, and we'll go to work\ntogether. This is nothing compared with things people do find out. We'll\ngo at it, beak and claw, and we'll show you a thing or two.”\n\nFreckles caught her sleeve.\n\n“Me mother, Angel! Me mother!” he marveled hoarsely. “Did you say\nyou could be finding out today if me mother loved me? How? Oh, Angel!\nNothing matters, IF ONLY ME MOTHER DIDN'T DO IT!”\n\n“Then you rest easy,” said the Angel, with large confidence. “Your\nmother didn't do it! Mothers of sons such as you don't do things like\nthat. I'll go to work at once and prove it to you. The first thing to\ndo is to go to that Home where you were and get the clothes you wore the\nnight you were left there. I know that they are required to save those\nthings carefully. We can find out almost all there is to know about your\nmother from them. Did you ever see them?”\n\n“Yis,” he replied.\n\n“Freckles! Were they white?” she cried.\n\n“Maybe they were once. They're all yellow with laying, and brown with\nblood-stains now” said Freckles, the old note of bitterness creeping in.\n“You can't be telling anything at all by them, Angel!”\n\n“Well, but I just can!” said the Angel positively. “I can see from the\nquality what kind of goods your mother could afford to buy. I can see\nfrom the cut whether she had good taste. I can see from the care she\ntook in making them how much she loved and wanted you.”\n\n“But how? Angel, tell me how!” implored Freckles with trembling\neagerness.\n\n“Why, easily enough,” said the Angel. “I thought you'd understand.\nPeople that can afford anything at all, always buy white for little new\nbabies--linen and lace, and the very finest things to be had. There's a\nyoung woman living near us who cut up her wedding clothes to have fine\nthings for her baby. Mothers who love and want their babies don't buy\nlittle rough, ready-made things, and they don't run up what they make on\nan old sewing machine. They make fine seams, and tucks, and put on lace\nand trimming by hand. They sit and stitch, and stitch--little, even\nstitches, every one just as careful. Their eyes shine and their faces\nglow. When they have to quit to do something else, they look sorry, and\nfold up their work so particularly. There isn't much worth knowing about\nyour mother that those little clothes won't tell. I can see her putting\nthe little stitches into them and smiling with shining eyes over your\ncoming. Freckles, I'll wager you a dollar those little clothes of yours\nare just alive with the dearest, tiny handmade stitches.”\n\nA new light dawned in Freckles' eyes. A tinge of warm color swept into\nhis face. Renewed strength was noticeable in his grip of her hands.\n\n“Oh Angel! Will you go now? Will you be hurrying?” he cried.\n\n“Right away,” said the Angel. “I won't stop for a thing, and I'll hurry\nwith all my might.”\n\nShe smoothed his pillow, straightened the cover, gave him one steady\nlook in the eyes, and went quietly from the room.\n\nOutside the door, McLean and the surgeon anxiously awaited her. McLean\ncaught her shoulders.\n\n“Angel, what have you done?” he demanded.\n\nThe Angel smiled defiance into his eyes.\n\n“'What have I done?'” she repeated. “I've tried to save Freckles.”\n\n“What will your father say?” groaned McLean.\n\n“It strikes me,” said the Angel, “that what Freckles said would be to\nthe point.”\n\n“Freckles!” exclaimed McLean. “What could he say?”\n\n“He seemed to be able to say several things,” answered the Angel\nsweetly. “I fancy the one that concerns you most at present was, that if\nmy father should offer me to him he would not have me.”\n\n“And no one knows why better than I do,” cried McLean. “Every day he\nmust astonish me with some new fineness.”\n\nHe turned to the surgeon. “Save him!” he commanded. “Save him!” he\nimplored. “He is too fine to be sacrificed.”\n\n“His salvation lies here,” said the surgeon, stroking the Angel's\nsunshiny hair, “and I can read in the face of her that she knows how she\nis going to work it out. Don't trouble for the boy. She will save him!”\n\nThe Angel laughingly sped down the hall, and into the street, just as\nshe was.\n\n“I have come,” she said to the matron of the Home, “to ask if you will\nallow me to examine, or, better yet, to take with me, the little clothes\nthat a boy you called Freckles, discharged last fall, wore the night he\nwas left here.”\n\nThe woman looked at her in greater astonishment than the occasion\ndemanded.\n\n“Well, I'd be glad to let you see them,” she said at last, “but the\nfact is we haven't them. I do hope we haven't made some mistake. I was\nthoroughly convinced, and so was the superintendent. We let his people\ntake those things away yesterday. Who are you, and what do you want with\nthem?”\n\nThe Angel stood dazed and speechless, staring at the matron.\n\n“There couldn't have been a mistake,” continued the matron, seeing the\nAngel's distress. “Freckles was here when I took charge, ten years ago.\nThese people had it all proved that he belonged to them. They had\nhim traced to where he ran away in Illinois last fall, and there they\ncompletely lost track of him. I'm sorry you seem so disappointed, but it\nis all right. The man is his uncle, and as like the boy as he possibly\ncould be. He is almost killed to go back without him. If you know where\nFreckles is, they'd give big money to find out.”\n\nThe Angel laid a hand along each cheek to steady her chattering teeth.\n\n“Who are they?” she stammered. “Where are they going?”\n\n“They are Irish folks, miss,” said the matron. “They have been in\nChicago and over the country for the past three months, hunting him\neverywhere. They have given up, and are starting home today. They----”\n\n“Did they leave an address? Where could I find them?” interrupted the\nAngel.\n\n“They left a card, and I notice the morning paper has the man's picture\nand is full of them. They've advertised a great deal in the city papers.\nIt's a wonder you haven't seen something.”\n\n“Trains don't run right. We never get Chicago papers,” said the Angel.\n“Please give me that card quickly. They may escape me. I simply must\ncatch them!”\n\nThe matron hurried to the secretary and came back with a card.\n\n“Their addresses are there,” she said. “Both in Chicago and at their\nhome. They made them full and plain, and I was to cable at once if I\ngot the least clue of him at any time. If they've left the city, you can\nstop them in New York. You're sure to catch them before they sail--if\nyou hurry.”\n\nThe matron caught up a paper and thrust it into the Angel's hand as she\nran to the street.\n\nThe Angel glanced at the card. The Chicago address was Suite Eleven,\nAuditorium. She laid her hand on her driver's sleeve and looked into his\neyes.\n\n“There is a fast-driving limit?” she asked.\n\n“Yes, miss.”\n\n“Will you crowd it all you can without danger of arrest? I will pay\nwell. I must catch some people!”\n\nThen she smiled at him. The hospital, an Orphans' Home, and the\nAuditorium seemed a queer combination to that driver, but the Angel was\nalways and everywhere the Angel, and her methods were strictly her own.\n\n“I will take you there as quickly as any man could with a team,” he said\npromptly.\n\nThe Angel clung to the card and paper, and as best she could in the\nlurching, swaying cab, read the addresses over.\n\n“O'More, Suite Eleven, Auditorium.”\n\n“'O'More,'” she repeated. “Seems to fit Freckles to a dot. Wonder if\nthat could be his name? 'Suite Eleven' means that you are pretty well\nfixed. Suites in the Auditorium come high.”\n\nThen she turned the card and read on its reverse, Lord Maxwell O'More,\nM. P., Killvany Place, County Clare, Ireland.\n\nThe Angel sat on the edge of the seat, bracing her feet against the one\nopposite, as the cab pitched and swung around corners and past vehicles.\nShe mechanically fingered the pasteboard and stared straight ahead. Then\nshe drew a deep breath and read the card again.\n\n“A Lord-man!” she groaned despairingly. “A Lord-man! Bet my hoecake's\nscorched! Here I've gone and pledged my word to Freckles I'd find him\nsome decent relatives, that he could be proud of, and now there isn't a\nchance out of a dozen that he'll have to be ashamed of them after all.\nIt's too mean!”\n\nThe tears of vexation rolled down the tired, nerve-racked Angel's\ncheeks.\n\n“This isn't going to do,” she said, resolutely wiping her eyes with the\npalm of her hand and gulping down the nervous spasm in her throat. “I\nmust read this paper before I meet Lord O'More.”\n\nShe blinked back the tears and spreading the paper on her knee, read:\n“After three months' fruitless search, Lord O'More gives up the quest of\nhis lost nephew, and leaves Chicago today for his home in Ireland.”\n\nShe read on, and realized every word. The likeness settled any doubt. It\nwas Freckles over again, only older and well dressed.\n\n“Well, I must catch you if I can,” muttered the Angel. “But when I do,\nif you are a gentleman in name only, you shan't have Freckles; that's\nflat. You're not his father and he is twenty. Anyway, if the law will\ngive him to you for one year, you can't spoil him, because nobody could,\nand,” she added, brightening, “he'll probably do you a lot of good.\nFreckles and I both must study years yet, and you should be something\nthat will save him. I guess it will come out all right. At least, I\ndon't believe you can take him away if I say no.”\n\n“Thank you; and wait, no matter how long,” she said to her driver.\n\nCatching up the paper, she hurried to the desk and laid down Lord\nO'More's card.\n\n“Has my uncle started yet?” she asked sweetly.\n\nThe surprised clerk stepped back on a bellboy, and covertly kicked him\nfor being in the way.\n\n“His lordship is in his room,” he said, with a low bow.\n\n“All right,” said the Angel, picking up the card. “I thought he might\nhave started. I'll see him.”\n\nThe clerk shoved the bellboy toward the Angel.\n\n“Show her ladyship to the elevator and Lord O'More's suite,” he said,\nbowing double.\n\n“Aw, thanks,” said the Angel with a slight nod, as she turned away.\n\n“I'm not sure,” she muttered to herself as the elevator sped upward,\n“whether it's the Irish or the English who say: 'Aw, thanks,' but it's\nprobable he isn't either; and anyway, I just had to do something to\ncounteract that 'All right.' How stupid of me!”\n\nAt the bellboy's tap, the door swung open and the liveried servant\nthrust a cardtray before the Angel. The opening of the door created a\ncurrent that swayed a curtain aside, and in an adjoining room, lounging\nin a big chair, with a paper in his hand, sat a man who was, beyond\nquestion, of Freckles' blood and race.\n\nWith perfect control the Angel dropped Lord O'More's card in the tray,\nstepped past his servant, and stood before his lordship.\n\n“Good morning,” she said with tense politeness.\n\nLord O'More said nothing. He carelessly glanced her over with amused\ncuriosity, until her color began to deepen and her blood to run hotly.\n\n“Well, my dear,” he said at last, “how can I serve you?”\n\nInstantly the Angel became indignant. She had been so shielded in the\nmidst of almost entire freedom, owing to the circumstances of her life,\nthat the words and the look appeared to her as almost insulting. She\nlifted her head with a proud gesture.\n\n“I am not your 'dear,'” she said with slow distinctness. “There isn't a\nthing in the world you can do for me. I came here to see if I could do\nsomething--a very great something--for you; but if I don't like you, I\nwon't do it!”\n\nThen Lord O'More did stare. Suddenly he broke into a ringing laugh.\nWithout a change of attitude or expression, the Angel stood looking\nsteadily at him.\n\nThere was a silken rustle, then a beautiful woman with cheeks of satiny\npink, dark hair, and eyes of pure Irish blue, moved to Lord O'More's\nside, and catching his arm, shook him impatiently.\n\n“Terence! Have you lost your senses?” she cried. “Didn't you understand\nwhat the child said? Look at her face! See what she has!”\n\nLord O'More opened his eyes widely and sat up. He did look at the\nAngel's face intently, and suddenly found it so good that it was\ndifficult to follow the next injunction. He arose instantly.\n\n“I beg your pardon,” he said. “The fact is, I am leaving Chicago sorely\ndisappointed. It makes me bitter and reckless. I thought you one more of\nthose queer, useless people who have thrust themselves on me constantly,\nand I was careless. Forgive me, and tell me why you came.”\n\n“I will if I like you,” said the Angel stoutly, “and if I don't, I\nwon't!”\n\n“But I began all wrong, and now I don't know how to make you like me,”\n said his lordship, with sincere penitence in his tone.\n\nThe Angel found herself yielding to his voice. He spoke in a soft,\nmellow, smoothly flowing Irish tone, and although his speech was\nperfectly correct, it was so rounded, and accented, and the sentences so\nturned, that it was Freckles over again. Still, it was a matter of the\nvery greatest importance, and she must be sure; so she looked into the\nbeautiful woman's face.\n\n“Are you his wife?” she asked.\n\n“Yes,” said the woman, “I am his wife.”\n\n“Well,” said the Angel judicially, “the Bird Woman says no one in the\nwhole world knows all a man's bignesses and all his littlenesses as his\nwife does. What you think of him should do for me. Do you like him?”\n\nThe question was so earnestly asked that it met with equal earnestness.\nThe dark head moved caressingly against Lord O'More's sleeve.\n\n“Better than anyone in the whole world,” said Lady O'More promptly.\n\nThe Angel mused a second, and then her legal tinge came to the fore\nagain.\n\n“Yes, but have you anyone you could like better, if he wasn't all\nright?” she persisted.\n\n“I have three of his sons, two little daughters, a father, mother, and\nseveral brothers and sisters,” came the quick reply.\n\n“And you like him best?” persisted the Angel with finality.\n\n“I love him so much that I would give up every one of them with dry eyes\nif by so doing I could save him,” cried Lord O'More's wife.\n\n“Oh!” cried the Angel. “Oh, my!”\n\nShe lifted her clear eyes to Lord O'More's and shook her head.\n\n“She never, never could do that!” she said. “But it's a mighty big thing\nto your credit that she THINKS she could. I guess I'll tell you why I\ncame.”\n\nShe laid down the paper, and touched the portrait.\n\n“When you were only a boy, did people call you Freckles?” she asked.\n\n“Dozens of good fellows all over Ireland and the Continent are doing it\ntoday,” answered Lord O'More.\n\nThe Angel's face wore her most beautiful smile.\n\n“I was sure of it,” she said winningly. “That's what we call him, and he\nis so like you, I doubt if any one of those three boys of yours are\nmore so. But it's been twenty years. Seems to me you've been a long time\ncoming!”\n\nLord O'More caught the Angel's wrists and his wife slipped her arms\naround her.\n\n“Steady, my girl!” said the man's voice hoarsely. “Don't make me think\nyou've brought word of the boy at this last hour, unless you know\nsurely.”\n\n“It's all right,” said the Angel. “We have him, and there's no chance\nof a mistake. If I hadn't gone to that Home for his little clothes, and\nheard of you and been hunting you, and had met you on the street, or\nanywhere, I would have stopped you and asked you who you were, just\nbecause you are so like him. It's all right. I can tell you where\nFreckles is; but whether you deserve to know--that's another matter!”\n\nLord O'More did not hear her. He dropped in his chair, and covering his\nface, burst into those terrible sobs that shake and rend a strong man.\nLady O'More hovered over him, weeping.\n\n“Umph! Looks pretty fair for Freckles,” muttered the Angel. “Lots of\nthings can be explained; now perhaps they can explain this.”\n\nThey did explain so satisfactorily that in a few minutes the Angel was\non her feet, hurrying Lord and Lady O'More to reach the hospital. “You\nsaid Freckles' old nurse knew his mother's picture instantly,” said the\nAngel. “I want that picture and the bundle of little clothes.”\n\nLady O'More gave them into her hands.\n\nThe likeness was a large miniature, painted on ivory, with a frame of\nbeaten gold. Surrounded by masses of dark hair was a delicately cut\nface. In the upper part of it there was no trace of Freckles, but\nthe lips curving in a smile were his very own. The Angel gazed at it\nsteadily. Then with a quivering breath she laid the portrait aside and\nreached both hands to Lord O'More.\n\n“That will save Freckles' life and insure his happiness,” she said\npositively. “Thank you, oh thank you for coming!”\n\nShe opened the bundle of yellow and brown linen and gave only a glance\nat the texture and work. Then she gathered the little clothes and the\npicture to her heart and led the way to the cab.\n\nUshering Lord and Lady O'More into the reception room, she said to\nMcLean, “Please go call up my father and ask him to come on the first\ntrain.”\n\nShe closed the door after him.\n\n“These are Freckles' people,” she said to the Bird Woman. “You can find\nout about each other; I'm going to him.”\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XIX\n\nWherein Freckles Finds His Birthright and the Angel Loses Her Heart\n\nThe nurse left the room quietly, as the Angel entered, carrying the\nbundle and picture. When they were alone, she turned to Freckles and saw\nthat the crisis was indeed at hand.\n\nThat she had good word to give him was his salvation, for despite the\nheavy plaster jacket that held his body immovable, his head was lifted\nfrom the pillow. Both arms reached for her. His lips and cheeks flamed,\nwhile his eyes flashed with excitement.\n\n“Angel,” he panted. “Oh Angel! Did you find them? Are they white? Are\nthe little stitches there? OH ANGEL! DID ME MOTHER LOVE ME?”\n\nThe words seemed to leap from his burning lips. The Angel dropped the\nbundle on the bed and laid the picture face down across his knees.\nShe gently pushed his head to the pillow and caught his arms in a firm\ngrasp.\n\n“Yes, dear heart,” she said with fullest assurance. “No little clothes\nwere ever whiter. I never in all my life saw such dainty, fine, little\nstitches; and as for loving you, no boy's mother ever loved him more!”\n\nA nervous trembling seized Freckles.\n\n“Sure? Are you sure?” he urged with clicking teeth.\n\n“I know,” said the Angel firmly. “And Freckles, while you rest and be\nglad, I want to tell you a story. When you feel stronger we will look at\nthe clothes together. They are here. They are all right. But while I\nwas at the Home getting them, I heard of some people that were hunting\na lost boy. I went to see them, and what they told me was all so exactly\nlike what might have happened to you that I must tell you. Then you'll\nunderstand that things could be very different from what you always have\ntortured yourself with thinking. Are you strong enough to listen? May I\ntell you?”\n\n“Maybe 'twasn't me mother! Maybe someone else made those little\nstitches!”\n\n“Now, goosie, don't you begin that,” said the Angel, “because I know\nthat it was!”\n\n“Know!” cried Freckles, his head springing from the pillow. “Know! How\ncan you know?”\n\nThe Angel gently soothed him back.\n\n“Why, because nobody else would ever sit and do it the way it is done.\nThat's how I know,” she said emphatically. “Now you listen while I tell\nyou about this lost boy and his people, who have hunted for months and\ncan't find him.”\n\nFreckles lay quietly under her touch, but he did not hear a word that\nshe was saying until his roving eyes rested on her face; he immediately\nnoticed a remarkable thing. For the first time she was talking to him\nand avoiding his eyes. That was not like the Angel at all. It was the\ndelight of hearing her speak that she looked one squarely in the face\nand with perfect frankness. There were no side glances and down-drooping\neyes when the Angel talked; she was business straight through. Instantly\nFreckles' wandering thoughts fastened on her words.\n\n“--and he was a sour, grumpy, old man,” she was saying. “He always had\nbeen spoiled, because he was an only son, so he had a title, and a big\nestate. He would have just his way, no matter about his sweet little\nwife, or his boys, or anyone. So when his elder son fell in love with a\nbeautiful girl having a title, the very girl of all the world his\nfather wanted him to, and added a big adjoining estate to his, why, that\npleased him mightily.\n\n“Then he went and ordered his younger son to marry a poky kind of a\ngirl, that no one liked, to add another big estate on the other side,\nand that was different. That was all the world different, because the\nelder son had been in love all his life with the girl he married, and,\noh, Freckles, it's no wonder, for I saw her! She's a beauty and she has\nthe sweetest way.\n\n“But that poor younger son, he had been in love with the village\nvicar's daughter all his life. That's no wonder either, for she was more\nbeautiful yet. She could sing as the angels, but she hadn't a cent. She\nloved him to death, too, if he was bony and freckled and red-haired--I\ndon't mean that! They didn't say what color his hair was, but his\nfather's must have been the reddest ever, for when he found out about\nthem, and it wasn't anything so terrible, HE JUST CAVED!\n\n“The old man went to see the girl--the pretty one with no money, of\ncourse--and he hurt her feelings until she ran away. She went to London\nand began studying music. Soon she grew to be a fine singer, so she\njoined a company and came to this country.\n\n“When the younger son found that she had left London, he followed her.\nWhen she got here all alone, and afraid, and saw him coming to her, why,\nshe was so glad she up and married him, just like anybody else would\nhave done. He didn't want her to travel with the troupe, so when they\nreached Chicago they thought that would be a good place, and they\nstopped, while he hunted work. It was slow business, because he never\nhad been taught to do a useful thing, and he didn't even know how to\nhunt work, least of all to do it when he found it; so pretty soon things\nwere going wrong. But if he couldn't find work, she could always sing,\nso she sang at night, and made little things in the daytime. He didn't\nlike her to sing in public, and he wouldn't allow her when he could\nHELP himself; but winter came, it was very cold, and fire was expensive.\nRents went up, and they had to move farther out to cheaper and\ncheaper places; and you were coming--I mean, the boy that is lost was\ncoming--and they were almost distracted. Then the man wrote and told his\nfather all about it; and his father sent the letter back unopened with\na line telling him never to write again. When the baby came, there was\nvery little left to pawn for food and a doctor, and nothing at all for\na nurse; so an old neighbor woman went in and took care of the young\nmother and the little baby, because she was so sorry for them. By that\ntime they were away in the suburbs on the top floor of a little wooden\nhouse, among a lot of big factories, and it kept growing colder, with\nless to eat. Then the man grew desperate and he went just to find\nsomething to eat and the woman was desperate, too. She got up, left the\nold woman to take care of her baby, and went into the city to sing for\nsome money. The woman became so cold she put the baby in bed and went\nhome. Then a boiler blew up in a big factory beside the little house and\nset it on fire. A piece of iron was pitched across and broke through\nthe roof. It came down smash, and cut just one little hand off the poor\nbaby. It screamed and screamed; and the fire kept coming closer and\ncloser.\n\n“The old woman ran out with the other people and saw what had happened.\nShe knew there wasn't going to be time to wait for firemen or anything,\nso she ran into the building. She could hear the baby screaming, and she\ncouldn't stand that; so she worked her way to it. There it was, all hurt\nand bleeding. Then she was almost scared to death over thinking what its\nmother would do to her for going away and leaving it, so she ran to a\nHome for little friendless babies, that was close, and banged on the\ndoor. Then she hid across the street until the baby was taken in, and\nthen she ran back to see if her own house was burning. The big factory\nand the little house and a lot of others were all gone. The people there\ntold her that the beautiful lady came back and ran into the house to\nfind her baby. She had just gone in when her husband came, and he went\nin after her, and the house fell over both of them.”\n\nFreckles lay rigidly, with his eyes on the Angel's face, while she\ntalked rapidly to the ceiling.\n\n“Then the old woman was sick about that poor little baby. She was afraid\nto tell them at the Home, because she knew she never should have left\nit, but she wrote a letter and sent it to where the beautiful woman,\nwhen she was ill, had said her husband's people lived. She told all\nabout the little baby that she could remember: when it was born, how it\nwas named for the man's elder brother, that its hand had been cut off in\nthe fire, and where she had put it to be doctored and taken care of. She\ntold them that its mother and father were both burned, and she begged\nand implored them to come after it.\n\n“You'd think that would have melted a heart of ice, but that old man\nhadn't any heart to melt, for he got that letter and read it. He hid it\naway among his papers and never told a soul. A few months ago he died.\nWhen his elder son went to settle his business, he found the letter\nalmost the first thing. He dropped everything, and came, with his wife,\nto hunt that baby, because he always had loved his brother dearly, and\nwanted him back. He had hunted for him all he dared all these years, but\nwhen he got here you were gone--I mean the baby was gone, and I had to\ntell you, Freckles, for you see, it might have happened to you like that\njust as easy as to that other lost boy.”\n\nFreckles reached up and turned the Angel's face until he compelled her\neyes to meet his.\n\n“Angel,” he asked quietly, “why don't you look at me when you are\ntelling about that lost boy?”\n\n“I--I didn't know I wasn't,” faltered the Angel.\n\n“It seems to me,” said Freckles, his breath beginning to come in sharp\nwheezes, “that you got us rather mixed, and it ain't like you to be\nmixing things till one can't be knowing. If they were telling you so\nmuch, did they say which hand was for being off that lost boy?”\n\nThe Angel's eyes escaped again.\n\n“It--it was the same as yours,” she ventured, barely breathing in her\nfear.\n\nStill Freckles lay rigid and whiter than the coverlet.\n\n“Would that boy be as old as me?” he asked.\n\n“Yes,” said the Angel faintly.\n\n“Angel,” said Freckles at last, catching her wrist, “are you trying to\ntell me that there is somebody hunting a boy that you're thinking might\nbe me? Are you belavin' you've found me relations?”\n\nThen the Angel's eyes came home. The time had come. She pinioned\nFreckles' arms to his sides and bent above him.\n\n“How strong are you, dear heart?” she breathed. “How brave are you? Can\nyou bear it? Dare I tell you that?”\n\n“No!” gasped Freckles. “Not if you're sure! I can't bear it! I'll die if\nyou do!”\n\nThe day had been one unremitting strain with the Angel. Nerve tension\nwas drawn to the finest thread. It snapped suddenly.\n\n“Die!” she flamed. “Die, if I tell you that! You said this morning that\nyou would die if you DIDN'T know your name, and if your people were\nhonorable. Now I've gone and found you a name that stands for ages of\nhonor, a mother who loved you enough to go into the fire and die for\nyou, and the nicest kind of relatives, and you turn round and say you'll\ndie over that! YOU JUST TRY DYING AND YOU'LL GET A GOOD SLAP!”\n\nThe Angel stood glaring at him. One second Freckles lay paralyzed and\ndumb with astonishment. The next the Irish in his soul arose above\neverything. A laugh burst from him. The terrified Angel caught him in\nher arms and tried to stifle the sound. She implored and commanded. When\nhe was too worn to utter another sound, his eyes laughed silently.\n\nAfter a long time, when he was quiet and rested, the Angel commenced\ntalking to him gently, and this time her big eyes, humid with tenderness\nand mellow with happiness, seemed as if they could not leave his face.\n\n“Dear Freckles,” she was saying, “across your knees there is the face of\nthe mother who went into the fire for you, and I know the name--old and\nfull of honor--to which you were born. Dear heart, which will you have\nfirst?”\n\nFreckles was very tired; the big drops of perspiration ran together on\nhis temples; but the watching Angel caught the words his lips formed,\n“Me mother!”\n\nShe lifted the lovely pictured face and set it in the nook of his arm.\nFreckles caught her hand and drew her beside him, and together they\ngazed at the picture while the tears slid over their cheeks.\n\n“Me mother! Oh, me mother! Can you ever be forgiving me? Oh, me\nbeautiful little mother!” chanted Freckles over and over in exalted\nwonder, until he was so completely exhausted that his lips refused to\nform the question in his weary eyes.\n\n“Wait!” cried the Angel with inborn refinement, for she could no more\nanswer that question than he could ask. “Wait, I will write it!”\n\nShe hurried to the table, caught up the nurse's pencil, and on the back\nof a prescription tablet scrawled it: “Terence Maxwell O'More, Dunderry\nHouse, County Clare, Ireland.”\n\nBefore she had finished came Freckles' voice: “Angel, are you hurrying?”\n\n“Yes,” said the Angel; “I am. But there is a good deal of it. I have to\nput in your house and country, so that you will feel located.”\n\n“Me house?” marveled Freckles.\n\n“Of course,” said the Angel. “Your uncle says your grandmother left your\nfather her dower house and estate, because she knew his father would cut\nhim off. You get that, and all your share of your grandfather's property\nbesides. It is all set off for you and waiting. Lord O'More told me so.\nI suspect you are richer than McLean, Freckles.”\n\nShe closed his fingers over the slip and straightened his hair.\n\n“Now you are all right, dear Limberlost guard,” she said. “You go to\nsleep and don't think of a thing but just pure joy, joy, joy! I'll keep\nyour people until you wake up. You are too tired to see anyone else just\nnow!”\n\nFreckles caught her skirt as she turned from him.\n\n“I'll go to sleep in five minutes,” he said, “if you will be doing just\none thing more for me. Send for your father! Oh, Angel, send for him\nquick! How will I ever be waiting until he comes?”\n\nOne instant the Angel stood looking at him. The next a crimson wave\ndarkly stained her lovely face. Her chin began a spasmodic quivering and\nthe tears sprang into her eyes. Her hands caught at her chest as if she\nwere stifling. Freckles' grasp on her tightened until he drew her beside\nhim. He slipped his arm around her and drew her face to his pillow.\n\n“Don't, Angel; for the love of mercy don't be doing that,” he implored.\n“I can't be bearing it. Tell me. You must tell me.”\n\nThe Angel shook her head.\n\n“That ain't fair, Angel,” said Freckles. “You made me tell you when it\nwas like tearing the heart raw from me breast. And you was for making\neverything heaven--just heaven and nothing else for me. If I'm so much\nmore now than I was an hour ago, maybe I can be thinking of some way to\nfix things. You will be telling me?” he coaxed, moving his cheek against\nher hair.\n\nThe Angel's head moved in negation. Freckles did a moment of intent\nthinking.\n\n“Maybe I can be guessing,” he whispered. “Will you be giving me three\nchances?”\n\nThere was the faintest possible assent.\n\n“You didn't want me to be knowing me name,” guessed Freckles.\n\nThe Angel's head sprang from the pillow and her tear-stained face flamed\nwith outraged indignation.\n\n“Why, I did too!” she cried angrily.\n\n“One gone,” said Freckles calmly. “You didn't want me to have relatives,\na home, and money.”\n\n“I did!” exclaimed the Angel. “Didn't I go myself, all alone, into the\ncity, and find them when I was afraid as death? I did too!”\n\n“Two gone,” said Freckles. “You didn't want the beautifulest girl in the\nworld to be telling me.----”\n\nDown went the Angel's face and a heavy sob shook her. Freckles' clasp\ntightened around her shoulders, while his face, in its conflicting\nemotions, was a study. He was so stunned and bewildered by the miracle\nthat had been performed in bringing to light his name and relatives that\nhe had no strength left for elaborate mental processes. Despite all\nit meant to him to know his name at last, and that he was of honorable\nbirth--knowledge without which life was an eternal disgrace and burden\nthe one thing that was hammering in Freckles' heart and beating in his\nbrain, past any attempted expression, was the fact that, while nameless\nand possibly born in shame, the Angel had told him that she loved him.\nHe could find no word with which to begin to voice the rapture of his\nheart over that. But if she regretted it--if it had been a thing done\nout of her pity for his condition, or her feeling of responsibility, if\nit killed him after all, there was only one thing left to do. Not for\nMcLean, not for the Bird Woman, not for the Duncans would Freckles have\ndone it--but for the Angel--if it would make her happy--he would do\nanything.\n\n“Angel,” whispered Freckles, with his lips against her hair, “you\nhaven't learned your history book very well, or else you've forgotten.”\n\n“Forgotten what?” sobbed the Angel.\n\n“Forgotten about the real knight, Ladybird,” breathed Freckles. “Don't\nyou know that, if anything happened that made his lady sorry, a real\nknight just simply couldn't be remembering it? Angel, darling little\nSwamp Angel, you be listening to me. There was one night on the trail,\none solemn, grand, white night, that there wasn't ever any other like\nbefore or since, when the dear Boss put his arm around me and told me\nthat he loved me; but if you care, Angel, if you don't want it that\nway, why, I ain't remembering that anyone else ever did--not in me whole\nlife.”\n\nThe Angel lifted her head and looked into the depths of Freckles' honest\ngray eyes, and they met hers unwaveringly; but the pain in them was\npitiful.\n\n“Do you mean,” she demanded, “that you don't remember that a brazen,\nforward girl told you, when you hadn't asked her, that she”--the\nAngel choked on it a second, but she gave a gulp and brought it out\nbravely--“that she loved you?”\n\n“No!” cried Freckles. “No! I don't remember anything of the kind!”\n\nBut all the songbirds of his soul burst into melody over that one little\nclause: “When you hadn't asked her.”\n\n“But you will,” said the Angel. “You may live to be an old, old man, and\nthen you will.”\n\n“I will not!” cried Freckles. “How can you think it, Angel?”\n\n“You won't even LOOK as if you remember?”\n\n“I will not!” persisted Freckles. “I'll be swearing to it if you want me\nto. If you wasn't too tired to think this thing out straight, you'd be\nseeing that I couldn't--that I just simply couldn't! I'd rather give it\nall up now and go into eternity alone, without ever seeing a soul of me\nsame blood, or me home, or hearing another man call me by the name I was\nborn to, than to remember anything that would be hurting you, Angel. I\nshould think you'd be understanding that it ain't no ways possible for\nme to do it.”\n\nThe Angel's tear-stained face flashed into dazzling beauty. A\nhalf-hysterical little laugh broke from her heart and bubbled over her\nlips.\n\n“Oh, Freckles, forgive me!” she cried. “I've been through so much that\nI'm scarcely myself, or I wouldn't be here bothering you when you should\nbe sleeping. Of course you couldn't! I knew it all the time! I was just\nscared! I was forgetting that you were you! You're too good a knight\nto remember a thing like that. Of course you are! And when you don't\nremember, why, then it's the same as if it never happened. I was almost\nkilled because I'd gone and spoiled everything, but now it will be all\nright. Now you can go on and do things like other men, and I can have\nsome flowers, and letters, and my sweetheart coming, and when you are\nSURE, why, then YOU can tell ME things, can't you? Oh, Freckles, I'm\nso glad! Oh, I'm so happy! It's dear of you not to remember, Freckles;\nperfectly dear! It's no wonder I love you so. The wonder would be if\nI did not. Oh, I should like to know how I'm ever going to make you\nunderstand how much I love you!”\n\nPillow and all, she caught him to her breast one long second; then she\nwas gone.\n\nFreckles lay dazed with astonishment. At last his amazed eyes searched\nthe room for something approaching the human to which he could appeal,\nand falling on his mother's portrait, he set it before him.\n\n“For the love of life! Me little mother,” he panted, “did you hear that?\nDid you hear it! Tell me, am I living, or am I dead and all heaven come\ntrue this minute? Did you hear it?”\n\nHe shook the frame in his impatience at receiving no answer.\n\n“You are only a pictured face,” he said at last, “and of course you\ncan't talk; but the soul of you must be somewhere, and surely in this\nhour you are close enough to be hearing. Tell me, did you hear that? I\ncan't ever be telling a living soul; but darling little mother, who\ngave your life for mine, I can always be talking of it to you! Every day\nwe'll talk it over and try to understand the miracle of it. Tell me, are\nall women like that? Were you like me Swamp Angel? If you were, then I'm\nunderstanding why me father followed across the ocean and went into the\nfire.”\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XX\n\nWherein Freckles returns to the Limberlost, and Lord O'More Sails for\nIreland Without Him\n\nFreckles' voice ceased, his eyes closed, and his head rolled back from\nexhaustion. Later in the day he insisted on seeing Lord and Lady O'More,\nbut he fainted before the resemblance of another man to him, and gave\nall of his friends a terrible fright.\n\nThe next morning, the Man of Affairs, with a heart filled with\nmisgivings, undertook the interview on which Freckles insisted. His\nfears were without cause. Freckles was the soul of honor and simplicity.\n\n“Have they been telling you what's come to me?” he asked without even\nwaiting for a greeting.\n\n“Yes,” said the Angel's father.\n\n“Do you think you have the very worst of it clear to your\nunderstanding?”\n\nUnder Freckles' earnest eyes the Man of Affairs answered soberly: “I\nthink I have, Mr. O'More.”\n\nThat was the first time Freckles heard his name from the lips of\nanother. One second he lay overcome; the next, tears filled his eyes,\nand he reached out his hand. Then the Angel's father understood, and he\nclasped that hand and held it in a strong, firm grasp.\n\n“Terence, my boy,” he said, “let me do the talking. I came here with\nthe understanding that you wanted to ask me for my only child. I should\nlike, at the proper time, to regard her marriage, if she has found the\nman she desires to marry, not as losing all I have, but as gaining a man\non whom I can depend to love as a son and to take charge of my affairs\nfor her when I retire from business. Bend all of your energies toward\nrapid recovery, and from this hour understand that my daughter and my\nhome are yours.”\n\n“You're not forgetting this?”\n\nFreckles lifted his right arm.\n\n“Terence, I'm sorrier than I have words to express about that,” said\nthe Man of Affairs. “It's a damnable pity! But if it's for me to choose\nwhether I give all I have left in this world to a man lacking a hand, or\nto one of these gambling, tippling, immoral spendthrifts of today, with\nboth hands and feet off their souls, and a rotten spot in the core, I\nchoose you; and it seems that my daughter does the same. Put what is\nleft you of that right arm to the best uses you can in this world, and\nnever again mention or feel that it is defective so long as you live.\nGood day, sir!”\n\n“One minute more,” said Freckles. “Yesterday the Angel was telling me\nthat there was money coming to me from two sources. She said that me\ngrandmother had left me father all of her fortune and her house, because\nshe knew that his father would be cutting him off, and also that me\nuncle had set aside for me what would be me father's interest in his\nfather's estate.\n\n“Whatever the sum is that me grandmother left me father, because she\nloved him and wanted him to be having it, that I'll be taking. 'Twas\nhers from her father, and she had the right to be giving it as she\nchose. Anything from the man that knowingly left me father and me mother\nto go cold and hungry, and into the fire in misery, when just a little\nwould have made life so beautiful to them, and saved me this crippled\nbody--money that he willed from me when he knew I was living, of his\nblood and on charity among strangers, I don't touch, not if I freeze,\nstarve, and burn too! If there ain't enough besides that, and I can't be\nearning enough to fix things for the Angel----”\n\n“We are not discussing money!” burst in the Man of Affairs. “We don't\nwant any blood-money! We have all we need without it. If you don't feel\nright and easy over it, don't you touch a cent of any of it.”\n\n“It's right I should have what me grandmother intinded for me father,\nand I want it,” said Freckles, “but I'd die before I'd touch a cent of\nme grandfather's money!”\n\n\n“Now,” said the Angel, “we are all going home. We have done all we can\nfor Freckles. His people are here. He should know them. They are very\nanxious to become acquainted with him. We'll resign him to them. When he\nis well, why, then he will be perfectly free to go to Ireland or come to\nthe Limberlost, just as he chooses. We will go at once.”\n\nMcLean held out for a week, and then he could endure it no longer.\nHe was heart hungry for Freckles. Communing with himself in the long,\nsoundful nights of the swamp, he had learned to his astonishment that\nfor the past year his heart had been circling the Limberlost with\nFreckles. He began to wish that he had not left him. Perhaps the\nboy--his boy by first right, after all--was being neglected. If the\nBoss had been a nervous old woman, he scarcely could have imagined more\nthings that might be going wrong.\n\nHe started for Chicago, loaded with a big box of goldenrod, asters,\nfringed gentians, and crimson leaves, that the Angel carefully had\ngathered from Freckles' room, and a little, long slender package. He\ntraveled with biting, stinging jealousy in his heart. He would not\nadmit it even to himself, but he was unable to remain longer away from\nFreckles and leave him to the care of Lord O'More.\n\nIn a few minutes' talk, while McLean awaited admission to Freckles'\nroom, his lordship had chatted genially of Freckles' rapid recovery,\nof his delight that he was unspotted by his early surroundings, and\nhis desire to visit the Limberlost with Freckles before they sailed;\nhe expressed the hope that he could prevail upon the Angel's father to\nplace her in his wife's care and have her education finished in Paris.\nHe said they were anxious to do all they could to help bind Freckles'\narrangements with the Angel, as both he and Lady O'More regarded her as\nthe most promising girl they knew, and one who could be fitted to fill\nthe high position in which Freckles would place her.\n\nEvery word he uttered was pungent with bitterness to McLean. The swamp\nhad lost its flavor without Freckles; and yet, as Lord O'More talked,\nMcLean fervently wished himself in the heart of it. As he entered\nFreckles' room he almost lost his breath. Everything was changed.\n\nFreckles lay beside a window where he could follow Lake Michigan's\nblue until the horizon dipped into it. He could see big soft clouds,\nwhite-capped waves, shimmering sails, and puffing steamers trailing\nbillowing banners of lavender and gray across the sky. Gulls and curlews\nwheeled over the water and dipped their wings in the foam. The room was\nfilled with every luxury that taste and money could introduce.\n\nAll the tan and sunburn had been washed from Freckles' face in sweats\nof agony. It was a smooth, even white, its brown rift scarcely showing.\nWhat the nurses and Lady O'More had done to Freckles' hair McLean could\nnot guess, but it was the most beautiful that he ever had seen. Fine as\nfloss, bright in color, waving and crisp, it fell around the white face.\n\nThey had gotten his arms into and his chest covered with a finely\nembroidered, pale-blue silk shirt, with soft, white tie at the throat.\nAmong the many changes that had taken place during his absence, the\nfact that Freckles was most attractive and barely escaped being handsome\nremained almost unnoticed by the Boss, so great was his astonishment at\nseeing both cuffs turned back and the right arm in view. Freckles was\nusing the maimed arm that previously he always had hidden.\n\n“Oh Lord, sir, but I'm glad to see you!” cried Freckles, almost rolling\nfrom the bed as he reached toward McLean. “Tell me quick, is the Angel\nwell and happy? Can me Little Chicken spread six feet of wing and\nsail to his mother? How's me new father, the Bird Woman, Duncans, and\nNellie--darling little high-stepping Nelie? Me Aunt Alice is going to\nchoose the hat just as soon as I'm mended enough to be going with her.\nHow are all the gang? Have they found any more good trees? I've been\nthinking a lot, sir. I believe I can find others near that last one.\nMe Aunt Alice thinks maybe I can, and Uncle Terence says it's likely.\nGolly, but they're nice, ilegant people. I tell you I'm proud to be same\nblood with them! Come closer, quick! I was going to do this yesterday,\nand somehow I just felt that you'd surely be coming today and I waited.\nI'm selecting the Angel's ring stone. The ring she ordered for me is\nfinished and they sent it to keep me company. See? It's an emerald--just\nme color, Lord O'More says.”\n\nFreckles flourished his hand.\n\n“Ain't that fine? Never took so much comfort with anything in me life.\nEvery color of the old swamp is in it. I asked the Angel to have a\nlittle shamrock leaf cut on it, so every time I saw it I'd be thinking\nof the 'love, truth, and valor' of that song she was teaching me. Ain't\nthat a beautiful song? Some of these days I'm going to make it echo. I'm\na little afraid to be doing it with me voice yet, but me heart's tuning\naway on it every blessed hour. Will you be looking at these now?”\n\nFreckles tilted a tray of unset stones from Peacock's that would have\nransomed several valuable kings. He held them toward McLean, stirring\nthem with his right arm.\n\n“I tell you I'm glad to see you, sir” he said. “I tried to tell me uncle\nwhat I wanted, but this ain't for him to be mixed up in, anyway, and I\ndon't think I made it clear to him. I couldn't seem to say the words I\nwanted. I can be telling you, sir.”\n\nMcLean's heart began to thump as a lover's.\n\n“Go on, Freckles,” he said assuringly.\n\n“It's this,” said Freckles. “I told him that I would pay only three\nhundred dollars for the Angel's stone. I'm thinking that with what he\nhas laid up for me, and the bigness of things that the Angel did for me,\nit seems like a stingy little sum to him. I know he thinks I should be\ngiving much more, but I feel as if I just had to be buying that stone\nwith money I earned meself; and that is all I have saved of me wages. I\ndon't mind paying for the muff, or the drexing table, or Mrs. Duncan's\nthings, from that other money, and later the Angel can have every last\ncent of me grandmother's, if she'll take it; but just now--oh, sir,\ncan't you see that I have to be buying this stone with what I have in\nthe bank? I'm feeling that I couldn't do any other way, and don't you\nthink the Angel would rather have the best stone I can buy with the\nmoney I earned meself than a finer one paid for with other money?”\n\n“In other words, Freckles,” said the Boss in a husky voice, “you don't\nwant to buy the Angel's ring with money. You want to give for it\nyour first awful fear of the swamp. You want to pay for it with the\nloneliness and heart hunger you have suffered there, with last winter's\nfreezing on the line and this summer's burning in the sun. You want it\nto stand to her for every hour in which you risked your life to fulfill\nyour contract honorably. You want the price of that stone to be the\nfears that have chilled your heart--the sweat and blood of your body.”\n\nFreckles' eyes were filled with tears and his face quivering with\nfeeling.\n\n“Dear Mr. McLean,” he said, reaching with a caress over the Boss's black\nhair and his cheek. “Dear Boss, that's why I've wanted you so. I knew\nyou would know. Now you will be looking at these? I don't want emeralds,\nbecause that's what she gave me.”\n\nHe pushed the green stones into a little heap of rejected ones. Then he\nsingled out all the pearls.\n\n“Ain't they pretty things?” he said. “I'll be getting her some of those\nlater. They are like lily faces, turtle-head flowers, dewdrops in the\nshade or moonlight; but they haven't the life in them that I want in the\nstone I give to the Angel right now.”\n\nFreckles heaped the pearls with the emeralds. He studied the diamonds a\nlong time.\n\n“These things are so fascinating like they almost tempt one, though they\nain't quite the proper thing,” he said. “I've always dearly loved to be\nwatching yours, sir. I must get her some of these big ones, too, some\nday. They're like the Limberlost in January, when it's all ice-coated,\nand the sun is in the west and shines through and makes all you can see\nof the whole world look like fire and ice; but fire and ice ain't like\nthe Angel.”\n\nThe diamonds joined the emeralds and pearls. There was left a little red\nheap, and Freckles' fingers touched it with a new tenderness. His eyes\nwere flashing.\n\n“I'm thinking here's me Angel's stone,” he exulted. “The Limberlost, and\nme with it, grew in mine; but it's going to bloom, and her with it, in\nthis! There's the red of the wild poppies, the cardinal-flowers, and the\nlittle bunch of crushed foxfire that we found where she put it to save\nme. There's the light of the campfire, and the sun setting over Sleepy\nSnake Creek. There's the red of the blood we were willing to give for\neach other. It's like her lips, and like the drops that dried on her\nbeautiful arm that first day, and I'm thinking it must be like the\nbrave, tender, clean, red heart of her.”\n\nFreckles lifted the ruby to his lips and handed it to McLean.\n\n“I'll be signing me cheque and you have it set,” he said. “I want you to\ndraw me money and pay for it with those very same dollars, sir.”\n\nAgain the heart of McLean took hope.\n\n“Freckles, may I ask you something?” he said.\n\n“Why, sure,” said Freckles. “There's nothing you would be asking that it\nwouldn't be giving me joy to be telling you.”\n\nMcLean's eyes traveled to Freckles' right arm with which he was moving\nthe jewels.\n\n“Oh, that!” cried Freckles with a laugh. “You're wanting to know where\nall the bitterness is gone? Well sir, 'twas carried from me soul, heart,\nand body on the lips of an Angel. Seems that hurt was necessary in the\nbeginning to make today come true. The wound had always been raw, but\nthe Angel was healing it. If she doesn't care, I don't. Me dear new\nfather doesn't, nor me aunt and uncle, and you never did. Why should I\nbe fretting all me life about what can't be helped. The real truth is,\nthat since what happened to it last week, I'm so everlastingly proud of\nit I catch meself sticking it out on display a bit.”\n\nFreckles looked the Boss in the eyes and began to laugh.\n\n“Well thank heaven!” said McLean.\n\n“Now it's me turn,” said Freckles. “I don't know as I ought to be asking\nyou, and yet I can't see a reason good enough to keep me from it. It's\na thing I've had on me mind every hour since I've had time to straighten\nthings out a little. May I be asking you a question?”\n\nMcLean reached over and took Freckles' hand. His voice was shaken with\nfeeling as he replied: “Freckles, you almost hurt me. Will you never\nlearn how much you are to me--how happy you make me in coming to me with\nanything, no matter what?”\n\n“Then it's this,” said Freckles, gripping the hand of McLean strongly.\n“If this accident, and all that's come to me since, had never happened,\nwhere was it you had planned to send me to school? What was it you meant\nfor me to do?”\n\n“Why, Freckles,” answered McLean, “I'm scarcely prepared to state\ndefinitely. My ideas were rather hazy. I thought we would make a\nbeginning and see which way things went. I figured on taking you to\nGrand Rapids first, and putting you in the care of my mother. I had an\nidea it would be best to secure a private tutor to coach you for a\nyear or two, until you were ready to enter Ann Arbor or the Chicago\nUniversity in good shape. Then I thought we'd finish in this country at\nYale or Harvard, and end with Oxford, to get a good, all-round flavor.”\n\n“Is that all?” asked Freckles.\n\n“No; that's leaving the music out,” said McLean. “I intended to have\nyour voice tested by some master, and if you really were endowed for a\ncareer as a great musician, and had inclinations that way, I wished to\nhave you drop some of the college work and make music your chief study.\nFinally, I wanted us to take a trip through Europe and clear around the\ncircle together.”\n\n“And then what?” queried Freckles breathlessly.\n\n“Why, then,” said McLean, “you know that my heart is hopelessly in the\nwoods. I never will quit the timber business while there is timber to\nhandle and breath in my body. I thought if you didn't make a profession\nof music, and had any inclination my way, we would stretch the\npartnership one more and take you into the firm, placing your work with\nme. Those plans may sound jumbled in the telling, but they have grown\nsteadily on me, Freckles, as you have grown dear to me.”\n\nFreckles lifted anxious and eager eyes to McLean.\n\n“You told me once on the trail, and again when we thought that I was\ndying, that you loved me. Do these things that have come to me make any\ndifference in any way with your feeing toward me?”\n\n“None,” said McLean. “How could they, Freckles? Nothing could make me\nlove you more, and you never will do anything that will make me love you\nless.”\n\n“Glory be to God!” cried Freckles. “Glory to the Almighty! Hurry and\nbe telling your mother I'm coming! Just as soon as I can get on me feet\nI'll be taking that ring to me Angel, and then I'll go to Grand Rapids\nand be making me start just as you planned, only that I can be paying me\nown way. When I'm educated enough, we'll all--the Angel and her father,\nthe Bird Woman, you, and me--all of us will go together and see me house\nand me relations and be taking that trip. When we get back, we'll add\nO'More to the Lumber Company, and golly, sir, but we'll make things hum!\nGood land, sir! Don't do that! Why, Mr. McLean, dear Boss, dear father,\ndon't be doing that! What is it?”\n\n“Nothing, nothing!” boomed McLean's deep bass; “nothing at all!”\n\nHe abruptly turned, and hurried to the window.\n\n“This is a mighty fine view,” he said. “Lake's beautiful this morning.\nNo wonder Chicago people are so proud of their city's location on its\nshore. But, Freckles, what is Lord O'More going to say to this?”\n\n“I don't know,” said Freckles. “I am going to be cut deep if he cares,\nfor he's been more than good to me, and Lady Alice is next to me Angel.\nHe's made me feel me blood and race me own possession. She's talked to\nme by the hour of me father and mother and me grandmother. She's made\nthem all that real I can lay claim to them and feel that they are mine.\nI'm very sorry to be hurting them, if it will, but it can't be changed.\nNobody ever puts the width of the ocean between me and the Angel. From\nhere to the Limberlost is all I can be bearing peaceable. I want the\neducation, and then I want to work and live here in the country where I\nwas born, and where the ashes of me father and mother rest.\n\n“I'll be glad to see Ireland, and glad especial to see those little\npeople who are my kin, but I ain't ever staying long. All me heart\nis the Angel's, and the Limberlost is calling every minute. You're\nthinking, sir, that when I look from that window I see the beautiful\nwater, ain't you? I'm not.\n\n“I see soft, slow clouds oozing across the blue, me big black chickens\nhanging up there, and a great feather softly sliding down. I see mighty\ntrees, swinging vines, bright flowers, and always masses of the wild\nroses, with the wild rose face of me Ladybird looking through. I see the\nswale rocking, smell the sweetness of the blooming things, and the damp,\nmucky odor of the swamp; and I hear me birds sing, me squirrels bark,\nthe rattlers hiss, and the step of Wessner or Black Jack coming; and\nwhether it's the things that I loved or the things that I feared, it's\nall a part of the day.\n\n“Me heart's all me Swamp Angel's, and me love is all hers, and I have\nher and the swamp so confused in me mind I never can be separating them.\nWhen I look at her, I see blue sky, the sun rifting through the leaves\nand pink and red flowers; and when I look at the Limberlost I see a pink\nface with blue eyes, gold hair, and red lips, and, it's the truth, sir,\nthey're mixed till they're one to me!\n\n“I'm afraid it will be hurting some, but I have the feeing that I can be\nmaking my dear people understand, so that they will be willing to let\nme come back home. Send Lady O'More to put these flowers God made in the\nplace of these glass-house ilegancies, and please be cutting the string\nof this little package the Angel's sent me.”\n\nAs Freckles held up the package, the lights of the Limberlost flashed\nfrom the emerald on his finger. On the cover was printed: “To the\nLimberlost Guard!” Under it was a big, crisp, iridescent black feather.",
