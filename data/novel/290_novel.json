 "text": "THE STARK MUNRO LETTERS\n\nBy J. Stark Munro\n\n\n     BEING A SERIES OF TWELVE LETTERS\n     WRITTEN BY J. STARK MUNRO, M.B.,\n     TO HIS FRIEND AND FORMER FELLOW-STUDENT,\n     HERBERT SWANBOROUGH,\n     OF LOWELL, MASSACHUSETTS,\n     DURING THE YEARS 1881-1884\n\nEdited And Arranged By A. Conan Doyle\n\n\nThe letters of my friend Mr. Stark Munro appear to me to form so\nconnected a whole, and to give so plain an account of some of the\ntroubles which a young man may be called upon to face right away at the\noutset of his career, that I have handed them over to the gentleman who\nis about to edit them. There are two of them, the fifth and the ninth,\nfrom which some excisions are necessary; but in the main I hope that\nthey may be reproduced as they stand. I am sure that there is no\nprivilege which my friend would value more highly than the thought that\nsome other young man, harassed by the needs of this world and doubts\nof the next, should have gotten strength by reading how a brother had\npassed down the valley of shadow before him.\n\nHERBERT SWANBOROUGH.\n\nLOWELL, MASS.\n\n\n\n\n\nTHE STARK MUNRO LETTERS.\n\n\n\n\nI. HOME. 30th March, 1881.\n\nI have missed you very much since your return to America, my dear\nBertie, for you are the one man upon this earth to whom I have ever been\nable to unreservedly open my whole mind. I don’t know why it is; for,\nnow that I come to think of it, I have never enjoyed very much of your\nconfidence in return. But that may be my fault. Perhaps you don’t find\nme sympathetic, even though I have every wish to be. I can only say that\nI find you intensely so, and perhaps I presume too much upon the fact.\nBut no, every instinct in my nature tells me that I don’t bore you by my\nconfidences.\n\nCan you remember Cullingworth at the University? You never were in the\nathletic set, and so it is possible that you don’t. Anyway, I’ll take it\nfor granted that you don’t, and explain it all from the beginning. I’m\nsure that you would know his photograph, however, for the reason that he\nwas the ugliest and queerest-looking man of our year.\n\nPhysically he was a fine athlete--one of the fastest and most determined\nRugby forwards that I have ever known, though he played so savage a game\nthat he was never given his international cap. He was well-grown, five\nfoot nine perhaps, with square shoulders, an arching chest, and a quick\njerky way of walking. He had a round strong head, bristling with short\nwiry black hair. His face was wonderfully ugly, but it was the ugliness\nof character, which is as attractive as beauty. His jaw and eyebrows\nwere scraggy and rough-hewn, his nose aggressive and red-shot, his eyes\nsmall and near set, light blue in colour, and capable of assuming a\nvery genial and also an exceedingly vindictive expression. A slight wiry\nmoustache covered his upper lip, and his teeth were yellow, strong, and\noverlapping. Add to this that he seldom wore collar or necktie, that his\nthroat was the colour and texture of the bark of a Scotch fir, and that\nhe had a voice and especially a laugh like a bull’s bellow. Then you\nhave some idea (if you can piece all these items in your mind) of the\noutward James Cullingworth.\n\nBut the inner man, after all, was what was most worth noting. I don’t\npretend to know what genius is. Carlyle’s definition always seemed to me\nto be a very crisp and clear statement of what it is NOT. Far from its\nbeing an infinite capacity for taking pains, its leading characteristic,\nas far as I have ever been able to observe it, has been that it allows\nthe possessor of it to attain results by a sort of instinct which other\nmen could only reach by hard work. In this sense Cullingworth was the\ngreatest genius that I have ever known. He never seemed to work, and yet\nhe took the anatomy prize over the heads of all the ten-hour-a-day\nmen. That might not count for much, for he was quite capable of idling\nostentatiously all day and then reading desperately all night; but\nstart a subject of your own for him, and then see his originality and\nstrength. Talk about torpedoes, and he would catch up a pencil, and on\nthe back of an old envelope from his pocket he would sketch out some\nnovel contrivance for piercing a ship’s netting and getting at her side,\nwhich might no doubt involve some technical impossibility, but which\nwould at least be quite plausible and new. Then as he drew, his\nbristling eyebrows would contract, his small eyes would gleam with\nexcitement, his lips would be pressed together, and he would end by\nbanging on the paper with his open hand, and shouting in his exultation.\nYou would think that his one mission in life was to invent torpedoes.\nBut next instant, if you were to express surprise as to how it was that\nthe Egyptian workmen elevated the stones to the top of the pyramids, out\nwould come the pencil and envelope, and he would propound a scheme for\ndoing that with equal energy and conviction. This ingenuity was joined\nto an extremely sanguine nature. As he paced up and down in his jerky\nquick-stepping fashion after one of these flights of invention, he would\ntake out patents for it, receive you as his partner in the enterprise,\nhave it adopted in every civilised country, see all conceivable\napplications of it, count up his probable royalties, sketch out the\nnovel methods in which he would invest his gains, and finally retire\nwith the most gigantic fortune that has ever been amassed. And you would\nbe swept along by his words, and would be carried every foot of the\nway with him, so that it would come as quite a shock to you when you\nsuddenly fell back to earth again, and found yourself trudging the city\nstreet a poor student, with Kirk’s Physiology under your arm, and hardly\nthe price of your luncheon in your pocket.\n\nI read over what I have written, but I can see that I give you no real\ninsight into the demoniac cleverness of Cullingworth. His views upon\nmedicine were most revolutionary, but I daresay that if things fulfil\ntheir promise I may have a good deal to say about them in the sequel.\nWith his brilliant and unusual gifts, his fine athletic record, his\nstrange way of dressing (his hat on the back of his head and his throat\nbare), his thundering voice, and his ugly, powerful face, he had quite\nthe most marked individuality of any man that I have ever known.\n\nNow, you will think me rather prolix about this man; but, as it looks\nas if his life might become entwined with mine, it is a subject of\nimmediate interest to me, and I am writing all this for the purpose\nof reviving my own half-faded impressions, as well as in the hope of\namusing and interesting you. So I must just give you one or two other\npoints which may make his character more clear to you.\n\nHe had a dash of the heroic in him. On one occasion he was placed in\nsuch a position that he must choose between compromising a lady, or\nspringing out of a third-floor window. Without a moment’s hesitation he\nhurled himself out of the window. As luck would have it, he fell through\na large laurel bush on to a garden plot, which was soft with rain, and\nso escaped with a shaking and a bruising. If I have to say anything that\ngives a bad impression of the man, put that upon the other side.\n\nHe was fond of rough horse-play; but it was better to avoid it with him,\nfor you could never tell what it might lead to. His temper was nothing\nless than infernal. I have seen him in the dissecting-rooms begin to\nskylark with a fellow, and then in an instant the fun would go out of\nhis face, his little eyes would gleam with fury, and the two would be\nrolling, worrying each other like dogs, below the table. He would\nbe dragged off, panting and speechless with fury, with his wiry hair\nbristling straight up like a fighting terrier’s.\n\nThis pugnacious side of his character would be worthily used sometimes.\nI remember that an address which was being given to us by an eminent\nLondon specialist was much interrupted by a man in the front row, who\namused himself by interjecting remarks. The lecturer appealed to his\naudience at last. “These interruptions are insufferable, gentlemen,”\n said he; “will no one free me from this annoyance?” “Hold your\ntongue--you, sir, on the front bench,” cried Cullingworth, in his\nbull’s bellow. “Perhaps you’ll make me,” said the fellow, turning a\ncontemptuous face over his shoulder. Cullingworth closed his note-book,\nand began to walk down on the tops of the desks to the delight of the\nthree hundred spectators. It was fine to see the deliberate way in which\nhe picked his way among the ink bottles. As he sprang down from the last\nbench on to the floor, his opponent struck him a smashing blow full in\nthe face. Cullingworth got his bulldog grip on him, however, and rushed\nhim backwards out of the class-room. What he did with him I don’t know,\nbut there was a noise like the delivery of a ton of coals; and the\nchampion of law and order returned, with the sedate air of a man who had\ndone his work. One of his eyes looked like an over-ripe damson, but we\ngave him three cheers as he made his way back to his seat. Then we went\non with the dangers of Placenta Praevia.\n\nHe was not a man who drank hard, but a little drink would have a very\ngreat effect upon him. Then it was that the ideas would surge from his\nbrain, each more fantastic and ingenious than the last. And if ever\nhe did get beyond the borderland he would do the most amazing things.\nSometimes it was the fighting instinct that would possess him,\nsometimes the preaching, and sometimes the comic, or they might come\nin succession, replacing each other so rapidly as to bewilder his\ncompanions. Intoxication brought all kinds of queer little peculiarities\nwith it. One of them was that he could walk or run perfectly straight,\nbut that there always came a time when he unconsciously returned upon\nhis tracks and retraced his steps again. This had a strange effect\nsometimes, as in the instance which I am about to tell you.\n\nVery sober to outward seeming, but in a frenzy within, he went down to\nthe station one night, and, stooping to the pigeon-hole, he asked the\nticket-clerk, in the suavest voice, whether he could tell him how far\nit was to London. The official put forward his face to reply when\nCullingworth drove his fist through the little hole with the force of a\npiston. The clerk flew backwards off his stool, and his yell of pain and\nindignation brought some police and railway men to his assistance.\nThey pursued Cullingworth; but he, as active and as fit as a greyhound,\noutraced them all, and vanished into the darkness, down the long,\nstraight street. The pursuers had stopped, and were gathered in a knot\ntalking the matter over, when, looking up, they saw, to their amazement,\nthe man whom they were after, running at the top of his speed in their\ndirection. His little peculiarity had asserted itself, you see, and\nhe had unconsciously turned in his flight. They tripped him up, flung\nthemselves upon him, and after a long and desperate struggle dragged\nhim to the police station. He was charged before the magistrate next\nmorning, but made such a brilliant speech from the dock in his own\ndefence that he carried the Court with him, and escaped with a nominal\nfine. At his invitation, the witnesses and the police trooped after\nhim to the nearest hotel, and the affair ended in universal\nwhisky-and-sodas.\n\nWell, now, if, after all these illustrations, I have failed to give\nyou some notion of the man, able, magnetic, unscrupulous, interesting,\nmany-sided, I must despair of ever doing so. I’ll suppose, however, that\nI have not failed; and I will proceed to tell you, my most patient of\nconfidants, something of my personal relations with Cullingworth.\n\nWhen I first made a casual acquaintance with him he was a bachelor. At\nthe end of a long vacation, however, he met me in the street, and told\nme, in his loud-voiced volcanic shoulder-slapping way, that he had just\nbeen married. At his invitation, I went up with him then and there to\nsee his wife; and as we walked he told me the history of his wedding,\nwhich was as extraordinary as everything else he did. I won’t tell it\nto you here, my dear Bertie, for I feel that I have dived down too many\nside streets already; but it was a most bustling business, in which the\nlocking of a governess into her room and the dyeing of Cullingworth’s\nhair played prominent parts. Apropos of the latter he was never quite\nable to get rid of its traces; and from this time forward there was\nadded to his other peculiarities the fact that when the sunlight\nstruck upon his hair at certain angles, it turned it all iridescent and\nshimmering.\n\nWell, I went up to his lodgings with him, and was introduced to Mrs.\nCullingworth. She was a timid, little, sweet-faced, grey-eyed woman,\nquiet-voiced and gentle-mannered. You had only to see the way in which\nshe looked at him to understand that she was absolutely under his\ncontrol, and that do what he might, or say what he might, it would\nalways be the best thing to her. She could be obstinate, too, in a\ngentle, dove-like sort of way; but her obstinacy lay always in the\ndirection of backing up his sayings and doings. This, however, I was\nonly to find out afterwards; and at that, my first visit, she impressed\nme as being one of the sweetest little women that I had ever known.\n\nThey were living in the most singular style, in a suite of four\nsmall rooms, over a grocer’s shop. There was a kitchen, a bedroom,\na sitting-room, and a fourth room, which Cullingworth insisted upon\nregarding as a most unhealthy apartment and a focus of disease, though\nI am convinced that it was nothing more than the smell of cheeses from\nbelow which had given him the idea. At any rate, with his usual energy\nhe had not only locked the room up, but had gummed varnished paper over\nall the cracks of the door, to prevent the imaginary contagion from\nspreading. The furniture was the sparest possible. There were, I\nremember, only two chairs in the sitting-room; so that when a guest came\n(and I think I was the only one) Cullingworth used to squat upon a pile\nof yearly volumes of the British Medical Journal in the corner. I can\nsee him now levering himself up from his lowly seat, and striding about\nthe room roaring and striking with his hands, while his little wife\nsat mum in the corner, listening to him with love and admiration in her\neyes. What did we care, any one of the three of us, where we sat or how\nwe lived, when youth throbbed hot in our veins, and our souls were all\naflame with the possibilities of life? I still look upon those Bohemian\nevenings, in the bare room amid the smell of the cheese, as being among\nthe happiest that I have known.\n\nI was a frequent visitor to the Cullingworths, for the pleasure that I\ngot was made the sweeter by the pleasure which I hoped that I gave. They\nknew no one, and desired to know no one; so that socially I seemed to be\nthe only link that bound them to the world. I even ventured to interfere\nin the details of their little menage. Cullingworth had a fad at the\ntime, that all the diseases of civilisation were due to the abandonment\nof the open-air life of our ancestors, and as a corollary he kept his\nwindows open day and night. As his wife was obviously fragile, and yet\nwould have died before she would have uttered a word of complaint, I\ntook it upon myself to point out to him that the cough from which she\nsuffered was hardly to be cured so long as she spent her life in a\ndraught. He scowled savagely at me for my interference; and I thought\nwe were on the verge of a quarrel, but it blew over, and he became more\nconsiderate in the matter of ventilation.\n\nOur evening occupations just about that time were of a most\nextraordinary character. You are aware that there is a substance, called\nwaxy matter, which is deposited in the tissues of the body during the\ncourse of certain diseases. What this may be and how it is formed has\nbeen a cause for much bickering among pathologists. Cullingworth had\nstrong views upon the subject, holding that the waxy matter was really\nthe same thing as the glycogen which is normally secreted by the liver.\nBut it is one thing to have an idea, and another to be able to prove\nit. Above all, we wanted some waxy matter with which to experiment. But\nfortune favoured us in the most magical way. The Professor of Pathology\nhad come into possession of a magnificent specimen of the condition.\nWith pride he exhibited the organ to us in the class-room before\nordering his assistant to remove it to the ice-chest, preparatory to its\nbeing used for microscopical work in the practical class. Cullingworth\nsaw his chance, and acted on the instant. Slipping out of the classroom,\nhe threw open the ice-chest, rolled his ulster round the dreadful\nglistening mass, closed the chest again, and walked quietly away. I have\nno doubt that to this day the disappearance of that waxy liver is one of\nthe most inexplicable mysteries in the career of our Professor.\n\nThat evening, and for many evenings to come, we worked upon our liver.\nFor our experiments it was necessary to subject it all to great heat\nin an endeavour to separate the nitrogenous cellular substance from the\nnon-nitrogenous waxy matter. With our limited appliances the only way\nwe could think of was to cut it into fine pieces and cook it in a frying\npan. So night after night the curious spectacle might have been seen of\na beautiful young woman and two very earnest young men busily engaged in\nmaking these grim fricassees. Nothing came of all our work; for though\nCullingworth considered that he had absolutely established his case, and\nwrote long screeds to the medical papers upon the subject, he was never\napt at stating his views with his pen, and he left, I am sure, a very\nconfused idea on the minds of his readers as to what it was that he was\ndriving at. Again, as he was a mere student without any letters after\nhis name, he got scant attention, and I never heard that he gained over\na single supporter.\n\nAt the end of the year we both passed our examinations and became duly\nqualified medical men. The Cullingworths vanished away, and I never\nheard any more of them, for he was a man who prided himself upon never\nwriting a letter. His father had formerly a very large and lucrative\npractice in the West of Scotland, but he died some years ago. I had a\nvague idea, founded upon some chance remark of his, that Cullingworth\nhad gone to see whether the family name might still stand him in good\nstead there. As for me I began, as you will remember that I explained\nin my last, by acting as assistant in my father’s practice. You know,\nhowever, that at its best it is not worth more than L700 a year, with no\nroom for expansion. This is not large enough to keep two of us at work.\nThen, again, there are times when I can see that my religious opinions\nannoy the dear old man. On the whole, and for every reason, I think\nthat it would be better if I were out of this. I applied for several\nsteamship lines, and for at least a dozen house surgeonships; but there\nis as much competition for a miserable post with a hundred a year as\nif it were the Viceroyship of India. As a rule, I simply get my\ntestimonials returned without any comment, which is the sort of thing\nthat teaches a man humility. Of course, it is very pleasant to live with\nthe mater, and my little brother Paul is a regular trump. I am teaching\nhim boxing; and you should see him put his tiny fists up, and counter\nwith his right. He got me under the jaw this evening, and I had to ask\nfor poached eggs for supper.\n\nAnd all this brings me up to the present time and the latest news. It is\nthat I had a telegram from Cullingworth this morning--after nine months’\nsilence. It was dated from Avonmouth, the town where I had suspected\nthat he had settled, and it said simply, “Come at once. I have urgent\nneed of you. CULLINGWORTH.” Of course, I shall go by the first train\nto-morrow. It may mean anything or nothing. In my heart of hearts I hope\nand believe that old Cullingworth sees an opening for me either as his\npartner or in some other way. I always believed that he would turn up\ntrumps, and make my fortune as well as his own. He knows that if I am\nnot very quick or brilliant I am fairly steady and reliable. So that’s\nwhat I’ve been working up to all along, Bertie, that to-morrow I go to\njoin Cullingworth, and that it looks as if there was to be an opening\nfor me at last. I gave you a sketch of him and his ways, so that you may\ntake an interest in the development of my fortune, which you could not\ndo if you did not know something of the man who is holding out his hand\nto me.\n\nYesterday was my birthday, and I was two and twenty years of age.\nFor two and twenty years have I swung around the sun. And in all\nseriousness, without a touch of levity, and from the bottom of my soul,\nI assure you that I have at the present moment the very vaguest idea as\nto whence I have come from, whither I am going, or what I am here for.\nIt is not for want of inquiry, or from indifference. I have mastered\nthe principles of several religions. They have all shocked me by the\nviolence which I should have to do to my reason to accept the dogmas of\nany one of them. Their ethics are usually excellent. So are the ethics\nof the common law of England. But the scheme of creation upon which\nthose ethics are built! Well, it really is to me the most astonishing\nthing that I have seen in my short earthly pilgrimage, that so many\nable men, deep philosophers, astute lawyers, and clear-headed men of\nthe world should accept such an explanation of the facts of life. In the\nface of their apparent concurrence my own poor little opinion would not\ndare to do more than lurk at the back of my soul, were it not that\nI take courage when I reflect that the equally eminent lawyers and\nphilosophers of Rome and Greece were all agreed that Jupiter had\nnumerous wives and was fond of a glass of good wine.\n\nMind, my dear Bertie, I do not wish to run down your view or that of any\nother man. We who claim toleration should be the first to extend it\nto others. I am only indicating my own position, as I have often done\nbefore. And I know your reply so well. Can’t I hear your grave voice\nsaying “Have faith!” Your conscience allows you to. Well, mine won’t\nallow me. I see so clearly that faith is not a virtue, but a vice. It is\na goat which has been herded with the sheep. If a man deliberately shut\nhis physical eyes and refused to use them, you would be as quick as any\none in seeing that it was immoral and a treason to Nature. And yet you\nwould counsel a man to shut that far more precious gift, the reason, and\nto refuse to use it in the most intimate question of life.\n\n“The reason cannot help in such a matter,” you reply. I answer that to\nsay so is to give up a battle before it is fought. My reason SHALL help\nme, and when it can help no longer I shall do without help.\n\nIt’s late, Bertie, and the fire’s out, and I’m shivering; and you, I’m\nvery sure, are heartily weary of my gossip and my heresies, so adieu\nuntil my next.\n\n\n\n\nII. HOME, 10th April, 1881.\n\nWell, my dear Bertie, here I am again in your postbox. It’s not a\nfortnight since I wrote you that great long letter, and yet you see I\nhave news enough to make another formidable budget. They say that the\nart of letter-writing has been lost; but if quantity may atone for\nquality, you must confess that (for your sins) you have a friend who has\nretained it.\n\nWhen I wrote to you last I was on the eve of going down to join the\nCullingworths at Avonmouth, with every hope that he had found some\nopening for me. I must tell you at some length the particulars of that\nexpedition.\n\nI travelled down part of the way with young Leslie Duncan, whom I think\nyou know. He was gracious enough to consider that a third-class carriage\nand my company were to be preferred to a first class with solitude. You\nknow that he came into his uncle’s money a little time ago, and after a\nfirst delirious outbreak, he has now relapsed into that dead heavy state\nof despair which is caused by having everything which one can wish for.\nHow absurd are the ambitions of life when I think that I, who am fairly\nhappy and as keen as a razor edge, should be struggling for that which\nI can see has brought neither profit nor happiness to him! And yet, if I\ncan read my own nature, it is not the accumulation of money which is my\nreal aim, but only that I may acquire so much as will relieve my mind\nof sordid cares and enable me to develop any gifts which I may have,\nundisturbed. My tastes are so simple that I cannot imagine any advantage\nwhich wealth can give--save indeed the exquisite pleasure of helping a\ngood man or a good cause. Why should people ever take credit for charity\nwhen they must know that they cannot gain as much pleasure out of their\nguineas in any other fashion? I gave my watch to a broken schoolmaster\nthe other day (having no change in my pocket), and the mater could not\nquite determine whether it was a trait of madness or of nobility. I\ncould have told her with absolute confidence that it was neither the one\nnor the other, but a sort of epicurean selfishness with perhaps a little\ndash of swagger away down at the bottom of it. What had I ever had from\nmy chronometer like the quiet thrill of satisfaction when the fellow\nbrought me the pawn ticket and told me that the thirty shillings had\nbeen useful?\n\nLeslie Duncan got out at Carstairs, and I was left alone with a hale,\nwhite-haired, old Roman Catholic priest, who had sat quietly reading his\noffice in the corner. We fell into the most intimate talk, which lasted\nall the way to Avonmouth--indeed, so interested was I that I very nearly\npassed through the place without knowing it. Father Logan (for that was\nhis name) seemed to me to be a beautiful type of what a priest should\nbe--self-sacrificing and pure-minded, with a kind of simple cunning\nabout him, and a deal of innocent fun. He had the defects as well as the\nvirtues of his class, for he was absolutely reactionary in his views.\nWe discussed religion with fervour, and his theology was somewhere\nabout the Early Pliocene. He might have chattered the matter over with\na priest of Charlemagne’s Court, and they would have shaken hands after\nevery sentence. He would acknowledge this and claim it as a merit.\nIt was consistency in his eyes. If our astronomers and inventors and\nlaw-givers had been equally consistent where would modern civilisation\nbe? Is religion the only domain of thought which is non-progressive, and\nto be referred for ever to a standard set two thousand years ago?\nCan they not see that as the human brain evolves it must take a wider\noutlook? A half-formed brain makes a half-formed God, and who shall say\nthat our brains are even half-formed yet? The truly inspired priest is\nthe man or woman with the big brain. It is not the shaven patch on the\noutside, but it is the sixty ounces within which is the real mark of\nelection.\n\nYou know that you are turning up your nose at me, Bertie. I can see you\ndo it. But I’ll come off the thin ice, and you shall have nothing but\nfacts now. I’m afraid that I should never do for a story-teller, for the\nfirst stray character that comes along puts his arm in mine and walks me\noff, with my poor story straggling away to nothing behind me.\n\nWell, then, it was night when we reached Avonmouth, and as I popped my\nhead out of the carriage window, the first thing that my eyes rested\nupon was old Cullingworth, standing in, the circle of light under a\ngas-lamp. His frock coat was flying open, his waistcoat unbuttoned at\nthe top, and his hat (a top hat this time) jammed on the back of his\nhead, with his bristling hair spurting out in front of it. In every way,\nsave that he wore a collar, he was the same Cullingworth as ever.\nHe gave a roar of recognition when he saw me, bustled me out of my\ncarriage, seized my carpet bag, or grip-sack as you used to call it, and\na minute later we were striding along together through the streets.\n\nI was, as you may imagine, all in a tingle to know what it was that he\nwanted with me. However, as he made no allusion to it, I did not care to\nask, and, during our longish walk, we talked about indifferent matters.\nIt was football first, I remember, whether Richmond had a chance against\nBlackheath, and the way in which the new passing game was shredding the\nold scrimmages. Then he got on to inventions, and became so excited that\nhe had to give me back my bag in order that he might be able to slap all\nhis points home with his fist upon his palm. I can see him now stopping,\nwith his face leaning forward and his yellow tusks gleaming in the\nlamplight.\n\n“My dear Munro” (this was the style of the thing), “why was armour\nabandoned, eh? What! I’ll tell you why. It was because the weight of\nmetal that would protect a man who was standing up was more than he\ncould carry. But battles are not fought now-a-days by men who are\nstanding up. Your infantry are all lying on their stomachs, and it would\ntake very little to protect them. And steel has improved, Munro! Chilled\nsteel! Bessemer! Bessemer! Very good. How much to cover a man? Fourteen\ninches by twelve, meeting at an angle so that the bullet will glance.\nA notch at one side for the rifle. There you have it, laddie--the\nCullingworth patent portable bullet-proof shield! Weight? Oh, the weight\nwould be sixteen pounds. I worked it out. Each company carries its\nshields in go-carts, and they are served out on going into action. Give\nme twenty thousand good shots, and I’ll go in at Calais and come out at\nPekin. Think of it, my boy! the moral effect. One side gets home every\ntime and the other plasters its bullets up against steel plates. No\ntroops would stand it. The nation that gets it first will pitchfork the\nrest of Europe over the edge. They’re bound to have it--all of them.\nLet’s reckon it out. There’s about eight million of them on a war\nfooting. Let us suppose that only half of them have it. I say only half,\nbecause I don’t want to be too sanguine. That’s four million, and I\nshould take a royalty of four shillings on wholesale orders. What’s\nthat, Munro? About three-quarters of a million sterling, eh? How’s that,\nladdie, eh? What?”\n\nReally, that is not unlike his style of talk, now that I come to read it\nover, only you miss the queer stops, the sudden confidential whispers,\nthe roar with which he triumphantly answered his own questions, the\nshrugs and slaps, and gesticulations. But not a word all the time as to\nwhat it was that made him send me that urgent wire which brought me to\nAvonmouth.\n\nI had, of course, been puzzling in my mind as to whether he had\nsucceeded or not, though from his cheerful appearance and buoyant talk,\nit was tolerably clear to me that all was well with him. I was, however,\nsurprised when, as we walked along a quiet, curving avenue, with great\nhouses standing in their own grounds upon either side, he stopped and\nturned in through the iron gate which led up to one of the finest of\nthem. The moon had broken out and shone upon the high-peaked roof,\nand upon the gables at each corner. When he knocked it was opened by\na footman with red plush knee-breeches. I began to perceive that my\nfriend’s success must have been something colossal.\n\nWhen we came down to the dining-room for supper, Mrs. Cullingworth was\nwaiting there to greet me. I was sorry to see that she was pale and\nweary-looking. However, we had a merry meal in the old style, and her\nhusband’s animation reflected itself upon her face, until at last we\nmight have been back in the little room, where the Medical Journals\nserved as a chair, instead of in the great oak-furnished, picture-hung\nchamber to which we had been promoted. All the time, however, not one\nword as to the object of my journey.\n\nWhen the supper was finished, Cullingworth led the way into a small\nsitting-room, where we both lit our pipes, and Mrs. Cullingworth her\ncigarette. He sat for some little time in silence, and then bounding up\nrushed to the door and flung it open. It is always one of his strange\npeculiarities to think that people are eavesdropping or conspiring\nagainst him; for, in spite of his superficial brusqueness and frankness,\na strange vein of suspicion runs through his singular and complex\nnature. Having satisfied himself now that there were no spies or\nlisteners he threw himself down into his armchair.\n\n“Munro,” said he, prodding at me with his pipe, “what I wanted to tell\nyou is, that I am utterly, hopelessly, and irretrievably ruined.”\n\nMy chair was tilted on its back legs as he spoke, and I assure you that\nI was within an ace of going over. Down like a pack of cards came all my\ndreams as to the grand results which were to spring from my journey to\nAvonmouth. Yes, Bertie, I am bound to confess it: my first thought was\nof my own disappointment, and my second of the misfortune of my friends.\nHe had the most diabolical intuitions, or I a very tell-tale face, for\nhe added at once--\n\n“Sorry to disappoint you, my boy. That’s not what you expected to hear,\nI can see.”\n\n“Well,” I stammered, “it IS rather a surprise, old chap. I thought from\nthe... from the...”\n\n\n“From the house, and the footman, and the furniture,” said he. “Well,\nthey’ve eaten me up among them... licked me clean, bones and gravy. I’m\ndone for, my boy, unless...”--here I saw a question in his eyes--“unless\nsome friend were to lend me his name on a bit of stamped paper.”\n\n“I can’t do it, Cullingworth,” said I. “It’s a wretched thing to have to\nrefuse a friend; and if I had money...”\n\n“Wait till you’re asked, Munro,” he interrupted, with his ugliest\nof expressions. “Besides, as you have nothing and no prospects, what\nearthly use would YOUR name on a paper be?”\n\n“That’s what I want to know,” said I, feeling a little mortified, none\nthe less.\n\n“Look here, laddie,” he went on; “d’you see that pile of letters on the\nleft of the table?”\n\n“Yes.”\n\n“Those are duns. And d’you see those documents on the right? Well, those\nare County Court summonses. And, now, d’you see that;” he picked up a\nlittle ledger, and showed me three or, four names scribbled on the first\npage.\n\n“That’s the practice,” he roared, and laughed until the great veins\njumped out on his forehead. His wife laughed heartily also, just as she\nwould have wept, had he been so disposed.\n\n“It’s this way, Munro,” said he, when he had got over his paroxysm. “You\nhave probably heard--in fact, I have told you myself--that my father had\nthe finest practice in Scotland. As far as I could judge he was a man of\nno capacity, but still there you are--he had it.”\n\nI nodded and smoked.\n\n“Well, he’s been dead seven years, and fifty nets dipping into his\nlittle fish-pond. However, when I passed I thought my best move was to\ncome down to the old place, and see whether I couldn’t piece the thing\ntogether again. The name ought to be worth something, I thought. But it\nwas no use doing the thing in a half hearted way. Not a bit of use in\nthat, Munro. The kind of people who came to him were wealthy, and must\nsee a fine house and a man in livery. What chance was there of gathering\nthem into a bow-windowed forty pound-a-year house with a grubby-faced\nmaid at the door? What do you suppose I did? My boy, I took the\ngovernor’s old house, that was unlet--the very house that he kept up at\nfive thousand a year. Off I started in rare style, and sank my last cent\nin furniture. But it’s no use, laddie. I can’t hold on any longer. I\ngot two accidents and an epileptic--twenty-two pounds, eight and\nsixpence--that’s the lot!\n\n“What will you do, then?”\n\n“That’s what I wanted your advice about. That’s why I wired for you. I\nalways respected your opinion, my boy, and I thought that now was the\ntime to have it.”\n\nIt struck me that if he had asked for it nine months before there would\nhave been more sense in it. What on earth could I do when affairs were\nin such a tangle? However, I could not help feeling complimented when so\nindependent a fellow as Cullingworth turned to me in this way.\n\n“You really think,” said I, “that it is no use holding on here?”\n\nHe jumped up, and began pacing the room in his swift jerky way.\n\n“You take warning from it, Munro,” said he. “You’ve got to start yet.\nTake my tip, and go where no one knows you. People will trust a stranger\nquick enough; but if they can remember you as a little chap who ran\nabout in knickerbockers, and got spanked with a hair brush for stealing\nplums, they are not going to put their lives in your keeping. It’s all\nvery well to talk about friendship and family connections; but when a\nman has a pain in the stomach he doesn’t care a toss about all that. I’d\nstick it up in gold, letters in every medical class-room--have it carved\nacross the gate of the University--that if a man wants friends be\nmust go among strangers. It’s all up here, Munro; so there’s no use in\nadvising me to hold on.”\n\nI asked him how much he owed. It came to about seven hundred pounds.\nThe rent alone was two hundred. He had already raised money on the\nfurniture, and his whole assets came to less than a tenner. Of course,\nthere was only one possible thing that I could advise.\n\n“You must call your creditors together,” said I; “they can see for\nthemselves that you are young and energetic--sure to succeed sooner or\nlater. If they push you into a corner now, they can get nothing. Make\nthat clear to them. But if you make a fresh start elsewhere and succeed,\nyou may pay them all in full. I see no other possible way out of it.”\n\n“I knew that you’d say that, and it’s just what I thought myself. Isn’t\nit, Hetty? Well, then, that settles it; and I am much obliged to you for\nyour advice, and that’s all we’ll say about the matter to-night. I’ve\nmade my shot and missed. Next time I shall hit, and it won’t be long\neither.”\n\nHis failure did not seem to weigh very heavily on his mind, for in a few\nminutes he was shouting away as lustily as ever. Whiskey and hot water\nwere brought in, that we might all drink luck to the second venture.\n\nAnd this whiskey led us to what might have been a troublesome affair.\nCullingworth, who had drunk off a couple of glasses, waited until his\nwife had left the room, and then began to talk of the difficulty of\ngetting any exercise now that he had to wait in all day in the hope of\npatients. This led us round to the ways in which a man might take his\nexercise indoors, and that to boxing. Cullingworth took a couple of\npairs of gloves out of a cupboard, and proposed that we should fight a\nround or two then and there.\n\nIf I hadn’t been a fool, Bertie, I should never have consented. It’s\none of my many weaknesses, that, whether it’s a woman or a man, anything\nlike a challenge sets me off. But I knew Cullingworth’s ways, and I told\nyou in my last what a lamb of a temper he has. None the less, we pushed\nback the table, put the lamp on a high bracket, and stood up to one\nanother.\n\nThe moment I looked him in the face I smelled mischief. He had a gleam\nof settled malice in his eye. I believe it was my refusal to back his\npaper which was running in his head. Anyway he looked as dangerous as he\ncould look, with his scowling face sunk forward a little, his hands\ndown near his hips (for his boxing, like everything else about him, is\nunconventional), and his jaw set like a rat-trap.\n\nI led off, and then in he came hitting with both hands, and grunting\nlike a pig at every blow. From what I could see of him he was no boxer\nat all, but just a formidable rough and tumble fighter. I was guarding\nwith both hands for half a minute, and then was rushed clean off my legs\nand banged up against the door, with my head nearly through one of the\npanels. He wouldn’t stop then, though he saw that I had no space to get\nmy elbows back; and he let fly a right-hander which would have put me\ninto the hall, if I hadn’t slipped it and got back to the middle of the\nroom.\n\n“Look here, Cullingworth,” said I; “there’s not much boxing about this\ngame.”\n\n“Yes, I hit pretty hard, don’t I?”\n\n“If you come boring into me like that, I’m bound to hit you out again,”\n I said. “I want to play light if you’ll let me.”\n\nThe words were not out of my mouth before he was on me like a flash. I\nslipped him again; but the room was so small, and he as active as a cat,\nthat there was no getting away from him. He was on me once more with\na regular football rush that knocked me off my balance. Before I knew\nwhere I was he got his left on the mark and his right on my ear. I\ntripped over a footstool, and then before I could get my balance he had\nme on the same ear again, and my head was singing like a tea-kettle.\nHe was as pleased as possible with himself, blowing out his chest and\nslapping it with his palms as he took his place in the middle of the\nroom.\n\n“Say when you’ve had enough, Munro,” said he.\n\nThis was pretty stiff, considering that I had two inches the better of\nhim in height, and as many stone in weight, besides being the better\nboxer. His energy and the size of the room had been against me so far,\nbut he wasn’t to have all the slogging to himself in the next round if I\ncould help it.\n\nIn he came with one of his windmill rushes. But I was on the look-out\nfor him this time. I landed him with my left a regular nose-ender as he\ncame, and then, ducking under his left, I got him a cross-counter on\nthe jaw that laid him flat across his own hearthrug. He was up in an\ninstant, with a face like a madman.\n\n“You swine!” he shouted. “Take those gloves off, and put your hands up!”\n He was tugging at his own to get them off.\n\n“Go on, you silly ass!” said I. “What is there to fight about?”\n\nHe was mad with passion, and chucked his gloves down under the table.\n\n“By God, Munro,” he cried, “if you don’t take those gloves off, I’ll go\nfor you, whether you have them on or not.”\n\n“Have a glass of soda water,” said I.\n\nHe made a crack at me. “You’re afraid of me, Munro. That’s what’s the\nmatter with you,” he snarled.\n\nThis was getting too hot, Bertie. I saw all the folly of the thing. I\nbelieved that I might whip him; but at the same time I knew that we were\nso much of a match that we would both get pretty badly cut up without\nany possible object to serve. For all that, I took my gloves off, and I\nthink perhaps it was the wisest course after all. If Cullingworth\nonce thought he had the whiphand of you, you might be sorry for it\nafterwards.\n\nBut, as fate would have it, our little barney was nipped in the bud.\nMrs. Cullingworth came into the room at that instant, and screamed out\nwhen she saw her husband. His nose was bleeding and his chin was all\nslobbered with blood, so that I don’t wonder that it gave her a turn.\n\n“James!” she screamed; and then to me: “What is the meaning of this,\nMr. Munro?”\n\nYou should have seen the hatred in her dove’s eyes. I felt an insane\nimpulse to pick her up and kiss her.\n\n“We’ve only been having a little spar, Mrs. Cullingworth,” said I. “Your\nhusband was complaining that he never got any exercise.”\n\n“It’s all right, Hetty,” said he, pulling his coat on again. “Don’t be a\nlittle stupid. Are the servants gone to bed? Well, you might bring some\nwater in a basin from the kitchen. Sit down, Munro, and light your pipe\nagain. I have a hundred things that I want to talk to you about.”\n\nSo that was the end of it, and all went smoothly for the rest of the\nevening. But, for all that, the little wife will always look upon me\nas a brute and a bully; while as to Cullingworth----well, it’s rather\ndifficult to say what Cullingworth thinks about the matter.\n\nWhen I woke next morning he was in my room, and a funny-looking object\nhe was. His dressing-gown lay on a chair, and he was putting up a\nfifty-six pound dumb-bell, without a rag to cover him. Nature didn’t\ngive him a very symmetrical face, nor the sweetest of expressions; but\nhe has a figure like a Greek statue. I was amused to see that both his\neyes had a touch of shadow to them. It was his turn to grin when I\nsat up and found that my ear was about the shape and consistence of a\ntoadstool. However, he was all for peace that morning, and chatted away\nin the most amiable manner possible.\n\nI was to go back to my father’s that day, but I had a couple of hours\nwith Cullingworth in his consulting room before I left. He was in his\nbest form, and full of a hundred fantastic schemes, by which I was to\nhelp him. His great object was to get his name into the newspapers. That\nwas the basis of all success, according to his views. It seemed to\nme that he was confounding cause with effect; but I did not argue the\npoint. I laughed until my sides ached over the grotesque suggestions\nwhich poured from him. I was to lie senseless in the roadway, and to be\ncarried into him by a sympathising crowd, while the footman ran with a\nparagraph to the newspapers. But there was the likelihood that the\ncrowd might carry me in to the rival practitioner opposite. In various\ndisguises I was to feign fits at his very door, and so furnish fresh\ncopy for the local press. Then I was to die--absolutely to expire--and\nall Scotland was to resound with how Dr. Cullingworth, of Avonmouth, had\nresuscitated me. His ingenious brain rang a thousand changes out of\nthe idea, and his own impending bankruptcy was crowded right out of his\nthoughts by the flood of half-serious devices.\n\nBut the thing that took the fun out of him, and made him gnash his\nteeth, and stride cursing about the room, was to see a patient walking\nup the steps which led to the door of Scarsdale, his opposite neighbour.\nScarsdale had a fairly busy practice, and received his people at home\nfrom ten to twelve, so that I got quite used to seeing Cullingworth fly\nout of his chair, and rush raving to the window. He would diagnose\nthe cases, too, and estimate their money value until he was hardly\narticulate.\n\n“There you are!” he would suddenly yell; “see that man with a limp!\nEvery morning he goes. Displaced semilunar cartilage, and a three\nmonths’ job. The man’s worth thirty-five shillings a week. And there!\nI’m hanged if the woman with the rheumatic arthritis isn’t round in\nher bath-chair again. She’s all sealskin and lactic acid. It’s simply\nsickening to see how they crowd to that man. And such a man! You haven’t\nseen him. All the better for you. I don’t know what the devil you are\nlaughing at, Munro. I can’t see where the fun comes in myself.”\n\nWell, it was a short experience that visit to Avonmouth, but I think\nthat I shall remember it all my life. Goodness knows, you must be sick\nenough of the subject, but when I started with so much detail I was\ntempted to go. It ended by my going back again in the afternoon,\nCullingworth assuring me that he would call his creditors together as\nI had advised, and that he would let me know the result in a few days.\nMrs. C. would hardly shake hands with me when I said goodbye; but I like\nher the better for that. He must have a great deal of good in him, or he\ncould not have won her love and confidence so completely. Perhaps there\nis another Cullingworth behind the scenes--a softer, tenderer man, who\ncan love and invite love. If there is, I have never got near him. And\nyet I may only have been tapping at the shell. Who knows? For that\nmatter, it is likely enough that he has never got at the real Johnnie\nMunro. But you have, Bertie; and I think that you’ve had a little too\nmuch of him this time, only you encourage me to this sort of excess by\nyour sympathetic replies. Well, I’ve done as much as the General Post\nOffice will carry for fivepence, so I’ll conclude by merely remarking\nthat a fortnight has passed, and that I have had no news from Avonmouth,\nwhich does not in the very slightest degree surprise me. If I ever do\nhear anything, which is exceedingly doubtful, you may be sure that I\nwill put a finish to this long story.\n\n\n\n\nIII. HOME, 15th October, 1881.\n\n\nWithout any figure of speech I feel quite ashamed when I think of you,\nBertie. I send you one or two enormously long letters, burdened, as far\nas I can remember them, with all sorts of useless detail. Then, in spite\nof your kindly answers and your sympathy, which I have done so little to\ndeserve, I drop you completely for more than six months. By this J pen\nI swear that it shall not happen again; and this letter may serve to\nbridge the gap and to bring you up to date in my poor affairs, in which,\nof all outer mankind, you alone take an interest.\n\nTo commence with what is of most moment, you may rest assured that what\nyou said in your last letter about religion has had my most earnest\nattention. I am sorry that I have not got it by me to refer to (I\nlent it to Charlie), but I think I have the contents in my head. It is\nnotorious, as you say, that an unbeliever may be as bigoted as any of\nthe orthodox, and that a man may be very dogmatic in his opposition to\ndogma. Such men are the real enemies of free thought. If anything could\npersuade me to turn traitor to my reason, it would, for example, be\nthe blasphemous and foolish pictures displayed in some of the agnostic\njournals.\n\nBut every movement has its crowd of camp followers, who straggle and\nscatter. We are like a comet, bright at the head but tailing away into\nmere gas behind. However, every man may speak for himself, and I do\nnot feel that your charge comes home to me. I am only bigoted against\nbigotry, and that I hold to be as legitimate as violence to the violent.\nWhen one considers what effect the perversion of the religious instinct\nhas had during the history of the world; the bitter wars, Christian and\nMahomedan, Catholic and Protestant; the persecutions, the torturings,\nthe domestic hatreds, the petty spites, with ALL creeds equally\nblood-guilty, one cannot but be amazed that the concurrent voice of\nmankind has not placed bigotry at the very head of the deadly sins.\nIt is surely a truism to say that neither smallpox nor the plague have\nbrought the same misery upon mankind.\n\nI cannot be bigoted, my dear boy, when I say from the bottom of my heart\nthat I respect every good Catholic and every good Protestant, and that\nI recognise that each of these forms of faith has been a powerful\ninstrument in the hands of that inscrutable Providence which rules\nall things. Just as in the course of history one finds that the most\nfar-reaching and admirable effects may proceed from a crime; so in\nreligion, although a creed be founded upon an entirely inadequate\nconception of the Creator and His ways, it may none the less be the very\nbest practical thing for the people and age which have adopted it. But\nif it is right for those to whom it is intellectually satisfying to\nadopt it, it is equally so for those to whom it is not, to protest\nagainst it, until by this process the whole mass of mankind gets\ngradually leavened, and pushed a little further upon their slow upward\njourney.\n\nCatholicism is the more thorough. Protestantism is the more reasonable.\nProtestantism adapts itself to modern civilisation. Catholicism expects\ncivilisation to adapt itself to it. Folk climb from the one big branch\nto the other big branch, and think they have made a prodigious change,\nwhen the main trunk is rotten beneath them, and both must in their\npresent forms be involved sooner or later in a common ruin. The movement\nof human thought, though slow, is still in the direction of truth, and\nthe various religions which man sheds as he advances (each admirable in\nits day) will serve, like buoys dropped down from a sailing vessel, to\ngive the rate and direction of his progress.\n\nBut how do I know what is truth, you ask? I don’t. But I know\nparticularly well what isn’t. And surely that is something to have\ngained. It isn’t true that the great central Mind that planned all\nthings is capable of jealousy or of revenge, or of cruelty or of\ninjustice. These are human attributes; and the book which ascribes\nthem to the Infinite must be human also. It isn’t true that the laws of\nNature have been capriciously disturbed, that snakes have talked, that\nwomen have been turned to salt, that rods have brought water out of\nrocks. You must in honesty confess that if these things were presented\nto us when we were, adults for the first time, we should smile at them.\nIt isn’t true that the Fountain of all common sense should punish a race\nfor a venial offence committed by a person long since dead, and then\nshould add to the crass injustice by heaping the whole retribution upon\na single innocent scapegoat. Can you not see all the want of justice\nand logic, to say nothing of the want of mercy, involved in such a\nconception? Can you not see it, Bertie? How can you blind yourself to\nit! Take your eyes away from the details for a moment, and look at this\nroot idea of the predominant Faith. Is the general conception of it\nconsistent with infinite wisdom and mercy? If not, what becomes of the\ndogmas, the sacraments, the whole scheme which is founded upon this\nsand-bank? Courage, my friend! At the right moment all will be laid\naside, as the man whose strength increases lays down the crutch which\nhas been a good friend to him in his weakness. But his changes won’t be\nover then. His hobble will become a walk, and his walk a run. There is\nno finality--CAN be none since the question concerns the infinite. All\nthis, which appears too advanced to you to-day, will seem reactionary\nand conservative a thousand years hence.\n\nSince I am upon this topic, may I say just a little more without boring\nyou? You say that criticism such as mine is merely destructive, and that\nI have nothing to offer in place of what I pull down. This is not quite\ncorrect. I think that there are certain elemental truths within our\ngrasp which ask for no faith for their acceptance, and which are\nsufficient to furnish us with a practical religion, having so much of\nreason in it that it would draw thinking men into its fold, not drive\nthem forth from it.\n\nWhen we all get back to these elemental and provable facts there will\nbe some hopes of ending the petty bickerings of creeds, and of including\nthe whole human family in one comprehensive system of thought.\n\nWhen first I came out of the faith in which I had been reared, I\ncertainly did feel for a time as if my life-belt had burst. I won’t\nexaggerate and say that I was miserable and plunged in utter spiritual\ndarkness. Youth is too full of action for that. But I was conscious of a\nvague unrest, of a constant want of repose, of an emptiness and hardness\nwhich I had not noticed in life before. I had so identified religion\nwith the Bible that I could not conceive them apart. When the foundation\nproved false, the whole structure came rattling about my ears. And then\ngood old Carlyle came to the rescue; and partly from him, and partly\nfrom my own broodings, I made a little hut of my own, which has kept me\nsnug ever since, and has even served to shelter a friend or two besides.\n\nThe first and main thing was to get it thoroughly soaked into one that\nthe existence of a Creator and an indication of His attributes does in\nno way depend upon Jewish poets, nor upon human paper or printing ink.\nOn the contrary, all such efforts to realise Him must only belittle Him,\nbringing the Infinite down to the narrow terms of human thought, at\na time when that thought was in the main less spiritual than it is\nat present. Even the most material of modern minds would flinch at\ndepicting the Deity as ordering wholesale executions, and hacking kings\nto pieces upon the horns of altars.\n\nThen having prepared your mind for a higher (if perhaps a vaguer)\nidea of the Deity, proceed to study Him in His works, which cannot be\ncounterfeited or manipulated. Nature is the true revelation of the Deity\nto man. The nearest green field is the inspired page from which you may\nread all that it is needful for you to know.\n\nI confess that I have never been able to understand the position of the\natheist. In fact, I have come to disbelieve in his existence, and\nto look upon the word as a mere term of theological reproach. It may\nrepresent a temporary condition, a passing mental phase, a defiant\nreaction against an anthropomorphic ideal; but I cannot conceive that\nany man can continue to survey Nature and to deny that there are laws at\nwork which display intelligence and power. The very existence of a world\ncarries with it the proof of a world-maker, as the table guarantees\nthe pre-existence of the carpenter. Granting this, one may form what\nconception one will of that Maker, but one cannot be an atheist.\n\nWisdom and power and means directed to an end run all through the scheme\nof Nature. What proof do we want, then, from a book? If the man who\nobserves the myriad stars, and considers that they and their innumerable\nsatellites move in their serene dignity through the heavens, each\nswinging clear of the other’s orbit--if, I say, the man who sees this\ncannot realise the Creator’s attributes without the help of the book of\nJob, then his view of things is beyond my understanding. Nor is it only\nin the large things that we see the ever present solicitude of some\nintelligent force. Nothing is too tiny for that fostering care. We see\nthe minute proboscis of the insect carefully adjusted to fit into the\ncalyx of the flower, the most microscopic hair and gland each with its\ndefinite purposeful function to perform. What matter whether these came\nby special creation or by evolution? We know as a matter of fact that\nthey came by evolution, but that only defines the law. It does not\nexplain it.\n\nBut if this power has cared for the bee so as to furnish it with its\nhoney bag and its collecting forceps, and for the lowly seed so as to\nhave a thousand devices by which it reaches a congenial soil, then is it\nconceivable that we, the highest product of all, are overlooked? It is\nNOT conceivable. The idea is inconsistent with the scheme of creation as\nwe see it. I say again that no faith is needed to attain the certainty\nof a most watchful Providence.\n\nAnd with this certainty surely we have all that is necessary for an\nelemental religion. Come what may after death, our duties lie clearly\ndefined before us in this life; and the ethical standard of all creeds\nagrees so far that there is not likely to be any difference of opinion\nas to that. The last reformation simplified Catholicism. The coming one\nwill simplify Protestantism. And when the world is ripe for it another\nwill come and simplify that. The ever improving brain will give us an\never broadening creed. Is it not glorious to think that evolution\nis still living and acting--that if we have an anthropoid ape as an\nancestor, we may have archangels for our posterity?\n\nWell, I really never intended to inflict all this upon you, Bertie. I\nthought I could have made my position clear in a page or so. But you can\nsee how one point has brought up another. Even now I am leaving so much\nunsaid. I can see with such certainty exactly what you will say. “If\nyou deduce a good Providence from the good things in nature, what do\nyou make of the evil?” That’s what you will say. Suffice it that I am\ninclined to deny the existence of evil. Not another word will I say upon\nthe subject; but if you come back to it yourself, then be it on your own\nhead.\n\nYou remember that when I wrote last I had just returned from visiting\nthe Cullingworths at Avonmouth, and that he had promised to let me know\nwhat steps he took in appeasing his creditors. As I expected, I have not\nhad one word from him since. But in a roundabout way I did get some news\nas to what happened. From this account, which was second-hand, and may\nhave been exaggerated, Cullingworth did exactly what I had recommended,\nand calling all his creditors together he made them a long statement as\nto his position. The good people were so touched by the picture that\nhe drew of a worthy man fighting against adversity that several of them\nwept, and there was not only complete unanimity as to letting their\nbills stand over, but even some talk of a collection then and there to\nhelp Cullingworth on his way. He has, I understand, left Avonmouth, but\nno one has any idea what has become of him. It is generally supposed\nthat he has gone to England. He is a strange fellow, but I wish him luck\nwherever he goes.\n\nWhen I came back I settled down once more to the routine of my father’s\npractice, holding on there until something may turn up. And for six\nmonths I have had to wait; a weary six months they have been. You see I\ncannot ask my father for money--or, at least, I cannot bring myself to\ntake an unnecessary penny of his money--for I know how hard a fight\nit is with him to keep the roof over our heads and pay for the modest\nlittle horse and trap which are as necessary to his trade as a goose\nis to a tailor. Foul fare the grasping taxman who wrings a couple of\nguineas from us on the plea that it is a luxury! We can just hold\non, and I would not have him a pound the poorer for me. But you can\nunderstand, Bertie, that it is humiliating for a man of my age to have\nto go about without any money in my pocket. It affects me in so many\npetty ways. A poor man may do me a kindness, and I have to seem mean in\nhis eyes. I may want a flower for a girl, and must be content to appear\nungallant. I don’t know why I should be ashamed of this, since it is no\nfault of mine, and I hope that I don’t show it to any one else that I AM\nashamed of it; but to you, my dear Bertie, I don’t mind confessing that\nit hurts my self-respect terribly.\n\nI have often wondered why some of those writing fellows don’t try their\nhands at drawing the inner life of a young man from about the age of\npuberty until he begins to find his feet a little. Men are very fond\nof analysing the feelings of their heroines, which they cannot possibly\nknow anything about, while they have little to say of the inner\ndevelopment of their heroes, which is an experience which they have\nthemselves undergone. I should like to try it myself, but it would need\nblending with fiction, and I never had a spark of imagination. But I\nhave a vivid recollection of what I went through myself. At the time I\nthought (as everybody thinks) that it was a unique experience; but since\nI have heard the confidences of my father’s patients I am convinced that\nit is the common lot. The shrinking, horrible shyness, alternating with\noccasional absurd fits of audacity which represent the reaction against\nit, the longing for close friendship, the agonies over imaginary\nslights, the extraordinary sexual doubts, the deadly fears caused by\nnon-existent diseases, the vague emotion produced by all women, and the\nhalf-frightened thrill by particular ones, the aggressiveness caused\nby fear of being afraid, the sudden blacknesses, the profound\nself-distrust--I dare bet that you have felt every one of them, Bertie,\njust as I have, and that the first lad of eighteen whom you see out of\nyour window is suffering from them now.\n\nThis is all a digression, however, from the fact that I have been six\nmonths at home and am weary of it, and pleased at the new development\nof which I shall have to tell you. The practice here, although\nunremunerative, is very busy with its three-and-sixpenny visits and\nguinea confinements, so that both the governor and I have had plenty\nto do. You know how I admire him, and yet I fear there is little\nintellectual sympathy between us. He appears to think that those\nopinions of mine upon religion and politics which come hot from my\ninmost soul have been assumed either out of indifference or bravado. So\nI have ceased to talk on vital subjects with him, and, though we affect\nto ignore it, we both know that there is a barrier there. Now, with my\nmother--ah, but my mother must have a paragraph to herself.\n\nYou met her, Bertie! You must remember her sweet face, her sensitive\nmouth, her peering, short-sighted eyes, her general suggestion of a\nplump little hen, who is still on the alert about her chickens. But you\ncannot realise all that she is to me in our domestic life. Those helpful\nfingers! That sympathetic brain! Ever since I can remember her she has\nbeen the quaintest mixture of the housewife and the woman of letters,\nwith the highbred spirited lady as a basis for either character. Always\na lady, whether she was bargaining with the butcher, or breaking in a\nskittish charwoman, or stirring the porridge, which I can see her doing\nwith the porridge-stick in one hand, and the other holding her Revue\ndes deux Mondes within two inches of her dear nose. That was always her\nfavourite reading, and I can never think of her without the association\nof its browny-yellow cover.\n\nShe is a very well-read woman is the mother; she keeps up to date in\nFrench literature as well as in English, and can talk by the hour about\nthe Goncourts, and Flaubert, and Gautier. Yet she is always hard at\nwork; and how she imbibes all her knowledge is a mystery. She reads when\nshe knits, she reads when she scrubs, she even reads when she feeds\nher babies. We have a little joke against her, that at an interesting\npassage she deposited a spoonful of rusk and milk into my little\nsister’s car-hole, the child having turned her head at the critical\ninstant. Her hands are worn with work, and yet where is the idle woman\nwho has read as much?\n\nThen, there is her family pride. That is a very vital portion of the\nmother. You know how little I think of such things. If the Esquire were\nto be snipped once and for ever from the tail of my name I should be\nthe lighter for it. But, ma foi!--to use her own favourite expletive--it\nwould not do to say this to her. On the Packenham side (she is a\nPackenham) the family can boast of some fairly good men--I mean on the\ndirect line--but when we get on the side branches there is not a monarch\nupon earth who does not roost on that huge family tree. Not once, nor\ntwice, but thrice did the Plantagenets intermarry with us, the Dukes\nof Brittany courted our alliance, and the Percies of Northumberland\nintertwined themselves with our whole illustrious record. So in my\nboyhood she would expound the matter, with hearthbrush in one hand and\na glove full of cinders in the other, while I would sit swinging my\nknickerbockered legs, swelling with pride until my waistcoat was as\ntight as a sausage skin, as I contemplated the gulf which separated me\nfrom all other little boys who swang their legs upon tables. To this\nday if I chance to do anything of which she strongly approves, the dear\nheart can say no more than that I am a thorough Packenham; while if I\nfall away from the straight path, she says with a sigh that there are\npoints in which I take after the Munros.\n\nShe is broad-minded and intensely practical in her ordinary moods,\nthough open to attacks of romance. I can recollect her coming to see me\nat a junction through which my train passed, with a six months’ absence\non either side of the incident. We had five minutes’ conversation, my\nhead out of the carriage window. “Wear flannel next your skin, my dear\nboy, and never believe in eternal punishment,” was her last item of\nadvice as we rolled out of the station. Then to finish her portrait\nI need not tell you, who have seen her, that she is young-looking and\ncomely to be the mother of about thirty-five feet of humanity. She\nwas in the railway carriage and I on the platform the other day. “Your\nhusband had better get in or we’ll go without him,” said the guard. As\nwe went off, the mother was fumbling furiously in her pocket, and I know\nthat she was looking for a shilling.\n\nAh! what a gossip I have been! And all to lead up to the one sentence\nthat I could not have stayed at home this six months if it had not been\nfor the company and the sympathy of my mother.\n\nWell, now I want to tell you about the scrape that I got myself into. I\nsuppose that I ought to pull a long face over it, but for the life of me\nI can’t help laughing. I have you almost up to date in my history now,\nfor what I am going to tell you happened only last week. I must mention\nno names here even to you; for the curse of Ernulphus, which includes\neight and forty minor imprecations, be upon the head of the man who\nkisses and tells.\n\nYou must know, then, that within the boundaries of this city there are\ntwo ladies, a mother and a daughter, whom I shall call Mrs. and Miss\nLaura Andrews. They are patients of the governor’s, and have become\nto some extent friends of the family. Madame is Welsh, charming\nin appearance, dignified in her manners, and High Church in her\nconvictions. The daughter is rather taller than the mother, but\notherwise they are strikingly alike. The mother is thirty-six and\nthe daughter eighteen. Both are exceedingly charming. Had I to choose\nbetween them, I think, entre nous, that the mother would have attracted\nme most, for I am thoroughly of Balzac’s opinion as to the woman of\nthirty. However, fate was to will it otherwise.\n\nIt was the coming home from a dance which first brought Laura and\nme together. You know how easily and suddenly these things happen,\nbeginning in playful teasing and ending in something a little warmer\nthan friendship. You squeeze the slender arm which is passed through\nyours, you venture to take the little gloved hand, you say good night\nat absurd length in the shadow of the door. It is innocent and very\ninteresting, love trying his wings in a first little flutter. He will\nkeep his sustained flight later on, the better for the practice. There\nwas never any question of engagements between us, nor any suggestion of\nharm. She knew that I was a poor devil with neither means nor prospects,\nand I knew that her mother’s will was her law, and that her course\nwas already marked out for her. However, we exchanged our little\nconfidences, and met occasionally by appointment, and tried to make our\nlives brighter without darkening those of any one else. I can see you\nshake your head here and growl, like the comfortable married man that\nyou are, that such relations are very dangerous. So they are, my boy:\nbut neither of us cared, she out of innocence and I out of recklessness,\nfor from the beginning all the fault in the matter was mine.\n\nWell, matters were in this state when one day last week a note came up\nto the Dad saying that Mrs. Andrews’ servant was ill, and would he come\nat once. The old man had a touch of gout, so I donned my professional\ncoat and sallied forth, thinking that perhaps I might combine pleasure\nwith business, and have a few words with Laura. Sure enough, as I passed\nup the gravel drive which curves round to the door, I glanced through\nthe drawing-room window, and saw her sitting painting, with her back\nto the light. It was clear that she had not heard me. The hall door was\najar, and when I pushed it open, no one was in the hall. A sudden fit\nof roguishness came over me. I pushed the drawing-room door very slowly\nwider, crept in on tiptoe, stole quietly across, and bending down, I\nkissed the artist upon the nape of her neck. She turned round with a\nsqueal, and it was the mother!\n\nI don’t know whether you have ever been in a tighter corner than that,\nBertie. It was quite tight enough for me. I remember that I smiled as\nI stole across the carpet on that insane venture. I did not smile again\nthat evening. It makes me hot now when I think of it.\n\nWell, I made the most dreadful fool of myself. At first, the good lady\nwho (as I think I told you) is very dignified and rather reserved, could\nnot believe her senses. Then, as the full force of my enormity came upon\nher she reared herself up until she seemed the tallest and the coldest\nwoman I had ever seen. It was an interview with a refrigerator. She\nasked me what I had ever observed in her conduct which had encouraged\nme to subject her to such an outrage. I saw, of course, that any excuses\nupon my part would put her on the right track and give poor Laura away;\nso I stood with my hair bristling and my top hat in my hand, presenting,\nI am sure, a most extraordinary figure. Indeed, she looked rather funny\nherself, with her palette in one hand, her brush in the other, and the\nblank astonishment on her face. I stammered out something about hoping\nthat she did not mind, which made her more angry than ever. “The\nonly possible excuse for your conduct, sir, is that you are under the\ninfluence of drink,” said she. “I need not say that we do not require\nthe services of a medical man in that condition.” I did not try to\ndisabuse her of the idea, for really I could see no better explanation;\nso I beat a retreat in a very demoralised condition. She wrote a letter\nto my father about it in the evening, and the old man was very angry\nindeed. As to the mother, she is as staunch as steel, and quite prepared\nto prove that poor Mrs. A. was a very deep designing person, who had\nlaid a trap for innocent Johnnie. So there has been a grand row; and not\na soul upon earth has the least idea of what it all means, except only\nyourself as you read this letter.\n\nYou can imagine that this has not contributed to make life here more\npleasant, for my father cannot bring himself to forgive me. Of course,\nI don’t wonder at his anger. I should be just the same myself. It does\nlook like a shocking breach of professional honour, and a sad disregard\nof his interests. If he knew the truth he would see that it was nothing\nworse than a silly ill-timed boyish joke. However, he never shall know\nthe truth.\n\nAnd now there is some chance of my getting something to do. We had\na letter to-night from Christie & Howden, the writers to the Signet,\nsaying that they desire an interview with me, in view of a possible\nappointment. We can’t imagine what it means, but I am full of hopes. I\ngo to-morrow morning to see them, and I shall let you know the result.\n\nGood-bye, my dear Bertie! Your life flows in a steady stream, and mine\nin a broken torrent. Yet I would have every detail of what happens to\nyou.\n\n\n\n\n\nIV. HOME, 1st December, 1881.\n\nI may be doing you an injustice, Bertie, but it seemed to me in\nyour last that there were indications that the free expression of my\nreligious views had been distasteful to you. That you should disagree\nwith me I am prepared for; but that you should object to free and honest\ndiscussion of those subjects which above all others men should be honest\nover, would, I confess, be a disappointment. The Freethinker is placed\nat this disadvantage in ordinary society, that whereas it would be\nconsidered very bad taste upon his part to obtrude his unorthodox\nopinion, no such consideration hampers those with whom he disagrees.\nThere was a time when it took a brave man to be a Christian. Now it\ntakes a brave man not to be. But if we are to wear a gag, and hide our\nthoughts when writing in confidence to our most intimate----no, but I\nwon’t believe it. You and I have put up too many thoughts together and\nchased them where-ever{sic} they would double, Bertie; so just write to\nme like a good fellow, and tell me that I am an ass. Until I have that\ncomforting assurance, I shall place a quarantine upon everything which\ncould conceivably be offensive to you.\n\nDoes not lunacy strike you, Bertie, as being a very eerie thing? It is\na disease of the soul. To think that you may have a man of noble mind,\nfull of every lofty aspiration, and that a gross physical cause, such\nas the fall of a spicule of bone from the inner table of his skull on\nto the surface of the membrane which covers his brain, may have the\nultimate effect of turning him into an obscene creature with every\nbestial attribute! That a man’s individuality should swing round\nfrom pole to pole, and yet that one life should contain these two\ncontradictory personalities--is it not a wondrous thing?\n\nI ask myself, where is the man, the very, very inmost essence of the\nman? See how much you may subtract from him without touching it. It does\nnot lie in the limbs which serve him as tools, nor in the apparatus by\nwhich he is to digest, nor in that by which he is to inhale oxygen. All\nthese are mere accessories, the slaves of the lord within. Where,\nthen, is he? He does not lie in the features which are to express his\nemotions, nor in the eyes and ears which can be dispensed with by the\nblind and deaf. Nor is he in the bony framework which is the rack over\nwhich nature hangs her veil of flesh. In none of these things lies the\nessence of the man. And now what is left? An arched whitish putty-like\nmass, some fifty odd ounces in weight, with a number of white filaments\nhanging down from it, looking not unlike the medusae which float in our\nsummer seas. But these filaments only serve to conduct nerve force\nto muscles and to organs which serve secondary purposes. They may\nthemselves therefore be disregarded. Nor can we stop here in our\nelimination. This central mass of nervous matter may be pared down on\nall sides before we seem to get at the very seat of the soul. Suicides\nhave shot away the front lobes of the brain, and have lived to repent\nit. Surgeons have cut down upon it and have removed sections. Much of it\nis merely for the purpose of furnishing the springs of motion, and much\nfor the reception of impressions. All this may be put aside as we search\nfor the physical seat of what we call the soul--the spiritual part of\nthe man. And what is left then? A little blob of matter, a handful of\nnervous dough, a few ounces of tissue, but there--somewhere there--lurks\nthat impalpable seed, to which the rest of our frame is but the pod. The\nold philosophers who put the soul in the pineal gland were not right,\nbut after all they were uncommonly near the mark.\n\nYou’ll find my physiology even worse than my theology, Bertie. I have\na way of telling stories backwards to you, which is natural enough when\nyou consider that I always sit down to write under the influence of the\nlast impressions which have come upon me. All this talk about the soul\nand the brain arises simply from the fact that I have been spending the\nlast few weeks with a lunatic. And how it came about I will tell you as\nclearly as I can.\n\nYou remember that in my last I explained to you how restive I had been\ngetting at home, and how my idiotic mistake had annoyed my father and\nhad made my position here very uncomfortable. Then I mentioned, I think,\nthat I had received a letter from Christie & Howden, the lawyers. Well,\nI brushed up my Sunday hat, and my mother stood on a chair and landed me\ntwice on the ear with a clothes brush, under the impression that she\nwas making the collar of my overcoat look more presentable. With which\naccolade out I sallied into the world, the dear soul standing on the\nsteps, peering after me and waving me success.\n\nWell, I was in considerable trepidation when I reached the office, for I\nam a much more nervous person than any of my friends will ever credit\nme with being. However, I was shown in at once to Mr. James Christie,\na wiry, sharp, thin-lipped kind of man, with an abrupt manner, and\nthat sort of Scotch precision of speech which gives the impression of\nclearness of thought behind it.\n\n“I understand from Professor Maxwell that you have been looking about\nfor an opening, Mr. Munro,” said he.\n\nMaxwell had said that he would give me a hand if he could; but you\nremember that he had a reputation for giving such promises rather\neasily. I speak of a man as I find him, and to me he has been an\nexcellent friend.\n\n“I should be very happy to hear of any opening,” said I.\n\n“Of your medical qualifications there is no need to speak,” he went\non, running his eyes all over me in the most questioning way. “Your\nBachelorship of Medicine will answer for that. But Professor Maxwell\nthought you peculiarly fitted for this vacancy for physical reasons. May\nI ask you what your weight is?”\n\n“Fourteen stone.”\n\n“And you stand, I should judge, about six feet high?”\n\n“Precisely.”\n\n\n“Accustomed too, as I gather, to muscular exercise of every kind. Well,\nthere can be no question that you are the very man for the post, and I\nshall be very happy to recommend you to Lord Saltire.”\n\n“You forget,” said I, “that I have not yet heard what the position is,\nor the terms which you offer.”\n\nHe began to laugh at that. “It was a little precipitate on my part,”\n said he; “but I do not think that we are likely to quarrel as to\nposition or terms. You may have heard perhaps of the sad misfortune of\nour client, Lord Saltire? Not? To put it briefly then, his son, the Hon.\nJames Derwent, the heir to the estates and the only child, was struck\ndown by the sun while fishing without his hat last July. His mind has\nnever recovered from the shock, and he has been ever since in a chronic\nstate of moody sullenness which breaks out every now and then into\nviolent mania. His father will not allow him to be removed from\nLochtully Castle, and it is his desire that a medical man should stay\nthere in constant attendance upon his son. Your physical strength would\nof course be very useful in restraining those violent attacks of which\nI have spoken. The remuneration will be twelve pounds a month, and you\nwould be required to take over your duties to-morrow.”\n\nI walked home, my dear Bertie, with a bounding heart, and the pavement\nlike cotton wool under my feet. I found just eightpence in my pocket,\nand I spent the whole of it on a really good cigar with which to\ncelebrate the occasion. Old Cullingworth has always had a very high\nopinion of lunatics for beginners. “Get a lunatic, my boy! Get a\nlunatic!” he used to say. Then it was not only the situation, but the\nfine connection that it opened up. I seemed to see exactly what would\nhappen. There would be illness in the family,--Lord Saltire himself\nperhaps, or his wife. There would be no time to send for advice. I would\nbe consulted. I would gain their confidence and become their family\nattendant. They would recommend me to their wealthy friends. It was all\nas clear as possible. I was debating before I reached home whether it\nwould be worth my while to give up a lucrative country practice in order\nto take the Professorship which might be offered me.\n\nMy father took the news philosophically enough, with some rather\nsardonic remark about my patient and me being well qualified to keep\neach other company. But to my mother it was a flash of joy, followed by\na thunderclap of consternation. I had only three under-shirts, the\nbest of my linen had gone to Belfast to be refronted and recuffed, the\nnight-gowns were not marked yet--there were a dozen of those domestic\ndifficulties of which the mere male never thinks. A dreadful vision of\nLady Saltire looking over my things and finding the heel out of one of\nmy socks obsessed my mother. Out we trudged together, and before evening\nher soul was at rest, and I had mortgaged in advance my first month’s\nsalary. She was great, as we walked home, upon the grand people into\nwhose service I was to enter. “As a matter of fact, my dear,” said she,\n“they are in a sense relations of yours. You are very closely allied to\nthe Percies, and the Saltires have Percy blood in them also. They are\nonly a cadet branch, and you are close upon the main line; but still it\nis not for us to deny the connection.” She brought a cold sweat out upon\nme by suggesting that she should make things easy by writing to Lord\nSaltire and explaining our respective positions. Several times during\nthe evening I heard her murmur complacently that they were only the\ncadet branch.\n\nAm I not the slowest of story-tellers? But you encourage me to it by\nyour sympathetic interest in details. However, I shall move along a\nlittle faster now. Next morning I was off to Lochtully, which, as you\nknow, is in the north of Perthshire. It stands three miles from the\nstation, a great gray pinnacled house, with two towers cocking out above\nthe fir woods, like a hare’s ears from a tussock of grass. As we drove\nup to the door I felt pretty solemn--not at all as the main line should\ndo when it condescends to visit the cadet branch. Into the hall as I\nentered came a grave learned-looking man, with whom in my nervousness\nI was about to shake hands cordially. Fortunately he forestalled the\nimpending embrace by explaining that he was the butler. He showed\nme into a small study, where everything stank of varnish and morocco\nleather, there to await the great man. He proved when he came to be a\nmuch less formidable figure than his retainer--indeed, I felt thoroughly\nat my ease with him from the moment he opened his mouth. He is grizzled,\nred-faced, sharp-featured, with a prying and yet benevolent expression,\nvery human and just a trifle vulgar. His wife, however, to whom I\nwas afterwards introduced, is a most depressing person,--pale, cold,\nhatchet-faced, with drooping eyelids and very prominent blue veins at\nher temples. She froze me up again just as I was budding out under the\ninfluence of her husband. However, the thing that interested me most\nof all was to see my patient, to whose room I was taken by Lord Saltire\nafter we had had a cup of tea.\n\nThe room was a large bare one, at the end of a long corridor. Near the\ndoor was seated a footman, placed there to fill up the gap between two\ndoctors, and looking considerably relieved at my advent. Over by the\nwindow (which was furnished with a wooden guard, like that of a nursery)\nsat a tall, yellow-haired, yellow-bearded, young man, who raised a pair\nof startled blue eyes as we entered. He was turning over the pages of a\nbound copy of the Illustrated London News.\n\n“James,” said Lord Saltire, “this is Dr. Stark Munro, who has come to\nlook after you.”\n\nMy patient mumbled something in his beard, which seemed to me\nsuspiciously like “Damn Dr. Stark Munro!” The peer evidently thought the\nsame, for he led me aside by the elbow.\n\n“I don’t know whether you have been told that James is a little rough in\nhis ways at present,” said he; “his whole nature has deteriorated very\nmuch since this calamity came upon him. You must not be offended by\nanything he may say or do.”\n\n“Not in the least,” said I.\n\n“There is a taint of this sort upon my wife’s side,” I whispered the\nlittle lord; “her uncle’s symptoms were identical. Dr. Peterson says\nthat the sunstroke was only the determining cause. The predisposition\nwas already there. I may tell you that the footman will always be in the\nnext room, so that you can call him if you need his assistance.”\n\nWell, it ended by lord and lacquey moving off, and leaving me with my\npatient. I thought that I should lose no time in establishing a kindly\nrelation with him, so I drew a chair over to his sofa and began to ask\nhim a few questions about his health and habits. Not a word could I get\nout of him in reply. He sat as sullen as a mule, with a kind of sneer\nabout his handsome face, which showed me very well that he had heard\neverything. I tried this and tried that, but not a syllable could I\nget from him; so at last I turned from him and began to look over some\nillustrated papers on the table. He doesn’t read, it seems, and will do\nnothing but look at pictures. Well, I was sitting like this with my back\nhalf turned, when you can imagine my surprise to feel something plucking\ngently at me, and to see a great brown hand trying to slip its way into\nmy coat pocket. I caught at the wrist and turned swiftly round, but too\nlate to prevent my handkerchief being whisked out and concealed behind\nthe Hon. James Derwent, who sat grinning at me like a mischievous\nmonkey.\n\n“Come, I may want that,” said I, trying to treat the matter as a joke.\n\nHe used some language which was more scriptural than religious. I saw\nthat he did not mean giving it up, but I was determined not to let him\nget the upper hand over me. I grabbed for the handkerchief; and he, with\na snarl, caught my hand in both of his. He had a powerful grip, but I\nmanaged to get his wrist and to give it a wrench round, until, with a\nhowl, he dropped my property.\n\n“What fun,” said I, pretending to laugh. “Let us try again. Now, you\ntake it up, and see if I can get it again.”\n\nBut he had had enough of that game. Yet he appeared to be better\nhumoured than before the incident, and I got a few short answers to the\nquestions which I put to him.\n\nAnd here comes in the text which started me preaching about lunacy at\nthe beginning of this letter. WHAT a marvellous thing it is! This man,\nfrom all I can learn of him, has suddenly swung clean over from one\nextreme of character to the other. Every plus has in an instant become a\nminus. He’s another man, but in the same case. I am told that he used\nto be (only a few months ago, mind you) most fastidious in dress\nand speech. Now he is a foul-tongued rough! He had a nice taste in\nliterature. Now he stares at you if you speak of Shakespeare. Queerest\nof all, he used to be a very high-and-dry Tory in his opinions. He\nis fond now of airing the most democratic views, and in a needlessly\noffensive way. When I did get on terms with him at last, I found that\nthere was nothing on which he could be drawn on to talk so soon as on\npolitics. In substance, I am bound to say that I think his new views are\nprobably saner than his old ones, but the insanity lies in his sudden\nreasonless change and in his violent blurts of speech.\n\nIt was some weeks, however, before I gained his confidence, so far as\nto be able to hold a real conversation with him. For a long time he was\nvery sullen and suspicious, resenting the constant watch which I kept\nupon him. This could not be relaxed, for he was full of the most apish\ntricks. One day he got hold of my tobacco pouch, and stuffed two ounces\nof my tobacco into the long barrel of an Eastern gun which hangs on the\nwall. He jammed it all down with the ramrod, and I was never able to get\nit up again. Another time he threw an earthenware spittoon through the\nwindow, and would have sent the clock after it had I not prevented\nhim. Every day I took him for a two hours’ constitutional, save when it\nrained, and then we walked religiously for the same space up and down\nthe room. Heh! but it was a deadly, dreary, kind of life.\n\nI was supposed to have my eye upon him all day, with a two-hour interval\nevery afternoon and an evening to myself upon Fridays. But then what was\nthe use of an evening to myself when there was no town near, and I had\nno friends whom I could visit? I did a fair amount of reading, for Lord\nSaltire let me have the run of his library. Gibbon gave me a couple of\nenchanting weeks. You know the effect that he produces. You seem to\nbe serenely floating upon a cloud, and looking down on all these pigmy\narmies and navies, with a wise Mentor ever at your side to whisper to\nyou the inner meaning of all that majestic panorama.\n\nNow and again young Derwent introduced some excitement into my dull\nlife. On one occasion when we were walking in the grounds, he suddenly\nsnatched up a spade from a grass-plot, and rushed at an inoffensive\nunder-gardener. The man ran screaming for his life, with my patient\ncursing at his very heels, and me within a few paces of him. When I at\nlast laid my hand on his collar, he threw down his weapon and burst into\nshrieks of laughter. It was only mischief and not ferocity; but when\nthat under-gardener saw us coming after that he was off with a face like\na cream cheese. At night the attendant slept in a camp-bed at the foot\nof the patient’s, and my room was next door, so that I could be called\nif necessary. No, it was not a very exhilarating life!\n\nWe used to go down to family meals when there were no visitors; and\nthere we made a curious quartette: Jimmy (as he wished me to call him)\nglum and silent; I with the tail of my eye always twisted round to him;\nLady Saltire with her condescending eyelids and her blue veins; and the\ngood-natured peer, fussy and genial, but always rather subdued in the\npresence of his wife. She looked as if a glass of good wine would do\nher good, and he as if he would be the better for abstinence; and so, in\naccordance with the usual lopsidedness of life, he drank freely, and\nshe took nothing but lime-juice and water. You cannot imagine a more\nignorant, intolerant, narrow-minded woman than she. If she had only been\ncontent to be silent and hidden that small brain of hers, it would\nnot have mattered; but there was no end to her bitter and exasperating\nclacking. What was she after all but a thin pipe for conveying disease\nfrom one generation to another? She was bounded by insanity upon the\nnorth and upon the south. I resolutely set myself to avoid all argument\nwith her; but she knew, with her woman’s instinct, that we were as far\napart as the poles, and took a pleasure in waving the red flag before\nme. One day she was waxing eloquent as to the crime of a minister of an\nEpiscopal church performing any service in a Presbyterian chapel. Some\nneighbouring minister had done it, it seems; and if he had been marked\ndown in a pot house she could not have spoken with greater loathing.\nI suppose that my eyes were less under control than my tongue, for she\nsuddenly turned upon me with:\n\n“I see that you don’t agree with me, Dr. Munro.”\n\nI replied quietly that I did not, and tried to change the conversation;\nbut she was not to be shaken off.\n\n“Why not, may I ask?”\n\nI explained that in my opinion the tendency of the age was to break down\nthose ridiculous doctrinal points which are so useless, and which have\nfor so long set people by the ears. I added that I hoped the time\nwas soon coming when good men of all creeds would throw this lumber\noverboard and join hands together.\n\nShe half rose, almost speechless with indignation.\n\n“I presume,” said she, “that you are one of those people who would\nseparate the Church from the State?”\n\n“Most certainly,” I answered.\n\nShe stood erect in a kind of cold fury, and swept out of the room. Jimmy\nbegan to chuckle, and his father looked perplexed.\n\n“I am sorry that my opinions are offensive to Lady Saltire,” I remarked.\n\n“Yes, yes; it’s a pity; a pity,” said he “well, well, we must say what\nwe think; but it’s a pity you think it--a very great pity.”\n\nI quite expected to get my dismissal over this business, and indeed,\nindirectly I may say that I did so. From that day Lady Saltire was as\nrude to me as she could be, and never lost an opportunity of making\nattacks upon what she imagined to be my opinions. Of these I never\ntook the slightest notice; but at last on an evil day she went for me\npoint-blank, so that there was no getting away from her. It was just\nat the end of lunch, when the footman had left the room. She had been\ntalking about Lord Saltire’s going up to London to vote upon some\nquestion in the House of Lords.\n\n“Perhaps, Dr. Munro,” said she, turning acidly upon me, “that is also an\ninstitution which has not been fortunate enough to win your approval.”\n\n“It is a question, Lady Saltire, which I should much prefer not to\ndiscuss,” I answered.\n\n“Oh, you might just as well have the courage of your convictions,” said\nshe. “Since you desire to despoil the National Church, it is natural\nenough that you should wish also to break up the Constitution. I have\nheard that an atheist is always a red republican.”\n\nLord Saltire rose, wishing, I have no doubt, to put an end to the\nconversation. Jimmy and I rose also; and suddenly I saw that instead of\nmoving towards the door he was going to his mother. Knowing his little\ntricks, I passed my hand under his arm, and tried to steer him away. She\nnoticed it, however, and interfered.\n\n“Did you wish to speak to me, James?”\n\n“I want to whisper in your ear, mother.”\n\n“Pray don’t excite yourself, sir,” said I, again attempting to detain\nhim. Lady Saltire arched her aristocratic eyebrows.\n\n“I think, Dr. Munro, that you push your authority rather far when you\nventure to interfere between a mother and her son,” said she. “What was\nit, my poor dear boy?”\n\nJimmy bent down and whispered something in her ear. The blood rushed\ninto her pale face, and she sprang from him as if he had struck her.\nJimmy began to snigger.\n\n“This is your doing, Dr. Munro,” she cried furiously. “You have\ncorrupted my son’s mind, and encouraged him to insult his mother.”\n\n“My dear! My dear!” said her husband soothingly, and I quietly led the\nrecalcitrant Jimmy upstairs. I asked him what it was that he had said to\nhis mother, but got only chuckles in reply.\n\nI had a presentiment that I should hear more of the matter; and I was\nnot wrong. Lord Saltire called me into his study in the evening.\n\n“The fact is, doctor,” said he, “that Lady Saltire has been extremely\nannoyed and grieved about what occurred at lunch to-day. Of course, you\ncan imagine that such an expression coming from her own son, shocked her\nmore than I can tell.”\n\n“I assure you, Lord Saltire,” said I, “that I have no idea at all what\npassed between Lady Saltire and my patient.”\n\n“Well,” said he, “without going into details, I may say that what he\nwhispered was a blasphemous wish, most coarsely expressed, as to the\nfuture of that Upper House to which I have the honor to belong.”\n\n“I am very sorry,” said I, “and I assure you that I have never\nencouraged him in his extreme political views, which seem to me to be\nsymptoms of his disease.”\n\n“I am quite convinced that what you say is true,” he answered; “but Lady\nSaltire is unhappily of the opinion that you have instilled these ideas\ninto him. You know that it is a little difficult sometimes to reason\nwith a lady. However, I have no doubt that all may be smoothed over if\nyou would see Lady Saltire and assure her that she has misunderstood\nyour views upon this point, and that you are personally a supporter of a\nHereditary Chamber.”\n\nIt put me in a tight corner, Bertie; but my mind was instantly made up.\nFrom the first word I had read my dismissal in every uneasy glance of\nhis little eyes.\n\n“I am afraid,” said I, “that that is rather further than I am prepared\nto go. I think that since there has been for some weeks a certain\nfriction between Lady Saltire and myself, it would perhaps be as well\nthat I should resign the post which I hold in your household. I shall\nbe happy, however, to remain here until you have found some one to take\nover my duties.”\n\n“Well, I am sorry it has come to this, and yet it may be that you are\nright,” said he, with an expression of relief; “as to James, there need\nbe no difficulty about that, for Dr. Patterson could come in tomorrow\nmorning.”\n\n“Then to-morrow morning let it be,” I answered.\n\n“Very good, Dr. Munro; I will see that you have your cheque before you\ngo.”\n\nSo there was the end of all my fine dreams about aristocratic practices\nand wonderful introductions! I believe the only person in the whole\nhouse who regretted me was Jimmy, who was quite downcast at the news.\nHis grief, however, did not prevent him from brushing my new top-hat\nthe wrong way on the morning that I left. I did not notice it until I\nreached the station, and a most undignified object I must have looked\nwhen I took my departure.\n\nSo ends the history of a failure. I am, as you know, inclined to\nfatalism, and do not believe that such a thing as chance exists; so I am\nbound to think that this experience was given to me for some end. It\nwas a preliminary canter for the big race, perhaps. My mother was\ndisappointed, but tried to show it as little as possible. My father\nwas a little sardonic over the matter. I fear that the gap between us\nwidens. By the way, an extraordinary card arrived from Cullingworth\nduring my absence. “You are my man,” said he; “mind that I am to have\nyou when I want you.” There was no date and no address, but the postmark\nwas Bradfield in the north of England. Does it mean nothing? Or may it\nmean everything? We must wait and see.\n\nGood-bye, old man. Let me hear equally fully about your own affairs. How\ndid the Rattray business go off?\n\n\n\n\n\nV. MERTON ON THE MOORS, 5th March, 1882.\n\n\nI was so delighted, my dear chap, to have your assurance that nothing\nthat I have said or could say upon the subject of religion could offend\nyou. It is difficult to tell you how pleased and relieved I was at your\ncordial letter. I have no one to whom I can talk upon such matters. I\nam all driven inwards, and thought turns sour when one lets it\nstagnate like that. It is a grand thing to be able to tell it all to a\nsympathetic listener--and the more so perhaps when he looks at it all\nfrom another standpoint. It steadies and sobers one.\n\nThose whom I love best are those who have least sympathy with my\nstruggles. They talk about having faith, as if it could be done by an\nact of volition. They might as well tell me to have black hair instead\nof red. I might simulate it perhaps by refusing to use my reason at all\nin religious matters. But I will never be traitor to the highest thing\nthat God has given me. I WILL use it. It is more moral to use it and go\nwrong, than to forego it and be right. It is only a little foot-rule,\nand I have to measure Mount Everest with it; but it’s all I have, and\nI’ll never give it up while there’s breath between my lips.\n\nWith all respect to you, Bertie, it is very easy to be orthodox. A man\nwho wanted mental peace and material advancement in this world would\ncertainly choose to be so. As Smiles says--“A dead fish can float with\nthe stream, but it takes a man to swim against it.” What could be more\nnoble than the start and the starter of Christianity? How beautiful\nthe upward struggle of an idea, like some sweet flower blossoming out\namongst rubble and cinders! But, alas! to say that this idea was a final\nidea! That this scheme of thought was above the reason! That this\ngentle philosopher was that supreme intelligence to which we cannot even\nimagine a personality without irreverence!--all this will come to rank\nwith the strangest delusions of mankind. And then how clouded has become\nthat fine daybreak of Christianity! Its representatives have risen from\nthe manger to the palace, from the fishing smack to the House of Lords.\nNor is that other old potentate in the Vatican, with his art treasures,\nhis guards, and his cellars of wine in a more logical position. They are\nall good and talented men, and in the market of brains are worth perhaps\nas much as they get. But how can they bring themselves to pose as the\nrepresentatives of a creed, which, as they themselves expound it, is\nbased upon humility, poverty, and self-denial? Not one of them who\nwould not quote with approval the parable of the Wedding Guest. But\ntry putting one of them out of their due precedence at the next Court\nreception. It happened some little time ago with a Cardinal, and England\nrang with his protests. How blind not to see how they would spring at\none leap into the real first place if they would but resolutely claim\nthe last as the special badge of their master!\n\nWhat can we know? What are we all? Poor silly half-brained things\npeering out at the infinite, with the aspirations of angels and the\ninstincts of beasts. But surely all will be well with us. If not, then\nHe who made us is evil, which is not to be thought. Surely, then, all\nmust go very well with us!\n\nI feel ashamed when I read this over. My mind fills in all the trains\nof thought of which you have the rude ends peeping out from this tangle.\nMake what you can of it, dear Bertie, and believe that it all comes from\nmy innermost heart. Above all may I be kept from becoming a partisan,\nand tempering with truth in order to sustain a case. Let me but get a\nhand on her skirt, and she may drag me where she will, if she will but\nturn her face from time to time that I may know her.\n\nYou’ll see from the address of this letter, Bertie, that I have left\nScotland and am in Yorkshire. I have been here three months, and am now\non the eve of leaving under the strangest circumstances and with the\nqueerest prospects. Good old Cullingworth has turned out a trump, as I\nalways knew he would. But, as usual, I am beginning at the wrong end, so\nhere goes to give you an idea of what has been happening.\n\nI told you in my last about my lunacy adventure and my ignominious\nreturn from Lochtully Castle. When I had settled for the flannel vests\nwhich my mother had ordered so lavishly I had only five pounds left out\nof my pay. With this, as it was the first money that I had ever earned\nim{sic} my life, I bought her a gold bangle, so behold me reduced at\nonce to my usual empty pocketed condition. Well, it was something just\nto feel that I HAD earned money. It gave me an assurance that I might\nagain.\n\nI had not been at home more than a few days when my father called me\ninto the study after breakfast one morning and spoke very seriously as\nto our financial position. He began the interview by unbuttoning his\nwaistcoat and asking me to listen at his fifth intercostal space, two\ninches from the left sternal line. I did so, and was shocked to hear a\nwell-marked mitral regurgitant murmur.\n\n“It is of old standing,” said he, “but of late I have had a puffiness\nabout the ankles and some renal symptoms which show me that it is\nbeginning to tell.”\n\nI tried to express my grief and sympathy, but he cut me short with some\nasperity.\n\n“The point is,” said he, “that no insurance office would accept my\nlife, and that I have been unable, owing to competition and increased\nexpenses, to lay anything by. If I die soon (which, between ourselves,\nis by no means improbable), I must leave to your care your mother and\nthe children. My practice is so entirely a personal one that I cannot\nhope to be able to hand over to you enough to afford a living.”\n\nI thought of Cullingworth’s advice about going where you are least\nknown. “I think,” said I, “that, my chances would be better away from\nhere.”\n\n“Then you must lose no time in establishing yourself,” said he. “Your\nposition would be one of great responsibility if anything were to happen\nto me just now. I had hoped that you had found an excellent opening with\nthe Saltires; but I fear that you can hardly expect to get on in the\nworld, my boy, if you insult your employer’s religious and political\nview at his own table.”\n\nIt wasn’t a time to argue, so I said nothing. My father took a copy of\nthe Lancet out of his desk, and turned up an advertisement which he had\nmarked with a blue pencil. “Read this!” said he.\n\nI’ve got it before me as I write. It runs thus: Qualified Assistant.\nWanted at once in a large country and colliery practice. Thorough\nknowledge of obstetrics and dispensing indispensable. Ride and drive.\nL70 a year. Apply Dr. Horton Merton on the Moors, Yorkshire.”\n\n“There might be an opening there,” said he. “I know Horton, and I am\nconvinced that I can get you the appointment. It would at least give\nyou the opportunity of looking round and seeing whether there was any\nvacancy there. How do you think it would suit you?”\n\nOf course I could only answer that I was willing to turn my hand\nto anything. But that interview has left a mark upon me--a heavy\never-present gloom away at the back of my soul, which I am conscious of\neven when the cause of it has for a moment gone out of my thoughts.\n\nI had enough to make a man serious before, when I had to face the world\nwithout money or interest. But now to think of the mother and my sisters\nand little Paul all leaning upon me when I cannot stand myself--it is\na nightmare. Could there be anything more dreadful in life than to have\nthose whom you love looking to you for help and to be unable to give it?\nBut perhaps it won’t come to that. Perhaps my father may hold his\nown for years. Come what may, I am bound to think that all things are\nordered for the best; though when the good is a furlong off, and we with\nour beetle eyes can only see three inches, it takes some confidence in\ngeneral principles to pull us through.\n\nWell, it was all fixed up; and down I came to Yorkshire. I wasn’t in the\nbest of spirits when I started, Bertie, but they went down and down as\nI neared my destination. How people can dwell in such places passes my\ncomprehension. What can life offer them to make up for these mutilations\nof the face of Nature? No woods, little grass, spouting chimneys,\nslate-coloured streams, sloping mounds of coke and slag, topped by\nthe great wheels and pumps of the mines. Cinder-strewn paths, black as\nthough stained by the weary miners who toil along them, lead through\nthe tarnished fields to the rows of smoke-stained cottages. How can any\nyoung unmarried man accept such a lot while there’s an empty hammock in\nthe navy, or a berth in a merchant forecastle? How many shillings a week\nis the breath of the ocean worth? It seems to me that if I were a poor\nman--well, upon my word, that “if” is rather funny when I think that\nmany of the dwellers in those smoky cottages have twice my salary with\nhalf my expenses.\n\nWell, as I said, my spirits sank lower and lower until they got down\ninto the bulb, when on looking through the gathering gloom I saw\n“Merton” printed on the lamps of a dreary dismal station. I got out, and\nwas standing beside my trunk and my hat-box, waiting for a porter, when\nup came a cheery-looking fellow and asked me whether I was Dr. Stark\nMunro. “I’m Horton,” said he; and shook hands cordially.\n\nIn that melancholy place the sight of him was like a fire on a frosty\nnight. He was gaily dressed in the first place, check trousers, white\nwaistcoat, a flower in his button hole. But the look of the man was\nvery much to my heart. He was ruddy checked and black eyed, with a jolly\nstout figure and an honest genial smile. I felt as we clinched hands in\nthe foggy grimy station that I had met a man and a friend.\n\nHis carriage was waiting, and we drove out to his residence, The\nMyrtles, where I was speedily introduced both to his family and his\npractice. The former is small, and the latter enormous. The wife is\ndead; but her mother, Mrs. White, keeps house for him; and there are two\ndear little girls, about five and seven. Then there is an unqualified\nassistant, a young Irish student, who, with the three maids, the\ncoachman, and the stable boy, make up the whole establishment. When I\ntell you that we give four horses quite as much as they can do, you will\nhave an idea of the ground we cover.\n\nThe house, a large square brick one, standing in its own grounds, is\nbuilt on a small hill in an oasis of green fields. Beyond this, however,\non every side the veil of smoke hangs over the country, with the mine\npumps and the chimneys bristling out of it. It would be a dreadful place\nfor an idle man: but we are all so busy that we have hardly time to\nthink whether there’s a view or not.\n\nDay and night we are at work; and yet the three months have been very\npleasant ones to look back upon.\n\nI’ll give you an idea of what a day’s work is like. We breakfast about\nnine o’clock, and immediately afterwards the morning patients begin to\ndrop in. Many of them are very poor people, belonging to the colliery\nclubs, the principle of which is, that the members pay a little over a\nhalfpenny a week all the year round, well or ill, in return for which\nthey get medicine and attendance free. “Not much of a catch for the\ndoctors,” you would say, but it is astonishing what competition there\nis among them to get the appointment. You see it is a certainty for\none thing, and it leads indirectly to other little extras. Besides, it\namounts up surprisingly. I have no doubt that Horton has five or six\nhundred a year from his clubs alone. On the other hand, you can imagine\nthat club patients, since they pay the same in any case, don’t let their\nailments go very far before they are round in the consulting room.\n\nWell, then, by half-past nine we are in full blast. Horton is seeing\nthe better patients in the consulting room, I am interviewing the\npoorer ones in the waiting room, and McCarthy, the Irishman, making up\nprescriptions as hard as he can tear. By the club rules, patients are\nbound to find their own bottles and corks.\n\nThey generally remember the bottle, but always forget the cork. “Ye must\npay a pinny or ilse put your forefinger in,” says McCarthy. They have an\nidea that all the strength of the medicine goes if the bottle is open,\nso they trot off with their fingers stuck in the necks. They have the\nmost singular notions about medicines. “It’s that strong that a spoon\nwill stand oop in’t!” is one man’s description. Above all, they love to\nhave two bottles, one with a solution of citric acid, and the other with\ncarbonate of soda. When the mixture begins to fizz, they realise that\nthere is indeed a science of medicine.\n\nThis sort of work, with vaccinations, bandagings, and minor surgery,\ntakes us to nearly eleven o’clock, when we assemble in Horton’s room to\nmake out the list. All the names of patients under treatment are pinned\nupon a big board. We sit round with note books open, and distribute\nthose who must be seen between us. By the time this is done and the\nhorses in, it is half-past eleven. Then away we all FLY upon our several\ntasks: Horton in a carriage and pair to see the employers; I in a dog\ncart to see the employed; and McCarthy on his good Irish legs to see\nthose chronic cases to which a qualified man can do no good, and an\nunqualified no harm.\n\nWell, we all work back again by two o’clock, when we find dinner waiting\nfor us. We may or may not have finished our rounds. If not away we go\nagain. If we have, Horton dictates his prescriptions, and strides off\nto bed with his black clay pipe in his mouth. He is the most abandoned\nsmoker I have ever met with, collecting the dottles of his pipes in\nthe evening, and smoking them the next morning before breakfast in the\nstable yard. When he has departed for his nap, McCarthy and I get to\nwork on the medicine. There are, perhaps, fifty bottles to put up, with\npills, ointment, etc. It is quite half-past four before we have them all\nlaid out on the shelf addressed to the respective invalids. Then we have\nan hour or so of quiet, when we smoke or read, or box with the coachman\nin the harness room. After tea the evening’s work commences. From six to\nnine people are coming in for their medicine, or fresh patients wishing\nadvice. When these are settled we have to see again any very grave cases\nwhich may be on the list; and so, about ten o’clock, we may hope to have\nanother smoke, and perhaps a game of cards. Then it is a rare thing for\na night to pass without one or other of us having to trudge off to a\ncase which may take us two hours, or may take us ten. Hard work, as you\nsee; but Horton is such a good chap, and works so hard himself, that one\ndoes not mind what one does. And then we are all like brothers in the\nhouse; our talk is just a rattle of chaff, and the patients are as\nhomely as ourselves, so that the work becomes quite a pleasure to all of\nus.\n\nYes, Horton is a real right-down good fellow. His heart is broad and\nkind and generous. There is nothing petty in the man. He loves to see\nthose around him happy; and the sight of his sturdy figure and jolly red\nface goes far to make them so. Nature meant him to be a healer; for he\nbrightens up a sick room as he did the Merton station when first I set\neyes upon him. Don’t imagine from my description that he is in any\nway soft, however. There is no one on whom one could be less likely to\nimpose. He has a temper which is easily aflame and as easily appeased.\nA mistake in the dispensing may wake it up and then he bursts into\nthe surgery like a whiff of cast wind, his checks red, his whiskers\nbristling, and his eyes malignant. The daybook is banged, the bottles\nrattled, the counter thumped, and then he is off again with five doors\nslamming behind him. We can trace his progress when the black mood is on\nhim by those dwindling slams. Perhaps it is that McCarthy has labelled\nthe cough mixture as the eye-wash, or sent an empty pillbox with an\nexhortation to take one every four hours. In any case the cyclone comes\nand goes, and by the next meal all is peace once more.\n\nI said that the patients were very homely. Any one who is over-starched\nmight well come here to be unstiffened. I confess that I did not quite\nfall in with it at once. When on one of my first mornings a club patient\nwith his bottle under his arm came up to me and asked me if I were the\ndoctor’s man, I sent him on to see the groom in the stable. But soon one\nfalls into the humour of it. There is no offence meant; and why should\nany be taken? They are kindly, generous folk; and if they pay no respect\nto your profession in the abstract, and so rather hurt your dignity,\nthey will be as leal and true as possible to yourself if you can win\ntheir respect. I like the grip of their greasy and blackened hands.\n\nAnother peculiarity of the district is that many of the manufacturers\nand colliery owners have risen from the workmen, and have (in some cases\nat least) retained their old manners and even their old dress. The other\nday Mrs. White, Horton’s mother-in-law, had a violent sick headache,\nand, as we are all very fond of the kind old lady, we were trying to\nkeep things as quiet as possible down-stairs. Suddenly there came\na bang! bang! bang! at the knocker; and then in an instant another\nrattling series of knocks, as if a tethered donkey were trying to kick\nin the panel. After all our efforts for silence it was exasperating. I\nrushed to the door to find a seedy looking person just raising his hand\nto commence a fresh bombardment. “What on earth’s the matter?” I asked,\nonly I may have been a little more emphatic. “Pain in the jaw,” said he.\n“You needn’t make such a noise,” said I; “other people are ill besides\nyou.” “If I pay my money, young man, I’ll make such noise as I like.”\n And actually in cold blood he commenced a fresh assault upon the door.\nHe would have gone on with his devil’s tattoo all morning if I had not\nled him down the path and seen him off the premises. An hour afterwards\nHorton whirled into the surgery, with a trail of banged doors behind\nhim. “What’s this about Mr. Usher, Munro?” he asked. “He says that you\nwere violent towards him.” “There was a club patient here who kept on\nbanging the knocker,” said I; “I was afraid that he would disturb Mrs.\nWhite, and so I made him stop.” Horton’s eyes began to twinkle. “My\nboy,” said he, “that club patient, as you call him, is the richest man\nin Merton, and worth a hundred a year to me.” I have no doubt that he\nappeased him by some tale of my disgrace and degradation; but I have not\nheard anything of the matter since.\n\nIt has been good for me to be here, Bertie. It has brought me in close\ncontact with the working classes, and made me realise what fine people\nthey are. Because one drunkard goes home howling on a Saturday night,\nwe are too apt to overlook the ninety-nine decent folk by their own\nfiresides. I shall not make that mistake any more. The kindliness of the\npoor to the poor makes a man sick of himself. And their sweet patience!\nDepend upon it, if ever there is a popular rising, the wrongs which lead\nto it must be monstrous and indefensible. I think the excesses of the\nFrench Revolution are dreadful enough in themselves, but much more so as\nan index to the slow centuries of misery against which they were a mad\nprotest. And then the wisdom of the poor! It is amusing to read the glib\nnewspaper man writing about the ignorance of the masses. They don’t\nknow the date of Magna Charta, or whom John of Gaunt married; but put\na practical up-to-date problem before them, and see how unerringly they\ntake the right side. Didn’t they put the Reform Bill through in the\nteeth of the opposition of the majority of the so-called educated\nclasses? Didn’t they back the North against the South when nearly all\nour leaders went wrong? When universal arbitration and the suppression\nof the liquor traffic comes, is it not sure to be from the pressure of\nthese humble folks? They look at life with clearer and more unselfish\neyes. It’s an axiom, I think, that to heighten a nation’s wisdom you\nmust lower its franchise.\n\nI often have my doubts, Bertie, if there is such a thing as the\nexistence of evil? If we could honestly convince ourselves that there\nwas not, it would help us so much in formulating a rational religion.\nBut don’t let us strain truth even for such an object as that. I must\nconfess that there are some forms of vice, cruelty for example, for\nwhich it is hard to find any explanation, save indeed that it is a\ndegenerate survival of that war-like ferocity which may once have been\nof service in helping to protect the community. No; let me be frank, and\nsay that I can’t make cruelty fit into my scheme. But when you find that\nother evils, which seem at first sight black enough, really tend in\nthe long run to the good of mankind, it may be hoped that those which\ncontinue to puzzle us may at last be found to serve the same end in some\nfashion which is now inexplicable.\n\nIt seems to me that the study of life by the physician vindicates the\nmoral principles of right and wrong. But when you look closely it is a\nquestion whether that which is a wrong to the present community may not\nprove to have been a right to the interests of posterity. That sounds\na little foggy; but I will make my meaning more clear when I say that\nI think right and wrong are both tools which are being wielded by those\ngreat hands which are shaping the destinies of the universe, that both\nare making for improvement; but that the action of the one is immediate,\nand that of the other more slow, but none the less certain. Our own\ndistinction of right and wrong is founded too much upon the immediate\nconvenience of the community, and does not inquire sufficiently deeply\ninto the ultimate effect.\n\nI have my own views about Nature’s methods, though I feel that it is\nrather like a beetle giving his opinions upon the milky way. However,\nthey have the merit of being consoling; for if we could conscientiously\nsee that sin served a purpose, and a good one, it would take some of the\nblackness out of life. It seems to me, then, that Nature, still working\non the lines of evolution, strengthens the race in two ways. The one is\nby improving those who are morally strong, which is done by increased\nknowledge and broadening religious views; the other, and hardly less\nimportant, is by the killing off and extinction of those who are morally\nweak. This is accomplished by drink and immorality. These are really two\nof the most important forces which work for the ultimate perfection of\nthe race. I picture them as two great invisible hands hovering over the\ngarden of life and plucking up the weeds. Looked at in one’s own day,\none can only see that they produce degradation and misery. But at the\nend of a third generation from then, what has happened? The line of the\ndrunkard and of the debauchee, physically as well as morally weakened,\nis either extinct or on the way towards it. Struma, tubercle, nervous\ndisease, have all lent a hand towards the pruning off of that rotten\nbranch, and the average of the race is thereby improved. I believe from\nthe little that I have seen of life, that it is a law which acts with\nstartling swiftness, that a majority of drunkards never perpetuate\ntheir species at all, and that when the curse is hereditary, the second\ngeneration generally sees the end of it.\n\nDon’t misunderstand me, and quote me as saying that it is a good thing\nfor a nation that it should have many drunkards. Nothing of the kind.\nWhat I say is, that if a nation has many morally weak people, then it\nis good that there should be a means for checking those weaker strains.\nNature has her devices, and drink is among them. When there are no more\ndrunkards and reprobates, it means that the race is so advanced that it\nno longer needs such rough treatment. Then the all-wise Engineer will\nspeed us along in some other fashion.\n\nI’ve been thinking a good deal lately about this question of the uses of\nevil, and of how powerful a tool it is in the hands of the Creator. Last\nnight the whole thing crystallised out quite suddenly into a small set\nof verses. Please jump them if they bore you.\n\n\n               WITH EITHER HAND.\n\n               1.\n\n\n               God’s own best will bide the test,\n                   And God’s own worst will fall;\n               But, best or worst or last or first,\n                   He ordereth it all.\n\n\n               2.\n\n\n               For ALL is good, if understood,\n                   (Ah, could we understand!)\n               And right and ill are tools of skill\n                   Held in His either hand.\n\n\n\n               3.\n\n\n               The harlot and the anchorite,\n                   The martyr and the rake,\n               Deftly He fashions each aright,\n                   Its vital part to take.\n\n\n\n               4.\n\n\n               Wisdom He makes to guide the sap\n                   Where the high blossoms be;\n               And Lust to kill the weaker branch,\n                   And Drink to trim the tree.\n\n\n               5.\n\n\n               And Holiness that so the bole\n                   Be solid at the core;\n               And Plague and Fever, that the whole\n                   Be changing evermore.\n\n\n\n               6.\n\n\n               He strews the microbes in the lung,\n                   The blood-clot in the brain;\n               With test and test He picks the best,\n                   Then tests them once again.\n\n\n\n               7.\n\n\n               He tests the body and the mind,\n                   He rings them o’er and o’er;\n               And if they crack, He throws them back,\n                   And fashions them once more.\n\n\n\n               8.\n\n\n               He chokes the infant throat with slime,\n                   He sets the ferment free;\n               He builds the tiny tube of lime\n                   That blocks the artery.\n\n\n\n               9.\n\n\n               He lets the youthful dreamer store\n                   Great projects in his brain,\n               Until he drops the fungus spore\n                   That smears them out again.\n\n\n\n               10.\n\n\n               He stores the milk that feeds the babe,\n                   He dulls the tortured nerve;\n               He gives a hundred joys of sense\n                   Where few or none might serve.\n\n\n\n               11.\n\n\n               And still he trains the branch of good\n                   Where the high blossoms be,\n               And wieldeth still the shears of ill\n                   To prune and prune His tree.\n\n\n\n               12.\n\n\n               So read I this--and as I try\n                   To write it clear again,\n               I feel a second finger lie\n                   Above mine on the pen.\n\n\n\n               13.\n\n\n               Dim are these peering eyes of mine,\n                   And dark what I have seen.\n               But be I wrong, the wrong is Thine,\n                   Else had it never been.\n\n\n\nI am quite ashamed of having been so didactic. But it is fine to think\nthat sin may have an object and work towards good. My father says that\nI seem to look upon the universe as if it were my property, and can’t be\nhappy until I know that all is right with it. Well, it does send a\nglow through me when I seem to catch a glimpse of the light behind the\nclouds.\n\nAnd now for my big bit of news which is going to change my whole\nlife. Whom do you think I had a letter from last Tuesday week? From\nCullingworth, no less. It had no beginning, no end, was addressed\nall wrong, and written with a very thick quill pen upon the back of a\nprescription. How it ever reached me is a wonder. This is what he had to\nsay:--\n\n“Started here in Bradfield last June. Colossal success. My example must\nrevolutionise medical practice. Rapidly making fortune. Have invention\nwhich is worth millions. Unless our Admiralty take it up shall make\nBrazil the leading naval power. Come down by next train on receiving\nthis. Have plenty for you to do.”\n\nThat was the whole of this extraordinary letter; it had no name to it,\nwhich was certainly reasonable enough, since no one else could have\nwritten it. Knowing Cullingworth as well as I did, I took it with\nreservations and deductions. How could he have made so rapid and\ncomplete a success in a town in which he must have been a complete\nstranger? It was incredible. And yet there must be some truth in it, or\nhe would not invite me to come down and test it. On the whole, I thought\nthat I had better move very cautiously in the matter; for I was happy\nand snug where I was, and kept on putting a little by, which I hoped\nwould form a nucleus to start me in practice. It is only a few pounds\nup to date, but in a year or so it might mount to something. I wrote\nto Cullingworth, therefore, thanking him for having remembered me, and\nexplaining how matters stood.\n\nI had had great difficulty in finding an opening, I said, and now that I\nhad one I was loth to give it up save for a permanency.\n\nTen days passed, during which Cullingworth was silent. Then came a huge\ntelegram.\n\n“Your letter to hand. Why not call me a liar at once? I tell you that I\nhave seen thirty thousand patients in the last year. My actual takings\nhave been over four thousand pounds. All patients come to me. Would not\ncross the street to see Queen Victoria. You can have all visiting, all\nsurgery, all midwifery. Make what you like of it. Will guarantee three\nhundred pounds the first year.”\n\nWell, this began to look more like business--especially that last\nsentence. I took it to Horton, and asked his advice. His opinion was\nthat I had nothing to lose and everything to gain. So it ended by my\nwiring back accepting the partnership--if it is a partnership--and\nto-morrow morning I am off to Bradfield with great hopes and a small\nportmanteau. I know how interested you are in the personality of\nCullingworth--as every one is who comes, even at second hand, within\nrange of his influence; and so you may rely upon it that I shall give\nyou a very full and particular account of all that passes between us. I\nam looking forward immensely to seeing him again, and I trust we won’t\nhave any rows.\n\nGoodbye, old chap. My foot is upon the threshold of fortune.\nCongratulate me.\n\n\n\n\nVI. THE PARADE, BRADFIELD, 7th March, 1882.\n\n\nIt is only two days since I wrote to you, my dear old chap, and yet I\nfind myself loaded to the muzzle and at full cock again. I have come to\nBradfield. I have seen old Cullingworth once more, and I have found\nthat all he has told me is true. Yes; incredible as it sounded, this\nwonderful fellow seems to have actually built up a great practice in\nlittle more than a year. He really is, with all his eccentricities, a\nvery remarkable man, Bertie. He doesn’t seem to have a chance of showing\nhis true powers in this matured civilisation. The law and custom hamper\nhim. He is the sort of fellow who would come right to the front in\na French Revolution. Or if you put him as Emperor over some of these\nlittle South American States, I believe that in ten years he would\neither be in his grave, or would have the Continent. Yes; Cullingworth\nis fit to fight for a higher stake than a medical practice, and on a\nbigger stage than an English provincial town. When I read of Aaron Burr\nin your history I always picture him as a man like C.\n\nI had the kindest of leave takings from Horton. If he had been my\nbrother he could not have been more affectionate. I could not have\nthought that I should grow so fond of a man in so short a time. He\ntakes the keenest interest in my venture, and I am to write him a full\naccount. He gave me as we parted a black old meerschaum which he had\ncoloured himself--the last possible pledge of affection from a smoker.\nIt was pleasant for me to feel that if all went wrong at Bradfield, I\nhad a little harbour at Merton for which I could make. Still, of course,\npleasant and instructive as the life there was, I could not shut my eyes\nto the fact that it would take a terribly long time before I could save\nenough to buy a share in a practice--a longer time probably than my poor\nfather’s strength would last. That telegram of Cullingworth’s in which,\nas you may remember, he guaranteed me three hundred pounds in the first\nyear, gave me hopes of a much more rapid career. You will agree with me,\nI am sure, that I did wisely to go to him.\n\nI had an adventure upon the way to Bradfield. The carriage in which\nI was travelling contained a party of three, at whom I took the most\ncasual of glances before settling down to the daily paper. There was an\nelderly lady, with a bright rosy face, gold spectacles, and a dash of\nred velvet in her bonnet. With her were two younger people, who I took\nto be her son and her daughter--the one a quiet, gentle-looking girl of\ntwenty or so, dressed in black, and the other a short, thick-set young\nfellow, a year or two older. The two ladies sat by each other in the\nfar corner, and the son (as I presume him to be) sat opposite me. We may\nhave travelled an hour or more without my paying any attention to\nthis little family party, save that I could not help hearing some talk\nbetween the two ladies. The younger, who was addressed as Winnie, had,\nas I noticed, a very sweet and soothing voice. She called the elder\n“mother,” which showed that I was right as to the relationship.\n\nI was sitting, then, still reading my paper, when I was surprised to\nget a kick on the shins from the young fellow opposite. I moved my legs,\nthinking that it was an accident, but an instant afterwards I received\nanother and a harder one. I dropped my paper with a growl, but the\nmoment that I glanced at him I saw how the matter stood. His foot was\njerking spasmodically, his two hands clenched, and drumming against his\nbreast, while his eyes were rolling upwards until only the rim of his\niris was to be seen. I sprang upon him, tore open his collar, unbuttoned\nhis waistcoat, and pulled his head down upon the seat. Crash went one of\nhis heels through the carriage window, but I contrived to sit upon his\nknees while I kept hold of his two wrists.\n\n“Don’t be alarmed!” I cried, “it’s epilepsy, and will soon pass!”\n\nGlancing up, I saw that the little girl was sitting very pale and quiet\nin the corner. The mother had pulled a bottle out of her bag and was\nquite cool and helpful.\n\n“He often has them,” said she, “this is bromide.”\n\n“He is coming out,” I answered; “you look after Winnie.”\n\nI blurted it out because her head seemed to rock as if she were going\noff; but the absurdity of the thing struck us all next moment, and the\nmother burst into a laugh in which the daughter and I joined. The son\nhad opened his eyes and had ceased to struggle.\n\n“I must really beg your pardon,” said I, as I helped him up again. “I\nhad not the advantage of knowing your other name, and I was in such a\nhurry that I had no time to think what I was saying.”\n\nThey laughed again in the most good-humoured way, and, as soon as\nthe young fellow had recovered, we all joined in quite a confidential\nconversation. It is wonderful how the intrusion of any of the realities\nof life brushes away the cobwebs of etiquette. In half an hour we knew\nall about each other, or at any rate I knew all about them. Mrs. La\nForce was the mother’s name, a widow with these two children. They had\ngiven up housekeeping, and found it more pleasant to live in apartments,\ntravelling from one watering place to another. Their one trouble was\nthe nervous weakness of the son Fred. They were now on their way to\nBirchespool, where they hoped that he might get some good from the\nbracing air. I was able to recommend vegetarianism, which I have found\nto act like a charm in such cases. We had quite a spirited conversation,\nand I think that we were sorry on both sides when we came to the\njunction where they had to change. Mrs. La Force gave me her card, and I\npromised to call if ever I should be in Birchespool.\n\nHowever, all this must be stupid enough to you. You know my little ways\nby this time, and you don’t expect me to keep on the main line of my\nstory. However, I am back on the rails now, and I shall try to remain\nthere.\n\nWell, it was nearly six o’clock, and evening was just creeping in when\nwe drew up in Bradfield Station. The first thing I saw when I looked out\nof the window was Cullingworth, exactly the same as ever, striding in\nhis jerky way down the platform, his coat flying open, his chin thrust\nforward (he is the most under-hung man I have ever seen), and his great\nteeth all gleaming, like a good-natured blood-hound. He roared with\ndelight when he saw me, wrung my hand, and slapped me enthusiastically\nupon the shoulder.\n\n“My dear chap!” said he. “We’ll clear this town out. I tell you, Munro,\nwe won’t leave a doctor in it. It’s all they can do now to get butter\nto their bread; and when we get to work together they’ll have to eat it\ndry. Listen to me, my boy! There are a hundred and twenty thousand folk\nin this town, all shrieking for advice, and there isn’t a doctor who\nknows a rhubarb pill from a calculus. Man, we only have to gather them\nin. I stand and take the money until my arm aches.”\n\n“But how is it?” I asked, as we pushed our way through the crowd, “are\nthere so few other doctors?”\n\n“Few!” he roared. “By Crums, the streets are blocked with them. You\ncouldn’t fall out of a window in this town without killing a doctor. But\nof all the ---- well, there, you’ll see them for yourself. You walked to\nmy house at Avonmouth, Munro. I don’t let my friends walk to my house at\nBradfield--eh, what?”\n\nA well-appointed carriage with two fine black horses was drawn up at\nthe station entrance. The smart coachman touched his hat as Cullingworth\nopened the door.\n\n“Which of the houses, sir?” he asked.\n\nCullingworth’s eyes shot round to me to see what I thought of such a\nquery. Between ourselves I have not the slightest doubt that he had\ninstructed the man to ask it. He always had a fine eye for effect, but\nhe usually erred by underrating the intelligence of those around him.\n\n“Ah!” said he, rubbing his chin like a man in doubt. “Well, I daresay\ndinner will be nearly ready. Drive to the town residential.”\n\n“Good gracious, Cullingworth!” said I as we started. “How many houses do\nyou inhabit? It sounds as if you had bought the town.”\n\n“Well, well,” said he, laughing, “we are driving to the house where I\nusually live. It suits us very well, though I have not been able to get\nall the rooms furnished yet. Then I have a little farm of a few hundred\nacres just outside the city. It is a pleasant place for the week ends,\nand we send the nurse and the child----”\n\n“My dear chap, I did not know that you had started a family!”\n\n“Yes, it’s an infernal nuisance; but still the fact remains. We get our\nbutter and things from the farm. Then, of course, I have my house of\nbusiness in the heart of the city.”\n\n“Consulting and waiting room, I suppose?”\n\nHe looked at me with a sort of half vexed, half amused expression. “You\ncannot rise to a situation, Munro,” said he. “I never met a fellow with\nsuch a stodgy imagination. I’d trust you to describe a thing when you\nhave seen it, but never to build up an idea of it beforehand.”\n\n“What’s the trouble now?” I asked.\n\n“Well, I have written to you about my practice, and I’ve wired to you\nabout it, and here you sit asking me if I work it in two rooms. I’ll\nhave to hire the market square before I’ve finished, and then I won’t\nhave space to wag my elbows. Can your imagination rise to a great house\nwith people waiting in every room, jammed in as tight as they’ll fit,\nand two layers of them squatting in the cellar? Well, that’s my house of\nbusiness on an average day. The folk come in from the county fifty miles\noff, and eat bread and treacle on the doorstep, so as to be first in\nwhen the housekeeper comes down. The medical officer of health made an\nofficial complaint of the over-crowding of my waiting-rooms. They wait\nin the stables, and sit along the racks and under the horses’ bellies.\nI’ll turn some of ‘em on to you, my boy, and then you’ll know a little\nmore about it.”\n\nWell, all this puzzled me a good deal, as you can imagine, Bertie; for,\nmaking every allowance for Cullingworth’s inflated way of talking, there\nmust be something at the back of it. I was thinking to myself that I\nmust keep my head cool, and have a look at everything with my own eyes,\nwhen the carriage pulled up and we got out.\n\n“This is my little place,” said Cullingworth.\n\nIt was the corner house of a line of fine buildings, and looked to me\nmuch more like a good-sized hotel than a private mansion. It had a broad\nsweep of steps leading to the door, and towered away up to five or six\nstories, with pinnacles and a flagstaff on the top. As a matter of fact,\nI learned that before Cullingworth took it, it had been one of the chief\nclubs in the town, but the committee had abandoned it on account of\nthe heavy rent. A smart maid opened the door; and a moment later I\nwas shaking hands with Mrs. Cullingworth, who was all kindliness and\ncordiality. She has, I think, forgotten the little Avonmouth business,\nwhen her husband and I fell out.\n\nThe inside of the house was even huger than I had thought from the look\nof the exterior. There were over thirty bedrooms, Cullingworth informed\nme, as he helped me to carry my portmanteau upstairs. The hall and first\nstair were most excellently furnished and carpetted, but it all run\nto nothing at the landing. My own bedroom had a little iron bed, and a\nsmall basin standing on a packing case. Cullingworth took a hammer from\nthe mantelpiece, and began to knock in nails behind the door.\n\n“These will do to hang your clothes on,” said he; “you don’t mind\nroughing it a little until we get things in order?”\n\n“Not in the least.”\n\n“You see,” he explained, “there’s no good my putting a forty pound suite\ninto a bed-room, and then having to chuck it all out of the window in\norder to make room for a hundred-pound one. No sense in that, Munro!\nEh, what! I’m going to furnish this house as no house has ever been\nfurnished. By Crums! I’ll bring the folk from a hundred miles round just\nto have leave to look at it. But I must do it room by room. Come down\nwith me and look at the dining-room. You must be hungry after your\njourney.”\n\nIt really was furnished in a marvellous way--nothing flash, and\neverything magnificent. The carpet was so rich that my feet seemed to\nsink into it as into deep moss. The soup was on the table, and Mrs.\nCullingworth sitting down, but he kept hauling me round to look at\nsomething else.\n\n“Go on, Hetty,” he cried over his shoulder. “I just want to show Munro\nthis. Now, these plain dining-room chairs, what d’you think they cost\neach? Eh, what?”\n\n“Five pounds,” said I at a venture.\n\n“Exactly!” he cried, in great delight; “thirty pounds for the six. You\nhear, Hetty! Munro guessed the price first shot. Now, my boy, what for\nthe pair of curtains?”\n\nThey were a magnificent pair of stamped crimson velvet, with a two-foot\ngilt cornice above them. I thought that I had better not imperil my\nnewly gained reputation by guessing.\n\n“Eighty pounds!” he roared, slapping them with the back of his hand.\n“Eighty pounds, Munro! What d’ye think of that? Everything that I\nhave in this house is going to be of the best. Why, look at this\nwaiting-maid! Did you ever see a neater one?”\n\nHe swung the girl, towards me by the arm.\n\n“Don’t be silly, Jimmy,” said Mrs. Cullingworth mildly, while he\nroared with laughter, with all his fangs flashing under his\nbristling moustache. The girl edged closer to her mistress, looking\nhalf-frightened and half-angry.\n\n“All right, Mary, no harm!” he cried. “Sit down, Munro, old chap. Get a\nbottle of champagne, Mary, and we’ll drink to more luck.”\n\nWell, we had a very pleasant little dinner. It is never slow if\nCullingworth is about. He is one of those men who make a kind of\nmagnetic atmosphere, so that you feel exhilarated and stimulated in\ntheir presence. His mind is so nimble and his thoughts so extravagant,\nthat your own break away from their usual grooves, and surprise you\nby their activity. You feel pleased at your own inventiveness and\noriginality, when you are really like the wren when it took a lift on\nthe eagle’s shoulder. Old Peterson, you remember, used to have a similar\neffect upon you in the Linlithgow days.\n\nIn the middle of dinner he plunged off, and came back with a round bag\nabout the size of a pomegranate in his hand.\n\n“What d’ye think this is, Munro? Eh?”\n\n“I have no idea.”\n\n“Our day’s take. Eh, Hetty?” He undid a string, and in an instant a pile\nof gold and silver rattled down upon the cloth, the coins whirling and\nclinking among the dishes. One rolled off the table and was retrieved by\nthe maid from some distant corner.\n\n“What is it, Mary? A half sovereign? Put it in your pocket. What did the\nlot come to, Hetty?”\n\n“Thirty-one pound eight.”\n\n“You see, Munro! One day’s work.” He plunged his hand into his trouser\npocket and brought out a pile of sovereigns, which he balanced in his\npalm. “Look at that, laddie. Rather different from my Avonmouth form,\neh? What?”\n\n“It will be good news for them,” I suggested.\n\n\nHe was scowling at me in an instant with all his old ferocity. You\ncannot imagine a more savage-looking creature than Cullingworth is when\nhis temper goes wrong. He gets a perfectly fiendish expression in his\nlight blue eyes, and all his hair bristles up like a striking cobra. He\nisn’t a beauty at his best, but at his worst he’s really phenomenal. At\nthe first danger signal his wife had ordered the maid from the room.\n\n“What rot you do talk, Munro!” he cried. “Do you suppose I am going to\ncripple myself for years by letting those debts hang on to me?”\n\n“I understood that you had promised,” said I. “Still, of course, it is\nno business of mine.”\n\n“I should hope not,” he cried. “A tradesman stands to win or to lose.\nHe allows a margin for bad debts. I would have paid it if I could. I\ncouldn’t, and so I wiped the slate clean. No one in his senses would\ndream of spending all the money that I make in Bradfield upon the\ntradesmen of Avonmouth.”\n\n“Suppose they come down upon you?”\n\n“Well, we’ll see about that when they do. Meanwhile I am paying ready\nmoney for every mortal thing that comes up the door steps. They think so\nwell of me here that I could have had the whole place furnished like a\npalace from the drain pipes to the flagstaff, only I determined to take\neach room in turn when I was ready for it. There’s nearly four hundred\npounds under this one ceiling.”\n\nThere came a tap at the door, and in walked a boy in buttons.\n\n“If you please, sir, Mr. Duncan wishes to see you.”\n\n“Give my compliments to Mr. Duncan, and tell him he may go to the\ndevil!”\n\n“My dear Jimmy!” cried Mrs. Cullingworth.\n\n“Tell him I am at dinner; and if all the kings in Europe were waiting in\nthe hall with their crowns in their hands I wouldn’t cross that door mat\nto see them.”\n\nThe boy vanished, but was back in an instant.\n\n“Please, sir, he won’t go.”\n\n“Won’t go! What d’you mean?” Cullingworth sat with his mouth open and\nhis knife and fork sticking up. “What d’you mean, you brat? What are you\nboggling about?”\n\n“It’s his bill, sir,” said the frightened boy.\n\nCullingworth’s face grew dusky, and the veins began to swell on his\nforehead.\n\n“His bill, eh! Look here!” He took his watch out and laid it on the\ntable. “It’s two minutes to eight. At eight I’m coming out, and if I\nfind him there I’ll strew the street with him. Tell him I’ll shred him\nover the parish. He has two minutes to save his life in, and one of them\nis nearly gone.”\n\nThe boy bolted from the room, and in an instant afterwards we heard\nthe bang of the front door, with a clatter of steps down the stairs.\nCullingworth lay back in his chair and roared until the tears shone\non his eyelashes, while his wife quivered all over with sympathetic\nmerriment.\n\n“I’ll drive him mad,” Cullingworth sobbed at last. “He’s a nervous,\nchicken-livered kind of man; and when I look at him he turns the colour\nof putty. If I pass his shop I usually just drop in and stand and look\nat him. I never speak, but just look. It paralyses him. Sometimes the\nshop is full of people; but it is just the same.”\n\n“Who is he, then?” I asked.\n\n“He’s my corn merchant. I was saying that I paid my tradesmen as I go,\nbut he is the only exception. He has done me once or twice, you see;\nand so I try to take it out of him. By the way, you might send him down\ntwenty pounds to-morrow, Hetty. It’s time for an instalment.”\n\nWhat a gossip you will think me, Bertie? But when I begin, my memory\nbrings everything back so clearly, and I write on and on almost\nunconsciously. Besides, this fellow is such a mixture of qualities, that\nI could never give you any idea of him by myself; and so I just try to\nrepeat to you what he says, and what he does, so that you may build up\nyour own picture of the man. I know that he has always interested you,\nand that he does so more now than ever since our fates have drawn us\ntogether again.\n\nAfter dinner, we went into the back room, which was the most\nextraordinary contrast to the front one, having only a plain deal table,\nand half-a-dozen kitchen chairs scattered about on a linoleum floor.\nAt one end was an electric battery and a big magnet. At the other, a\npacking case with several pistols and a litter of cartridges upon it. A\nrook rifle was leaning tip against it, and looking round I saw that the\nwalls were all pocked with bullet marks.\n\n“What’s this, then?” I asked, rolling my eyes round.\n\n“Hetty, what’s this?” he asked, with his pipe in his hand and his head\ncocked sideways.\n\n“Naval supremacy and the command of the seas,” said she, like a child\nrepeating a lesson.\n\n“That’s it,” he shouted, stabbing at me with the amber. “Naval supremacy\nand command of the seas. It’s all here right under your nose. I tell\nyou, Munro, I could go to Switzerland to-morrow, and I could say to\nthem--‘Look here, you haven’t got a seaboard and you haven’t got a port;\nbut just find me a ship, and hoist your flag on it, and I’ll give you\nevery ocean under heaven.’ I’d sweep the seas until there wasn’t a\nmatch-box floating on them. Or I could make them over to a limited\ncompany, and join the board after allotment. I hold the salt water in\nthe cup of this hand, every drop of it.”\n\nHis wife put her hands on his shoulder with admiration in her eyes. I\nturned to knock out my pipe, and grinned over the grate.\n\n“Oh, you may grin,” said he. (He was wonderfully quick at spotting what\nyou were doing.) “You’ll grin a little wider when you see the dividends\ncoming in. What’s the value of that magnet?”\n\n“A pound?”\n\n“A million pounds. Not a penny under. And dirt cheap to the nation that\nbuys it. I shall let it go at that, though I could make ten times as\nmuch if I held on. I shall take it up to the Secretary of the Navy in\na week or two; and if he seems to be a civil deserving sort of person I\nshall do business with him. It’s not every day, Munro, that a man comes\ninto his office with the Atlantic under one arm and the Pacific under\nthe other. Eh, what?”\n\nI knew it would make him savage, but I lay back in my chair and laughed\nuntil I was tired. His wife looked at me reproachfully; but he, after a\nmoment of blackness, burst out laughing also, stamping up and down the\nroom and waving his arms.\n\n“Of course it seems absurd to you,” he cried. “Well, I daresay it would\nto me if any other fellow had worked it out. But you may take my word\nfor it that it’s all right. Hetty here will answer for it. Won’t you,\nHetty?”\n\n“It’s splendid, my dear.”\n\n“Now I’ll show you, Munro; what an unbelieving Jew you are, trying to\nlook interested, and giggling at the back of your throat! In the first\nplace, I have discovered a method--which I won’t tell you--of increasing\nthe attractive power of a magnet a hundred-fold. Have you grasped that?”\n\n“Yes.”\n\n“Very good. You are also aware, I presume, that modern projectiles are\neither made of or tipped with steel. It may possibly have come to your\nears that magnets attract steel. Permit me now to show you a small\nexperiment.” He bent over his apparatus, and I suddenly heard the\nsnapping of electricity. “This,” he continued going across to the\npacking case, “is a saloon pistol, and will be exhibited in the museums\nof the next century as being the weapon with which the new era was\ninaugurated. Into the breech I place a Boxer cartridge, specialty\nprovided for experimental purposes with a steel bullet. I aim point\nblank at the dab of red sealing wax upon the wall, which is four inches\nabove the magnet. I am an absolutely dead shot. I fire. You will now\nadvance, and satisfy yourself that the bullet is flattened upon the end\nof the magnet, after which you will apologise to me for that grin.”\n\nI looked, and it certainly was as he had said.\n\n“I’ll tell you what I would do,” he cried. “I am prepared to put that\nmagnet in Hetty’s bonnet, and to let you fire six shots straight at her\nface. How’s that for a test? You wouldn’t mind, Hetty? Eh, what!”\n\n“I don’t think she would have objected, but I hastened to disclaim any\nshare in such an experiment.\n\n“Of course, you see that the whole thing is to scale. My warship of the\nfuture carries at her prow and stern a magnet which shall be as much\nlarger than that as the big shell will be larger than this tiny bullet.\nOr I might have a separate raft, possibly, to carry my apparatus. My\nship goes into action. What happens then, Munro? Eh, what! Every shot\nfired at her goes smack on to the magnet. There’s a reservoir below into\nwhich they drop when the electric circuit is broken. After every action\nthey are sold by auction for old metal, and the result divided as prize\nmoney among the crew. But think of it, man! I tell you it is an absolute\nimpossibility for a shot to strike any ship which is provided with my\napparatus. And then look at the cheapness. You don’t want armour. You\nwant nothing. Any ship that floats becomes invulnerable with one of\nthese. The war ship of the future will cost anything from seven pound\nten. You’re grinning again; but if you give me a magnet and a Brixton\ntrawler with a seven-pounder gun I’ll show sport to the finest\nbattle-ship afloat.”\n\n“Well, there must be some flaw about this,” I suggested. “If your magnet\nis so strong as all that, you would have your own broadside boomeranging\nback upon you.”\n\n“Not a bit of it! There’s a big difference between a shot flying away\nfrom you with all its muzzle velocity, and another one which is coming\ntowards you and only needs a slight deflection to strike the magnet.\nBesides, by breaking the circuit I can take off the influence when I\nam firing my own broadside. Then I connect, and instantly become\ninvulnerable.”\n\n“And your nails and screws?”\n\n“The warship of the future will be bolted together by wood.”\n\nWell, he would talk of nothing else the whole evening but of this\nwonderful invention of his. Perhaps there is nothing in it--probably\nthere is not; and yet it illustrates the many-sided nature of the man,\nthat he should not say one word about his phenomenal success here--of\nwhich I am naturally most anxious to hear--not a word either upon the\nimportant subject of our partnership, but will think and talk of nothing\nbut this extraordinary naval idea. In a week he will have tossed it\naside in all probability, and be immersed in some plan for reuniting the\nJews and settling them in Madagascar. Yet from all he has said, and all\nI have seen, there can be no doubt that he has in some inexplicable way\nmade a tremendous hit, and to-morrow I shall let you know all about\nit. Come what may, I am delighted that I came, for things promise to be\ninteresting. Regard this not as the end of a letter, but of a paragraph.\nYou shall have the conclusion to-morrow, or on Thursday at the latest.\nGoodbye, and my remembrance to Lawrence if you see him. How’s your\nfriend from Yale?\n\n\n\n\nVII. THE PARADE, BRADFIELD, 9th March, 1882.\n\n\nWell, you see I am as good as my word, Bertie; and here is a full\naccount of this queer little sample gouged out of real life, never to be\nseen, I should fancy, by any eye save your own. I have written to Horton\nalso, and of course to my mother; but I don’t go into detail with them,\nas I have got into the way of doing with you. You keep on assuring me\nthat you like it; so on your own head be it if you find my experiences\ngradually developing into a weariness.\n\nWhen I woke in the morning, and looked round at the bare walls and the\nbasin on the packing case, I hardly knew where I was. Cullingworth came\ncharging into the room in his dressing gown, however, and roused me\neffectually by putting his hands on the rail at the end of the bed, and\nthrowing a somersault over it which brought his heels on to my pillow\nwith a thud. He was in great spirits, and, squatting on the bed, he held\nforth about his plans while I dressed.\n\n“I tell you one of the first things I mean to do, Munro,” said he. “I\nmean to have a paper of my own. We’ll start a weekly paper here, you and\nI, and we’ll make them sit up all round. We’ll have an organ of our own,\njust like every French politician. If any one crosses us, we’ll make\nthem wish they had never been born. Eh, what, laddie? what d’you think?\nSo clever, Munro, that everybody’s bound to read it, and so scathing\nthat it will just fetch out blisters every time. Don’t you think we\ncould?”\n\n“What politics?” I asked.\n\n“Oh, curse the politics! Red pepper well rubbed in, that’s my idea of a\npaper. Call it the Scorpion. Chaff the Mayor and the Council until they\ncall a meeting and hang themselves. I’d do the snappy paragraphs, and\nyou would do the fiction and poetry. I thought about it during the\nnight, and Hetty has written to Murdoch’s to get an estimate for the\nprinting. We might get our first number out this day week.”\n\n“My dear chap!” I gasped.\n\n“I want you to start a novel this morning. You won’t get many patients\nat first, and you’ll have lots of time.”\n\n“But I never wrote a line in my life.”\n\n“A properly balanced man can do anything he sets his hand to. He’s\ngot every possible quality inside him, and all he wants is the will to\ndevelop it.”\n\n“Could you write a novel yourself?” I asked.\n\n“Of course I could. Such a novel, Munro, that when they’d read the first\nchapter the folk would just sit groaning until the second came out.\nThey’d wait in rows outside my door in the hope of hearing what was\ncoming next. By Crums, I’ll go and begin it now!” And, with another\nsomersault over the end of the bed, he rushed from the room, with the\ntassels of his dressing gown flying behind him.\n\nI daresay you’ve quite come to the conclusion by this time that\nCullingworth is simply an interesting pathological study--a man in the\nfirst stage of lunacy or general paralysis. You might not be so sure\nabout it if you were in close contact with him. He justifies his wildest\nflights by what he does. It sounds grotesque when put down in black and\nwhite; but then it would have sounded equally grotesque a year ago if he\nhad said that he would build up a huge practice in a twelvemonth. Now we\nsee that he has done it. His possibilities are immense. He has such\nhuge energy at the back of his fertility of invention. I am afraid, on\nthinking over all that I have written to you, that I may have given you\na false impression of the man by dwelling too much on those incidents\nin which he has shown the strange and violent side of his character, and\nomitting the stretches between where his wisdom and judgment have had a\nchance. His conversation when he does not fly off at a tangent is\nfull of pith and idea. “The greatest monument ever erected to Napoleon\nBuonaparte was the British National debt,” said he yesterday. Again,\n“We must never forget that the principal export of Great Britain to the\nUnited States IS the United States.” Again, speaking of Christianity,\n“What is intellectually unsound cannot be morally sound.” He shoots off\na whole column of aphorisms in a single evening. I should like to have\na man with a note book always beside him to gather up his waste. No; you\nmust not let me give you a false impression of the man’s capacity.\nOn the other hand, it would be dishonest to deny that I think him\nthoroughly unscrupulous, and full of very sinister traits. I am much\nmistaken, however, if he has not fine strata in his nature. He is\ncapable of rising to heights as well as of sinking to depths.\n\nWell, when we had breakfasted we got into the carriage and drove off to\nthe place of business.\n\n“I suppose you are surprised at Hetty coming with us, said Cullingworth,\nslapping me on the knee. Hetty, Munro is wondering what the devil you\nare here for, only he is too polite to ask.”\n\nIn fact, it HAD struck me as rather strange that she should, as a matter\nof course, accompany us to business.\n\n“You’ll see when we get there,” he cried chuckling. “We run this affair\non lines of our own.”\n\nIt was not very far, and we soon found ourselves outside a square\nwhitewashed building, which had a huge “Dr. Cullingworth” on a great\nbrass plate at the side of the door. Underneath was printed “May be\nconsulted gratis from ten to four.” The door was open, and I caught a\nglimpse of a crowd of people waiting in the hall.\n\n“How many here?” asked Cullingworth of the page boy.\n\n“A hundred and forty, sir.”\n\n“All the waiting rooms full?”\n\n“Yes, sir.”\n\n“Courtyard full?\n\n“Yes, sir.”\n\n“Stable full?”\n\n“Yes, sir.”\n\n“Coach-house full?”\n\n“There’s still room in the coach-house, sir.”\n\n“Ah, I’m sorry we haven’t got a crowded day for you, Munro,” said he.\n“Of course, we can’t command these things, and must take them as they\ncome. Now then, now then, make a gangway, can’t you?”--this to his\npatients. “Come here and see the waiting-room. Pooh! what an atmosphere!\nWhy on earth can’t you open the windows for yourselves? I never saw\nsuch folk! There are thirty people in this room, Munro, and not one with\nsense enough to open a window to save himself from suffocation.”\n\n“I tried, sir, but there’s a screw through the sash,” cried one fellow.\n\n“Ah, my boy, you’ll never get on in the world if you can’t open a\nwindow without raising a sash,” said Cullingworth, slapping him on the\nshoulder. He took the man’s umbrella and stuck it through two of the\npanes of glass.\n\n“That’s the way!” he said. “Boy, see that the screw is taken out. Now\nthen, Munro, come along, and we’ll get to work.”\n\nWe went up a wooden stair, uncarpeted, leaving every room beneath us,\nas far as I could see, crowded with patients. At the top was a bare\npassage, which had two rooms opposite to each other at one end, and a\nsingle one at the other.\n\n“This is my consulting room,” said he, leading the way into one of\nthese. It was a good-sized square chamber, perfectly empty save for\ntwo plain wooden chairs and an unpainted table with two books and a\nstethoscope upon it. “It doesn’t look like four or five thousand a year,\ndoes it? Now, there is an exactly similar one opposite which you can\nhave for yourself. I’ll send across any surgical cases which may turn\nup. To-day, however, I think you had better stay with me, and see how I\nwork things.”\n\n“I should very much like to,” said I.\n\n“There are one or two elementary rules to be observed in the way of\nhandling patients,” he remarked, seating himself on the table and\nswinging his legs. “The most obvious is that you must never let them see\nthat you want them. It should be pure condescension on your part seeing\nthem at all; and the more difficulties you throw in the way of it, the\nmore they think of it. Break your patients in early, and keep them well\nto heel. Never make the fatal mistake of being polite to them. Many\nfoolish young men fall into this habit, and are ruined in consequence.\nNow, this is my form”--he sprang to the door, and putting his two hands\nto his mouth he bellowed: “Stop your confounded jabbering down there! I\nmight as well be living above a poultry show! There, you see,” he added\nto me, “they will think ever so much more of me for that.”\n\n“But don’t they get offended?” I asked.\n\n“I’m afraid not. I have a name for this sort of thing now, and they have\ncome to expect it. But an offended patient--I mean a thoroughly insulted\none--is the finest advertisement in the world. If it is a woman,\nshe runs clacking about among her friends until your name becomes a\nhousehold word, and they all pretend to sympathise with her, and\nagree among themselves that you must be a remarkably discerning man. I\nquarrelled with one man about the state of his gall duct, and it ended\nby my throwing him down the stairs. What was the result? He talked so\nmuch about it that the whole village from which he came, sick and\nwell, trooped to see me. The little country practitioner who had been\nbuttering them up for a quarter of a century found that he might as well\nput up his shutters. It’s human nature, my boy, and you can’t alter it.\nEh, what? You make yourself cheap and you become cheap. You put a high\nprice on yourself and they rate you at that price. Suppose I set up in\nHarley Street to-morrow, and made it all nice and easy, with hours from\nten to three, do you think I should get a patient? I might starve first.\nHow would I work it? I should let it be known that I only saw patients\nfrom midnight until two in the morning, and that bald-headed people\nmust pay double. That would set people talking, their curiosity would\nbe stimulated, and in four months the street would be blocked all night.\nEh, what? laddie, you’d go yourself. That’s my principle here. I often\ncome in of a morning and send them all about their business, tell them\nI’m going off to the country for a day. I turn away forty pounds, and\nit’s worth four hundred as an advertisement!”\n\n“But I understood from the plate that the consultations were gratis.”\n\n“So they are, but they have to pay for the medicine. And if a patient\nwishes to come out of turn he has to pay half-a-guinea for the\nprivilege. There are generally about twenty every day who would rather\npay that than wait several hours. But, mind you, Munro, don’t you make\nany mistake about this! All this would go for nothing if you had not\nsomething, slid behind--I cure them. That’s the point. I take cases that\nothers have despaired of, and I cure them right off. All the rest is\nonly to bring them here. But once here I keep them on my merits. It\nwould all be a flash in the pan but for that. Now, come along and see\nHetty’s department.”\n\nWe walked down the passage to the other room. It was elaborately fitted\nup as a dispensary, and there with a chic little apron Mrs. Cullingworth\nwas busy making up pills. With her sleeves turned up and a litter of\nglasses and bottles all round her, she was laughing away like a little\nchild among its toys.\n\n“The best dispenser in the world!” cried Cullingworth, patting her on\nthe shoulder. “You see how I do it, Munro. I write on a label what the\nprescription is, and make a sign which shows how much is to be charged.\nThe man comes along the passage and passes the label through the pigeon\nhole. Hetty makes it up, passes out the bottle, and takes the money.\nNow, come on and clear some of these folk out of the house.”\n\nIt is impossible for me to give you any idea of that long line of\npatients, filing hour after hour through the unfurnished room, and\ndeparting, some amused, and some frightened, with their labels in\ntheir hands. Cullingworth’s antics are beyond belief. I laughed until I\nthought the wooden chair under me would have come to pieces. He roared,\nhe raved, he swore, he pushed them about, slapped them on the back,\nshoved them against the wall, and occasionally rushed out to the head\nof the stair to address them en masse. At the same time, behind all\nthis tomfoolery, I, watching his prescriptions, could see a quickness of\ndiagnosis, a scientific insight, and a daring and unconventional use of\ndrugs, which satisfied me that he was right in saying that, under all\nthis charlatanism, there lay solid reasons for his success. Indeed,\n“charlatanism” is a misapplied word in this connection; for it would\ndescribe the doctor who puts on an artificial and conventional manner\nwith his patients, rather than one who is absolutely frank and true to\nhis own extraordinary nature.\n\nTo some of his patients he neither said one word nor did he allow them\nto say one. With a loud “hush” he would rush at them, thump them on the\nchests, listen to their hearts, write their labels, and then run them\nout of the room by their shoulders. One poor old lady he greeted with a\nperfect scream. “You’ve been drinking too much tea!” he cried. “You are\nsuffering from tea poisoning!” Then, without allowing her to get a word\nin, he clutched her by her crackling black mantle, dragged her up to the\ntable, and held out a copy of “Taylor’s Medical Jurisprudence” which was\nlying there. “Put your hand on the book,” he thundered, “and swear that\nfor fourteen days you will drink nothing but cocoa.” She swore with\nupturned eyes, and was instantly whirled off with her label in her hand,\nto the dispensary. I could imagine that to the last day of her life, the\nold lady would talk of her interview with Cullingworth; and I could well\nunderstand how the village from which she came would send fresh recruits\nto block up his waiting rooms.\n\nAnother portly person was seized by the two armholes of his waistcoat,\njust as he was opening his mouth to explain his symptoms, and was rushed\nbackward down the passage, down the stairs, and finally into the street,\nto the immense delight of the assembled patients, “You eat too much,\ndrink too much, and sleep too much,” Cullingworth roared after him.\n“Knock down a policeman, and come again when they let you out.” Another\npatient complained of a “sinking feeling.” “My dear,” said he, “take\nyour medicine; and if that does no good, swallow the cork, for there is\nnothing better when you are sinking.”\n\nAs far as I could judge, the bulk of the patients looked upon a morning\nat Cullingworth’s as a most enthralling public entertainment, tempered\nonly by a thrill lest it should be their turn next to be made an\nexhibition of.\n\nWell, with half-an-hour for lunch, this extraordinary business went\non till a quarter to four in the afternoon. When the last patient had\ndeparted, Cullingworth led the way into the dispensary, where all the\nfees had been arranged upon the counter in the order of their value.\nThere were seventeen half-sovereigns, seventy-three shillings, and\nforty-six florins; or thirty-two pounds eight and sixpence in all.\nCullingworth counted it up, and then mixing the gold and silver into\none heap, he sat running his fingers through it and playing with it.\nFinally, he raked it into the canvas bag which I had seen the night\nbefore, and lashed the neck up with a boot-lace.\n\nWe walked home, and that walk struck me as the most extraordinary part\nof all that extraordinary day. Cullingworth paraded slowly through the\nprincipal streets with his canvas bag, full of money, outstretched at\nthe full length of his arm. His wife and I walked on either side,\nlike two acolytes supporting a priest, and so we made our way solemnly\nhomewards the people stopping to see us pass.\n\n“I always make a point of walking through the doctor’s quarter,” said\nCullingworth. “We are passing through it now. They all come to their\nwindows and gnash their teeth and dance until I am out of sight.”\n\n“Why should you quarrel with them? What is the matter with them?” I\nasked.\n\n“Pooh! what’s the use of being mealy-mouthed about it?” said he. “We\nare all trying to cut each other’s throats, and why should we be\nhypocritical over it? They haven’t got a good word for me, any one of\nthem; so I like to take a rise out of them.”\n\n“I must say that I can see no sense in that. They are your brothers\nin the profession, with the same education and the same knowledge. Why\nshould you take an offensive attitude towards them?”\n\n“That’s what I say, Dr. Munro,” cried his wife. “It is so very\nunpleasant to feel that one is surrounded by enemies on every side.”\n\n“Hetty’s riled because their wives wouldn’t call upon her,” he cried.\n“Look at that, my dear,” jingling his bag. “That is better than having\na lot of brainless women drinking tea and cackling in our drawing-room.\nI’ve had a big card printed, Munro, saying that we don’t desire to\nincrease the circle of our acquaintance. The maid has orders to show it\nto every suspicious person who calls.”\n\n“Why should you not make money at your practice, and yet remain on good\nterms with your professional brethren?” said I. “You speak as if the two\nthings were incompatible.”\n\n“So they are. What’s the good of beating about the bush, laddie?\nMy methods are all unprofessional, and I break every law of medical\netiquette as often as I can think of it. You know very well that the\nBritish Medical Association would hold up their hands in horror if it\ncould see what you have seen to-day.”\n\n“But why not conform to professional etiquette?”\n\n“Because I know better. My boy, I’m a doctor’s son, and I’ve seen too\nmuch of it. I was born inside the machine, and I’ve seen all the wires.\nAll this etiquette is a dodge for keeping the business in the hands of\nthe older men. It’s to hold the young men back, and to stop the holes by\nwhich they might slip through to the front. I’ve heard my father say so\na score of times. He had the largest practice in Scotland, and yet he\nwas absolutely devoid of brains. He slipped into it through seniority\nand decorum. No pushing, but take your turn. Very well, laddie, when\nyou’re at the top of the line, but how about it when you’ve just taken\nyour place at the tail? When I’m on the top rung I shall look down and\nsay, ‘Now, you youngsters, we are going to have very strict etiquette,\nand I beg that you will come up very quietly and not disarrange me from\nmy comfortable position.’ At the same time, if they do what I tell\nthem, I shall look upon them as a lot of infernal blockheads. Eh, Munro,\nwhat?”\n\nI could only say again that I thought he took a very low view of the\nprofession, and that I disagreed with every word he said.\n\n“Well, my boy, you may disagree as much as you like, but if you are\ngoing to work with me you must throw etiquette to the devil!”\n\n“I can’t do that.”\n\n“Well, if you are too clean handed for the job you can clear out. We\ncan’t keep you here against your will.”\n\nI said nothing; but when we got back, I went upstairs and packed up\nmy trunk, with every intention of going back to Yorkshire by the night\ntrain. He came up to my room, and finding what I was at, he burst into\napologies which would have satisfied a more exacting man than I am.\n\n“You shall do just exactly what you like, my dear chap. If you don’t\nlike my way, you may try some way of your own.”\n\n“That’s fair enough,” said I. “But it’s a little trying to a man’s\nself-respect if he is told to clear out every time there is a difference\nof opinion.”\n\n“Well, well, there was no harm meant, and it shan’t occur again. I can’t\npossibly say more than that; so come along down and have a cup of tea.”\n\nAnd so the matter blew over; but I very much fear, Bertie, that this is\nthe first row of a series. I have a presentiment that sooner or later my\nposition here will become untenable. Still, I shall give it a fair trial\nas long as he will let me. Cullingworth is a fellow who likes to have\nnothing but inferiors and dependants round him. Now, I like to stand on\nmy own legs, and think with my own mind. If he’ll let me do this we’ll\nget along very well; but if I know the man he will claim submission,\nwhich is more than I am inclined to give. He has a right to my\ngratitude, which I freely admit. He has found an opening for me when I\nbadly needed one and had no immediate prospects. But still, one may pay\ntoo high a price even for that, and I should feel that I was doing so if\nI had to give up my individuality and my manhood.\n\nWe had an incident that evening which was so characteristic that I must\ntell you of it. Cullingworth has an air gun which fires little steel\ndarts. With this he makes excellent practice at about twenty feet, the\nlength of the back room. We were shooting at a mark after dinner, when\nhe asked me whether I would hold a halfpenny between my finger and\nthumb, and allow him to shoot it out. A halfpenny not being forthcoming,\nhe took a bronze medal out of his waistcoat pocket, and I held that\ntip as a mark. “Kling!” went the air gun, and the medal rolled upon the\nfloor.\n\n“Plumb in the centre,” said he.\n\n“On the contrary,” I answered, “you never hit it at all!”\n\n“Never hit it! I must have hit it!”\n\n“I am confident you didn’t.”\n\n“Where’s the dart, then?”\n\n“Here,” said I, holding up a bleeding forefinger, from which the tail\nend of the fluff with which the dart was winged was protruding.\n\nI never saw a man so abjectly sorry for anything in my life. He used\nlanguage of self-reproach which would have been extravagant if he had\nshot off one of my limbs. Our positions were absurdly reversed; and it\nwas he who sat collapsed in a chair, while it was I, with the dart\nstill in my finger, who leaned over him and laughed the matter off. Mrs.\nCullingworth had run for hot water, and presently with a tweezers we\ngot the intruder out. There was very little pain (more to-day than\nyesterday), but if ever you are called upon to identify my body you may\nlook for a star at the end of my right forefinger.\n\nWhen the surgery was completed (Cullingworth writhing and groaning all\nthe time) my eyes happened to catch the medal which I had dropped, lying\nupon the carpet. I lifted it up and looked at it, eager to find some\ntopic which would be more agreeable. Printed upon it was--“Presented to\nJames Cullingworth for gallantry in saving life. Jan. 1879.”\n\n“Hullo, Cullingworth,” said I. “You never told me about this!”\n\nHe was off in an instant in his most extravagant style.\n\n“What! the medal? Haven’t you got one? I thought every one had. You\nprefer to be select, I suppose. It was a little boy. You’ve no idea the\ntrouble I had to get him in.”\n\n“Get him out, you mean.”\n\n“My dear chap, you don’t understand! Any one could get a child out.\nIt’s getting one in that’s the bother. One deserves a medal for it. Then\nthere are the witnesses, four shillings a day I had to pay them, and\na quart of beer in the evenings. You see you can’t pick up a child and\ncarry it to the edge of a pier and throw it in. You’d have all sorts of\ncomplications with the parents. You must be patient and wait until you\nget a legitimate chance. I caught a quinsy walking up and down Avonmouth\npier before I saw my opportunity. He was rather a stolid fat boy, and he\nwas sitting on the very edge, fishing. I got the sole of my foot on to\nthe small of his back, and shot him an incredible distance. I had some\nlittle difficulty in getting him out, for his fishing line got twice\nround my legs, but it all ended well, and the witnesses were as staunch\nas possible. The boy came up to thank me next day, and said that he was\nquite uninjured save for a bruise on the back. His parents always send\nme a brace of fowls every Christmas.”\n\nI was sitting with my finger in the hot water listening to this\nrigmarole. When he had finished he ran off to get his tobacco box, and\nwe could hear the bellowing of his laughter dwindling up the stair. I\nwas still looking at the medal, which, from the dents all over it, had\nevidently been often used as a target, when I felt a timid touch upon my\nsleeve; it was Mrs. Cullingworth, who was looking earnestly at me with a\nvery distressed expression upon her face.\n\n“You believe far too much what James says,” said she. “You don’t know\nhim in the least, Mr. Munro. You don’t look at a thing from his point\nof view, and you will never understand him until you do. It is not, of\ncourse, that he means to say anything that is untrue; but his fancy is\nexcited, and he is quite carried away by the humour of any idea, whether\nit tells against himself or not. It hurts me, Mr. Munro, to see the\nonly man in the world towards whom he has any feeling of friendship,\nmisunderstanding him so completely, for very often when you say nothing\nyour face shows very clearly what you think.”\n\nI could only answer lamely that I was very sorry if I had misjudged her\nhusband in any way, and that no one had a keener appreciation of some of\nhis qualities than I had.\n\n“I saw how gravely you looked when he told you that absurd story about\npushing a little boy into the water,” she continued; and, as she spoke,\nshe drew from somewhere in the front of her dress a much creased slip of\npaper. “Just glance at that, please, Dr. Munro.”\n\nIt was a newspaper cutting, which gave the true account of the incident.\nSuffice it that it was an ice accident, and that Cullingworth had really\nbehaved in a heroic way and had been drawn out himself insensible, with\nthe child so clasped in his arms that it was not until he had recovered\nhis senses that they were able to separate them. I had hardly finished\nreading it when we heard his step on the stairs; and she, thrusting\nthe paper back into her bosom, became in an instant the same silently\nwatchful woman as ever.\n\nIs he not a conundrum? If he interests you at a distance (and I take\nfor granted that what you say in your letters is not merely conventional\ncompliment) you can think how piquant he is in actual life. I must\nconfess, however, that I can never shake off the feeling that I am\nliving with some capricious creature who frequently growls and may\npossibly bite. Well, it won’t be very long before I write again, and\nby that time I shall probably know whether I am likely to find\nany permanent billet here or not. I am so sorry to hear about Mrs.\nSwanborough’s indisposition. You know that I take the deepest interest\nin everything that affects you. They tell me here that I am looking very\nfit, though I think they ought to spell it with an “a.”\n\n\n\n\n\nVIII. THE PARADE, BRADFIELD, 6th April, 1882.\n\n\nI am writing this, my dear Bertie, at a little table which has been\nfitted up in the window of my bedroom. Every one in the house is asleep\nexcept myself; and all the noise of the city is hushed. Yet my own brain\nis singularly active, and I feel that I am better employed in sitting\nup and writing to you, than in tossing about upon my bed. I am often\naccused of being sleepy in the daytime, but every now and then Nature\ngets level by making me abnormally wakeful at night.\n\nAre you conscious of the restful influence which the stars exert? To me\nthey are the most soothing things in Nature. I am proud to say that I\ndon’t know the name of one of them. The glamour and romance would pass\naway from them if they were all classified and ticketed in one’s brain.\nBut when a man is hot and flurried, and full of his own little ruffled\ndignities and infinitesimal misfortunes, then a star bath is the finest\nthing in the world. They are so big, and so serene and so lovely.\nThey tell me that the interplanetary spaces are full of the debris of\nshattered asteroids; so, perhaps, even among them there are such things\nas disease and death. Yet just to look at them must remind a man of what\na bacillus of a thing he is--the whole human race like some sprinkling\nof impalpable powder upon the surface of one of the most insignificant\nfly-wheels of a monstrous machine. But there’s order in it, Bertie,\nthere’s order! And where there is order there must be mind, and where\nthere is mind there must be sense of Justice. I don’t allow that there\ncan be any doubt as to the existence of that central Mind, or as to the\npossession by it of certain attributes. The stars help me to realise\nthese. It is strange, when one looks upon them, to think that the\nChurches are still squabbling down here over such questions as whether\nthe Almighty is most gratified by our emptying a tea-spoonful of water\nover our babies’ heads, or by our waiting a few years and then plunging\nthem bodily into a tank. It would be comic if it were not so tragic.\n\nThis train of thought is the after-swell from an argument with\nCullingworth this evening. He holds that the human race is deteriorating\nmentally and morally. He calls out at the grossness which confounds the\nCreator with a young Jewish Philosopher. I tried to show him that this\nis no proof of degeneration, since the Jewish Philosopher at least\nrepresented a moral idea, and was therefore on an infinitely higher\nplane than the sensual divinities of the ancients. His own views of the\nCreator seem to me to be a more evident degeneration. He declares\nthat looking round at Nature he can see nothing but ruthlessness and\nbrutality. “Either the Creator is not all-powerful, or else He is not\nall-good,” says he. “Either He can stop these atrocities and won’t, in\nwhich case He is not all-good; or else He would stop them but can’t, in\nwhich case He is not all-powerful.” It was a difficult dilemma for a man\nwho professes to stick to reason to get out of. Of course, if you plead\nfaith, you can always slip out of anything. I was forced to get behind\na corner of that buckler with which you have so often turned my own\nthrusts. I said that the dilemma arose from our taking it for granted\nthat that which seemed evil really was EVIL. “It lies with you to prove\nthat it isn’t,” said he. “We may hope that it isn’t,” said I. “Wait\nuntil some one tells you that you have cancer of the pyloric end of the\nstomach,” said he; and he shouted it out again every time I tried to\nrenew the argument.\n\nBut in all soberness, I really do think, Bertie, that very much which\nseems to be saddest in life might be very different if we could focus it\nproperly. I tried to give you my views about this in the case of drink\nand immorality. But physically, I fancy that it applies more obviously\nthan it does morally. All the physical evils of life seem to culminate\nin death; and yet death, as I have seen it, has not been a painful or\nterrible process. In many cases, a man dies without having incurred\nnearly as much pain, during the whole of his fatal illness, as would\nhave arisen from a whitlow or an abscess of the jaw. And it is often\nthose deaths which seem most terrible to the onlooker, which are least\nso to the sufferer. When a man is overtaken by an express and shivered\ninto fragments, or when he drops from a fourth-floor window and\nis smashed into a bag of splinters, the unfortunate spectators are\nconvulsed with horror, and find a text for pessimistic views about the\nProvidence which allows such things to be. And yet, it is very doubtful\nwhether the deceased, could his tongue be loosened, would remember\nanything at all about the matter. We know, as students of medicine,\nthat though pain is usually associated with cancers and with abdominal\ncomplaints; still, in the various fevers, in apoplexy, in blood\npoisonings, in lung diseases, and, in short, in the greater proportion\nof serious maladies, there is little suffering.\n\nI remember how struck I was when first I saw the actual cautery applied\nin a case of spinal disease. The white hot iron was pressed firmly into\nthe patient’s back, without the use of any anaesthetic, and what with\nthe sight and the nauseating smell of burned flesh I felt faint and ill.\nYet, to my astonishment, the patient never flinched nor moved a muscle\nof his face, and on my inquiring afterwards, he assured me that the\nproceeding was absolutely painless, a remark which was corroborated\nby the surgeon. “The nerves are so completely and instantaneously\ndestroyed,” he explained, “that they have no time to convey a painful\nimpression.” But then if this be so, what becomes of all the martyrs\nat the stake, and the victims of Red Indians, and other poor folk\nover whose sufferings and constancy we have wondered? It may be that\nProvidence is not only not cruel itself, but will not allow man to be\ncruel either. Do your worst, and it will step in with a “No, I won’t\nallow this poor child of mine to be hurt”; and then comes the dulling\nof the nerve and the lethargy which takes the victim out of the reach of\nthe tormentor. David Livingstone under the claws of the lion must have\nlooked like an object lesson of the evil side of things, and yet he has\nleft it upon record that his own sensations were pleasurable rather than\notherwise. I am well convinced that if the newly-born infant and the man\nwho had just died could compare their experiences, the former would have\nproved to be the sufferer. It is not for nothing that the first thing\nthe newcomer into this planet does is to open its toothless mouth and\nprotest energetically against fate.\n\nCullingworth has written a parable which makes a paragraph for our\nwonderful new weekly paper.\n\n“The little cheese mites held debate,” he says, “as to who made the\ncheese. Some thought that they had no data to go upon, and some that it\nhad come together by a solidification of vapour, or by the centrifugal\nattraction of atoms. A few surmised that the platter might have\nsomething to do with it; but the wisest of them could not deduce the\nexistence of a cow.”\n\nWe are at one, he and I, in thinking that the infinite is beyond our\nperception. We differ only in that he sees evil and I see good in the\nworking of the universe. Ah, what a mystery it all is! Let us be honest\nand humble and think kindly of each other. There’s a line of stars all\nwinking at me over the opposite roof--winking slyly at the silly little\nperson with the pen and paper who is so earnest about what he can never\nunderstand.\n\nWell, now, I’ll come back to something practical. It is nearly a month\nsince I wrote to you last. The date is impressed upon my memory because\nit was the day after Cullingworth shot the air-dart into my finger. The\nplace festered and prevented my writing to any one for a week or two,\nbut it is all right again now. I have ever so much of different sorts to\ntell you, but really when I come to think of it, it does not amount to\nvery much after all.\n\nFirst of all, about the practice. I told you that I was to have a room\nimmediately opposite to Cullingworth’s, and that all the surgical cases\nwere to be turned over to me. For a few days I had nothing to do, except\nto listen to him romping and scuffling with his patients, or making\nspeeches to them from the top of the stairs. However, a great “Dr. Stark\nMunro, Surgeon,” has been affixed to the side of the door downstairs,\nopposite Cullingworth’s plate; and a proud man was I when first my eyes\nlit upon it. On the fourth day, however, in came a case. He little knew\nthat he was the first that I had ever had all to myself in my life.\nPerhaps he would not have looked quite so cheerful if he had realised\nit.\n\nPoor chap, he had little enough to be cheery over either. He was an old\nsoldier who had lost a good many teeth, but who had continued to find\nroom between his nose and chin for a short black clay pipe. Lately there\nappeared a small sore on his nose which had spread, and become crusted.\nOn feeling it I found it as hard as a streak of glue, with constant\ndarting pains passing through it. Of course, there could be no question\nas to diagnosis. It was epitheliomatous cancer, caused by the irritation\nof the hot tobacco smoke. I sent him back to his village, and two days\nafter I drove over in Cullingworth’s dog-cart, and removed the growth. I\nonly got a sovereign for it. But it may be a nucleus for cases. The\nold fellow did most admirably, and he has just been in (with a most\naristocratic curl to his nostrils) to tell me that he has bought a box\nfull of churchwardens. It was my first operation, and I daresay I was\nmore nervous about it than my patient, but the result has given me\nconfidence. I have fully made up my mind to let nothing pass me. Come\nwhat may, I am prepared to do it. Why should a man wait? Of course,\nI know that many men do; but surely one’s nerve is more likely to be\nstrong and one’s knowledge fresh now than in twenty years.\n\nCases came dribbling in from day to day--all very poor people, and able\nto pay very poor fees--but still most welcome to me. The first week I\ntook (including that operation fee) one pound seventeen and sixpence.\nThe second, I got two pounds exactly. The third, I had two pounds five,\nand now I find that this last week has brought in two pounds eighteen;\nso I am moving in the right direction. Of course, it compares absurdly\nenough with Cullingworth’s twenty pound a day, and my little quiet\nback-water seems a strange contrast to the noisy stream which pours for\never through his room. Still, I am quite satisfied, and I have no doubt\nat all that his original estimate of three hundred pounds for the first\nyear will be amply justified. It would be a pleasant thing to think that\nif anything were really to happen at home, I should be able to be of\nsome use to them. If things go on as they have begun, I shall soon have\nmy feet firmly planted.\n\nI was compelled, by the way, to forego an opening which a few months ago\nwould have been the very summit of my ambition. You must know (possibly\nI told you), that immediately after I passed, I put my name down as a\ncandidate for a surgeonship on the books of several of the big steamship\nlines. It was done as a forlorn hope, for a man has usually to wait\nseveral years before his turn comes round. Well, just a week after I\nstarted here, I got a telegram one night from Liverpool: “Join the Decia\nto-morrow as surgeon, not later than eight in the evening.” It was from\nStaunton & Merivale, the famous South American firm, and the Decia is\na fine 6000-ton passenger boat, doing the round journey by Bahia and\nBuenos Ayres to Rio and Valparaiso. I had a bad quarter of an hour, I\ncan tell you. I don’t think I was ever so undecided about anything in my\nlife. Cullingworth was dead against my going, and his influence carried\nthe day.\n\n“My dear chap,” said he, “you’d knock down the chief mate, and he’d\nspread you out with a handspike. You’d get tied by your thumbs to the\nrigging. You’d be fed on stinking water and putrid biscuits. I’ve been\nreading a novel about the merchant service, and I know.”\n\nWhen I laughed at his ideas of modern sea-going he tried another line.\n\n“You’re a bigger fool than I take you for if you go,” said he. “Why,\nwhat can it lead to? All the money you earn goes to buy a blue coat, and\ndaub it with lace. You think you’re bound for Valparaiso, and you\nfind yourself at the poor-house. You’ve got a rare opening here, and\neverything ready to your hand. You’ll never get such another again.”\n\nAnd so it ended by my letting them have a wire to say that I could not\ncome. It is strange when you come to a point where the road of your life\nobviously divides, and you take one turning or the other after vainly\ntrying to be sure about the finger-post. I think after all I chose\nrightly. A ship’s surgeon must remain a ship’s surgeon, while here there\nis no horizon to my possibilities.\n\nAs to old Cullingworth, he is booming along as merrily as ever. You say\nin your last, that what you cannot understand is how he got his hold of\nthe public in so short a time. That is just the point which I have found\nit hard to get light upon. He told me that after his first coming he had\nnot a patient for a month, and that he was so disheartened that he very\nnearly made a moonlight exodus. At last, however, a few cases came his\nway--and he made such extraordinary cures of them, or else impressed\nthem so by his eccentricity, that they would do nothing but talk of him.\nSome of his wonderful results got into the local press, though, after\nmy Avonmouth experience, I should not like to guarantee that he did not\nhimself convey them there. He showed me an almanac, which had a great\ncirculation in the district.\n\nIt had an entry sandwiched in this way:\n\nAug. 15. Reform Bill passed 1867.\n\nAug. 16. Birth of Julius Caesar.\n\nAug. 17. Extraordinary cure by Dr. Cullingworth of a case of dropsy in\nBradfield, 1881.\n\nAug. 18. Battle of Gravelotte, 1870.\n\n\nIt reads as if it were one of the landmarks of the latter half of the\ncentury. I asked him how on earth it got there; but I could only learn\nthat the woman was fifty-six inches round the waist, and that he had\ntreated her with elaterium.\n\nThat leads me to another point. You ask me whether his cures are really\nremarkable, and, if so, what his system is. I answer unhesitatingly,\nthat his cures are very remarkable, indeed, and that I look upon him as\na sort of Napoleon of medicine. His view is that the pharmacopaeal doses\nare in nearly every instance much too low. Excessive timidity has cut\ndown the dose until it has ceased to produce a real effect upon the\ndisease.\n\nMedical men, according to his view, have been afraid of producing a\npoisonous effect with their drugs. With him, on the contrary, the\nwhole art of medicine lies in judicious poisoning, and when the case\nis serious, his remedies are heroic. Where, in epilepsy, I should have\ngiven thirty-grain doses of bromide or chloral every four hours, he\nwould give two drachms every three. No doubt it will seem to you very\nkill-or-cure, and I am myself afraid that a succession of coroners’\ninquests may check Cullingworth’s career; but hitherto he has had no\npublic scandal, while the cases which he has brought back to life have\nbeen numerous. He is the most fearless fellow. I have seen him pour\nopium into a dysenteric patient until my hair bristled. But either his\nknowledge or his luck always brings him out right.\n\nThen there are other cures which depend, I think, upon his own personal\nmagnetism. He is so robust and loud-voiced and hearty that a weak\nnervous patient goes away from him recharged with vitality. He is so\nperfectly confident that he can cure them, that he makes them perfectly\nconfident that they can be cured; and you know how in nervous cases the\nmind reacts upon the body. If he chose to preserve crutches and sticks,\nas they do in the mediaeval churches, he might, I am sure, paper\nhis consulting room with them. A favourite device of his with an\nimpressionable patient is to name the exact hour of their cure. “My\ndear,” he will say, swaying some girl about by the shoulders, with his\nnose about three inches from hers, “you’ll feel better to-morrow at a\nquarter to ten, and at twenty past you’ll be as well as ever you were in\nyour life. Now, keep your eye on the clock, and see if I am not right.”\n Next day, as likely as not, her mother will be in, weeping tears of\njoy; and another miracle has been added to Cullingworth’s record. It may\nsmell of quackery, but it is exceedingly useful to the patient.\n\nStill I must confess that there is nothing about Cullingworth which jars\nme so much as the low view which he takes of our profession. I can never\nreconcile myself to his ideas, and yet I can never convert him to mine;\nso there will be a chasm there which sooner or later may open to divide\nus altogether. He will not acknowledge any philanthropic side to the\nquestion. A profession, in his view, is a means of earning a livelihood,\nand the doing good to our fellow mortals, is quite a secondary one.\n\n“Why the devil should we do all the good, Munro?” he shouts. “Eh, what? A\nbutcher would do good to the race, would he not, if he served his chops\nout gratis through the window? He’d be a real benefactor; but he goes\non selling them at a shilling the pound for all that. Take the case of\na doctor who devotes himself to sanitary science. He flushes out drains,\nand keeps down infection. You call him a philanthropist! Well, I call\nhim a traitor. That’s it, Munro, a traitor and a renegade! Did you ever\nhear of a congress of lawyers for simplifying the law and discouraging\nlitigation? What are the Medical Association and the General Council,\nand all these bodies for? Eh, laddie? For encouraging the best interests\nof the profession. Do you suppose they do that by making the\npopulation healthy? It’s about time we had a mutiny among the general\npractitioners. If I had the use of half the funds which the Association\nhas, I should spend part of them in drain-blocking, and the rest in the\ncultivation of disease germs, and the contamination of drinking water.”\n\nOf course, I told him that his views were diabolical; but, especially\nsince that warning which I had from his wife, I discount everything\nthat he says. He begins in earnest; but as he goes on the humour of\nexaggeration gets hold of him, and he winds up with things which he\nwould never uphold in cold blood. However, the fact remains that we\ndiffer widely in our views of professional life, and I fear that we may\ncome to grief over the question.\n\nWhat do you think we have been doing lately? Building a stable--no less.\nCullingworth wanted to have another one at the business place, as much,\nI think, for his patients as his horses; and, in his audacious way, he\ndetermined that he would build it himself. So at it we went, he, I,\nthe coachman, Mrs. Cullingworth, and the coachman’s wife. We dug\nfoundations, got bricks in by the cartload, made our own mortar, and I\nthink that we shall end by making a very fair job of it. It’s not quite\nas flat-chested as we could wish; and I think that if I were a horse\ninside it, I should be careful about brushing against the walls;\nbut still it will keep the wind and rain out when it is finished.\nCullingworth talks of our building a new house for ourselves; but as\nwe have three large ones already there does not seem to be any pressing\nneed.\n\nTalking about horses, we had no end of a fuss here the other day.\nCullingworth got it into his head that he wanted a first-class riding\nhorse; and as neither of the carriage ones would satisfy him, he\ncommissioned a horse dealer to get him one. The man told us of a charger\nwhich one of the officers in the garrison was trying to get rid of. He\ndid not conceal the fact that the reason why he wished to sell it was\nbecause he considered it to be dangerous; but, he added, that Captain\nLucas had given L150 for it, and was prepared to sell it at seventy.\nThis excited Cullingworth, and he ordered the creature to be saddled and\nbrought round. It was a beautiful animal, coal black, with a magnificent\nneck and shoulders, but with a nasty backward tilt to its ears, and an\nunpleasant way of looking at you. The horse dealer said that our yard\nwas too small to try the creature in; but Cullingworth clambered up upon\nits back and formally took possession of it by lamming it between the\nears with the bone handle of his whip. Then ensued one of the most\nlively ten minutes that I can remember. The beast justified his\nreputation; but Cullingworth, although he was no horseman, stuck to him\nlike a limpet. Backwards, forwards, sideways, on his fore feet, on\nhis hind feet, with his back curved, with his back sunk, bucking and\nkicking, there was nothing the creature did not try. Cullingworth was\nsitting alternately on his mane and on the root of his tail--never by\nany chance in the saddle--he had lost both stirrups, and his knees were\ndrawn up and his heels dug into the creature’s ribs, while his hands\nclawed at mane, saddle, or ears, whichever he saw in front of him. He\nkept his whip, however; and whenever the brute eased down, Cullingworth\nlammed him once more with the bone handle. His idea, I suppose, was to\nbreak its spirit, but he had taken a larger contract than he could carry\nthrough. The animal bunched his four feet together, ducked down his\nhead, arched his back like a yawning cat, and gave three convulsive\nsprings into the air. At the first, Cullingworth’s knees were above the\nsaddle flaps, at the second his ankles were retaining a convulsive\ngrip, at the third he flew forward like a stone out of a sling, narrowly\nmissed the coping of the wall, broke with his head the iron bar which\nheld some wire netting, and toppled back with a thud into the yard. Up\nhe bounded with the blood streaming down his face, and running into our\nhalf-finished stables he seized a hatchet, and with a bellow of\nrage rushed at the horse. I caught him by the coat and put on a\nfourteen-stone drag, while the horse dealer (who was as white as a\ncheese) ran off with his horse into the street. Cullingworth broke away\nfrom my grip, and cursing incoherently, his face slobbered with blood,\nand his hatchet waving over his head, he rushed out of the yard--the\nmost diabolical looking ruffian you can imagine. However, luckily for\nthe dealer, he had got a good start, and Cullingworth was persuaded to\ncome back and wash his face. We bound up his cut, and found him little\nthe worse, except in his temper. But for me he would most certainly have\npaid seventy pounds for his insane outburst of rage against the animal.\n\nI daresay you think it strange that I should write so much about this\nfellow and so little about anybody else; but the fact is, that I\nknow nobody else, and that my whole circle is bounded by my patients,\nCullingworth and his wife. They visit nobody, and nobody visits them. My\nliving with them brings the same taboo from my brother doctors upon my\nhead, although I have never done anything unprofessional myself. Who\nshould I see in the street the other day but the McFarlanes, whom you\nwill remember at Linlithgow? I was foolish enough to propose to Maimie\nMcFarlane once, and she was sensible enough to refuse me. What I should\nhave done had she accepted me, I can’t imagine; for that was three years\nago, and I have more ties and less prospect of marriage now than then.\nWell, there’s no use yearning for what you can’t have, and there’s no\nother man living to whom I would speak about the matter at all; but life\nis a deadly, lonely thing when a man has no one on his side but himself.\nWhy is it that I am sitting here in the moonlight writing to you,\nexcept that I am craving for sympathy and fellowship? I get it from you,\ntoo--as much as one friend ever got from another--and yet there are some\nsides to my nature with which neither wife nor friend nor any one else\ncan share. If you cut your own path, you must expect to find yourself\nalone upon it.\n\nHeigh ho! it’s nearly dawn, and I as wakeful as ever. It is chilly, and\nI have draped a blanket round me. I’ve heard that this is the favourite\nhour of the suicide, and I see that I’ve been tailing off in the\ndirection of melancholy myself. Let me wind up on a lighter chord by\nquoting Cullingworth’s latest article. I must tell you that he is\nstill inflamed by the idea of his own paper, and his brain is in full\neruption, sending out a perpetual stream of libellous paragraphs,\ndoggerel poems, social skits, parodies, and articles. He brings them\nall to me, and my table is already piled with them. Here is his latest,\nbrought up to my room after he had undressed. It was the outcome of some\nremarks I had made about the difficulty which our far-off descendants\nmay have in determining what the meaning is of some of the commonest\nobjects of our civilisation, and as a corollary how careful we should be\nbefore we become dogmatic about the old Romans or Egyptians.\n\n“At the third annual meeting of the New Guinea Archaeological Society\na paper was read upon recent researches on the supposed site of London,\ntogether with some observations upon hollow cylinders in use among\nthe ancient Londoners. Several examples of these metallic cylinders\nor tubings were on exhibition in the hall, and were passed round for\ninspection among the audience. The learned lecturer prefaced his remarks\nby observing that on account of the enormous interval of time which\nseparated them from the days when London was a flourishing city, it\nbehoved them to be very guarded in any conclusions to which they might\ncome as to the habits of the inhabitants. Recent research appeared to\nhave satisfactorily established the fact that the date of the final fall\nof London was somewhat later than that of the erection of the Egyptian\nPyramids. A large building had recently been unearthed near the dried-up\nbed of the river Thames; and there could be no question from existing\nrecords that this was the seat of the law-making council among the\nancient Britons--or Anglicans, as they were sometimes called. The\nlecturer proceeded to point out that the bed of the Thames had been\ntunnelled under by a monarch named Brunel, who is supposed by some\nauthorities to have succeeded Alfred the Great. The open spaces of\nLondon, he went on to remark, must have been far from safe, as the\nbones of lions, tigers, and other extinct forms of carnivora had\nbeen discovered in the Regent’s Park. Having briefly referred to the\nmysterious structures known as ‘pillar-boxes,’ which are scattered\nthickly over the city, and which are either religious in their origin,\nor else may be taken as marking the tombs of Anglican chiefs, the\nlecturer passed on to the cylindrical piping. This had been explained\nby the Patagonian school as being a universal system of\nlightning-conductors. He (the lecturer) could not assent to this theory.\nIn a series of observations, extending over several months, he had\ndiscovered the important fact that these lines of tubing, if followed\nout, invariably led to large hollow metallic reservoirs which were\nconnected with furnaces. No one who knew how addicted the ancient\nBritons were to the use of tobacco could doubt what this meant.\nEvidently large quantities of the herb were burned in the central\nchamber, and the aromatic and narcotic vapour was carried through the\ntubes to the house of every citizen, so that he might inhale it at will.\nHaving illustrated his remarks by a series of diagrams, the lecturer\nconcluded by saying that, although true science was invariably cautious\nand undogmatic, it was none the less an incontestable fact that so\nmuch light had been thrown upon old London, that every action of the\ncitizens’ daily life was known, from the taking of a tub in the morning,\nuntil after a draught of porter he painted himself blue before retiring\nto rest.”\n\nAfter all, I daresay this explanation of the London gas pipes is not\nmore absurd than some of our shots about the Pyramids, or ideas of life\namong the Babylonians.\n\nWell, good-bye, old chap; this is a stupid inconsequential letter, but\nlife has been more quiet and less interesting just of late. I may have\nsomething a little more moving for my next.\n\n\n\n\nIX. THE PARADE, BRADFIELD, 23rd April, 1882.\n\n\nI have some recollection, my dear Bertie, that when I wrote you a\nrambling disconnected sort of letter about three weeks ago, I wound up\nby saying that I might have something more interesting to tell you next\ntime. Well, so it has turned out! The whole game is up here, and I am\noff upon a fresh line of rails altogether. Cullingworth is to go one\nway and I another; and yet I am glad to say that there has not been any\nquarrel between us. As usual, I have begun my letter at the end, but\nI’ll work up to it more deliberately now, and let you know exactly how\nit came about.\n\nAnd first of all, a thousand thanks for your two long letters, which lie\nbefore me as I write. There is little enough personal news in them, but\nI can quite understand that the quiet happy routine of your life reels\noff very smoothly from week to week. On the other hand, you give me\nplenty of proof of that inner life which is to me so very much more\ninteresting. After all, we may very well agree to differ. You think\nsome things are proved which I don’t believe in. You think some things\nedifying which do not appear to me to be so. Well, I know that you are\nperfectly honest in your belief. I am sure you give me credit for being\nthe same. The future wilt decide which of us is right. The survival of\nthe truest is a constant law, I fancy, though it must be acknowledged\nthat it is very slow in action.\n\nYou make a mistake, however, in assuming that those who think as I\ndo are such a miserable minority. The whole essence of our thought is\nindependence and individual judgment; so that we don’t get welded into\nsingle bodies as the churches do, and have no opportunity of testing our\nown strength. There are, no doubt, all shades of opinion among us; but\nif you merely include those who in their private hearts disbelieve the\ndoctrines usually accepted, and think that sectarian churches tend\nto evil rather than good, I fancy that the figures would be rather\nsurprising. When I read your letter, I made a list of all those men with\nwhom I ever had intimate talk upon such matters. I got seventeen names,\nwith four orthodox. Cullingworth tried and got twelve names, with one\northodox. From all sides, one hears that every church complains of the\nabsence of men in the congregations. The women predominate three to\none. Is it that women are more earnest than men? I think it is quite the\nother way. But the men are following their reason, and the women their\nemotion. It is the women only who keep orthodoxy alive.\n\nNo, you mustn’t be too sure of that majority of yours. Taking the\nscientific, the medical, the professional classes, I question whether it\nexists at all. The clergy, busy in their own limited circles, and coming\nin contact only with those who agree with them, have not realised how\nlargely the rising generation has outgrown them. And (with exceptions\nlike yourself) it is not the most lax, but the BEST of the younger men,\nthe larger-brained and the larger-hearted, who have shaken themselves\nmost clear of the old theology. They cannot abide its want of charity,\nit’s limitations of God’s favours, its claims for a special Providence,\nits dogmatism about what seems to be false, its conflict with what we\nknow to be true. We KNOW that man has ascended, not descended; so what\nis the value of a scheme of thought which depends upon the supposition\nof his fall? We KNOW that the world was not made in six days, that the\nsun could never be stopped since it was never moving, and that no man\never lived three days in a fish; so what becomes of the inspiration of a\nbook which contains such statements? “Truth, though it crush me!”\n\nThere, now, you see what comes of waving the red rag! Let me make\na concession to appease you. I do believe that Christianity in its\ndifferent forms has been the very best thing for the world during all\nthis long barbarous epoch. Of course, it has been the best thing, else\nProvidence would not have permitted it. The engineer knows best what\ntools to use in strengthening his own machine. But when you say that\nthis is the best and last tool which will be used, you are laying down\nthe law a little too much.\n\nNow, first of all, I want to tell you about how the practice has been\ngoing on. The week after I wrote last showed a slight relapse. I only\ntook two pounds. But on the next I took a sudden jump up to three pounds\nseven shillings, and this last week I took three pounds ten. So it was\nsteadily creeping up; and I really thought that I saw my road clear\nin front of me, when the bolt suddenly fell from the blue. There were\nreasons, however, which prevented my being very disappointed when it did\ncome down; and these I must make clear to you.\n\nI think that I mentioned, when I gave you a short sketch of my dear old\nmother, that she has a very high standard of family honour. She really\ntries to live up to the Percy-Plantagenet blend which is said to flow\nin our veins; and it is only our empty pockets which prevent her\nfrom sailing through life, like the grande dame that she is, throwing\nlargesse to right and left, with her head in the air and her soul in the\nclouds. I have often heard her say (and I am quite convinced that she\nmeant it) that she would far rather see any one of us in our graves\nthan know that we had committed a dishonourable action. Yes; for all her\nsoftness and femininity, she could freeze iron-hard at the suspicion of\nbaseness; and I have seen the blood flush from her white cap to her lace\ncollar when she has heard of an act of meanness.\n\nWell, she had heard some details about the Cullingworths which\ndispleased her when I first knew them. Then came the smash-up at\nAvonmouth, and my mother liked them less and less. She was averse to my\njoining them in Bradfield, and it was only by my sudden movement at the\nend that I escaped a regular prohibition. When I got there, the very\nfirst question she asked (when I told her of their prosperity) was\nwhether they had paid their Avonmouth creditors. I was compelled to\nanswer that they had not. In reply she wrote imploring me to come away,\nand saying that, poor as our family was, none of them had ever fallen so\nlow as to enter into a business partnership with a man of unscrupulous\ncharacter and doubtful antecedents. I answered that Cullingworth spoke\nsometimes of paying his creditors, that Mrs. Cullingworth was in favour\nof it also, and that it seemed to me to be unreasonable to expect that I\nshould sacrifice a good opening on account of things with which I had\nno connection. I assured her that if Cullingworth did anything from then\nonwards which seemed to me dishonourable, I would disassociate myself\nfrom him, and I mentioned that I had already refused to adopt some of\nhis professional methods. Well, in reply to this, my mother wrote a\npretty violent letter about what she thought of Cullingworth, which led\nto another from me defending him, and showing that there were some deep\nand noble traits in his character. That produced another still more\noutspoken letter from her; and so the correspondence went on, she\nattacking and I defending, until a serious breach seemed to be opening\nbetween us. I refrained from writing at last, not out of ill temper, but\nbecause I thought that if she were given time she would cool down, and\ntake, perhaps, a more reasonable view of the situation. My father, from\nthe short note which he sent me, seemed to think the whole business\nabsolutely irregular, and to refuse to believe my accounts of\nCullingworth’s practice and receipts. This double opposition, from the\nvery people whose interests had really been nearest my heart in the\nwhole affair, caused me to be less disappointed than I should otherwise\nhave been when it all came to an end. In fact, I was quite in the humour\nto finish it myself when Fate did it for me.\n\nNow about the Cullingworths. Madam is as amiable as ever; and yet\nsomehow, unless I am deceiving myself, she has changed somewhat of late\nin her feelings towards me. I have turned upon her suddenly more than\nonce, and caught the skirt of a glance which was little less than\nmalignant. In one or two small matters I have also detected a hardness\nin her which I had never observed before. Is it that I have intruded\ntoo much into their family life? Have I come between the husband and the\nwife? Goodness knows I have striven with all my little stock of tact to\navoid doing so. And yet I have often felt that my position was a false\none. Perhaps a young man attaches too much importance to a woman’s\nglances and gestures. He wishes to assign a definite meaning to each,\nwhen they may be only the passing caprice of the moment. Ah, well, I\nhave nothing to blame myself with; and in any case it will soon be all\nover now.\n\nAnd then I have seen something of the same sort in Cullingworth; but\nhe is so strange a being that I never attach much importance to his\nvariations. He glares at me like an angry bull occasionally; and then\nwhen I ask him what is the matter, he growls out, “Oh, nothing!” and\nturns on his heel. Then at other times he is so cordial and friendly\nthat he almost overdoes it, and I find myself wondering whether he is\nnot acting. It must seem ungracious to you that I should speak so of a\nman who has been my benefactor; and it seems so to me also, but still\nthat IS the impression which he leaves upon me sometimes. It’s an\nabsurd idea, too; for what possible object could his wife and he have\nin pretending to be amiable, if they did not really feel so? And yet you\nknow the feeling that you get when a man smiles with his lips and not\nwith his eyes.\n\nOne day we went to the Central Hotel billiard-room in the evening to\nplay a match. Our form is just about the same, and we should have bad an\nenjoyable game if it had not been for that queer temper of his. He had\nbeen in a sullen humour the whole day, pretending not to hear what\nI said to him, or else giving snappy answers, and looking like a\nthunder-cloud. I was determined not to have a row, so I took no notice\nat all of his continual provocations, which, instead of pacifying him,\nseemed to encourage him to become more offensive. At the end of the\nmatch, wanting two to win, I put down the white which was in the jaws of\nthe pocket. He cried out that this was bad form. I contended that it was\nfolly to refrain from doing it when one was only two off game, and, on\nhis continuing to make remarks, I appealed to the marker, who took the\nsame view as I did. This opposition only increased his anger, and he\nsuddenly broke out into most violent language, abusing me in unmeasured\nterms. I said to him, “If you have anything to say to me, Cullingworth,\ncome out into the street and say it there. It’s a caddish thing to speak\nlike that before the marker.” He lifted his cue, and I thought he was\ngoing to strike me with it; but he flung it clattering on the floor, and\nchucked half a crown to the man. When we got out in the street, he began\nat once in as offensive a tone as ever.\n\n“That’s enough, Cullingworth,” I said. “I’ve stood already rather more\nthan I can carry.”\n\nWe were in the bright light of a shop window at that moment. He looked\nat me, and looked a second time, uncertain what to do. At any moment I\nmight have found myself in a desperate street row with a man who was my\nmedical partner. I gave no provocation, but kept myself keenly on the\nalert. Suddenly, to my relief, he burst out laughing (such a roar as\nmade the people stop on the other side of the road), and passing his arm\nthrough mine, he hurried me down the street.\n\n“Devil of a temper you’ve got, Munro,” said he. “By Crums, it’s hardly\nsafe to go out with you. I never know what you’re going to do next. Eh,\nwhat? You mustn’t be peppery with me, though; for I mean well towards\nyou, as you’ll see before you get finished with me.”\n\nI have told you this trivial little scene, Bertie, to show the strange\nway in which Cullingworth springs quarrels upon me; suddenly, without\nthe slightest possible provocation, taking a most offensive tone, and\nthen when he sees he has goaded me to the edge of my endurance, turning\nthe whole thing to chaff. This has occurred again and again recently;\nand, when coupled with the change in Mrs. Cullingworth’s demeanour,\nmakes one feel that something has happened to change one’s relations.\nWhat that something may be, I give you my word that I have no more\nidea than you have. Between their coldness, however, and my unpleasant\ncorrespondence with my mother, I was often very sorry that I had not\ntaken the South American liner.\n\nCullingworth is preparing for the issue of our new paper. He has carried\nthe matter through with his usual energy, but he doesn’t know enough\nabout local affairs to be able to write about them, and it is a question\nwhether he can interest the people here in anything else. At present we\nare prepared to run the paper single-handed; we are working seven hours\na day at the practice; we are building a stable; and in our odd hours we\nare practising at our magnetic ship-protector, with which Cullingworth\nis still well pleased, though he wants to get it more perfect before\nsubmitting it to the Admiralty.\n\nHis mind runs rather on naval architecture at present, and he has been\ndevising an ingenious method of preventing wooden-sided vessels from\nbeing crippled by artillery fire. I did not think much of his magnetic\nattractor, because it seemed to me that even if it had all the success\nthat he claimed for it, it would merely have the effect of substituting\nsome other metal for steel in the manufacture of shells. This new\nproject has, however, more to recommend it. This is the idea, as put in\nhis own words; and, as he has been speaking of little else for the last\ntwo days, I ought to remember them.\n\n“If you’ve got your armour there, laddie, it will be pierced,” says he.\n“Put up forty feet thick of steel; and I’ll build a gun that will knock\nit into tooth-powder. It would blow away, and set the folk coughing\nafter I had one shot at it. But you can’t pierce armour which only drops\nafter the shot has passed through. What’s the good of it? Why it\nkeeps out the water. That’s the main thing, after all. I call it the\nCullingworth spring-shutter screen. Eh, what, Munro? I wouldn’t take\na quarter of a million for the idea. You see how it would work. Spring\nshutters are furled all along the top of the bulwarks where the hammocks\nused to be. They are in sections, three feet broad, we will say, and\ncapable when let down of reaching the keel. Very well! Enemy sends a\nshot through Section A of the side. Section A shutter is lowered. Only\na thin film, you see, but enough to form a temporary plug. Enemy’s ram\nknocks in sections B, C, D of the side. What do you do? Founder? Not\na bit; you lower sections B, C, and D of Cullingworth’s spring-shutter\nscreen. Or you knock a hole on a rock. The same thing again. It’s a\nludicrous sight to see a big ship founder when so simple a precaution\nwould absolutely save her. And it’s equally good for ironclads also. A\nshot often starts their plates and admits water without breaking them.\nDown go your shutters, and all is well.”\n\nThat’s his idea, and he is busy on a model made out of the steels of\nhis wife’s stays. It sounds plausible, but he has the knack of making\nanything plausible when he is allowed to slap his hands and bellow.\n\nWe are both writing novels, but I fear that the results don’t bear\nout his theory that a man may do anything which he sets his will to.\nI thought mine was not so bad (I have done nine chapters), but\nCullingworth says he has read it all before, and that it is much too\nconventional. We must rivet the attention of the public from the start,\nhe says. Certainly, his own is calculated to do so, for it seems to me\nto be wild rubbish. The end of his first chapter is the only tolerable\npoint that he has made. A fraudulent old baronet is running race-horses\non the cross. His son, who is just coming of age, is an innocent youth.\nThe news of the great race of the year has just been received.\n\n“Sir Robert tottered into the room with dry lips and a ghastly face.\n\n“‘My poor boy!’ he cried. ‘Prepare for the worst!’\n\n“‘Our horse has lost!’ cried the young heir, springing from his chair.\n\n“The old man threw himself in agony upon the rug. ‘No, no!’ he screamed.\n‘IT HAS WON!’”\n\nMost of it, however, is poor stuff, and we are each agreed that the\nother was never meant for a novelist.\n\nSo much for our domestic proceedings, and all these little details which\nyou say you like to hear of. Now I must tell you of the great big change\nin my affairs, and how it came about.\n\nI have told you about the strange, sulky behaviour of Cullingworth,\nwhich has been deepening from day to day. Well, it seemed to reach a\nclimax this morning, and on our way to the rooms I could hardly get a\nword out of him. The place was fairly crowded with patients, but my\nown share was rather below the average. When I had finished I added a\nchapter to my novel, and waited until he and his wife were ready for the\ndaily bag-carrying homewards.\n\nIt was half-past three before he had done. I heard him stamp out into\nthe passage, and a moment later he came banging into my room. I saw in\nan instant that some sort of a crisis had come.\n\n“Munro,” he cried, “this practice is going to the devil!”\n\n“Ah!” said I. “How’s that?\n\n“It’s going to little pieces, Munro. I’ve been taking figures, and I\nknow what I am talking about. A month ago I was seeing six hundred\na week. Then I dropped to five hundred and eighty; then to\nfive-seventy-five; and now to five-sixty. What do you think of that?”\n\n“To be honest, I don’t think much of it,” I answered. “The summer is\ncoming on. You are losing all your coughs and colds and sore throats.\nEvery practice must dwindle at this time of year.”\n\n“That’s all very well,” said he, pacing up and down the room, with his\nhands thrust into his pockets, and his great shaggy eyebrows knotted\ntogether. “You may put it down to that, but I think quite differently\nabout it.”\n\n“What do you put it down to, then?”\n\n“To you.”\n\n“How’s that?” I asked.\n\n“Well,” said he, “you must allow that it is a very queer coincidence--if\nit is a coincidence--that from the day when your plate was put up my\npractice has taken a turn for the worse.”\n\n“I should be very sorry to think it was cause and effect,” I answered.\n“How do you think that my presence could have hurt you?”\n\n“I’ll tell you frankly, old chap,” said he, putting on suddenly that\nsort of forced smile which always seems to me to have a touch of a\nsneer in it. “You see, many of my patients are simple country folk, half\nimbecile for the most part, but then the half-crown of an imbecile is\nas good as any other half-crown. They come to my door, and they see two\nnames, and their silly jaws begin to drop, and they say to each other,\n‘There’s two of ‘em here. It’s Dr. Cullingworth we want to see, but if\nwe go in we’ll be shown as likely as not to Dr. Munro.’ So it ends in\nsome cases in their not coming at all. Then there are the women. Women\ndon’t care a toss whether you are a Solomon, or whether you are hot from\nan asylum. It’s all personal with them. You fetch them, or you don’t\nfetch them. I know how to work them, but they won’t come if they think\nthey are going to be turned over to anybody else. That’s what I put the\nfalling away down to.”\n\n“Well,” said I, “that’s easily set right.” I marched out of the room and\ndownstairs, with both Cullingworth and his wife behind me. Into the yard\nI went, and, picking up a big hammer, I started for the front door, with\nthe pair still at my heels. I got the forked end of the hammer under my\nplate, and with a good wrench I brought the whole thing clattering on to\nthe pavement.\n\n“That won’t interfere with you any more,” said I.\n\n“What do you intend to do now?” he asked.\n\n“Oh, I shall find plenty to do. Don’t you worry about that,” I answered.\n\n“Oh, but this is all rot,” said he, picking up the plate. “Come along\nupstairs and let us see where we stand.”\n\nWe filed off once more, he leading with the huge brass “Dr. Munro”\n under his arm; then the little woman, and then this rather perturbed\nand bemuddled young man. He and his wife sat on the deal table in the\nconsulting room, like a hawk and a turtle-dove on the same perch, while\nI leaned against the mantelpiece with my hands in my pockets. Nothing\ncould be more prosaic and informal; but I knew very well that I was at a\ncrisis of my life. Before, it was only a choosing between two roads. Now\nmy main track had run suddenly to nothing, and I must go back or find a\nbye-path.\n\n“It’s this way, Cullingworth,” said I. “I am very much obliged to you,\nand to you, Mrs. Cullingworth, for all your kindness and good wishes,\nbut I did not come here to spoil your practice; and, after what you have\ntold me, it is quite impossible for me to work with you any more.”\n\n“Well, my boy,” said he, “I am inclined myself to think that we should\ndo better apart; and that’s Hetty’s idea also, only she is too polite to\nsay so.”\n\n“It is a time for plain speaking,” I answered, “and we may as well\nthoroughly understand each other. If I have done your practice any\nharm, I assure you that I am heartily sorry, and I shall do all I can to\nrepair it. I cannot say more.”\n\n“What are you going to do, then?” asked Cullingworth.\n\n“I shall either go to sea or else start a practice on my own account.”\n\n“But you have no money.”\n\n“Neither had you when you started.”\n\n“Ah, that was different. Still, it may be that you are right. You’ll\nfind it a stiff pull at first.”\n\n“Oh, I am quite prepared for that.”\n\n“Well, you know, Munro, I feel that I am responsible to you to some\nextent, since I persuaded you not to take that ship the other day.”\n\n“It was a pity, but it can’t be helped.”\n\n“We must do what we can to make up. Now, I tell you what I am prepared\nto do. I was talking about it with Hetty this morning, and she thought\nas I did. If we were to allow you one pound a week until you got your\nlegs under you, it would encourage you to start for yourself, and you\ncould pay it back as soon as you were able.”\n\n“It is very kind of you,” said I. “If you would let the matter stand\njust now, I should like just to take a short walk by myself, and to\nthink it all over.”\n\nSo the Cullingworths did their bag-procession through the doctors’\nquarter alone to-day, and I walked to the park, where I sat down on one\nof the seats, lit a cigar, and thought the whole matter over. I was down\non my luck at first; but the balmy air and the smell of spring and the\nbudding flowers soon set me right again. I began my last letter among\nthe stars, and I am inclined to finish this one among the flowers, for\nthey are rare companions when one’s mind is troubled. Most things on\nthis earth, from a woman’s beauty to the taste of a nectarine, seem to\nbe the various baits with which Nature lures her silly gudgeons. They\nshall eat, they shall propagate, and for the sake of pleasing themselves\nthey shall hurry down the road which has been laid out for them. But\nthere lurks no bribe in the smell and beauty of the flower. It’s charm\nhas no ulterior motive.\n\nWell, I sat down there and brooded. In my heart I did not believe that\nCullingworth had taken alarm at so trifling a decrease. That could not\nhave been his real reason for driving me from the practice. He had found\nme in the way in his domestic life, no doubt, and he had devised\nthis excuse for getting rid of me. Whatever the reason was, it was\nsufficiently plain that all my hopes of building up a surgical practice,\nwhich should keep parallel with his medical one, were for ever at an\nend. On the whole, bearing in mind my mother’s opposition, and the\ncontinual janglings which we had had during the last few weeks, I was\nnot very sorry. On the contrary, a sudden curious little thrill of\nhappiness took me somewhere about the back of the midriff, and, as a\ndrift of rooks passed cawing over my head, I began cawing also in the\noverflow of my spirits.\n\nAnd then as I walked back I considered how far I could avail myself of\nthis money from Cullingworth. It was not much, but it would be madness\nto start without it, for I had sent home the little which I had saved at\nHorton’s. I had not more than six pounds in the whole world. I reflected\nthat the money could make no difference to Cullingworth, with his large\nincome, while it made a vast one to me. I should repay him in a year\nor two at the latest. Perhaps I might get on so well as to be able to\ndispense with it almost at once. There could be no doubt that it was the\nrepresentations of Cullingworth as to my future prospects in Bradfield\nwhich had made me refuse the excellent appointment in the Decia. I need\nnot therefore have any scruples at accepting some temporary assistance\nfrom his hands. On my return, I told him that I had decided to do so,\nand thanked him at the same time for his generosity.\n\n“That’s all right,” said he. “Hetty, my dear, get a bottle of fez in,\nand we shall drink success to Munro’s new venture.”\n\nIt seemed only the other day that he had been drinking my entrance into\npartnership; and here we were, the same three, sipping good luck to\nmy exit from it! I’m afraid our second ceremony was on both sides the\nheartier of the two.\n\n“I must decide now where I am to start,” I remarked. “What I want is\nsome nice little town where all the people are rich and ill.”\n\n“I suppose you wouldn’t care to settle here in Bradfield?” asked\nCullingworth.\n\n“Well, I cannot see much point in that. If I harmed you as a partner,\nI might do so more as a rival. If I succeeded it might be at your\nexpense.”\n\n“Well,” said he, “choose your town, and my offer still holds good.”\n\nWe hunted out an atlas, and laid the map of England before us on the\ntable. Cities and villages lay beneath me as thick as freckles, and yet\nthere was nothing to lead me to choose one rather than another.\n\n“I think it should be some place large enough to give you plenty of room\nfor expansion,” said he.\n\n“Not too near London,” added Mrs. Cullingworth.\n\n“And, above all, a place where I know nobody,” said I. “I can rough it\nby myself, but I can’t keep up appearances before visitors.”\n\n“What do you say to Stockwell?” said Cullingworth, putting the amber of\nhis pipe upon a town within thirty miles of Bradfield.\n\nI had hardly heard of the place, but I raised my glass. “Well, here’s to\nStockwell!” I cried; “I shall go there to-morrow morning and prospect.”\n We all drank the toast (as you will do at Lowell when you read this);\nand so it is arranged, and you may rely upon it that I shall give you a\nfull and particular account of the result.\n\n\n\n\nX. CADOGAN TERRACE, BIRCHESPOOL, 21st May, 1882.\n\n\nMy dear old chap, things have been happening, and I must tell you all\nabout it. Sympathy is a strange thing; for though I never see you, the\nmere fact that you over there in New England are keenly interested in\nwhat I am doing and thinking, makes my own life in old England very much\nmore interesting to me. The thought of you is like a good staff in my\nright hand.\n\nThe unexpected has happened so continually in my life that it has ceased\nto deserve the name. You remember that in my last I had received my\ndismissal, and was on the eve of starting for the little country town\nof Stockwell to see if there were any sign of a possible practice there.\nWell, in the morning, before I came down to breakfast, I was putting one\nor two things into a bag, when there came a timid knock at my door, and\nthere was Mrs. Cullingworth in her dressing-jacket, with her hair down\nher back.\n\n“Would you mind coming down and seeing James, Dr. Munro?” said she. “He\nhas been very strange all night, and I am afraid that he is ill.”\n\nDown I went, and found Cullingworth looking rather red in the face, and\na trifle wild about the eyes. He was sitting up in bed, with the neck of\nhis nightgown open, and an acute angle of hairy chest exposed. He had a\nsheet of paper, a pencil, and a clinical thermometer upon the coverlet\nin front of him.\n\n“Deuced interesting thing, Munro,” said he. “Come and look at this\ntemperature chart. I’ve been taking it every quarter of an hour since I\ncouldn’t sleep, and it’s up and down till it looks like the mountains in\nthe geography books. We’ll have some drugs in--eh, what, Munro?--and by\nCrums, we’ll revolutionise all their ideas about fevers. I’ll write a\npamphlet from personal experiment that will make all their books clean\nout of date, and they’ll have to tear them up and wrap sandwiches in\nthem.”\n\nHe was talking in the rapid slurring way of a man who has trouble\ncoming. I looked at his chart, and saw that he was over 102 degrees. His\npulse rub-a-dubbed under my fingers, and his skin sent a glow into my\nhand.\n\n“Any symptoms?” I asked, sitting down on the side of his bed.\n\n“Tongue like a nutmeg-grater,” said he, thrusting it out. “Frontal\nheadache, renal pains, no appetite, and a mouse nibbling inside my left\nelbow. That’s as far as we’ve got at present.”\n\n“I’ll tell you what it is, Cullingworth,” said I. “You have a touch of\nrheumatic fever, and you will have to lie by for a bit.”\n\n“Lie by be hanged!” he cried. “I’ve got a hundred people to see to-day.\nMy boy, I must be down there if I have the rattle in my throat. I didn’t\nbuild up a practice to have it ruined by a few ounces of lactic acid.”\n\n“James dear, you can easily build up another one,” said his wife, in her\ncooing voice. “You must do what Dr. Munro tells you.”\n\n“Well,” said I, “you’ll want looking after, and your practice will want\nlooking after, and I am quite ready to do both. But I won’t take the\nresponsibility unless you give me your word that you will do what you\nare told.”\n\n“If I’m to have any doctoring it must come from you, laddie,” he said;\n“for if I was to turn my toes up in the public square, there’s not a man\nhere who would do more than sign my certificate. By Crums, they might\nget the salts and oxalic acid mixed up if they came to treat me, for\nthere’s no love lost between us. But I want to go down to the practice\nall the same.”\n\n“It’s out of the question. You know the sequel of this complaint. You’ll\nhave endocarditis, embolism, thrombosis, metastatic abscesses--you know\nthe danger as well as I do.”\n\nHe sank back into his bed laughing.\n\n“I take my complaints one at a time, thank you,” said he. “I wouldn’t be\nso greedy as to have all those--eh, Munro, what?--when many another\npoor devil hasn’t got an ache to his back.” The four posts of his bed\nquivered with his laughter. “Do what you like, laddie--but I say, mind,\nif anything should happen, no tomfoolery over my grave. If you put so\nmuch as a stone there, by Crums, Munro, I’ll come back in the dead of\nthe night and plant it on the pit of your stomach.”\n\nNearly three weeks passed before he could set his foot to the\nground again. He wasn’t such a bad patient, after all; but he rather\ncomplicated my treatment by getting in all sorts of phials and powders,\nand trying experiments upon his own symptoms. It was impossible to keep\nhim quiet, and our only means of retaining him in bed was to allow him\nall the work that he could do there.\n\nHe wrote copiously, built up models of his patent screen, and banged\noff pistols at his magnetic target, which he had rigged tip on the\nmantelpiece. Nature has given him a constitution of steel, however, and\nhe shook off his malady more quickly and more thoroughly than the most\ndocile of sufferers.\n\nIn the meantime, Mrs. Cullingworth and I ran the practice together. As\na substitute for him I was a dreadful failure. They would not believe in\nme in the least. I felt that I was as flat as water after champagne.\nI could not address them from the stairs, nor push them about, nor\nprophesy to the anaeemic women. I was much too solemn and demure after\nwhat they had been accustomed to. However, I held the thing together\nas best I could, and I don’t think that he found the practice much the\nworse when he was able to take it over. I could not descend to what I\nthought was unprofessional, but I did my very best to keep the wheels\nturning.\n\nWell, I know that I am a shocking bad story-teller, but I just try to\nget things as near the truth as I can manage it. If I only knew how to\ncolour it up, I could make some of this better reading. I can get along\nwhen I am on one line, but it is when I have to bring in a second line\nof events that I understand what C. means when he says that I will never\nbe able to keep myself in nibs by what I earn in literature.\n\nThe second line is this, that I had written to my mother on the same\nnight that I wrote to you last, telling her that there need no longer be\na shadow of a disagreement between us, because everything was arranged,\nand I was going to leave Cullingworth at once. Then within a couple\nof posts I had to write again and announce that my departure was\nindefinitely postponed, and that I was actually doing his whole\npractice. Well, the dear old lady was very angry. I don’t suppose she\nquite understood how temporary the necessity was, and how impossible it\nwould have been to leave Cullingworth in the lurch. She was silent for\nnearly three weeks, and then she wrote a very stinging letter (and she\nhandles her adjectives most deftly when she likes). She went so far\nas to say that Cullingworth was a “bankrupt swindler,” and that I had\ndragged the family honour in the dirt by my prolonged association\nwith him. This letter came on the morning of the very last day that my\npatient was confined to the house. When I returned from work I found him\nsitting in his dressing-gown downstairs. His wife, who had driven home,\nwas beside him. To my surprise, when I congratulated him on being\nfit for work again, his manner (which had been most genial during his\nillness) was as ungracious as before our last explanation. His wife,\ntoo, seemed to avoid my eye, and cocked her chin at me when she spoke.\n\n“Yes, I’ll take it over to-morrow,” said he. “What do I owe you for\nlooking after it?”\n\n“Oh, it was all in the day’s work,” said I.\n\n“Thank you, I had rather have strict business,” he answered. “You know\nwhere you are then, but a favour is a thing with no end to it. What\nd’you put it at?”\n\n“I never thought about it in that light.”\n\n\n“Well, think about it now. A locum would have cost me four guineas a\nweek. Four fours sixteen. Make it twenty. Well, I promised to allow you\na pound a week, and you were to pay it back. I’ll put twenty pounds to\nyour credit account, and you’ll have it every week as sure as Saturday.”\n\n“Thank you,” said I. “If you are so anxious to make a business matter\nof it, you can arrange it so.” I could not make out, and cannot make out\nnow, what had happened to freeze them up so; but I supposed that they\nhad been talking it over, and came to the conclusion that I was settling\ndown too much upon the old lines, and that they must remind me that I\nwas under orders to quit. They might have done it with more tact.\n\nTo cut a long story short, on the very day that Cullingworth was able to\nresume his work I started off for Stockwell, taking with me only a bag,\nfor it was merely a prospecting expedition, and I intended to return for\nmy luggage if I saw reason for hope. Alas! there was not the faintest.\nThe sight of the place would have damped the most sanguine man that\never lived. It is one of those picturesque little English towns with\na history and little else. A Roman trench and a Norman keep are its\nprincipal products. But to me the most amazing thing about it was the\ncloud of doctors which had settled upon it. A double row of brass plates\nflanked the principal street. Where their patients came from I could not\nimagine, unless they practised upon each other. The host of the “Bull”\n where I had my modest lunch explained the mystery to some extent by\nsaying that, as there was pure country with hardly a hamlet for nearly\ntwelve miles in every direction, it was in these scattered farm-houses\nthat the Stockwell doctors found their patients. As I chatted with him a\nmiddle-aged, dusty-booted man trudged up the street. “There’s Dr. Adam,”\n said he. “He’s only a new-comer, but they say that some o’ these days\nhe’ll be starting his carriage.” “What do you mean by a new-comer?”\n I asked. “Oh, he’s scarcely been here ten years,” said the landlord.\n“Thank you,” said I. “Can you tell me when the next train leaves for\nBradfield?” So back I came, rather heavy at heart, and having spent\nten or twelve shillings which I could ill afford. My fruitless journey\nseemed a small thing, however, when I thought of the rising Stockwellite\nwith his ten years and his dusty boots. I can trudge along a path,\nhowever rough, if it will but lead to something; but may kindly Fate\nkeep me out of all cul-de-sacs!\n\nThe Cullingworths did not receive me cordially upon my return. There was\na singular look upon both their faces which seemed to ME to mean that\nthey were disappointed at this hitch in getting rid of me. When I think\nof their absolute geniality a few days ago, and their markedly reserved\nmanner now, I can make no sense out of it. I asked Cullingworth point\nblank what it meant, but he only turned it off with a forced laugh, and\nsome nonsense about my thin skin. I think that I am the last man in the\nworld to take offence where none is meant; but at any rate I determined\nto end the matter by leaving Bradfield at once. It had struck me, during\nmy journey back from Stockwell, that Birchespool would be a good place;\nso on the very next day I started off, taking my luggage with me, and\nbidding a final good-bye to Cullingworth and his wife.\n\n“You rely upon me, laddie,” said C. with something of his old geniality,\nas we shook hands on parting. “You get a good house in a central\nposition, put up your plate and hold on by your toe-nails. Charge little\nor nothing until you get a connection, and none of your professional\nhaw-dammy or you are a broken man. I’ll see that you don’t stop steaming\nfor want of coal.”\n\nSo with that comforting assurance I left them on the platform of the\nBradfield station. The words seem kind, do they not? and yet taking this\nmoney jars every nerve in my body. When I find that I can live on bread\nand water without it, I will have no more of it. But to do without it\nnow would be for the man who cannot swim to throw off his life-belt.\n\nI had plenty of time on my way to Birchespool to reflect upon my\nprospects and present situation. My baggage consisted of a large\nbrassplate, a small leather trunk, and a hat-box. The plate with my name\nengraved upon it was balanced upon the rack above my head. In my box\nwere a stethoscope, several medical books, a second pair of boots, two\nsuits of clothes, my linen and my toilet things. With this, and the five\npounds eighteen shillings which remain in my purse, I was sallying out\nto clear standing-room, and win the right to live from my fellow-men.\nBut at least there was some chance of permanency about this; and if\nthere was the promise of poverty and hardship, there was also that of\nfreedom. I should have no Lady Saltire to toss up her chin because I had\nmy own view of things, no Cullingworth to fly out at me about nothing. I\nwould be my own--my very own. I capered up and down the carriage at the\nthought. After all, I had everything to gain and nothing in the whole\nwide world to lose. And I had youth and strength and energy, and the\nwhole science of medicine packed in between my two ears. I felt as\nexultant as though I were going to take over some practice which lay\nready for me.\n\nIt was about four in the afternoon when I reached Birchespool, which\nis fifty-three miles by rail from Bradfield. It may be merely a name to\nyou, and, indeed, until I set foot in it I knew nothing of it myself;\nbut I can tell you now that it has a population of a hundred and\nthirty thousand souls (about the same as Bradfield), that it is mildly\nmanufacturing, that it is within an hour’s journey of the sea, that it\nhas an aristocratic western suburb with a mineral well, and that the\ncountry round is exceedingly beautiful. It is small enough to have a\ncharacter of its own, and large enough for solitude, which is always the\ngreat charm of a city, after the offensive publicity of the country.\n\nWhen I turned out with my brass plate, my trunk, and my hat-box upon the\nBirchespool platform, I sat down and wondered what my first move should\nbe. Every penny was going to be of the most vital importance to me,\nand I must plan things within the compass of that tiny purse. As I\nsat pondering, there came a sight of interest, for I heard a burst of\ncheering with the blare of a band upon the other side of the station,\nand then the pioneers and leading files of a regiment came swinging on\nto the platform. They wore white sun-hats, and were leaving for Malta,\nin anticipation of war in Egypt. They were young soldiers--English by\nthe white facings--with a colonel whose moustache reached his shoulders,\nand a number of fresh-faced long-legged subalterns. I chiefly remember\none of the colour-sergeants, a man of immense size and ferocious face,\nwho leaned upon his Martini, with two little white kittens peeping over\neither shoulder from the flaps of his knapsack. I was so moved at the\nsight of these youngsters going out to do their best for the dear old\ncountry, that I sprang up on my box, took off my hat, and gave them\nthree cheers. At first the folk on my side looked at me in their bovine\nfashion--like a row of cows over a wall. At the second a good many\njoined, and at the third my own voice was entirely lost. So I turned to\ngo my way, and the soldier laddies to go theirs; and I wondered which of\nus had the stiffest and longest fight before us.\n\nI left my baggage at the office, and jumped into a tramcar which was\npassing the station, with the intention of looking for lodgings, as\nI judged that they would be cheaper than an hotel. The conductor\ninterested himself in my wants in that personal way which makes me think\nthat the poorer classes in England are one of the kindliest races on\nearth. Policemen, postmen, railway guards, busmen, what good helpful\nfellows they all are! This one reckoned the whole thing out, how this\nstreet was central but dear, and the other was out-of-the-way but cheap,\nand finally dropped me at a medium shabby-genteel kind of thoroughfare\ncalled Cadogan Terrace, with instructions that I was to go down there\nand see how I liked it.\n\nI could not complain of a limited selection, for a “to let” or\n“apartments” was peeping out of every second window. I went into the\nfirst attractive house that I saw, and interviewed the rather obtuse\nand grasping old lady who owned it. A sitting-bed-room was to be had for\nthirteen shillings a week. As I had never hired rooms before, I had no\nidea whether this was cheap or dear; but I conclude it was the latter,\nsince on my raising my eyebrows as an experiment she instantly came down\nto ten shillings and sixpence. I tried another look and an exclamation\nof astonishment; but as she stood firm, I gathered that I had touched\nthe bottom.\n\n“Your rooms are quite clean?” I asked, for there was a wooden panelling\nwhich suggested possibilities.\n\n“Quite clean, Sir.”\n\n“No vermin?”\n\n“The officers of the garrison come sometimes.”\n\nThis took some thinking out. It had an ugly sound, but I gathered that\nshe meant that there could be no question about the cleanliness since\nthese gentlemen were satisfied. So the bargain was struck, and I ordered\ntea to be ready in an hour, while I went back to the station to fetch up\nmy luggage. A porter brought it up for eightpence (saving fourpence on\na cab, my boy!) and so I found myself in the heart of Birchespool with\na base of operations secured. I looked out of the little window of my\nlodgings at the reeking pots and grey sloping roofs, with a spire or\ntwo spurting up among them, and I shook my teaspoon defiantly at them.\n“You’ve got to conquer me,” said I, “or else I’m man enough to conquer\nyou.”\n\nNow, you would hardly expect that a fellow would have an adventure on\nhis very first night in a strange town; but I had--a trivial one, it is\ntrue, but fairly exciting while it lasted. Certainly it reads more like\nwhat might happen to a man in a book, but you may take it from me that\nit worked out just as I set it down here.\n\nWhen I had finished my tea, I wrote a few letters--one to Cullingworth,\nand one to Horton. Then, as it was a lovely evening, I determined to\nstroll out and see what sort of a place it was upon which Fate had\nwashed me up. “Best begin as you mean to go on,” thought I; so I donned\nmy frock-coat, put on my carefully-brushed top-hat, and sallied forth\nwith my very respectable metal-headed walking stick in my hand.\n\nI walked down to the Park, which is the chief centre of the place, and I\nfound that I liked everything I saw of it. It was a lovely evening, and\nthe air was fresh and sweet. I sat down and listened to the band for an\nhour, watching all the family parties, and feeling particularly lonely.\nMusic nearly always puts me into the minor key; so there came a time\nwhen I could stand it no longer, and I set off to find my way back to my\nlodgings. On the whole, I felt that Birchespool was a place in which a\nman might very well spend a happy life.\n\nAt one end of Cadogan Terrace (where I am lodging) there is a wide open\nspace where several streets meet. In the centre of this stands a large\nlamp in the middle of a broad stone pedestal, a foot or so high, and ten\nor twelve across. Well, as I strolled along I saw there was something\ngoing on round this lamppost. A crowd of people had gathered, with a\nswirl in the centre. I was, of course, absolutely determined not to get\nmixed up in any row; but I could not help pushing my way through the\ncrowd to see what was the matter.\n\nIt wasn’t a pretty sight. A woman, pinched and bedraggled, with a baby\non her arm, was being knocked about by a burly brute of a fellow whom I\njudged to be her husband from the way in which he cherished her. He was\none of those red-faced, dark-eyed men who can look peculiarly malignant\nwhen they choose. It was clear that he was half mad with drink, and that\nshe had been trying to lure him away from some den. I was just in time\nto see him take a flying kick at her, amid cries of “Shame!” from the\ncrowd, and then lurch forward again, with the evident intention of\nhaving another, the mob still expostulating vaguely.\n\nIf, Bertie, it had been old student days, I should have sailed straight\nin, as you or any other fellow would have done. My flesh crept with my\nloathing for the brute. But I had also to think of what I was and where\nI was, and what I had come there to do. However, there are some things\nwhich a man cannot stand, so I took a couple of steps forward, put my\nhand on the fellow’s shoulder, and said in as conciliatory and genial a\nvoice as I could muster: “Come, come, my lad! Pull yourself together.”\n\nInstead of “pulling himself together,” he very nearly knocked me\nasunder. I was all abroad for an instant. He had turned on me like a\nflash, and had struck me on the throat just under the chin, my head\nbeing a little back at the moment. It made me swallow once or twice, I\ncan tell you. Sudden as the blow was, I had countered, in the automatic\nsort of way that a man who knows anything of boxing does. It was only\nfrom the elbow, with no body behind it, but it served to stave him off\nfor the moment, while I was making inquiries about my windpipe. Then\nin he came with a rush; and the crowd swarming round with shrieks of\ndelight, we were pushed, almost locked in each other’s arms on to that\nbig pedestal of which I have spoken. “Go it, little ‘un!” “Give him\nbeans!” yelled the mob, who had lost all sight of the origin of the\nfray, and could only see that my opponent was two inches the shorter\nman. So there, my dear Bertie, was I, within a few hours of my entrance\ninto this town, with my top-hat down to my ears, my highly professional\nfrock-coat, and my kid gloves, fighting some low bruiser on a pedestal\nin one of the most public places, in the heart of a yelling and hostile\nmob! I ask you whether that was cruel luck or not?\n\nCullingworth told me before I started that Birchespool was a lively\nplace. For the next few minutes it struck me as the liveliest I had ever\nseen. The fellow was a round hand hitter, but so strong that he needed\nwatching. A round blow is, as you know, more dangerous than a straight\none if it gets home; for the angle of the jaw, the ear, and the\ntemple, are the three weakest points which you present. However, I took\nparticular care that my man did not get home; but, on the other hand, I\nfear that I did not do him much harm either. He bored in with his\nhead down; and I, like a fool, broke my knuckles over the top of his\nimpenetrable skull. Of course, theoretically I should either have\nstepped back and tried an undercut, or else taken him into chancery; but\nI must confess to feeling flurried and rattled from the blow I had\nhad, as well as from the suddenness of the whole affair. However, I was\ncooling down, and I daresay should in time have done something rational,\nwhen the affray came to a sudden and unexpected end.\n\nThis was from the impatience and excitement of the crowd. The folk\nbehind, wishing to see all that was going on, pushed against those in\nfront, until half-a-dozen of the foremost (with, I think, a woman among\nthem) were flung right up against us. One of these, a rough, sailor-like\nfellow in a jersey, got wedged between us; and my antagonist, in his\nblind rage, got one of his swinging blows home upon this new-comer’s\near. “What, you----!” yelled the sailor; and in an instant he had taken\nover the whole contract, and was at it hammer and tongs with my beauty.\nI grabbed my stick, which had fallen among the crowd, and backed my way\nout, rather dishevelled, but very glad to get off so cheaply. From the\nshouting which I could hear some time after I reached the door of my\nlodgings, I gathered that a good battle was still raging.\n\nYou see, it was the merest piece of luck in the world that my first\nappearance in Birchespool was not in the dock of the police-court. I\nshould have had no one to answer for me, if I had been arrested, and\nshould have been put quite on a level with my adversary. I daresay you\nthink I made a great fool of myself, but I should like to know how\nI could have acted otherwise. The only thing that I feel now is my\nloneliness. What a lucky fellow you are with your wife and child!\n\nAfter all, I see more and more clearly that both men and women are\nincomplete, fragmentary, mutilated creatures, as long as they are\nsingle. Do what they may to persuade themselves that their state is\nthe happiest, they are still full of vague unrests, of dim, ill-defined\ndissatisfactions, of a tendency to narrow ways and selfish thoughts.\nAlone each is a half-made being, with every instinct and feeling\nyearning for its missing moiety. Together they form a complete and\nsymmetrical whole, the minds of each strongest where that of the other\nneeds reinforcing. I often think that if our souls survive death (and I\nbelieve they do, though I base my believe on very different grounds from\nyours), every male soul will have a female one attached to or combined\nwith it, to round it off and give it symmetry. So thought the old\nMormon, you remember, who used it as an argument for his creed. “You\ncannot take your railway stocks into the next world with you,” he said.\n“But with all our wives and children we should make a good start in the\nworld to come.”\n\nI daresay you are smiling at me, as you read this, from the vantage\nground of your two years of matrimony. It will be long before I shall be\nable to put my views into practice.\n\nWell, good-bye, my dear old chap! As I said at the beginning of my\nletter, the very thought of you is good for me, and never more so than\nat this moment, when I am alone in a strange city, with very dubious\nprospects, and an uncertain future. We differ as widely as the poles,\nyou and I, and have done ever since I have known you. You are true\nto your faith, I to my reason--you to your family belief, I to my own\nideas; but our friendship shows that the real essentials of a man, and\nhis affinity for others, depends upon quite other things than views on\nabstract questions. Anyway, I can say with all my heart that I wish I\nsaw you with that old corncob of yours between your teeth, sitting\nin that ricketty American-leather armchair, with the villanous\nlodging-house antimacassar over the back of it. It is good of you to\ntell me how interested you are in my commonplace adventures; though if I\nhad not KNOWN that you were so, you may be sure that I should never have\nventured to inflict any of them upon you. My future is now all involved\nin obscurity, but it is obvious that the first thing I must do is to\nfind a fitting house, and my second to cajole the landlord into letting\nme enter into possession of it without any prepayment. To that I will\nturn myself to-morrow morning, and you shall know the result. Whom\nshould I hear from the other day but Archie McLagan? Of course it was a\nbegging letter. You can judge how far I am in a state to lose money; but\nin a hot fit I sent him ten shillings, which now, in my cold, I bitterly\nregret. With every good wish to you and yours, including your town, your\nState, and your great country, yours as ever.\n\n\n\n\nXI. OAKLEY VILLAS, BIRCHESPOOL, 29th May, 1882.\n\n\nBirchespool is really a delightful place, dear Bertie; and I ought to\nknow something about it, seeing that I have padded a good hundred miles\nthrough its streets during the last seven days. Its mineral springs used\nto be quite the mode a century or more ago; and it retains many traces\nof its aristocratic past, carrying it with a certain grace, too, as an\nemigre countess might wear the faded dress which had once rustled\nin Versailles. I forget the new roaring suburbs with their out-going\nmanufactures and their incoming wealth, and I live in the queer\nhealth-giving old city of the past. The wave of fashion has long passed\nover it, but a deposit of dreary respectability has been left behind.\nIn the High Street you can see the long iron extinguishers upon the\nrailings where the link-boys used to put out their torches, instead of\nstamping upon them or slapping them on the pavement, as was the custom\nin less high-toned quarters. There are the very high curbstones too,\nso that Lady Teazle or Mrs. Sneerwell could step out of coach or sedan\nchair without soiling her dainty satin shoes. It brings home to me what\nan unstable chemical compound man is. Here are the stage accessories\nas good as ever, while the players have all split up into hydrogen\nand oxygen and nitrogen and carbon, with traces of iron and silica and\nphosphorus. A tray full of chemicals and three buckets of water,--there\nis the raw material of my lady in the sedan chair! It’s a curious double\npicture, if one could but conjure it up. On the one side, the high-born\nbucks, the mincing ladies, the scheming courtiers, pushing and planning,\nand striving every one of them to attain his own petty object. Then for\na jump of a hundred years. What is this in the corner of the old vault?\nMargarine and chlesterine, carbonates, sulphates, and ptomaines! We turn\nfrom it in loathing, and as we go we carry with us that from which we\nfly.\n\nBut, mind you, Bertie, I have a very high respect for the human body,\nand I hold that it has been unduly snubbed and maligned by divines and\ntheologians: “our gross frames” and “our miserable mortal clay” are\nphrases which to my mind partake more of blasphemy than of piety. It\nis no compliment to the Creator to depreciate His handiwork. Whatever\ntheory or belief we may hold about the soul, there can, I suppose, be\nno doubt that the body is immortal. Matter may be transformed (in which\ncase it may be re-transformed), but it can never be destroyed. If\na comet were to strike this globule of ours, and to knock it into a\nbillion fragments, which were splashed all over the solar system--if\nits fiery breath were to lick up the earth’s surface until it was peeled\nlike an orange, still at the end of a hundred millions of years\nevery tiniest particle of our bodies would exist--in other forms and\ncombinations, it is true, but still those very atoms which now form the\nforefinger which traces these words. So the child with the same wooden\nbricks will build a wall, then strew them on the table; then a tower,\nthen strew once more, and so ever with the same bricks.\n\nBut then our individuality? I often wonder whether something of that\nwilt cling to our atoms--whether the dust of Johnnie Munro will ever\nhave something of him about it, and be separable from that of Bertie\nSwanborough. I think it is possible that we DO impress ourselves upon\nthe units of our own structure. There are facts which tend to show that\nevery tiny organic cell of which a man is composed, contains in its\nmicrocosm a complete miniature of the individual of which it forms a\npart. The ovum itself from which we are all produced is, as you know,\ntoo small to be transfixed upon the point of a fine needle; and yet\nwithin that narrow globe lies the potentiality, not only for reproducing\nthe features of two individuals, but even their smallest tricks of\nhabit and of thought. Well, if a single cell contains so much, perhaps a\nsingle molecule and atom has more than we think.\n\nHave you ever had any personal experience of dermoid cysts? We had one\nin Cullingworth’s practice just before his illness, and we were both\nmuch excited about it. They seem to me to be one of those wee little\nchinks through which one may see deep into Nature’s workings. In this\ncase the fellow, who was a clerk in the post office, came to us with a\nswelling over his eyebrow. We opened it under the impression that it was\nan abscess, and found inside some hair and a rudimentary jaw with teeth\nin it. You know that such cases are common enough in surgery, and that\nno pathological museum is without an example.\n\nBut what are we to understand by it? So startling a phenomenon must have\na deep meaning. That can only be, I think, that EVERY cell in the\nbody has the power latent in it by which it may reproduce the whole\nindividual--and that occasionally under some special circumstances--some\nobscure nervous or vascular excitement--one of these microscopic units\nof structure actually does make a clumsy attempt in that direction.\n\nBut, my goodness, where have I got to? All this comes from the\nBirchespool lamp-posts and curb-stones. And I sat down to write such a\npractical letter too! However, I give you leave to be as dogmatic and\ndidactic as you like in return. Cullingworth says my head is like a\nbursting capsule, with all the seeds getting loose. Poor seed, too, I\nfear, but some of it may lodge somewhere--or not, as Fate pleases.\n\nI wrote to you last on the night that I reached here. Next morning I set\nto work upon my task. You would be surprised (at least I was) to see\nhow practical and methodical I can be. First of all I walked down to the\npost-office and I bought a large shilling map of the town. Then back I\ncame and pinned this out upon the lodging-house table. This done, I set\nto work to study it, and to arrange a series of walks by which I should\npass through every street of the place. You have no idea what that means\nuntil you try to do it. I used to have breakfast, get out about ten,\nwalk till one, have a cheap luncheon (I can do well on three-pence),\nwalk till four, get back and note results. On my map I put a cross for\nevery empty house and a circle for every doctor. So at the end of that\ntime I had a complete chart of the whole place, and could see at a\nglance where there was a possible opening, and what opposition there was\nat each point.\n\nIn the meantime I had enlisted a most unexpected ally. On the second\nevening a card was solemnly brought up by the landlady’s daughter from\nthe lodger who occupied the room below. On it was inscribed “Captain\nWhitehall”; and then underneath, in brackets, “Armed Transport.” On\nthe back of the card was written, “Captain Whitehall (Armed Transport)\npresents his compliments to Dr. Munro, and would be glad of his\ncompany to supper at 8.30.” To this I answered, “Dr. Munro presents his\ncompliments to Captain Whitehall (Armed Transport), and will be most\nhappy to accept his kind invitation.” What “Armed Transport” might mean\nI had not an idea, but I thought it well to include it, as he seemed so\nparticular about it himself.\n\nOn descending I found a curious-looking figure in a gray dressing-gown\nwith a purple cord. He was an elderly man--his hair not quite white yet,\nbut well past mouse colour. His beard and moustache, however, were of a\nyellowish brown, and his face all puckered and shot with wrinkles, spare\nand yet puffy, with hanging bags under his singular light blue eyes.\n\n“By God, Dr. Munro, sir,” said he, as he shook my hand. “I take it as\nvery kind of you that you should accept an informal invitation. I do,\nsir, by God!”\n\nThis sentence was, as it proved, a very typical one, for he nearly\nalways began and ended each with an oath, while the centre was, as\na rule, remarkable for a certain suave courtesy. So regular was his\nformula that I may omit it and you suppose it, every time that he opened\nhis mouth. A dash here and there will remind you.\n\n“It’s been my practice, Dr. Munro, sir, to make friends with my\nneighbours through life; and some strange neighbours I have had. By\n----, sir, humble as you see me, I have sat with a general on my right,\nand an admiral on my left, and my toes up against a British ambassador.\nThat was when I commanded the armed transport Hegira in the Black Sea in\n‘55. Burst up in the great gale in Balaclava Bay, sir, and not as much\nleft as you could pick your teeth with.”\n\nThere was a strong smell of whisky in the room, and an uncorked bottle\nupon the mantelpiece. The captain himself spoke with a curious stutter,\nwhich I put down at first to a natural defect; but his lurch as he,\nturned back to his armchair showed me that he had had as much as he\ncould carry.\n\n“Not much to offer you, Dr. Munro, sir. The hind leg of a ---- duck,\nand a sailor’s welcome. Not Royal Navy, sir, though I have a ---- sight\nbetter manners than many that are. No, sir, I fly no false colours, and\nput no R. N. after my name; but I’m the Queen’s servant, by ----! No\nmercantile marine about me! Have a wet, sir! It’s the right stuff, and I\nhave drunk enough to know the difference.”\n\nWell, as the supper progressed I warmed with the liquor and the food,\nand I told my new acquaintance all about my plans and intentions. I\ndidn’t realise how lonely I had been until I found the pleasure of\ntalking. He listened to it all with much sympathy, and to my horror\ntossed off a whole tumbler-full of neat whisky to my success. So\nenthusiastic was he that it was all I could do to prevent him from\ndraining a second one.\n\n“You’ll do it, Dr. Munro, sir!” he cried. “I know a man when I see one,\nand you’ll do it. There’s my hand, sir! I’m with you! You needn’t be\nashamed to grasp it, for by ----, though I say it myself, it’s been open\nto the poor and shut to a bully ever since I could suck milk. Yes, sir,\nyou’ll make a good ship-mate, and I’m ---- glad to have you on my poop.”\n\nFor the remainder of the evening his fixed delusion was that I had come\nto serve under him; and he read me long rambling lectures about ship’s\ndiscipline, still always addressing me as “Dr. Munro, sir.” At last,\nhowever, his conversation became unbearable--a foul young man is odious,\nbut a foul old one is surely the most sickening thing on earth. One\nfeels that the white upon the hair, like that upon the mountain, should\nsignify a height attained. I rose and bade him good-night, with a last\nimpression of him leaning back in his dressing-gown, a sodden cigar-end\nin the corner of his mouth, his beard all slopped with whisky, and his\nhalf-glazed eyes looking sideways after me with the leer of a satyr. I\nhad to go into the street and walk up and down for half-an-hour before I\nfelt clean enough to go to bed.\n\nWell, I wanted to see no more of my neighbour, but in he came as I was\nsitting at breakfast, smelling like a bar-parlour, with stale whisky\noozing at every pore.\n\n“Good morning, Dr. Munro, sir,” said he, holding out a twitching hand.\n“I compliment you, sir! You look fresh, ---- fresh, and me with a head\nlike a toy-shop. We had a pleasant, quiet evening, and I took nothing to\nhurt, but it is the ---- relaxing air of this place that settles me. I\ncan’t bear up against it. Last year it gave me the horrors, and I expect\nit will again. You’re off house-hunting, I suppose?”\n\n“I start immediately after breakfast.”\n\n“I take a cursed interest in the whole thing. You may think it a ----\nimpertinence, but that’s the way I’m made. As long as I can steam I’ll\nthrow a rope to whoever wants a tow. I’ll tell you what I’ll do, Dr.\nMunro, sir. I’ll stand on one tack if you’ll stand on the other, and\nI’ll let you know if I come across anything that will do.”\n\nThere seemed to be no alternative between taking him with me, or letting\nhim go alone; so I could only thank him and let him have carte blanche.\nEvery night he would turn up, half-drunk as a rule, having, I believe,\nwalked his ten or fifteen miles as conscientiously as I had done. He\ncame with the most grotesque suggestions.\n\nOnce he had actually entered into negotiations with the owner of a huge\nshop, a place that had been a raper’s, with a counter about sixty feet\nlong. His reason was that he knew an innkeeper who had done very well a\nlittle further down on the other side. Poor old “armed transport” worked\nso hard that I could not help being touched and grateful; yet I longed\nfrom my heart that he would stop for he was a most unsavoury agent,\nand I never knew what extraordinary step he might take in my name. He\nintroduced me to two other men, one of them a singular-looking creature\nnamed Turpey, who was struggling along upon a wound-pension, having,\nwhen only a senior midshipman, lost the sight of one eye and the use of\none arm through the injuries he received at some unpronounceable Pah in\nthe Maori war. The other was a sad-faced poetical-looking man, of\ngood birth as I understood, who had been disowned by his family on the\noccasion of his eloping with the cook. His name was Carr, and his chief\npeculiarity, that he was so regular in his irregularities that he could\nalways tell the time of day by the state of befuddlement that he was in.\nHe would cock his head, think over his own symptoms, and then give\nyou the hour fairly correctly. An unusual drink would disarrange him,\nhowever; and if you forced the pace in the morning, he would undress and\ngo to bed about tea-time, with a full conviction that all the clocks\nhad gone mad. These two strange waifs were among the craft to whom old\nWhitehall had in his own words, “thrown a rope”; and long after I had\ngone to bed I could hear the clink of their glasses, and the tapping of\ntheir pipes against the fender in the room below.\n\nWell, when I had finished my empty-house-and-doctor chart, I found that\nthere was one villa to let, which undoubtedly was far the most suitable\nfor my purpose. In the first place it was fairly cheap-forty pounds, or\nfifty with taxes. The front looked well. It had no garden. It stood with\nthe well-to-do quarter upon the one side, and the poorer upon the other.\nFinally, it was almost at the intersection of four roads, one of which\nwas a main artery of the town. Altogether, if I had ordered a house for\nmy purpose I could hardly have got anything better, and I was thrilled\nwith apprehension lest some one should get before me to the agent. I\nhurried round and burst into the office with a precipitancy which rather\nstartled the demure clerk inside.\n\nHis replies, however, were reassuring. The house was still to let. It\nwas not quite the quarter yet, but I could enter into possession. I must\nsign an agreement to take it for one year, and it was usual to pay a\nquarter’s rent in advance.\n\nI don’t know whether I turned colour a little.\n\n“In advance!” I said, as carelessly as I could.\n\n“It is usual.”\n\n“Or references?”\n\n“Well, that depends, of couse{sic}, upon the references.”\n\n“Not that it matters much,” said I. (Heaven forgive me!) “Still, if it\nis the same to the firm, I may as well pay by the quarter, as I shall do\nafterwards.”\n\n“What names did you propose to give?” he asked.\n\nMy heart gave a bound, for I knew that all was right. My uncle, as\nyou know, won his knighthood in the Artillery, and though I have seen\nnothing of him, I knew that he was the man to pull me out of this tight\ncorner.\n\n“There’s my uncle, Sir Alexander Munro, Lismore House, Dublin,” said\nI. “He would be happy to answer any inquiry, and so would my friend Dr.\nCullingworth of Bradfield.”\n\nI brought him down with both barrels. I could see it by his eyes and the\ncurve of his back.\n\n“I have no doubt that that will be quite satisfactory,” said he.\n“Perhaps you would kindly sign the agreement.”\n\nI did so, and drew my hind foot across the Rubicon. The die was cast.\nCome what might, 1 Oakley Villas was on my hand for a twelve-month.\n\n“Would you like the key now?”\n\nI nearly snatched it out of his hands. Then away I ran to take\npossession of my property. Never shall I forget my feelings, my dear\nBertie, when the key clicked in the lock, and the door flew open. It was\nmy own house--all my very own! I shut the door again, the noise of the\nstreet died down, and I had, in that empty, dust-strewn hall, such a\nsense of soothing privacy as had never come to me before. In all my life\nit was the first time that I had ever stood upon boards which were not\npaid for by another.\n\nThen I proceeded to go from room to room with a delicious sense of\nexploration. There were two upon the ground floor, sixteen feet square\neach, and I saw with satisfaction that the wall papers were in fair\ncondition. The front one would make a consulting room, the other a\nwaiting room, though I did not care to reflect who was most likely to do\nthe waiting. I was in the highest spirits, and did a step dance in each\nroom as an official inauguration.\n\nThen down a winding wooden stair to the basement, where were kitchen\nand scullery, dimly lit, and asphalt-floored. As I entered the latter I\nstood staring. In every corner piles of human jaws were grinning at me.\nThe place was a Golgotha! In that half light the effect was sepulchral.\nBut as I approached and picked up one of them the mystery vanished.\nThey were of plaster-of-Paris, and were the leavings evidently of the\ndentist, who had been the last tenant. A more welcome sight was a huge\nwooden dresser with drawers and a fine cupboard in the corner. It only\nwanted a table and a chair to be a furnished room.\n\nThen I ascended again and went up the first flight of stairs. There were\ntwo other good sized apartments there. One should be my bedroom, and the\nother a spare room. And then another flight with two more. One for the\nservant, when I had one, and the other for a guest.\n\nFrom the windows I had a view of the undulating gray back of the city,\nwith the bustle of green tree tops. It was a windy day, and the clouds\nwere drifting swiftly across the heavens, with glimpses of blue between.\nI don’t know how it was, but as I stood looking through the grimy panes\nin the empty rooms a sudden sense of my own individuality and of my\nresponsibility to some higher power came upon me, with a vividness which\nwas overpowering. Here was a new chapter of my life about to be opened.\nWhat was to be the end of it? I had strength, I had gifts. What was I\ngoing to do with them? All the world, the street, the cabs, the houses,\nseemed to fall away, and the mite of a figure and the unspeakable\nGuide of the Universe were for an instant face to face. I was on my\nknees--hurled down all against my own will, as it were. And even then\nI could find no words to say. Only vague yearnings and emotions and a\nheartfelt wish to put my shoulder to the great wheel of good. What could\nI say? Every prayer seemed based on the idea that God was a magnified\nman--that He needed asking and praising and thanking. Should the cog of\nthe wheel creak praise to the Engineer? Let it rather cog harder, and\ncreak less. Yet I did, I confess, try to put the agitation of my soul\ninto words. I meant it for a prayer; but when I considered afterwards\nthe “supposing thats” and “in case ofs” with which it was sprinkled, it\nmust have been more like a legal document. And yet I felt soothed and\nhappier as I went downstairs again.\n\nI tell you this, Bertie, because if I put reason above emotion I would\nnot have you think that I am not open to attacks of the latter also.\nI feel that what I say about religion is too cold and academic. I feel\nthat there should be something warmer and sweeter and more comforting.\nBut if you ask me to buy this at the price of making myself believe a\nthing to be true, which all that is nearest the divine in me cries out\nagainst, then you are selling your opiates too high. I’m a volunteer for\n“God’s own forlorn hope,” and I’ll clamber up the breech as long as I\nthink I can see the flag of truth waving in front of me.\n\nWell, my next two cares were to get drugs and furniture. The former\nI was sure that I could obtain on long credit; while the latter I\nwas absolutely determined not to get into debt over. I wrote to the\nApothecaries’ Company, giving the names of Cullingworth and of my\nfather, and ordering twelve pounds’ worth of tinctures, infusions,\npills, powders, ointments, and bottles. Cullingworth must, I should\nthink, have been one of their very largest customers, so I knew very\nwell that my order would meet with prompt attention.\n\nThere remained the more serious matter of the furniture. I calculated\nthat when my lodgings were paid for I might, without quite emptying my\npurse, expend four pounds upon furniture--not a large allowance for a\ngood sized villa. That would leave me a few shillings to go on with,\nand before they were exhausted Cullingworth’s pound would come in. Those\npounds, however, would be needed for the rent, so I could hardly reckon\nupon them at all, as far as my immediate wants went. I found in the\ncolumns of the Birchespool Post that there was to be a sale of furniture\nthat evening, and I went down to the auctioneer’s rooms, accompanied,\nmuch against my will, by Captain Whitehall, who was very drunk and\naffectionate.\n\n“By God, Dr. Munro, sir, I’m the man that’s going to stick to you. I’m\nonly an old sailor-man, sir, with perhaps more liquor than sense; but\nI’m the Queen’s servant, and touch my pension every quarter day. I\ndon’t claim to be R. N., but I’m not merchant service either. Here I\nam, rotting in lodgings, but by ----, Dr. Munro, sir, I carried seven\nthousand stinking Turks from Varna to Balaclava Bay. I’m with you, Dr.\nMunro, and we put this thing through together.”\n\nWe came to the auction rooms and we stood on the fringe of the crowd\nwaiting for our chance. Presently up went a very neat little table. I\ngave a nod and got it for nine shillings. Then three rather striking\nlooking chairs, black wood and cane bottoms. Four shillings each I gave\nfor those. Then a metal umbrella-stand, four and sixpence. That was a\nmere luxury, but I was warming to the work. A job lot of curtains all\ntied together in a bundle went up. Somebody bid five shillings. The\nauctioneer’s eye came round to me, and I nodded. Mine again for five\nand sixpence. Then I bought a square of red drugget for half-a-crown,\na small iron bed for nine shillings, three watercolour paintings,\n“Spring,” “The Banjo Player,” and “Windsor Castle,” for five shillings;\na tiny fender, half-a-crown; a toilet set, five shillings; another\nvery small square-topped table, three and sixpence. Whenever I bid\nfor anything, Whitehall thrust his black-thorn up into the air, and\npresently I found him doing so on my behalf when I had no intention of\nbuying. I narrowly escaped having to give fourteen and sixpence for a\nstuffed macaw in a glass case.\n\n“It would do to hang in your hall, Dr. Munro, sir,” said he when I\nremonstrated with him.\n\n“I should have to hang myself in my hall soon if I spent my money like\nthat,” said I. “I’ve got as much as I can afford now, and I must stop.”\n\nWhen the auction was over, I paid my bill and had my goods hoisted on\nto a trolly, the porter undertaking to deliver them for two shillings.\nI found that I had over-estimated the cost of furnishing, for the total\nexpense was little more than three pounds. We walked round to Oakley\nVilla, and I proudly deposited all my goods in the hall. And here came\nanother extraordinary example of the kindness of the poorer classes. The\nporter when I had paid him went out to his trolly and returned with a\nhuge mat of oakum, as ugly a thing as I have ever set eyes upon. This he\nlaid down inside my door, and then without a word, brushing aside every\nremonstrance or attempt at thanks, he vanished away with his trolly into\nthe night.\n\nNext morning I came round to my house--MY house, my boy!--for good\nand all, after paying off my landlady. Her bill came to more than I\nexpected, for I only had breakfast and tea, always “dining out” as I\nmajestically expressed it. However, it was a relief to me to get it\nsettled, and to go round with my box to Oakley Villas. An ironmonger had\nfixed my plate on to the railings for half-a-crown the evening before,\nand there it was, glittering in the sun, when I came round. It made me\nquite shy to look at it, and I slunk into the house with a feeling that\nevery window in the street had a face in it.\n\nBut once inside, there was so much to be done that I did not know what\nI should turn to first. I bought a one-and-ninepenny broom and set to\nwork. You notice that I am precise about small sums, because just there\nlies the whole key of the situation. In the yard I found a zinc pail\nwith a hole in it, which was most useful, for by its aid I managed to\ncarry up all the jaws with which my kitchen was heaped. Then with my new\nbroom, my coat hung on a gas-bracket and my shirt sleeves turned to the\nelbow, I cleaned out the lower rooms and the hall, brushing the refuse\ninto the yard. After that I did as much for the upper floor, with the\nresult that I brought several square yards of dust down into the hall\nagain, and undid my previous cleaning. This was disheartening, but at\nleast it taught me to begin at the furthest point in future. When I had\nfinished, I was as hot and dirty as if it were half-time at a football\nmatch. I thought of our tidy charwoman at home, and realised what\nsplendid training she must be in.\n\nThen came the arranging of the furniture. The hall was easily managed,\nfor the planks were of a dark colour, which looked well of themselves.\nMy oakum mat and my umbrella stand were the only things in it; but\nI bought three pegs for sixpence, and fastened them up at the side,\ncompleting the effect by hanging my two hats upon them. Finally, as the\nexpanse of bare floor was depressing, I fixed one of my curtains about\nhalfway down it, draping it back, so that it had a kind of oriental\nlook, and excited a vague idea of suites of apartments beyond. It was a\nfine effect, and I was exceedingly proud of it.\n\nFrom that I turned to the most important point of all--the arrangement\nof my consulting room. My experience with Cullingworth had taught me\none thing at least,--that patients care nothing about your house if they\nonly think that you can cure them. Once get that idea into their\nheads, and you may live in a vacant stall in a stable and write your\nprescriptions on the manger. Still, as this was, for many a day to\ncome, to be the only furnished room in my house, it was worth a little\nplanning to get it set out to the best advantage.\n\nMy red drugget I laid out in the centre, and fastened it down with\nbrass-headed nails. It looked much smaller than I had hoped,--a little\nred island on an ocean of deal board, or a postage stamp in the middle\nof an envelope. In the centre of it I placed my table, with three\nmedical works on one side of it, and my stethoscope and dresser’s case\nupon the other. One chair went with the table, of course; and then I\nspent the next ten minutes in trying to determine whether the other\ntwo looked better together--a dense block of chairs, as it were--or\nscattered so that the casual glance would get the idea of numerous\nchairs. I placed them finally one on the right, and one in front of\nthe table. Then I put down my fender, and nailed “Spring,” “The Banjo\nPlayers,” and “Windsor Castle” on to three of the walls, with the mental\npromise that my first spare half-crown should buy a picture for the\nfourth. In the window I placed my little square table, and balanced upon\nit a photograph with an ivory mounting and a nice plush frame which I\nhad brought in my trunk. Finally, I found a pair of dark brown curtains\namong the job lot which I had bought at the sale, and these I put up and\ndrew pretty close together, so that a subdued light came into the room,\nwhich toned everything down, and made the dark corners look furnished.\nWhen I had finished I really do not believe that any one could have\nguessed that the total contents of that room came to about thirty\nshillings.\n\nThen I pulled my iron bed upstairs and fixed it in the room which I had\nfrom the first determined upon as my bedchamber. I found an old packing\ncase in the yard--a relic of my predecessor’s removal--and this made a\nvery good wash-hand stand for my basin and jug. When it was all fixed up\nI walked, swelling with pride, through my own chambers, giving a touch\nhere and a touch there until I had it perfect. I wish my mother could\nsee it--or, on second thoughts, I don’t; for I know that her first act\nwould be to prepare gallons of hot water, and to holystone the whole\nplace down, from garret to cellar--and I know by my own small experience\nwhat that means.\n\nWell, that’s as far as I’ve got as yet. What trivial, trivial stuff,\ninteresting to hardly a soul under heaven, save only about three! Yet it\npleases me to write as long as I have your assurance that it pleases\nyou to read. Pray, give my kindest remembrances to your wife, and to\nCamelford also, if he should happen to come your way. He was on the\nMississippi when last I heard.\n\n\n\n\nXII. OAKLEY VILLAS, BIRCHESPOOL, 5th June, 1882.\n\n\nWhen I had made all those dispositions which I described with such\npainful prolixity in my last letter, my dear Bertie, I sat down on my\nstudy chair, and I laid out the whole of my worldly wealth upon the\ntable in front of me. I was startled when I looked at it,--three\nhalf-crowns, a florin, and four sixpences, or eleven and sixpence in\nall. I had expected to hear from Cullingworth before this; but at least\nhe was always there, a trusty friend, at my back. Immediately upon\nengaging the house I had written him a very full letter, telling him\nthat I had committed myself to keeping it for one year, but assuring him\nthat I was quite convinced that with the help which he had promised me\nI should be able to hold my own easily. I described the favourable\nposition of the house, and gave him every detail of the rent and\nneighbourhood. That letter would, I was sure, bring a reply from him\nwhich would contain my weekly remittance. One thing I had, above all,\ndetermined upon. That was that, whatever hardships might lie before me,\nI would fight through them without help from home. I knew, of course,\nthat my mother would have sold everything down to her gold eye-glasses\nto help me, and that no thought of our recent disagreement would have\nweighed with her for an instant; but still a man has his feelings, you\nknow, and I did not propose to act against her judgment and then run\nhowling for help.\n\nI sat in my house all day, with that ever-present sense of privacy and\nnovelty which had thrilled me when I first shut the street door behind\nme. At evening I sallied out and bought a loaf of bread, half a pound\nof tea (“sweepings,” they call it, and it cost eightpence), a tin\nkettle (fivepence), a pound of sugar, a tin of Swiss milk, and a tin\nof American potted meat. I had often heard my mother groan over the\nexpenses of housekeeping, and now I began to understand what she meant.\nTwo and ninepence went like a flash, but at least I had enough to keep\nmyself going for some days.\n\nThere was a convenient gas bracket in the back room. I hammered a\nsplinter of wood into the wall above it, and so made an arm upon which\nI could hang my little kettle and boil it over the flame. The attraction\nof the idea was that there was no immediate expense, and many things\nwould have happened before I was called upon to pay the gas bill. The\nback room was converted then into both kitchen and dining room. The sole\nfurniture consisted of my box, which served both as cupboard, as table,\nand as chair. My eatables were all kept inside, and when I wished for a\nmeal I had only to pick them out and lay them on the lid, leaving room\nfor myself to sit beside them.\n\nIt was only when I went to my bedroom that I realised the oversights\nwhich I had made in my furnishing. There was no mattress and no pillow\nor bed-clothes. My mind had been so centred upon the essentials for the\npractice, that I had never given a thought to my own private wants. I\nslept that night upon the irons of my bed, and rose up like St. Lawrence\nfrom the gridiron. My second suit of clothes with Bristowe’s “Principles\nof Medicine” made an excellent pillow, while on a warm June night a\nman can do well wrapped in his overcoat. I had no fancy for second-hand\nbed-clothes, and determined until I could buy some new ones, to make\nmyself a straw pillow, and to put on both my suits of clothes on the\ncolder nights. Two days later, however, the problem was solved in more\nluxurious style by the arrival of a big brown tin box from my mother,\nwhich was as welcome to me, and as much of a windfall, as the Spanish\nwreck to Robinson Crusoe. There were too pairs of thick blankets, two\nsheets, a counterpane, a pillow, a camp-stool, two stuffed bears’ paws\n(of all things in this world!), two terra-cotta vases, a tea-cosy, two\npictures in frames, several books, an ornamental ink-pot, and a number\nof antimacassars and coloured tablecloths. It is not until you own a\ntable with a deal top and mahogany legs, that you understand what the\ntrue inner meaning of an ornamental cloth is. Right on the top of this\ntreasure came a huge hamper from the Apothecaries’ Society with the\ndrugs which I had ordered. When they were laid out in line, the bottles\nextended right down one side of the dining-room and half down the other.\nAs I walked through my house and viewed my varied possessions, I\nfelt less radical in my views, and begun to think that there might be\nsomething in the rights of property after all.\n\nAnd I added to my effects in a marvellous way. I made myself an\nexcellent mattress out of some sacking and the straw in which the\nmedicine bottles had been packed.\n\nAgain, out of three shutters which belonged to the room, I rigged up a\nvery effective side-table for my own den, which when covered with a\nred cloth, and ornamented with the bears’ paws, might have cost twenty\nguineas for all that the patient could say to the contrary. I had done\nall this with a light heart and a good spirit before the paralysing blow\nwhich I shall have to tell you about, came upon me.\n\nOf course it was obvious from the first that a servant was out of the\nquestion. I could not feed one, far less pay one, and I had no kitchen\nfurniture. I must open my door to my own patients--let them think what\nthey would of it. I must clean my own plate and brush down my own front;\nand these duties must be thoroughly done, come what might, for I must\nshow a presentable outside to the public. Well, there was no great\nhardship in that, for I could do it under the cover of night. But I had\nhad a suggestion from my mother which simplified matters immensely. She\nhad written to say that if I wished she would send my little brother\nPaul to keep me company. I wrote back eagerly to agree. He was a hardy\ncheery little fellow of nine, who would, I knew, gladly share hard times\nwith me; while, if they became unduly so, I could always have him taken\nhome again. Some weeks must pass before he could come, but it cheered me\nto think of him. Apart from his company, there were a thousand ways in\nwhich he might be useful.\n\nWho should come in on the second day but old Captain Whitehall? I was\nin the back room, trying how many slices I could make out of a pound of\npotted beef, when he rang my bell, and I only just shut my mouth in time\nto prevent my heart jumping out.\n\nHow that bell clanged through the empty house! I saw who it was,\nhowever, when I went into the hall; for the middle panels of my door are\nof glazed glass, so that I can always study a silhouette of my visitors\nbefore coming to closer quarters.\n\nI was not quite sure yet whether I loathed the man or liked him. He was\nthe most extraordinary mixture of charity and drunkenness, lechery and\nself-sacrifice that I had ever come across. But he brought into the\nhouse with him a whiff of cheeriness and hope for which I could not but\nbe grateful. He had a large brown paper parcel under his arm, which he\nunwrapped upon my table, displaying a great brown jar. This he carried\nover and deposited on the centre of my mantel-piece.\n\n“You will permit me, Dr. Munro, sir, to place this trifle in your room.\nIt’s lava, sir; lava from Vesuvius, and made in Naples. By ----, you may\nthink its empty, Dr. Munro, sir, but it is full of my best wishes; and\nwhen you’ve got the best practice in this town you may point to that\nvase and tell how it came from a skipper of an armed transport, who\nbacked you from the start.”\n\nI tell you, Bertie, the tears started to my eyes, and I could hardly\ngulp out a word or two of thanks. What a crisscross of qualities in\none human soul! It was not the deed or the words; but it was the almost\nwomanly look in the eyes of this broken, drink-sodden old Bohemian--the\nsympathy and the craving for sympathy which I read there. Only for an\ninstant though, for he hardened again into his usual reckless and half\ndefiant manner.\n\n“There’s another thing, sir. I’ve been thinking for some time back of\nhaving a medical opinion on myself. I’d be glad to put myself under your\nhands, if you would take a survey of me.”\n\n“What’s the matter?” I asked.\n\n“Dr. Munro, sir,” said he, “I am a walking museum. You could fit what\nISN’T the matter with me on to the back of a ---- visiting card. If\nthere’s any complaint you want to make a special study of, just you come\nto me, sir, and see what I can do for you. It’s not every one that can\nsay that he has had cholera three times, and cured himself by living\non red pepper and brandy. If you can only set the ---- little germs\nsneezing they’ll soon leave you alone. That’s my theory about cholera,\nand you should make a note of it, Dr. Munro, sir, for I was shipmates\nwith fifty dead men when I was commanding the armed transport Hegira in\nthe Black Sea, and I know ---- well what I am talking about.”\n\nI fill in Whitehall’s oaths with blanks because I feel how hopeless it\nis to reproduce their energy and variety. I was amazed when he stripped,\nfor his whole body was covered with a perfect panorama of tattooings,\nwith a big blue Venus right over his heart.\n\n“You may knock,” said he, when I began to percuss his chest, “but I am\n---- sure there’s no one at home. They’ve all gone visiting one another.\nSir John Hutton had a try some years ago. ‘Why, dammy, man, where’s your\nliver?’ said he. ‘Seems to me that some one has stirred you up with a\nporridge stick,’ said he. ‘Nothing is in its right place.’ ‘Except\nmy heart, Sir John,’ said I. ‘Aye, by ----, that will never lose its\nmoorings while it has a flap left.’”\n\nWell, I examined him, and I found his own account not very far from the\ntruth. I went over him carefully from head to foot, and there was not\nmuch left as Nature made it. He had mitral regurgitation, cirrhosis of\nthe liver, Bright’s disease, an enlarged spleen, and incipient dropsy.\nI gave him a lecture about the necessity of temperance, if not of total\nabstinence; but I fear that my words made no impression. He chuckled,\nand made a kind of clucking noise in his throat all the time that I was\nspeaking, but whether in assent or remonstrance I cannot say.\n\nHe pulled out his purse when I had finished, but I begged him to look on\nmy small service as a mere little act of friendship. This would not do\nat all, however, and he seemed so determined about it that I was forced\nto give way.\n\n“My fee is five shillings, then, since you insist upon making it a\nbusiness matter.”\n\n“Dr. Munro, sir,” he broke out, “I have been examined by men whom I\nwouldn’t throw a bucket of water over if they were burning, and I never\npaid them less than a guinea. Now that I have come to a gentleman and a\nfriend, stiffen me purple if I pay one farthing less.”\n\nSo, after much argument, it ended in the kind fellow going off and\nleaving a sovereign and a shilling on the edge of my table. The money\nburned my fingers, for I knew that his pension was not a very large one;\nand yet, since I could not avoid taking it, there was no denying that it\nwas exceedingly useful. Out I sallied and spent sixteen shillings of it\nupon a new palliasse which should go under the straw mattress upon my\nbed. Already, you see, I was getting to a state of enervating luxury\nin my household arrangements, and I could only lull my conscience by\nreminding myself that little Paul would have to sleep with me when he\ncame.\n\nHowever, I had not quite got to the end of Whitehall’s visit yet. When\nI went back I took down the beautiful lava jug, and inside I found his\ncard. On the back was written, “You have gone into action, sir. It may\nbe your fate to sink or to swim, but it can never be your degradation\nto strike. Die on the last plank and be damned to you, or come into port\nwith your ensign flying mast-high.”\n\nWas it not fine? It stirred my blood, and the words rang like a bugle\ncall in my head. It braced me, and the time was coming when all the\nbracing I could get would not be too much. I copied it out, and pinned\nit on one side of my mantel-piece. On the other I stuck up a chip from\nCarlyle, which I daresay is as familiar to you as to me. “One way or\nanother all the light, energy, and available virtue which we have does\ncome out of us, and goes very infallibly into God’s treasury, living and\nworking through eternities there. We are not lost--not a single atom\nof us--of one of us.” Now, there is a religious sentence which is\nintellectually satisfying, and therefore morally sound.\n\nThis last quotation leads to my second visitor. Such a row we had! I\nmake a mistake in telling you about it, for I know your sympathies will\nbe against me; but at least it will have the good effect of making you\nboil over into a letter of remonstrance and argument than which nothing\ncould please me better.\n\n\nWell, the second person whom I admitted through my door was the High\nChurch curate of the parish--at least, I deduced High Church from his\ncollar and the cross which dangled from his watch chain. He seemed to be\na fine upstanding manly fellow--in fact, I am bound in honesty to admit\nthat I have never met the washy tea-party curate outside the pages of\nPunch. As a body, I think they would compare very well in manliness (I\ndo not say in brains) with as many young lawyers or doctors. Still, I\nhave no love for the cloth. Just as cotton, which is in itself the most\nharmless substance in the world, becomes dangerous on being dipped into\nnitric acid, so the mildest of mortals is to be feared if he is once\nsoaked in sectarian religion. If he has any rancour or hardness in him\nit will bring it out. I was therefore by no means overjoyed to see my\nvisitor, though I trust that I received him with fitting courtesy. The\nquick little glance of surprise which he shot round him as he entered my\nconsulting-room, told me that it was not quite what he had expected.\n\n“You see, the Vicar has been away for two years,” he explained, “and\nwe have to look after things in his absence. His chest is weak, and he\ncan’t stand Birchespool. I live just opposite, and, seeing your plate go\nup, I thought I would call and welcome you into our parish.”\n\nI told him that I was very much obliged for the attention. If he\nhad stopped there all would have been well, and we should have had a\npleasant little chat. But I suppose it was his sense of duty which would\nnot permit it.\n\n“I trust,” said he, “that we shall see you at St. Joseph’s.”\n\nI was compelled to explain that it was not probable.\n\n“A Roman Catholic?” he asked, in a not unfriendly voice.\n\nI shook my head, but nothing would discourage him.\n\n“Not a dissenter!” he exclaimed, with a sudden hardening of his genial\nface.\n\nI shook my head again.\n\n“Ah, a little lax--a little remiss!” he said playfully, and with an\nexpression of relief. “Professional men get into these ways. They\nhave much to distract them. At least, you cling fast, no doubt, to the\nfundamental truths of Christianity?”\n\n“I believe from the bottom of my heart,” said I, “that the Founder of\nit was the best and sweetest character of whom we have any record in the\nhistory of this planet.”\n\nBut instead of soothing him, my conciliatory answer seemed to be taken\nas a challenge. “I trust,” said he severely, “that your belief goes\nfurther than that. You, are surely prepared to admit that He was an\nincarnation of the God-head.”\n\nI began to feel like the old badger in his hole who longs to have a\nscratch at the black muzzle which is so eager to draw him.\n\n“Does it not strike you,” I said, “that if He were but a frail mortal\nlike ourselves, His life assumes a much deeper significance? It then\nbecomes a standard towards which we might work. If, on the other hand,\nHe was intrinsically of a different nature to ourselves, then His\nexistence loses its point, since we and He start upon a different basis.\nTo my mind it is obvious that such a supposition takes away the beauty\nand the moral of His life. If He was divine then He COULD not sin, and\nthere was an end of the matter. We who are not divine and can sin, have\nlittle to learn from a life like that.”\n\n“He triumphed over sin,” said my visitor, as if a text or a phrase were\nan argument.\n\n“A cheap triumph!” I said. “You remember that Roman emperor who used to\ndescend into the arena fully armed, and pit himself against some poor\nwretch who had only a leaden foil which would double up at a thrust.\nAccording to your theory of your Master’s life, you would have it that\nHe faced the temptations of this world at such an advantage that they\nwere only harmless leaden things, and not the sharp assailants which we\nfind them. I confess, in my own case, that my sympathy is as strong when\nI think of His weaknesses as of His wisdom and His virtue. They come\nmore home to me, I suppose, since I am weak myself.”\n\n“Perhaps you would be good enough to tell me what has impressed you as\nweak in His conduct?” asked my visitor stiffly.\n\n“Well, the more human traits--‘weak’ is hardly the word I should have\nused. His rebuke of the Sabbatarians, His personal violence to the\nhucksters, His outbursts against the Pharisees, His rather unreasoning\npetulance against the fig-tree because it bore no fruit at the wrong\nseason of the year, His very human feeling towards the housewife who\nbustled about when He was talking, his gratification that the ointment\nshould have been used for Him instead of being devoted to the poor,\nHis self-distrust before the crisis--these make me realise and love the\nman.”\n\n“You are a Unitarian, then, or rather, perhaps, a mere Deist?” said the\ncurate, with a combative flush.\n\n“You may label me as you like,” I answered (and by this time I fear that\nI had got my preaching stop fairly out); “I don’t pretend to know what\ntruth is, for it is infinite, and I finite; but I know particularly well\nwhat it is NOT. It is not true that religion reached its acme nineteen\nhundred years ago, and that we are for ever to refer back to what was\nwritten and said in those days. No, sir; religion is a vital living\nthing, still growing and working, capable of endless extension and\ndevelopment, like all other fields of thought. There were many eternal\ntruths spoken of old and handed down to us in a book, some parts\nof which may indeed be called holy. But there are others yet to be\nrevealed; and if we are to reject them because they are not in those\npages, we should act as wisely as the scientist who would take no notice\nof Kirschoff’s spectral analysis because there is no mention of it in\nAlbertus Magnus. A modern prophet may wear a broadcloth coat and write\nto the magazines; but none the less he may be the little pipe which\nconveys a tiny squirt from the reservoirs of truth. Look at this!” I\ncried, rising and reading my Carlyle text. “That comes from no Hebrew\nprophet, but from a ratepayer in Chelsea. He and Emerson are also among\nthe prophets. The Almighty has not said His last say to the human race,\nand He can speak through a Scotchman or a New Englander as easily as\nthrough a Jew. The Bible, sir, is a book which comes out in instalments,\nand ‘To be continued,’ not ‘Finis,’ is written at the end of it.”\n\nMy visitor had been showing every sign of acute uneasiness during this\nlong speech of mine. Finally, he sprang to his feet, and took his hat\nfrom the table.\n\n“Your opinions are highly dangerous, sir,” said he. “It is my duty to\ntell you so. You believe in nothing.”\n\n“Nothing which limits the power or the goodness of the Almighty,” I\nanswered.\n\n“You have evolved all this from your own spiritual pride and\nself-sufficiency,” said he, hotly. “Why do you not turn to that Deity\nwhose name you use. Why do you not humble yourself before Him?”\n\n“How do you know I don’t?”\n\n“You said yourself that you never went to church.”\n\n“I carry my own church about under my own hat,” said I. “Bricks and\nmortar won’t make a staircase to heaven. I believe with your Master that\nthe human heart is the best temple. I am sorry to see that you differ\nfrom Him upon the point.”\n\nPerhaps it was too bad of me to say that. I might have guarded without\ncountering. Anyhow; it had the effect of ending an interview which was\nbecoming oppressive. My visitor was too indignant to answer, and swept\nout of the room without a word. From my window I could see him hurry\ndown the street, a little black angry thing, very hot and troubled\nbecause he cannot measure the whole universe with his pocket square and\ncompasses.\n\nThink of it, and think of what he is, an atom among atoms, standing at\nthe meeting point of two eternities! But what am I, a brother atom, that\nI should judge him?\n\nAfter all, I own to you, that it might have been better had I listened\nto what he had to say, and refused to give my own views. On the other\nhand, truth MUST be as broad as the universe which it is to explain, and\ntherefore far broader than anything which the mind of man can conceive.\nA protest against sectarian thought must always be an aspiration towards\ntruth. Who shall dare to claim a monopoly of the Almighty? It would be\nan insolence on the part of a solar system, and yet it is done every\nday by a hundred little cliques of mystery mongers. There lies the real\nimpiety.\n\nWell, the upshot of it all is, my dear Bertie, that I have begun my\npractice by making an enemy of the man who, of the whole parish, has the\nmost power to injure me. I know what my father would think about it, if\nhe knew.\n\nAnd now I come to the great event of this morning, from which I am still\ngasping. That villain Cullingworth has cut the painter, and left me to\ndrift as best I may.\n\nMy post comes at eight o’clock in the morning, and I usually get my\nletters and take them into bed to read them. There was only one this\nmorning, addressed in his strange, unmistakable hand. I made sure,\nof course, that it was my promised remittance, and I opened it with a\npleasurable feeling of expectation. This is a copy of what I read:--\n\n“When the maid was arranging your room after your departure, she cleared\nsome pieces of torn paper from under the grate. Seeing my name upon\nthem, she brought them, as in duty bound, to her mistress, who pasted\nthem together and found that they formed a letter from your mother to\nyou, in which I am referred to in the vilest terms, such as ‘a bankrupt\nswindler’ and ‘the unscrupulous Cullingworth.’ I can only say that we\nare astonished that you could have been a party to such a correspondence\nwhile you were a guest under our roof, and we refuse to have anything\nmore to do with you in any shape or form.”\n\nThat was a nice little morning greeting was it not, after I had, on the\nstrength of his promise, started in practice, and engaged a house for\na year with a few shillings in my pocket? I have given up smoking for\nreasons of economy; but I felt that the situation was worthy of a pipe,\nso I climbed out of bed, gathered a little heap of tobacco-dust from the\nlinings of my pocket, and smoked the whole thing over. That life-belt of\nwhich I had spoken so confidingly had burst, and left me to kick as best\nI might in very deep water. I read the note over and over again; and for\nall my dilemma, I could not help laughing at the mingled meanness and\nstupidity of the thing. The picture of the host and hostess busying\nthemselves in gumming together the torn letters of their departed guest\nstruck me as one of the funniest things I could remember. And there\nwas the stupidity of it, because surely a child could have seen that my\nmother’s attack was in answer to my defence. Why should we write a duet\neach saying the same thing? Well, I’m still very confused about it all,\nand I don’t in the least know what I am going to do--more likely to die\non the last plank, than to get into port with my ensign mast-high. I\nmust think it out and let you know the result. Come what may, one thing\nonly is sure, and that is that, in weal or woe, I remain, ever, your\naffectionate and garrulous friend.\n\n\n\n\nXIII. OAKLEY VILLAS, BIRCHESPOOL, 12th June, 1882.\n\n\nWhen I wrote my last letter, my dear Bertie, I was still gasping, like\na cod on a sand-bank, after my final dismissal by Cullingworth. The mere\nsetting of it all down in black and white seemed to clear the matter up,\nand I felt much more cheery by the time I had finished my letter. I was\njust addressing the envelope (observe what a continuous narrative you\nget of my proceedings!) when I was set jumping out of my carpet slippers\nby a ring at the bell. Through the glass panel I observed that it was a\nrespectable-looking bearded individual with a top-hat. It was a patient.\nIt MUST be a patient! Then first I realised what an entirely different\nthing it is to treat the patient of another man (as I had done with\nHorton) or to work a branch of another man’s practice (as I had done\nwith Cullingworth), and to have to do with a complete stranger on your\nown account. I had been thrilling to have one. Now that he had come I\nfelt for an instant as if I would not open the door. But of course that\nwas only a momentary weakness. I answered his ring with, I fear, rather\na hypocritical air of insouciance, as though I had happened to find\nmyself in the hall, and did not care to trouble the maid to ascend the\nstairs.\n\n“Dr. Stark Munro?” he asked.\n\n“Pray step in,” I answered, and waved him into the consulting-room. He\nwas a pompous, heavy-stepping, thick-voiced sort of person, but to me he\nwas an angel from on high. I was nervous, and at the same time so afraid\nthat he should detect my nervousness and lose confidence in me, that I\nfound myself drifting into an extravagant geniality. He seated himself\nat my invitation and gave a husky cough.\n\n“Ah,” said I--I always prided myself on being quick at\ndiagnosis--“bronchial, I perceive. These summer colds are a little\ntrying.”\n\n“Yes,” said he. “I’ve had it some time.”\n\n“With a little care and treatment----” I suggested.\n\nHe did not seem sanguine, but groaned and shook his head. “It’s not\nabout that I’ve come,” said he.\n\n“No?” My heart turned to lead.\n\n“No, doctor.” He took out a bulging notebook. “It’s about a small sum\nthat’s due on the meter.”\n\nYou’ll laugh, Bertie, but it was no laughing matter to me. He wanted\neight and sixpence on account of something that the last tenant either\nhad or had not done. Otherwise the company would remove the gas-meter.\nHow little he could have guessed that the alternative he was presenting\nto me was either to pay away more than half my capital, or to give up\ncooking my food! I at last appeased him by a promise that I should look\ninto the matter, and so escaped for the moment, badly shaken but still\nsolvent. He gave me a good deal of information about the state of his\ntubes (his own, not the gas company’s) before he departed; but I had\nrather lost interest in the subject since I had learned that he was\nbeing treated by his club doctor.\n\nThat was the first of my morning incidents. My second followed hard upon\nthe heels of it. Another ring came, and from my post of observation I\nsaw that a gipsy’s van, hung with baskets and wickerwork chairs, had\ndrawn up at the door. Two or three people appeared to be standing\noutside. I understood that they wished me to purchase some of their\nwares, so I merely opened the door about three inches, said “No, thank\nyou,” and closed it. They seemed not to have heard me for they rang\nagain, upon which I opened the door wider and spoke more decidedly.\nImagine my surprise when they rang again. I flung the door open, and was\nabout to ask them what they meant by their impudence, when one of the\nlittle group upon my doorstep said, “If you please, sir, it’s the baby.”\n Never was there such a change--from the outraged householder to the\nprofessional man. “Pray step in, madam,” said I, in quite my most\ncourtly style; and in they all came--the husband, the brother, the wife\nand the baby. The latter was in the early stage of measles. They were\npoor outcast sort of people, and seemed not to have sixpence among them;\nso my demands for a fee at the end of the consultation ended first in\nmy giving the medicine for nothing, and finally adding fivepence in\ncoppers, which was all the small change I had. A few more such patients\nand I am a broken man.\n\nHowever, the two incidents together had the effect of taking up my\nattention and breaking the blow which I had had in the Cullingworth\nletter. It made me laugh to think that the apparent outsider should\nprove to be a patient, and the apparent patient an outsider. So back\nI went, in a much more judicial frame of mind, to read that precious\ndocument over again, and to make up my mind what it was that I should\ndo.\n\nAnd now I came to my first real insight into the depths which lie in the\ncharacter of Cullingworth. I began by trying to recall how I could\nhave torn up my mother’s letters, for it is not usual for me to destroy\npapers in this manner. I have often been chaffed about the way in which\nI allow them to accumulate until my pockets become unbearable. The more\nI thought about it the more convinced I was that I could not have done\nanything of the sort; so finally I got out the little house jacket which\nI had usually worn at Bradfield, and I examined the sheaves of letters\nwhich it contained. It was there, Bertie! Almost the very first one that\nI opened was the identical one from which Cullingworth was quoting in\nwhich my mother had described him in those rather forcible terms.\n\nWell, this made me sit down and gasp. I am, I think, one of the most\nunsuspicious men upon earth, and through a certain easy-going indolence\nof disposition I never even think of the possibility of those with whom\nI am brought in contact trying to deceive me. It does not occur to me.\nBut let me once get on that line of thought--let me have proof that\nthere is reason for suspicion--and then all faith slips completely away\nfrom me. Now I could see an explanation for much which had puzzled me at\nBradfield. Those sudden fits of ill temper, the occasional ill-concealed\nanimosity of Cullingworth--did they not mark the arrival of each of\nmy mother’s letters? I was convinced that they did. He had read them\nthen--read them from the pockets of the little house coat which I used\nto leave carelessly in the hall when I put on my professional one to go\nout. I could remember, for example, how at the end of his illness his\nmanner had suddenly changed on the very day when that final letter of my\nmother’s had arrived. Yes, it was certain that he had read them from the\nbeginning.\n\nBut a blacker depth of treachery lay beyond. If he had read them, and if\nhe had been insane enough to think that I was acting disloyally towards\nhim, why had he not said so at the time? Why had he contented himself\nwith sidelong scowls and quarrelling over trivialities--breaking, too,\ninto forced smiles when I had asked him point blank what was the matter?\nOne obvious reason was that he could not tell his grievance without\ntelling also how he had acquired his information. But I knew enough of\nCullingworth’s resource to feel that he could easily have got over such\na difficulty as that. In fact, in this last letter he HAD got over it\nby his tale about the grate and the maid. He must have had some stronger\nreason for restraint. As I thought over the course of our relations I\nwas convinced that his scheme was to lure me on by promises until I had\ncommitted myself, and then to abandon me, so that I should myself have\nno resource but to compound with my creditors-to be, in fact, that which\nmy mother had called him.\n\nBut in that case he must have been planning it out almost from the\nbeginning of my stay with him, for my mother’s letters stigmatising his\nconduct had begun very early. For some time he had been uncertain how\nto proceed. Then he had invented the excuse (which seemed to me at the\ntime, if you remember, to be quite inadequate) about the slight weekly\ndecline in the practice in order to get me out of it. His next move\nwas to persuade me to start for myself; and as this would be impossible\nwithout money, he had encouraged me to it by the promise of a small\nweekly loan. I remembered how he had told me not to be afraid about\nordering furniture and other things, because tradesmen gave long credit\nto beginners, and I could always fall back upon him if necessary. He\nknew too from his own experience that the landlord would require at\nleast a year’s tenancy. Then he waited to spring his mine until I had\nwritten to say that I had finally committed myself, on which by return\nof post came his letter breaking the connection. It was so long and so\nelaborate a course of deceit, that I for the first time felt something\nlike fear as I thought of Cullingworth. It was as though in the\nguise and dress of a man I had caught a sudden glimpse of something\nsub-human--of something so outside my own range of thought that I was\npowerless against it.\n\nWell, I wrote him a little note--only a short one, but with, I hope,\na bit of a barb to it. I said that his letter had been a source of\ngratification to me, as it removed the only cause for disagreement\nbetween my mother and myself. She had always thought him a blackguard,\nand I had always defended him; but I was forced now to confess that she\nhad been right from the beginning. I said enough to show him that I\nsaw through his whole plot; and I wound up by assuring him that if he\nthought he had done me any harm he had made a great mistake; for I had\nevery reason to believe that he had unintentionally forced me into the\nvery opening which I had most desired myself.\n\nAfter this bit of bravado I felt better, and I thought over the\nsituation. I was alone in a strange town, without connections, without\nintroductions, with less than a pound in my pocket, and with no\npossibility of freeing myself from my responsibilities. I had no one at\nall to look to for help, for all my recent letters from home had given a\ndreary account of the state of things there. My poor father’s health and\nhis income were dwindling together. On the other hand, I reflected that\nthere were some points in my favour. I was young. I was energetic. I had\nbeen brought up hard, and was quite prepared to rough it. I was well up\nin my work, and believed I could get on with patients. My house was an\nexcellent one for my purpose, and I had already put the essentials of\nfurniture into it. The game was not played out yet. I jumped to my feet\nand clenched my hand, and swore to the chandelier that it never should\nbe played out until I had to beckon for help from the window.\n\nFor the next three days I had not a single ring at the bell of any sort\nwhatever. A man could not be more isolated from his kind. It used to\namuse me to sit upstairs and count how many of the passers-by stopped to\nlook at my plate. Once (on a Sunday morning) there were over a hundred\nin an hour, and often I could see from their glancing over their\nshoulders as they walked on, that they were thinking or talking of the\nnew doctor.\n\nThis used to cheer me up, and make me feel that something was going on.\n\nEvery night between nine and ten I slip out and do my modest shopping,\nhaving already made my MENU for the coming day. I come back usually with\na loaf of bread, a paper of fried fish, or a bundle of saveloys. Then\nwhen I think things are sufficiently quiet, I go out and brush down\nthe front with my broom, leaning it against the wall and looking up\nmeditatively at the stars whenever anyone passes. Then, later still,\nI bring out my polishing paste, my rag, and my chamois leather; and I\nassure you that if practice went by the brilliancy of one’s plate, I\nshould sweep the town.\n\nWho do you think was the first person who broke this spell of\nsilence? The ruffian whom I had fought under the lamp-post. He is a\nscissors-grinder it seems, and rang to know if I had a job for him. I\ncould not help grinning at him when I opened the door and saw who it\nwas. He showed no sign of recognising me, however, which is hardly to be\nwondered at.\n\nThe next comer was a real bona fide patient, albeit a very modest one.\nShe was a little anaemic old maid, a chronic hypochondriac I should\njudge, who had probably worked her way round every doctor in the town,\nand was anxious to sample this novelty. I don’t know whether I gave her\nsatisfaction. She said that she would come again on Wednesday, but her\neyes shifted as she said it. One and sixpence was as much as she could\npay, but it was very welcome. I can live three days on one and sixpence.\n\nI think that I have brought economy down to its finest point. No doubt,\nfor a short spell I could manage to live on a couple of pence a day; but\nwhat I am doing now is not to be a mere spurt, but my regular mode of\nlife for many a month to come. My tea and sugar and milk (Swiss)\ncome collectively to one penny a day. The loaf is at twopence\nthree-farthings, and I consume one a day. My dinner consists in\nrotation of one third of a pound of bacon, cooked over the gas (twopence\nhalfpenny), or two saveloys (twopence), or two pieces of fried\nfish (twopence), or a quarter of an eightpenny tin of Chicago beef\n(twopence). Any one of these, with a due allowance of bread and water,\nmakes a most substantial meal. Butter I have discarded for the present.\nMy actual board therefore comes well under sixpence a day, but I am a\npatron of literature to the extent of a halfpenny a day, which I\nexpend upon an evening paper; for with events hurrying on like this in\nAlexandria, I cannot bear to be without the news. Still I often reproach\nmyself with that halfpenny, for if I went out in the evening and looked\nat the placards I might save it, and yet have a general idea of what is\ngoing on. Of course, a halfpenny a night sounds nothing, but think of a\nshilling a month! Perhaps you picture me as bloodless and pulled down on\nthis diet! I am thin, it is true, but I never felt more fit in my life.\nSo full of energy am I that I start off sometimes at ten at night and\nwalk hard until two or three in the morning. I dare not go out during\nthe day, you see, for fear that I should miss a patient. I have asked my\nmother not to send little Paul down yet until I see my way more clearly.\n\nOld Whitehall came in to see me the other day. The object of his visit\nwas to invite me to dinner, and the object of the dinner to inaugurate\nmy starting in practice. If I were the kind old fellow’s son he could\nnot take a deeper interest in me and my prospects.\n\n“By ----, Dr. Munro, sir,” said he, “I’ve asked every ---- man in\nBirchespool that’s got anything the matter with him. You’ll have the\nlot as patients within a week. There’s Fraser, who’s got a touch of\nMartell’s three star. He’s coming. And there’s Saunders, who talks about\nnothing but his spleen. I’m sick of his ---- spleen! But I asked him.\nAnd there’s Turpey’s wound! This wet weather sets it tingling, and his\nown surgeon can do nothing but dab it with vaseline. He’ll be there. And\nthere’s Carr, who is drinking himself to death. He has not much for the\ndoctors, but what there is you may as well have.”\n\nAll next day he kept popping in to ask me questions about the dinner.\nShould we have clear soup or ox-tail? Didn’t I think that burgundy was\nbetter than port and sherry? The day after was the celebration itself,\nand he was in with a bulletin immediately after breakfast. The cooking\nwas to be done at a neighbouring confectioner’s. The landlady’s son\nwas coming in to wait. I was sorry to see that Whitehall was already\nslurring his words together, and had evidently been priming himself\nheavily. He looked in again in the afternoon to tell me what a good time\nwe should have. So-and-so could talk well, and the other man could sing\na song. He was so far gone by now, that I ventured (in the capacity of\nmedical adviser) to speak to him about it.\n\nIt’s not the liquor, Dr. Munro, sir,” said he earnestly. It’s the ----\nrelaxing air of this town. But I’ll go home and lie I’ll down, and be as\nfresh as paint to welcome my guests.”\n\nBut the excitement of the impending event must have been too much\nfor him. When I arrived at five minutes to seven, Turpey, the wounded\nlieutenant, met me in the hall with a face of ill omen.\n\n“It’s all up with Whitehall,” said he.\n\n\n“What’s the matter?”\n\n“Blind, speechless and paralytic. Come and look.”\n\nThe table in his room was nicely laid for dinner, and several decanters\nwith a large cold tart lay upon the sideboard. On the sofa was stretched\nour unfortunate host, his head back, his forked beard pointing to the\ncornice, and a half finished tumbler of whisky upon the chair beside\nhim. All our shakes and shouts could not break in upon that serene\ndrunkenness.\n\n“What are we to do?” gasped Turpey.\n\n“We must not let him make an exhibition of himself. We had better get\nhim away before any one else arrives.”\n\nSo we bore him off, all in coils and curves like a dead python, and\ndeposited him upon his bed. When we returned three other guests had\narrived.\n\n“You’ll be sorry to hear that Whitehall is not very well,” said Turpey.\n“Dr. Munro thought it would be better that he should not come down.”\n\n“In fact, I have ordered him to bed,” said I.\n\n“Then I move that Mr. Turpey be called upon to act as host,” said one of\nthe new comers; and so it was at once agreed.\n\nPresently the other men arrived; but there was no sign of the dinner. We\nwaited for a quarter of an hour, but nothing appeared. The landlady was\nsummoned, but could give no information.\n\n“Captain Whitehall ordered it from a confectioner’s, sir,” said she, in\nreply to the lieutenant’s cross-examination. “He did not tell me which\nconfectioner’s. It might have been any one of four or five. He only said\nthat it would all come right, and that I should bake an apple tart.”\n\nAnother quarter of an hour passed, and we were all ravenous. It was\nevident that Whitehall had made some mistake. We began to roll our eyes\ntowards the apple pie, as the boat’s crew does towards the boy in the\nstories of shipwreck. A large hairy man, with an anchor tattooed upon\nhis hand, rose and set the pie in front of Turpey.\n\n“What d’you say, gentlemen,--shall I serve it out?”\n\nWe all drew up at the table with a decision which made words\nsuperfluous. In five minutes the pie dish was as clean as when the cook\nfirst saw it. And our ill-luck vanished with the pie. A minute later the\nlandlady’s son entered with the soup; and cod’s head, roast beef,\ngame and ice pudding followed in due succession. It all came from some\nmisunderstanding about time. But we did them justice, in spite of the\ncurious hors d’oeuvre with which we had started; and a pleasanter dinner\nor a more enjoyable evening I have seldom had.\n\n“Sorry I was so bowled over, Dr. Munro, sir,” said Whitehall next\nmorning. “I need hilly country and a bracing air, not a ---- croquet\nlawn like this. Well, I’m ---- glad to hear that you gentlemen enjoyed\nyourselves, and I hope you found everything to your satisfaction.”\n\nI assured him that we did; but I had not the heart to tell him about the\napple pie.\n\nI tell you these trivial matters, my dear Bertie, just to show you that\nI am not down on my luck, and that my life is not pitched in the minor\nkey altogether, in spite of my queer situation. But, to turn to graver\nthings: I was right glad to get your letter, and to read all your\ndenunciations about dogmatic science. Don’t imagine that my withers are\nwrung by what you say, for I agree with almost every word of it.\n\nThe man who claims that we can know nothing is, to my mind, as\nunreasonable as he who insists that everything has been divinely\nrevealed to us. I know nothing more unbearable than the complacent type\nof scientist who knows very exactly all that he does know, but has not\nimagination enough to understand what a speck his little accumulation of\ndoubtful erudition is when compared with the immensity of our ignorance.\nHe is the person who thinks that the universe can be explained by laws,\nas if a law did not require construction as well as a world! The motion\nof the engine can be explained by the laws of physics, but that has not\nmade the foregoing presence of an engineer less obvious. In this world,\nhowever, part of the beautiful poise of things depends upon the fact\nthat whenever you have an exaggerated fanatic of any sort, his exact\nopposite at once springs up to neutralise him. You have a Mameluke: up\njumps a Crusader. You have a Fenian: up jumps an Orangeman. Every force\nhas its recoil. And so these more hide-bound scientists must be set\nagainst those gentlemen who still believe that the world was created in\nthe year 4004 B. C.\n\nAfter all, true science must be synonymous with religion, since science\nis the acquirement of fact; and facts are all that we have from which to\ndeduce what we are and why we are here. But surely the more we pry into\nthe methods by which results are brougt{sic} about, the more stupendous\nand wonderful becomes the great unseen power which lies behind, the\npower which drifts the solar system in safety through space, and\nyet adjusts the length of the insects proboscis to the depth of the\nhoney-bearing flower. What is that central intelligence? You may fit\nup your dogmatic scientist with a 300-diameter microscope, and with a\ntelescope with a six-foot speculum, but neither near nor far can he get\na trace of that great driving power.\n\nWhat should we say of a man who has a great and beautiful picture\nsubmitted to him, and who, having satisfied himself that the account\ngiven of the painting of the picture is incorrect, at once concludes\nthat no one ever painted it, or at least asserts that he has no possible\nmeans of knowing whether an artist has produced it or not? That is, as\nit seems to me, a fair statement of the position of some of the more\nextreme agnostics. “Is not the mere existence of the picture in itself\na proof that a skilful artist has been busied upon it? one might ask.”\n “Why, no,” says the objector. “It is possible that the picture produced\nitself by the aid of certain rules. Besides, when the picture was first\nsubmitted to me I was assured that it had all been produced within a\nweek, but by examining it I am able to say with certainty that it has\ntaken a considerable time to put together. I am therefore of opinion\nthat it is questionable whether any one ever painted it at all.”\n\nLeaving this exaggerated scientific caution on the one side, and faith\non the other, as being equally indefensible, there remains the clear\nline of reasoning that a universe implies the existence of a universe\nmaker, and that we may deduce from it some of His attributes, His power,\nHis wisdom, His forethought for small wants, His providing of luxuries\nfor His creatures. On the other hand, do not let us be disingenuous\nenough to shirk the mystery which lies in pain, in cruelty, in all which\nseems to be a slur upon His work. The best that we can say for them is\nto hope that they are not as bad as they seem, and possibly lead to some\nhigher end. The voices of the ill-used child and of the tortured animal\nare the hardest of all for the philosopher to answer.\n\nGood-bye, old chap! It is quite delightful to think that on one point at\nleast we are in agreement.\n\n\n\n\nXIV. OAKLEY VILLAS, BIRCHESPOOL, 15th January, 1883.\n\n\nYou write reproachfully, my dear Bertie, and you say that absence must\nhave weakened our close friendship, since I have not sent you a line\nduring this long seven months. The real truth of the matter is that\nI had not the heart to write to you until I could tell you something\ncheery; and something cheery has been terribly long in coming. At\npresent I can only claim that the cloud has perhaps thinned a little at\nthe edges.\n\nYou see by the address of this letter that I still hold my ground, but\nbetween ourselves it has been a terrible fight, and there have been\ntimes when that last plank of which old Whitehall wrote seemed to be\nslipping out of my clutch. I have ebbed and flowed, sometimes with a\nlittle money, sometimes without. At my best I was living hard, at my\nworst I was very close upon starvation. I have lived for a whole day\nupon the crust of a loaf, when I had ten pounds in silver in the drawer\nof my table. But those ten pounds had been most painfully scraped\ntogether for my quarter’s rent, and I would have tried twenty-four hours\nwith a tight leather belt before I would have broken in upon it. For two\ndays I could not raise a stamp to send a letter. I have smiled when I\nhave read in my evening paper of the privations of our fellows in Egypt.\nTheir broken victuals would have been a banquet to me. However, what\nodds how you take your carbon and nitrogen and oxygen, as long as you DO\nget it? The garrison of Oakley Villa has passed the worst, and there is\nno talk of surrender.\n\nIt was not that I have had no patients. They have come in as well as\ncould be expected. Some, like the little old maid, who was the first,\nnever returned. I fancy that a doctor who opened his own door forfeited\ntheir confidence. Others have become warm partisans. But they have\nnearly all been very poor people; and when you consider how many one and\nsixpences are necessary in order to make up the fifteen pounds which\nI must find every quarter for rent, taxes, gas and water, you will\nunderstand that even with some success, I have still found it a hard\nmatter to keep anything in the portmanteau which serves me as larder.\nHowever, my boy, two quarters are paid up, and I enter upon a third one\nwith my courage unabated. I have lost about a stone, but not my heart.\n\nI have rather a vague recollection of when it was exactly that my last\nwas written. I fancy that it must have been a fortnight after my start,\nimmediately after my breach with Cullingworth. It’s rather hard to know\nwhere to begin when one has so many events to narrate, disconnected from\neach other, and trivial in themselves, yet which have each loomed large\nas I came upon them, though they look small enough now that they are so\nfar astern. As I have mentioned Cullingworth, I may as well say first\nthe little that is to be said about him. I answered his letter in the\nway which I have, I think, already described. I hardly expected to hear\nfrom him again; but my note had evidently stung him, and I had a\nbrusque message in which he said that if I wished him to believe in my\n“bona-fides” (whatever he may have meant by that), I would return the\nmoney which I had had during the time that I was with him at Bradfield.\nTo this I replied that the sum was about twelve pounds; that I still\nretained the message in which he had guaranteed me three hundred pounds\nif I came to Bradfield, that the balance in my favour was two hundred\nand eighty-eight pounds; and that unless I had a cheque by return, I\nshould put the matter into the hands of my solicitor. This put a final\nend to our correspondence.\n\nThere was one other incident, however. One day after I had been in\npractice about two months, I observed a bearded commonplace-looking\nperson lounging about on the other side of the road. In the afternoon he\nwas again visible from my consulting-room window. When I saw him there\nonce more next morning, my suspicions were aroused, and they became\ncertainties when, a day or so afterwards, I came out of a patient’s\nhouse in a poor street, and saw the same fellow looking into a\ngreengrocer’s shop upon the other side. I walked to the end of the\nstreet, waited round the corner, and met him as he came hurrying after.\n\n“You can go back to Dr. Cullingworth, and tell him that I have as much\nto do as I care for,” said I. “If you spy upon me after this it will be\nat your own risk.”\n\nHe shuffled and coloured, but I walked on and saw him no more. There was\nno one on earth who could have had a motive for wanting to know exactly\nwhat I was doing except Cullingworth; and the man’s silence was\nenough in itself to prove that I was right. I have heard nothing of\nCullingworth since.\n\nI had a letter from my uncle in the Artillery, Sir Alexander Munro,\nshortly after my start, telling me that he had heard of my proceedings\nfrom my mother, and that he hoped to learn of my success. He is, as I\nthink you know, an ardent Wesleyan, like all my father’s people, and he\ntold me that the chief Wesleyan minister in the town was an old friend\nof his own, that he had learned from him that there was no Wesleyan\ndoctor, and that, being of a Wesleyan stock myself, if I would present\nthe enclosed letter of introduction to the minister, I should certainly\nfind it very much to my advantage. I thought it over, Bertie, and\nit seemed to me that it would be playing it rather low down to use a\nreligious organisation to my own advantage, when I condemned them in the\nabstract. It was a sore temptation, but I destroyed the letter.\n\nI had one or two pieces of luck in the way of accidental cases. One\n(which was of immense importance to me) was that of a grocer named\nHaywood, who fell down in a fit outside the floor of his shop. I was\npassing on my way to see a poor labourer with typhoid. You may believe\nthat I saw my chance, bustled in, treated the man, conciliated the wife,\ntickled the child, and gained over the whole household. He had these\nattacks periodically, and made an arrangement with me by which I was to\ndeal with him, and we were to balance bills against each other. It was\na ghoulish compact, by which a fit to him meant butter and bacon to\nme, while a spell of health for Haywood sent me back to dry bread and\nsaveloys. However, it enabled me to put by for the rent many a shilling\nwhich must otherwise have gone in food. At last, however, the poor\nfellow died, and there was our final settlement.\n\nTwo small accidents occurred near my door (it was a busy crossing),\nand though I got little enough from either of them, I ran down to the\nnewspaper office on each occasion, and had the gratification of\nseeing in the evening edition that “the driver, though much shaken,\nis pronounced by Dr. Stark Munro, of Oakley Villa, to have suffered no\nserious injury.” As Cullingworth used to say, it is hard enough for the\nyoung doctor to push his name into any publicity, and he must take what\nlittle chances he has. Perhaps the fathers of the profession would shake\ntheir heads over such a proceeding in a little provincial journal; but\nI was never able to see that any of them were very averse from seeing\ntheir own names appended to the bulletin of some sick statesman in The\nTimes.\n\nAnd then there came another and a more serious accident. This would be\nabout two months after the beginning, though already I find it hard to\nput things in their due order. A lawyer in the town named Dickson was\nriding past my windows when the horse reared up and fell upon him. I was\neating saveloys in the back room at the time, but I heard the noise and\nrushed to the door in time to meet the crowd who were carrying him in.\nThey flooded into my house, thronged my hall, dirtied my consulting\nroom, and even pushed their way into my back room, which they found\nelegantly furnished with a portmanteau, a lump of bread, and a cold\nsausage.\n\nHowever, I had no thought for any one but my patient, who was groaning\nmost dreadfully. I saw that his ribs were right, tested his joints,\nran my hand down his limbs, and concluded that there was no break or\ndislocation. He had strained himself in such a way, however, that it\nwas very painful to him to sit or to walk. I sent for an open carriage,\ntherefore, and conveyed him to his home, I sitting with my most\nprofessional air, and he standing straight up between my hands. The\ncarriage went at a walk, and the crowd trailed behind, with all the folk\nlooking out of the windows, so that a more glorious advertisement could\nnot be conceived. It looked like the advance guard of a circus. Once at\nhis house, however, professional etiquette demanded that I should hand\nthe case over to the family attendant, which I did with as good a grace\nas possible--not without some lingering hope that the old established\npractitioner might say, “You have taken such very good care of my\npatient, Dr. Munro, that I should not dream of removing him from your\nhands.” On the contrary, he snatched it away from me with avidity, and I\nretired with some credit, an excellent advertisement, and a guinea.\n\nThese are one or two of the points of interest which show above the dead\nmonotony of my life--small enough, as you see, but even a sandhill looms\nlarge in Holland. In the main, it is a dreary sordid record of shillings\ngained and shillings spent--of scraping for this and scraping for that,\nwith ever some fresh slip of blue paper fluttering down upon me, left\nso jauntily by the tax-collector, and meaning such a dead-weight pull to\nme. The irony of my paying a poor-rate used to amuse me. I should have\nbeen collecting it. Thrice at a crisis I pawned my watch, and thrice I\nrallied and rescued it. But how am I to interest you in the details of\nsuch a career? Now, if a fair countess had been so good as to slip on\na piece of orange peel before my door, or if the chief merchant in the\ntown had been saved by some tour-de-force upon my part, or if I had\nbeen summoned out at midnight to attend some nameless person in a lonely\nhouse with a princely fee for silence--then I should have something\nworthy of your attention. But the long months and months during which\nI listened to the throb of the charwoman’s heart and the rustle of the\ngreengrocer’s lungs, present little which is not dull and dreary. No\ngood angels came my way.\n\nWait a bit, though! One did. I was awakened at six in the morning one\nday by a ringing at my bell, and creeping to the angle of the stair\nI saw through the glass a stout gentleman in a top-hat outside. Much\nexcited, with a thousand guesses capping one another in my head, I ran\nback, pulled on some clothes, rushed down, opened the door, and found\nmyself in the grey morning light face to face with Horton. The good\nfellow had come down from Merton in an excursion train, and had been\ntravelling all night. He had an umbrella under his arm, and two great\nstraw baskets in each hand, which contained, when unpacked, a cold leg\nof mutton, half-a-dozen of beer, a bottle of port, and all sorts of\npasties and luxuries. We had a great day together, and when he rejoined\nhis excursion in the evening he left a very much cheerier man than he\nhad found.\n\nTalking of cheeriness, you misunderstand me, Bertie, if you think (as\nyou seem to imply) that I take a dark view of things. It is true that I\ndiscard some consolations which you possess, because I cannot convince\nmyself that they are genuine; but in this world, at least, I see immense\nreason for hope, and as to the next I am confident that all will be for\nthe best. From annihilation to beatification I am ready to adapt myself\nto whatever the great Designer’s secret plan my be.\n\nBut there is much in the prospects of this world to set a man’s heart\nsinging. Good is rising and evil sinking like oil and water in a bottle.\nThe race is improving. There are far fewer criminal convictions. There\nis far more education. People sin less and think more. When I meet a\nbrutal looking fellow I often think that he and his type may soon be\nas extinct as the great auk. I am not sure that in the interest of the\n‘ologies we ought not to pickle a few specimens of Bill Sykes, to show\nour children’s children what sort of a person he was.\n\nAnd then the more we progress the more we tend to progress. We advance\nnot in arithmetical but in geometrical progression. We draw compound\ninterest on the whole capital of knowledge and virtue which has been\naccumulated since the dawning of time. Some eighty thousand years are\nsupposed to have existed between paleolithic and neolithic man. Yet\nin all that time he only learned to grind his flint stones instead of\nchipping them. But within our father’s lives what changes have there not\nbeen? The railway and the telegraph, chloroform and applied electricity.\nTen years now go further than a thousand then, not so much on account\nof our finer intellects as because the light we have shows us the way to\nmore. Primeval man stumbled along with peering eyes, and slow, uncertain\nfootsteps. Now we walk briskly towards our unknown goal.\n\nAnd I wonder what that goal is to be! I mean, of course, as far as this\nworld is concerned. Ever since man first scratched hieroglyphics upon an\nostracon, or scribbled with sepia upon papyrus, he must have wondered,\nas we wonder to-day. I suppose that we DO know a little more than they.\nWe have an arc of about three thousand years given us, from which to\ncalculate out the course to be described by our descendants; but that\narc is so tiny when compared to the vast ages which Providence uses in\nworking out its designs that our deductions from it must, I think, be\nuncertain. Will civilisation be swamped by barbarism? It happened once\nbefore, because the civilised were tiny specks of light in the midst of\ndarkness. But what, for example, could break down the great country in\nwhich you dwell? No, our civilisation will endure and grow more complex.\nMan will live in the air and below the water. Preventive medicine will\ndevelop until old age shall become the sole cause of death. Education\nand a more socialistic scheme of society will do away with crime. The\nEnglish-speaking races will unite, with their centre in the United\nStates. Gradually the European States will follow their example. War\nwill become rare, but more terrible. The forms of religion will be\nabandoned, but the essence will be maintained; so that one universal\ncreed will embrace the whole civilised earth, which will preach trust\nin that central power, which will be as unknown then as now. That’s my\nhoroscope, and after that the solar system may be ripe for picking. But\nBertie Swanborough and Stark Munro will be blowing about on the west\nwind, and dirtying the panes of careful housewives long before the half\nof it has come to pass.\n\n\nAnd then man himself will change, of course. The teeth are going\nrapidly. You’ve only to count the dentists’ brass plates in Birchespool\nto be sure of that. And the hair also. And the sight. Instinctively,\nwhen we think of the more advanced type of young man, we picture him as\nbald, and with double eye-glasses. I am an absolute animal myself, and\nmy only sign of advance is that two of my back teeth are going. On the\nother hand, there is some evidence in favour of the development of a\nsixth sense-that of perception. If I had it now I should know that you\nare heartily weary of all my generalisations and dogmatism.\n\nAnd certainly there must be a spice of dogmatism in it when we begin\nlaying down laws about the future; for how do we know that there are not\nphases of nature coming upon us of which we have formed no conception?\nAfter all, a few seconds are a longer fraction of a day than an average\nlife is of the period during which we know that the world has been in\nexistence. But if a man lived only for a few seconds of daylight, his\nson the same, and his son the same, what would their united experiences\nafter a hundred generations tell them of the phenomenon which we call\nnight? So all our history and knowledge is no guarantee that our earth\nis not destined for experiences of which we can form no conception.\n\nBut to drop down from the universe to my own gnat’s buzz of an\nexistence, I think I have told you everything that might interest you\nof the first six months of my venture. Towards the end of that time\nmy little brother Paul came down--and the best of companions he is!\nHe shares the discomforts of my little menage in the cheeriest spirit,\ntakes me out of my blacker humours, goes long walks with me, is\ninterested in all that interests me (I always talk to him exactly as if\nhe were of my own age), and is quite ready to turn his hand to anything,\nfrom boot-blacking to medicine-carrying. His one dissipation is cutting\nout of paper, or buying in lead (on the rare occasion when we find a\nsurplus), an army of little soldiers. I have brought a patient into the\nconsulting room, and found a torrent of cavalry, infantry, and artillery\npouring across the table. I have been myself attacked as I sat silently\nwriting, and have looked up to find fringes of sharp-shooters pushing\nup towards me, columns of infantry in reserve, a troop of cavalry on my\nflank, while a battery of pea muzzle-loaders on the ridge of my medical\ndictionary has raked my whole position--with the round, smiling face of\nthe general behind it all. I don’t know how many regiments he has on a\npeace footing; but if serious trouble were to break out, I am convinced\nthat every sheet of paper in the house would spring to arms.\n\nOne morning I had a great idea which has had the effect of\nrevolutionising our domestic economy. It was at the time when the worst\npinch was over, and when we had got back as far as butter and occasional\ntobacco, with a milkman calling daily; which gives you a great sense of\nswagger when you have not been used to it.\n\n“Paul, my boy,” said I, “I see my way to fitting up this house with a\nwhole staff of servants for nothing.”\n\nHe looked pleased, but not surprised. He had a wholly unwarranted\nconfidence in my powers; so that if I had suddenly declared that I saw\nmy way to tilting Queen Victoria from her throne and seating myself upon\nit, he would have come without a question to aid and abet.\n\nI took a piece of paper and wrote, “To Let. A basement floor, in\nexchange for services. Apply 1 Oakley Villas.”\n\n“There, Paul,” said I, “run down to the Evening News office, and pay a\nshilling for three insertions.”\n\nThere was no need of three insertions. One would have been ample. Within\nhalf an hour of the appearance of the first edition, I had an applicant\nat the end of my bell-wire, and for the remainder of the evening Paul\nwas ushering them in and I interviewing them with hardly a break. I\nshould have been prepared at the outset to take anything in a petticoat;\nbut as we saw the demand increase, our conditions went up and up;\nwhite aprons, proper dress for answering door, doing beds and boots,\ncooking,--we became more and more exacting. So at last we made our\nselection; a Miss Wotton, who asked leave to bring her sister with her.\nShe was a hard-faced brusque-mannered person, whose appearance in a\nbachelor’s household was not likely to cause a scandal. Her nose was in\nitself a certificate of virtue. She was to bring her furniture into\nthe basement, and I was to give her and her sister one of the two upper\nrooms for a bedroom.\n\nThey moved in a few days later. I was out at the time, and the first\nintimation I had was finding three little dogs in my hall when I\nreturned. I had her up, and explained that this was a breach of\ncontract, and that I had no thoughts of running a menagerie. She pleaded\nvery hard for her little dogs, which it seems are a mother and two\ndaughters of some rare breed; so I at last gave in on the point.\nThe other sister appeared to lead a subterranean troglodytic sort of\nexistence; for, though I caught a glimpse of her whisking round the\ncorner at times, it was a good month before I could have sworn to her in\na police court.\n\nFor a time the arrangement worked well, and then there came\ncomplications. One morning, coming down earlier than usual, I saw a\nsmall bearded man undoing the inside chain of my door. I captured him\nbefore he could get it open. “Well,” said I, “what’s this?”\n\n“If you please, sir,” said he, “I’m Miss Wotton’s husband.”\n\nDreadful doubts of my housekeeper flashed across my mind, but I thought\nof her nose and was reassured. An examination revealed everything. She\nwas a married woman. The lines were solemnly produced. Her husband was a\nseaman. She had passed as a miss, because she thought I was more likely\nto take a housekeeper without encumbrances. Her husband had come home\nunexpectedly from a long voyage, and had returned last night. And\nthen--plot within plot--the other woman was not her sister, but a\nfriend, whose name was Miss Williams. She thought I was more likely to\ntake two sisters than two friends. So we all came to know who the other\nwas; and I, having given Jack permission to remain, assigned the other\ntop room to Miss Williams. From absolute solitude I seemed to be rapidly\ndeveloping into the keeper of a casual ward.\n\nIt was a never-failing source of joy to us to see the procession pass on\nthe way to their rooms at night. First came a dog; then Miss Williams,\nwith a candle; then Jack; then another dog; and finally, Mrs. Wotton,\nwith her candle in one hand and another dog under her arm. Jack was with\nus for three weeks; and as I made him holystone the whole place down\ntwice a week until the boards were like a quarter deck, we got something\nout of him in return for his lodging.\n\nAbout this time, finding a few shillings over and no expense imminent,\nI laid down a cellar, in the shape of a four and a half gallon cask of\nbeer, with a firm resolution that it should never be touched save on\nhigh days and holidays, or when guests had to be entertained.\n\nShortly afterwards Jack went away to sea again; and after his departure\nthere were several furious quarrels between the women down below, which\nfilled the whole house with treble reproaches and repartees. At last one\nevening Miss Williams--the quiet one--came to me and announced with sobs\nthat she must go. Mrs. Wotton made her life unbearable, she said. She\nwas determined to be independent, and had fitted up a small shop in a\npoor quarter of the town. She was going now, at once, to take possession\nof it.\n\nI was sorry, because I liked Miss Williams, and I said a few words to\nthat effect. She got as far as the hall door, and then came rustling\nback again into the consulting room. “Take a drink of your own beer!”\n she cried, and vanished.\n\nIt sounded like some sort of slang imprecation. If she had said “Oh,\npull up your socks!” I should have been less surprised. And then\nsuddenly the words took a dreadful meaning in my mind, and I rushed to\nthe cellar. The cask was tilted forward on the trestles. I struck it and\nit boomed like a drum. I turned the tap, and not one drop appeared. Let\nus draw a veil over the painful scene. Suffice it that Mrs. Wotton got\nher marching orders then and there--and that next day Paul and I found\nourselves alone in the empty house once more.\n\nBut we were demoralised by luxury. We could no longer manage without a\nhelper--especially now in the winter time, when fires had to be lit--the\nmost heart-breaking task that a man can undertake. I bethought me of\nthe quiet Miss Williams, and hunted her up in her shop. She was quite\nwilling to come, and saw how she could get out of the rent; but the\ndifficulty lay with her stock. This sounded formidable at first, but\nwhen I came to learn that the whole thing had cost eleven shillings, it\ndid not appear insurmountable. In half an hour my watch was pawned, and\nthe affair concluded. I returned with an excellent housekeeper, and\nwith a larger basketful of inferior Swedish matches, bootlaces, cakes of\nblack lead, and little figures made of sugar than I should have thought\nit possible to get for the money. So now we have settled down, and I\nhope that a period of comparative peace lies before us.\n\nGood-bye, old chap, and never think that I forget you. Your letters are\nread and re-read with avidity. I think I have every line you ever wrote\nme. You simply knock Paley out every time. I am so glad that you got out\nof that brewery business all right. For a time I was really afraid that\nyou must either lose your money or else risk more upon the shares. I can\nonly thank you for your kind offer of blank cheques.\n\nIt is wonderful that you should have slipped back into your American\nlife so easily after your English hiatus. As you say, however, it is\nnot a change but only a modification, since the root idea is the same\nin each. Is it not strange how the two great brothers are led to\nmisunderstand each other? A man is punished for private libel (over here\nat any rate), although the consequences can only be slight. But a\nman may perpetrate international libel, which is a very heinous and\nfar-reaching offence, and there is no law in the world which can punish\nhim. Think of the contemptible crew of journalists and satirists who for\never picture the Englishman as haughty and h-dropping, or the American\nas vulgar and expectorating. If some millionaire would give them all a\ntrip round the world we should have some rest--and if the plug came out\nof the boat midway it would be more restful still. And your vote-hunting\npoliticians with their tail-twisting campaigns, and our editors of the\nsupercilious weeklies with their inane tone of superiority, if they\nwere all aboard how much clearer we should be! Once more adieu, and good\nluck!\n\n\n\n\nXV. OAKLEY VILLAS, BIRCHESPOOL, 3rd August, 1883.\n\n\nDo you think that such a thing as chance exists? Rather an explosive\nsentence to start a letter with; but pray cast your mind back over your\nown life, and tell me if you think that we really are the sports of\nchance. You know how often the turning down this street or that, the\naccepting or rejecting of an invitation, may deflect the whole current\nof our lives into some other channel. Are we mere leaves, fluttered\nhither and thither by the wind, or are we rather, with every conviction\nthat we are free agents, carried steadily along to a definite and\npre-determined end? I confess that as I advance through life, I become\nmore and more confirmed in that fatalism to which I have always had an\ninclination.\n\nLook at it in this way. We know that many of the permanent facts of the\nuniverse are NOT chance. It is not chance that the heavenly bodies swing\nclear of each other, that the seed is furnished with the apparatus which\nwill drift it to a congenial soil, that the creature is adapted to its\nenvironment. Show me a whale with its great-coat of fat, and I want no\nfurther proof of design. But logically, as it seems to me, ALL must be\ndesign, or all must be chance. I do not see how one can slash a line\nright across the universe, and say that all to the right of that is\nchance, and all to the left is pre-ordained. You would then have to\ncontend that things which on the face of them are of the same class, are\nreally divided by an impassable gulf, and that the lower are regulated,\nwhile the higher are not. You would, for example, be forced to contend\nthat the number of articulations in a flea’s hind leg has engaged the\ndirect superintendence of the Creator, while the mischance which killed\na thousand people in a theatre depended upon the dropping of a wax vesta\nupon the floor, and was an unforeseen flaw in the chain of life. This\nseems to me to be unthinkable.\n\nIt is a very superficial argument to say that if a man holds the\nviews of a fatalist he will therefore cease to strive, and will wait\nresignedly for what fate may send him. The objector forgets that among\nthe other things fated is that we of northern blood SHOULD strive and\nshould NOT sit down with folded hands. But when a man has striven, when\nhe has done all he knows, and when, in spite of it, a thing comes to\npass, let him wait ten years before he says that it is a misfortune. It\nis part of the main line of his destiny then, and is working to an end.\nA man loses his fortune; he gains earnestness. His eyesight goes; it\nleads him to a spirituality. The girl loses her beauty; she becomes more\nsympathetic. We think we are pushing our own way bravely, but there is a\ngreat Hand in ours all the time.\n\nYou’ll wonder what has taken me off on this line. Only that I seem\nto see it all in action in my own life. But, as usual, I have started\nmerrily off with an appendix, so I shall go back and begin my report\nas nearly as possible where I ended the last. First of all, I may\nsay generally that the clouds were thinning then, and that they broke\nshortly afterwards. During the last few months we have never once quite\nlost sight of the sun.\n\nYou remember that we (Paul and I) had just engaged a certain\nMiss Williams to come and keep house for us. I felt that on the\nbasement-lodger principle I had not control enough; so we now entered\nupon a more business-like arrangement, by which a sum (though, alas! an\nabsurdly small one) was to be paid her for her services. I would it had\nbeen ten times as much, for a better and a more loyal servant man never\nhad. Our fortunes seemed to turn from the hour that she re-entered the\nhouse.\n\nSlowly, week by week, and month by month, the practice began to spread\nand to strengthen. There were spells when never a ring came to the bell,\nand it seemed as though all our labour had gone for nothing--but then\nwould come other days when eight and ten names would appear in my\nledger. Where did it come from you will ask. Some from old Whitehall and\nhis circle of Bohemians. Some from accident cases. Some from new comers\nto the town who drifted to me. Some from people whom I met first in\nother capacities. An insurance superintendent gave me a few cases to\nexamine, and that was a very great help. Above all, I learned a fact\nwhich I would whisper in the ear of every other man who starts, as I\nhave done, a stranger among strangers. Do not think that practice will\ncome to you. You must go to it. You may sit upon your consulting room\nchair until it breaks under you, but without purchase or partnership you\nwill make little or no progress. The way to do it is to go out, to mix\neverywhere with men, to let them know you. You will come back many a\ntime and be told by a reproachful housekeeper that some one has been for\nyou in your absence. Never mind! Go out again. A noisy smoking concert\nwhere you will meet eighty men is better for you than the patient or two\nwhom you might have seen at home. It took me some time to realise, but I\nspeak now as one who knows.\n\nBut--there is a great big “but” in the case. You must ride yourself on\nthe curb the whole time. Unless you are sure--absolutely sure--that you\ncan do this, you are far best at home. You must never for one instant\nforget yourself. You must remember what your object is in being there.\nYou must inspire respect. Be friendly, genial, convivial--what you\nwill--but preserve the tone and bearing of a gentleman. If you can make\nyourself respected and liked you will find every club and society that\nyou join a fresh introduction to practice. But beware of drink! Above\neverything, beware of drink! The company that you are in may condone\nit in each other, but never in the man who wishes them to commit their\nlives to his safe keeping. A slip is fatal--a half slip perilous. Make\nyour rule of life and go by it, in spite of challenge or coaxers. It\nwill be remembered in your favour next morning.\n\nAnd of course I do not mean merely festive societies. Literary,\ndebating, political, social, athletic, every one of them is a tool to\nyour hands. But you must show them what a good man you are. You must\nthrow yourself into each with energy and conviction. You will soon\nfind yourself on the committee--possibly the secretary, or even in the\npresidential chair. Do not grudge labour where the return may be remote\nand indirect. Those are the rungs up which one climbs.\n\nThat was how, when I had gained some sort of opening, I set to work to\nenlarge it. I joined this. I joined that. I pushed in every direction.\nI took up athletics again much to the advantage of my health, and found\nthat the practice benefited as well as I. My cricket form for the season\nhas been fair, with an average of about 20 with the bat and 9 with the\nball.\n\nIt must be allowed, however, that this system of sallying out for my\npatients and leaving my consulting room empty might be less successful\nif it were not for my treasure of a housekeeper. She is a marvel of\ndiscretion, and the way in which she perjures her soul for the sake of\nthe practice is a constant weight upon my conscience. She is a tall,\nthin woman, with a grave face and an impressive manner. Her standard\nfiction, implied rather than said (with an air as if it were so\nuniversally known that it would be absurd to put it into words) is,\nthat I am so pressed by the needs of my enormous practice, that any one\nwishing to consult me must make their appointment very exactly and a\nlong time in advance.\n\n“Dear me, now!” she says to some applicant. “He’s been hurried off again.\nIf you’d been here half-an-hour ago he might have given you a minute.\nI never saw such a thing” (confidentially). “Between you and me I don’t\nthink he can last at it long. He’s bound to break down. But come in, and\nI’ll do all I can for you.”\n\nThen, having carefully fastened the patient up in the consulting room,\nshe goes to little Paul.\n\n“Run round to the bowling green, Master Paul,” says she. “You’ll find\nthe doctor there, I think. Just tell him that a patient is waiting for\nhim.”\n\nShe seems in these interviews to inspire them with a kind of hushed\nfeeling of awe, as if they had found their way into some holy of holies.\nMy own actual appearance is quite an anti-climax after the introduction\nby Miss Williams.\n\nAnother of her devices is to make appointments with an extreme precision\nas to time, I being at the moment worked to death (at a cricket match).\n\n“Let us see!” says she, looking at the slate. “He will be clear at seven\nminutes past eight this evening. Yes, he could just manage it then. He\nhas no one at all from seven past to the quarter past”--and so at the\nappointed hour I have my patient precipitating himself into my room with\nthe demeanour of the man who charges in for his bowl of hot soup at a\nrailway station. If he knew that he is probably the only patient who has\nopened my door that evening he would not be in such a hurry--or think so\nmuch of my advice.\n\nOne curious patient has come my way who has been of great service to me.\nShe is a stately looking widow, Turner by name, the most depressingly\nrespectable figure, as of Mrs. Grundy’s older and less frivolous sister.\nShe lives in a tiny house, with one small servant to scale. Well, every\ntwo months or so she quite suddenly goes on a mad drink, which lasts for\nabout a week. It ends as abruptly as it begins, but while it is on the\nneighbours know it. She shrieks, yells, sings, chivies the servant,\nand skims plates out of the window at the passers-by. Of course, it is\nreally not funny, but pathetic and deplorable--all the same, it is hard\nto keep from laughing at the absurd contrast between her actions and\nher appearance. I was called in by accident in the first instance; but I\nspeedily acquired some control over her, so that now the neighbours send\nfor me the moment the crockery begins to come through the window. She\nhas a fair competence, so that her little vagaries are a help to me with\nmy rent. She has, too, a number of curious jugs, statues, and pictures,\na selection of which she presents to me in the course of each of her\nattacks, insisting upon my carrying them away then and there; so that I\nstagger out of the house like one of Napoleon’s generals coming out of\nItaly. There is a good deal of method in the old lady, however, and on\nher recovery she invariably sends round a porter, with a polite note to\nsay that she would be very glad to have her pictures back again.\n\nAnd now I have worked my way to the point where I can show you what I\nmean when I talk about fate. The medical practitioner who lives next\nme--Porter is his name--is a kindly sort of man, and knowing that I have\nhad a long uphill fight, he has several times put things in my way.\nOne day about three weeks ago he came into my consulting room after\nbreakfast.\n\n“Could you come with me to a consultation?” he asked.\n\n“With pleasure.”\n\n“I have my carriage outside.”\n\nHe told me something of the case as we went. It was a young fellow, an\nonly son, who had been suffering from nervous symptoms for some time,\nand lately from considerable pain in his head. “His people are living\nwith a patient of mine, General Wainwright,” said Porter. “He didn’t\nlike the symptoms, and thought he would have a second opinion.”\n\nWe came to the house, a great big one, in its own grounds, and had a\npreliminary talk with the dark-faced, white-haired Indian soldier who\nowns it. He was explaining the responsibility that he felt, the patient\nbeing his nephew, when a lady entered the room. “This is my sister, Mrs.\nLa Force,” said he, “the mother of the gentleman whom you are going to\nsee.”\n\nI recognised her instantly. I had met her before and under curious\ncircumstances. (Dr. Stark Munro here proceeds to narrate again how he\nhad met the La Forces, having evidently forgotten that he had already\ndone so in Letter VI.) When she was introduced I could see that she had\nnot associated me with the young doctor in the train. I don’t wonder,\nfor I have started a beard, in the hope of making myself look a little\nolder. She was naturally all anxiety about her son, and we went up with\nher (Porter and I) to have a look at him. Poor fellow! he seemed peakier\nand more sallow than when I had seen him last. We held our consultation,\ncame to an agreement about the chronic nature of his complaint, and\nfinally departed without my reminding Mrs. La Force of our previous\nmeeting.\n\nWell, there the matter might have ended; but about three days afterwards\nwho should be shown into my consulting room but Mrs. La Force and her\ndaughter. I thought the latter looked twice at me, when her mother\nintroduced her, as if she had some recollection of my face; but she\nevidently could not recall where she had seen it, and I said nothing to\nhelp her. They both seemed to be much distressed in mind--indeed,\nthe tears were brimming over from the girl’s eyes, and her lip was\nquivering.\n\n“We have come to you, Doctor Munro, in the greatest distress,” said Mrs.\nLa Force; “we should be very glad of your advice.”\n\n“You place me in rather a difficult position, Mrs. La Force,” said I.\n“The fact is, that I look upon you as Dr. Porter’s patients, and it is\na breach of etiquette upon my part to hold any communication with you\nexcept through him.”\n\n“It was he who sent us here,” said she.\n\n“Oh, that alters the matter entirely.”\n\n“He said he could do nothing to help us, and that perhaps you could.”\n\n“Pray let me know what you wish done.”\n\nShe set out valorously to explain; but the effort of putting her\ntroubles into words seemed to bring them more home to her, and she\nsuddenly blurred over and became inarticulate. Her daughter bent towards\nher, and kissed her with the prettiest little spasm of love and pity.\n\n“I will tell you about it, doctor,” said she. “Poor mother is almost\nworn out. Fred--my brother, that is to say, is worse. He has become\nnoisy, and will not be quiet.”\n\n“And my brother, the general,” continued Mrs. La Force, “naturally did\nnot expect this when he kindly offered us a home, and, being a nervous\nman, it is very trying to him. In fact, it cannot go on. He says so\nhimself.”\n\n“But what is mother to do?” cried the girl, taking up the tale again.\n“No hotel or lodging-house would take us in while poor Fred is like\nthat. And we have not the heart to send him to an asylum. Uncle will not\nhave us any longer, and we have nowhere to go to.” Her grey eyes tried\nto look brave, but her mouth would go down at the corners.\n\nI rose and walked up and down the room, trying to think it all out.\n\n“What I wanted to ask you,” said Mrs. La Force, “was whether perhaps\nyou knew some doctor or some private establishment which took in such\ncases--so that we could see Fred every day or so. The only thing is that\nhe must be taken at once, for really my brother has reached the end of\nhis patience.”\n\nI rang the bell for my housekeeper.\n\n“Miss Williams,” said I, “do you think we can furnish a bedroom by\nto-night, so as to take in a gentleman who is ill?”\n\nNever have I so admired that wonderful woman’s self-command.\n\n“Why, easily, sir, if the patients will only let me alone. But with that\nbell going thirty times an hour, it’s hard to say what you are going to\ndo.”\n\nThis with her funny manner set the ladies laughing, and the whole\nbusiness seemed lighter and easier. I promised to have the room ready\nby eight o’clock. Mrs. La Force arranged to bring her son round at that\nhour, and both ladies thanked me a very great deal more than I deserved;\nfor after all it was a business matter, and a resident patient was the\nvery thing that I needed. I was able to assure Mrs. La Force that I\nhad had a similar case under my charge before--meaning, of course, poor\n“Jimmy,” the son of Lord Saltire. Miss Williams escorted them to the\ndoor, and took occasion to whisper to them that it was wonderful how I\ngot through with it, and that I was within sight of my carriage.\n\nIt was a short notice, but we got everything ready by the hour. Carpet,\nbed, suite, curtains--all came together, and were fixed in their places\nby the united efforts of Miss Williams, Paul, and myself. Sharp at eight\na cab arrived, and Fred was conducted by me into his bedroom. The moment\nI looked at him I could see that he was much worse than when I saw him\nwith Dr. Porter. The chronic brain trouble had taken a sudden acute\nturn.\n\nHis eyes were wild, his cheeks flushed, his lips drawn slightly away\nfrom his teeth. His temperature was 102 deg., and he muttered to himself\ncontinually, and paid no attention to my questions. It was evident to me\nat a glance that the responsibility which I had taken upon myself was to\nbe no light one.\n\nHowever, we could but do our best. I undressed him and got him safely\nto bed, while Miss Williams prepared some arrowroot for his supper. He\nwould eat nothing, however, but seemed more disposed to dose, so having\nseen him settle down we left him. His room was the one next to mine,\nand as the wall was thin, I could hear the least movement. Two or three\ntimes he muttered and groaned, but finally he became quiet, and I was\nable to drop to sleep.\n\nAt three in the morning, I was awakened by a dreadful crash. Bounding\nout of bed I rushed into the other room. Poor Fred was standing in his\nlong gown, a pathetic little figure in the grey light of the dawning\nday. He had pulled over his washing-stand (with what object only his\nbemuddled mind could say), and the whole place was a morass of water\nwith islands of broken crockery. I picked him up and put him back into\nhis bed again--his body glowing through his night-dress, and his eyes\nstaring wildly about him. It was evidently impossible to leave him, and\nso I spent the rest of the night nodding and shivering in the armchair.\nNo, it was certainly not a sinecure that I had undertaken.\n\nIn the morning I went round to Mrs. La Force and gave her a bulletin.\nHer brother had recovered his serenity now that the patient had left.\nHe had the Victoria Cross it seems, and was one of the desperate little\ngarrison who held Lucknow in that hell-whirl of a mutiny. And now the\nsudden opening of a door sets him shaking, and a dropped tongs gives him\npalpitations. Are we not the strangest kind of beings?\n\nFred was a little better during the day, and even seemed in a dull\nsort of way to recognise his sister, who brought him flowers in the\nafternoon. Towards evening his temperature sank to 101.5@, and he\nfell into a kind of stupor. As it happened, Dr. Porter came in about\nsupper-time, and I asked him if he would step up and have a look at my\npatient. He did so, and we found him dozing peacefully. You would hardly\nthink that that small incident may have been one of the most momentous\nin my life. It was the merest chance in the world that Porter went up at\nall.\n\nFred was taking medicine with a little chloral in it at this time. I\ngave him his usual dose last thing at night; and then, as he seemed to\nbe sleeping peacefully, I went to my own room for the rest which I badly\nneeded. I did not wake until eight in the morning, when I was roused\nby the jingling of a spoon in a saucer, and the step of Miss Williams\npassing my door. She was taking him the arrowroot which I had ordered\nover-night. I heard her open the door, and the next moment my heart\nsprang into my mouth as she gave a hoarse scream, and her cup and saucer\ncrashed upon the floor. An instant later she had burst into my room,\nwith her face convulsed with terror.\n\n“My God!” she cried, “he’s gone!”\n\nI caught up my dressing-gown and rushed into the next room.\n\nPoor little Fred was stretched sideways across his bed, quite dead. He\nlooked as if he had been rising and had fallen backwards. His face was\nso peaceful and smiling that I could hardly have recognised the worried,\nfever-worn features of yesterday. There is great promise, I think, on\nthe faces of the dead. They say it is but the post-mortem relaxation of\nthe muscles, but it is one of the points on which I should like to see\nscience wrong.\n\nMiss Williams and I stood for five minutes without a word, hushed by the\npresence of that supreme fact. Then we laid him straight, and drew the\nsheet over him. She knelt down and prayed and sobbed, while I sat on\nthe bed, with the cold hand in mine. Then my heart turned to lead as I\nremembered that it lay for me to break the news to the mother.\n\nHowever, she took it most admirably. They were all three at breakfast\nwhen I came round, the general, Mrs. La Force, and the daughter. Somehow\nthey seemed to know all that I had to say at the very sight of me; and\nin their womanly unselfishness their sympathy was all for me, for the\nshock I had suffered, and the disturbance of my household. I found\nmyself turned from the consoler into the consoled. For an hour or more\nwe talked it over, I explaining what I hope needed no explanation, that\nas the poor boy could not tell me his symptoms it was hard for me to\nknow how immediate was his danger. There can be no doubt that the fall\nof temperature and the quietness which both Porter and I had looked upon\nas a hopeful sign, were really the beginning to the end.\n\nMrs. La Force asked me to see to everything, the formalities, register,\nand funeral. It was on a Wednesday, and we thought it best that the\nburial should be on the Friday. Back I hurried, therefore, not\nknowing what to do first, and found old Whitehall waiting for me in my\nconsulting room, looking very jaunty with a camelia in his button-hole.\nNot an organ in its right place, and a camelia in his button-hole!\n\nBetween ourselves, I was sorry to see him, for I was in no humour for\nhis company; but he had heard all about it from Miss Williams, and had\ncome to stop. Only then did I fully realise how much of the kindly,\ndelicate-minded gentleman remained behind that veil of profanity and\nobscenity which he so often held before him.\n\n“I’ll trot along with you, Dr. Munro, sir. A man’s none the worse for a\ncompanion at such times. I’ll not open my mouth unless you wish it, sir;\nbut I am an idle man, and would take it as a kindness if you would let\nme come round with you.”\n\nRound he came, and very helpful he was. He seemed to know all about the\nprocedure--“Buried two wives, Dr. Munro, sir!” I signed the certificate\nmyself, conveyed it to the registrar, got the order for burial, took\nit round to the parish clerk, arranged an hour, then off to the\nundertaker’s, and back to my practice. It was a kind of nightmare\nmorning to look back upon, relieved only by the figure of my old\nBohemian, with his pea jacket, his black thorn, his puffy, crinkly face,\nand his camelia.\n\nTo make a long story short, then, the funeral came off as arranged,\nGeneral Wainwright, Whitehall, and I being the sole mourners. The\ncaptain had never seen poor Fred in the flesh, but he “liked to be in at\nthe finish, sir,” and so he gave me his company. It was at eight in the\nmorning, and it was ten before we found ourselves at Oakley Villa. A\nburly man with bushy whiskers was waiting for us at the door.\n\n“Are you Dr. Munro, sir?” he asked.\n\n“I am.”\n\n“I am a detective from the local office. I was ordered to inquire into\nthe death of the young man in your house lately.”\n\nHere was a thunderbolt! If looking upset is a sign of guilt, I must have\nstood confessed as a villain. It was so absolutely unexpected. I hope,\nhowever, that I had command of myself instantly.\n\n“Pray step in!” said I. Any information I can give you is entirely at\nyour service. Have you any objection to my friend Captain Whitehall\nbeing present?\n\n“Not in the least.” So in we both went, taking this bird of ill-omen.\n\nHe was, however, a man of tact and with a pleasant manner.\n\n“Of course, Dr. Munro,” said he, “you are much too well known in the\ntown for any one to take this matter seriously. But the fact is that we\nhad an anonymous letter this morning saying that the young man had died\nyesterday and was to be buried at an unusual hour to-day, and that the\ncircumstances were suspicious.”\n\n“He died the day before yesterday. He was buried at eight to-day,” I\nexplained; and then I told him the whole story from the beginning. He\nlistened attentively and took a note or two.\n\n“Who signed the certificate?” he asked.\n\n“I did,” said I.\n\nHe raised his eyebrows slightly. “There is really no one to check your\nstatement then?” said he.\n\n“Oh yes, Dr. Porter saw him the night before he died. He knew all about\nthe case.”\n\nThe detective shut his note-book with a snap. “That is final, Dr.\nMunro,” said he. “Of course I must see Dr. Porter as a matter of form,\nbut if his opinion agrees with yours I can only apologise to you for\nthis intrusion.”\n\n“And there is one more thing, Mr. Detective, sir,” said Whitehall\nexplosively. “I’m not a rich man, sir, only the ---- half-pay skipper\nof an armed transport; but by ----, sir, I’d give you this hat full of\ndollars to know the name of the ---- rascal who wrote that anonymous\nletter, sir. By ---- sir, you’d have a real case to look after then.”\n And he waved his black thorn ferociously.\n\nSo the wretched business ended, Bertie. But on what trifling chances do\nour fortunes depend! If Porter had not seen him that night, it is more\nthan likely that there would have been an exhumation. And then,--well,\nthere would be chloral in the body; some money interests _DID_ depend upon\nthe death of the lad--a sharp lawyer might have made much of the case.\nAnyway, the first breath of suspicion would have blown my little rising\npractice to wind. What awful things lurk at the corners of Life’s\nhighway, ready to pounce upon us as we pass!\n\nAnd so you really are going a-voyaging! Well, I won’t write again until\nI hear that you are back from the Islands, and then I hope to have\nsomething a little more cheery to talk about.\n\n\n\n\nXVI. OAKLEY VILLAS, BIRCHESPOOL, 4th November, 1884.\n\nI face my study window as I write, Bertie. Slate-coloured clouds with\nragged fringes are drifting slowly overhead. Between them one has a\nglimpse of higher clouds of a lighter gray. I can hear the gentle swish\nof the rain striking a clearer note on the gravel path and a duller\namong the leaves. Sometimes it falls straight and heavy, till the air is\nfull of the delicate gray shading, and for half a foot above the ground\nthere is a haze from the rebound of a million tiny globules. Then\nwithout any change in the clouds it cases off again. Pools line my walk,\nand lie thick upon the roadway, their surface pocked by the falling\ndrops. As I sit I can smell the heavy perfume of the wet earth, and the\nlaurel bushes gleam where the light strikes sideways upon them. The\ngate outside shines above as though it were new varnished, and along the\nlower edge of the upper bar there hangs a fringe of great clear drops.\n\nThat is the best that November can do for us in our dripping little\nisland. You, I suppose, sitting among the dying glories of an American\nfall, think that this must needs be depressing. Don’t make any mistake\nabout that, my dear boy. You may take the States, from Detroit to\nthe Gulf, and you won’t find a happier man than this one. What do you\nsuppose I’ve got att his{sic-- at this} moment in my consulting room? A\nbureau? A bookcase? No, I know you’ve guessed my secret already. She\nis sitting in my big armchair; and she is the best, the kindest, the\nsweetest little woman in England.\n\nYes, I’ve been married six months now--the almanack says months, though\nI should have thought weeks. I should, of course, have sent cake and\ncards, but had an idea that you were not home from the Islands yet.\nIt is a good year since I wrote to you; but when you give an amorphous\naddress of that sort, what can you expect? I’ve thought of you, and\ntalked of you often enough.\n\nWell, I daresay, with the acumen of an old married man, you have guessed\nwho the lady is as well. We surely know by some nameless instinct more\nabout our futures than we think we know. I can remember, for example,\nthat years ago the name of Bradfield used to strike with a causeless\nfamiliarity upon my ear; and since then, as you know, the course of my\nlife has flowed through it. And so when I first saw Winnie La Force in\nthe railway carriage, before I had spoken to her or knew her name, I\nfelt an inexplicable sympathy for and interest in her. Have you had\nno experience of the sort in your life? Or was it merely that she was\nobviously gentle and retiring, and so made a silent claim upon all that\nwas helpful and manly in me? At any rate, I was conscious of it; and\nagain and again every time that I met her. How good is that saying of\nsome Russian writer that he who loves one woman knows more of the whole\nsex than he who has had passing relations with a thousand! I thought I\nknew something of women. I suppose every medical student does. But now I\ncan see that I really knew nothing. My knowledge was all external. I did\nnot know the woman soul, that crowning gift of Providence to man, which,\nif we do not ourselves degrade it, will set an edge to all that is good\nin us. I did not know how the love of a woman will tinge a man’s whole\nlife and every action with unselfishness. I did not know how easy it is\nto be noble when some one else takes it for granted that one will be\nso; or how wide and interesting life becomes when viewed by four eyes\ninstead of two. I had much to learn, you see; but I think I have learned\nit.\n\nIt was natural that the death of poor Fred La Force should make me\nintimate with the family. It was really that cold hand which I grasped\nthat morning as I sat by his bed which drew me towards my happiness. I\nvisited them frequently, and we often went little excursions together.\nThen my dear mother came down to stay with me for a spell, and turned\nMiss Williams gray by looking for dust in all sorts of improbable\ncorners; or advancing with a terrible silence, a broom in one hand and\na shovel in the other, to the attack of a spider’s web which she had\nmarked down in the beer cellar. Her presence enabled me to return some\nof the hospitality which I had received from the La Forces, and brought\nus still nearer together.\n\nI had never yet reminded them of our previous meeting. One evening,\nhowever, the talk turned upon clairvoyance, and Mrs. La Force was\nexpressing the utmost disbelief in it. I borrowed her ring, and holding\nit to my forehead, I pretended to be peering into her past.\n\n“I see you in a railway carriage,” said I. “You are wearing a red\nfeather in your bonnet. Miss La Force is dressed in something dark.\nThere is a young man there. He is rude enough to address your daughter\nas Winnie before he has ever been----”\n\n“Oh, mother,” she cried, “of course it is he! The face haunted me, and I\ncould not think where we had met it.”\n\nWell, there are some things that we don’t talk about to another man,\neven when we know each other as well as I know you. Why should we, when\nthat which is most engrossing to us consists in those gradual shades of\nadvance from friendship to intimacy, and from intimacy to something\nmore sacred still, which can scarcely be written at all, far less made\ninteresting to another? The time came at last when they were to leave\nBirchespool, and my mother and I went round the night before to say\ngoodbye. Winnie and I were thrown together for an instant.\n\n“When will you come back to Birchespool?” I asked.\n\n“Mother does not know.”\n\n“Will you come soon, and be my wife?”\n\nI had been turning over in my head all the evening how prettily I could\nlead up to it, and how neatly I could say it--and behold the melancholy\nresult! Well, perhaps the feeling of my heart managed to make itself\nclear even through those bald words. There was but one to judge, and she\nwas of that opinion.\n\n\nI was so lost in my own thoughts that I walked as far as Oakley Villa\nwith my mother before I opened my mouth. “Mam,” said I at last, “I have\nproposed to Winnie La Force, and she has accepted me.”\n\n“My boy,” said she, “you are a true Packenham.” And so I knew that my\nmother’s approval had reached the point of enthusiasm. It was not for\ndays--not until I expressed a preference for dust under the bookcase\nwith quiet, against purity and ructions--that the dear old lady\nperceived traces of the Munros.\n\nThe time originally fixed for the wedding was six months after this; but\nwe gradually whittled it down to five and to four. My income had risen\nto about two hundred and seventy pounds at the time; and Winnie had\nagreed, with a somewhat enigmatical smile, that we could manage very\nwell on that--the more so as marriage sends a doctor’s income up. The\nreason of her smile became more apparent when a few weeks before that\ndate I received a most portentous blue document in which “We, Brown\n& Woodhouse, the solicitors for the herein and hereafter mentioned\nWinifred La Force, do hereby”--state a surprising number of things,\nand use some remarkably bad English. The meaning of it, when all the\n“whereas’s and aforesaids” were picked out, was, that Winnie had about a\nhundred a year of her own. It could not make me love her a shade better\nthan I did; but at the same time I won’t be so absurd as to say that I\nwas not glad, or to deny that it made our marriage much easier than it\nwould otherwise have been.\n\nPoor Whitehall came in on the morning of the ceremony. He was staggering\nunder the weight of a fine Japanese cabinet which he had carried round\nfrom his lodgings. I had asked him to come to the church, and the old\ngentleman was resplendent in a white waistcoat and a silk tie. Between\nourselves, I had been just a little uneasy lest his excitement should\nupset him, as in the case of the dinner; but nothing could be more\nexemplary than his conduct and appearance. I had introduced him to\nWinnie some days before.\n\n“You’ll forgive me for saying, Dr. Munro, sir, that you are a ---- lucky\nfellow,” said he. “You’ve put your hand in the bag, sir, and taken out\nthe eel first time, as any one with half an eye can see. Now, I’ve had\nthree dips, and landed a snake every dip. If I’d had a good woman at my\nside, Dr. Munro, sir, I might not be the broken half-pay skipper of an\narmed transport to-day.”\n\n“I thought you had been twice married, captain.”\n\n“Three times, sir. I buried two. The other lives at Brussels. Well, I’ll\nbe at the church, Dr. Munro, sir; and you may lay that there is no one\nthere who wishes you better than I do.”\n\nAnd yet there were many there who wished me well. My patients had\nall got wind of it; and they assembled by the pew-full, looking\ndistressingly healthy. My neighbour, Dr. Porter, was there also to lend\nme his support, and old General Wainwright gave Winnie away. My mother,\nMrs. La Force, and Miss Williams were all in the front pew; and away\nat the back of the church I caught a glimpse of the forked beard and\ncrinkly face of Whitehall, and beside him the wounded lieutenant,\nthe man who ran away with the cook, and quite a line of the strange\nBohemians who followed his fortunes. Then when the words were said,\nand man’s form had tried to sanctify that which was already divine, we\nwalked amid the pealings of the “Wedding March” into the vestry, where\nmy dear mother relieved the tension of the situation by signing the\nregister in the wrong place, so that to all appearance it was she who\nhad just married the clergyman. And then amid congratulations and kindly\nfaces, we were together, her hand on my forearm, upon the steps of the\nchurch, and saw the familiar road stretching before us. But it was\nnot that road which lay before my eyes, but rather the path of our\nlives;--that broader path on which our feet were now planted, so\npleasant to tread, and yet with its course so shrouded in the mist. Was\nit long, or was it short? Was it uphill, or was it down? For her, at\nleast, it should be smooth, if a man’s love could make it so.\n\nWe were away for several weeks in the Isle of Man, and then came back\nto Oakley Villa, where Miss Williams was awaiting us in a house in which\neven my mother could have found no dust, and with a series of cheering\nlegends as to the crowds of patients who had blocked the street in my\nabsence. There really was a marked increase in my practice; and for the\nlast six months or so, without being actually busy, I have always had\nenough to occupy me. My people are poor, and I have to work hard for a\nsmall fee; but I still study and attend the local hospital, and keep my\nknowledge up-to-date, so as to be ready for my opening when it comes.\nThere are times when I chafe that I may not play a part upon some\nlarger stage than this; but my happiness is complete, and if fate has\nno further use for me, I am content now from my heart to live and to die\nwhere I am.\n\nYou will wonder, perhaps, how we get on--my wife and I--in the matter\nof religion. Well, we both go our own ways. Why should I proselytise? I\nwould not for the sake of abstract truth take away her child-like faith\nwhich serves to make life easier and brighter to her. I have made myself\nill-understood by you in these discursive letters if you have read in\nthem any bitterness against the orthodox creeds. Far from saying that\nthey are all false, it would express my position better to say that they\nare all true. Providence would not have used them were they not the best\navailable tools, and in that sense divine. That they are final I deny. A\nsimpler and more universal creed will take their place, when the mind of\nman is ready for it; and I believe it will be a creed founded upon those\nlines of absolute and provable truth which I have indicated. But the old\ncreeds are still the best suited to certain minds, and to certain ages.\nIf they are good enough for Providence to use, they are good enough for\nus to endure. We have but to wait upon the survival of the truest. If I\nhave seemed to say anything aggressive against them, it was directed\nat those who wish to limit the Almighty’s favour to their own little\nclique, or who wish to build a Chinese wall round religion, with no\nassimilation of fresh truths, and no hope of expansion in the future. It\nis with these that the pioneers of progress can hold no truce. As for my\nwife, I would as soon think of breaking in upon her innocent prayers, as\nshe would of carrying off the works of philosophy from my study table.\nShe is not narrow in her views; but if one could stand upon the very\ntopmost pinnacle of broad-mindedness, one would doubtless see from it\nthat even the narrow have their mission.\n\nAbout a year ago I had news of Cullingworth from Smeaton, who was in the\nsame football team at college, and who had called when he was passing\nthrough Bradfield. His report was not a very favourable one. The\npractice had declined considerably. People had no doubt accustomed\nthemselves to his eccentricities, and these had ceased to impress them.\nAgain, there had been one or two coroner’s inquests, which had spread\nthe impression that he had been rash in the use of powerful drugs. If\nthe coroner could have seen the hundreds of cures which Cullingworth had\neffected by that same rashness he would have been less confident with\nhis censures. But, as you can understand, C.’s rival medical men\nwere not disposed to cover him in any way. He had never had much\nconsideration for them.\n\nBesides this decline in his practice, I was sorry to hear that\nCullingworth had shown renewed signs of that curious vein of suspicion\nwhich had always seemed to me to be the most insane of all his traits.\nHis whole frame of mind towards me had been an example of it, but as far\nback as I can remember it had been a characteristic. Even in those\nearly days when they lived in four little rooms above a grocer’s shop,\nI recollect that he insisted upon gumming up every chink of one bedroom\nfor fear of some imaginary infection. He was haunted, too, with a\nperpetual dread of eavesdroppers, which used to make him fly at the door\nand fling it open in the middle of his conversation, pouncing out into\nthe passage with the idea of catching somebody in the act. Once it was\nthe maid with the tea tray that he caught, I remember; and I can see her\nastonished face now, with an aureole of flying cups and lumps of sugar.\n\nSmeaton tells me that this has now taken the form of imagining that some\none is conspiring to poison him with copper, against which he takes the\nmost extravagant precautions. It is the strangest sight, he says, to\nsee Cullingworth at his meals; for he sits with an elaborate chemical\napparatus and numerous retorts and bottles at his elbow, with which he\ntests samples of every course. I could not help laughing at Smeaton’s\ndescription, and yet it was a laugh with a groan underlying it. Of all\nruins, that of a fine man is the saddest.\n\nI never thought I should have seen Cullingworth again, but fate has\nbrought us together. I have always had a kindly feeling for him, though\nI feel that he used me atrociously. Often I have wondered whether, if I\nwere placed before him, I should take him by the throat or by the hand.\nYou will be interested to hear what actually occurred.\n\nOne day, just a week or so back, I was starting on my round, when a\nboy arrived with a note. It fairly took my breath away when I saw the\nfamiliar writing, and realised that Cullingworth was in Birchespool. I\ncalled Winnie, and we read it together.\n\n“Dear Munro,” it said, “James is in lodgings here for a few days. We are\non the point of leaving England. He would be glad, for the sake of old\ntimes, to have a chat with you before he goes.\n\n“Yours faithfully,\n\n“HETTY CULLINGWORTH.”\n\n\nThe writing was his and the style of address, so that it was evidently\none of those queer little bits of transparent cunning which were\ncharacteristic of him, to make it come from his wife, that he might not\nlay himself open to a direct rebuff. The address, curiously enough, was\nthat very Cadogan Terrace at which I had lodged, but two doors higher\nup.\n\nWell, I was averse from going myself, but Winnie was all for peace and\nforgiveness. Women who claim nothing invariably get everything, and so\nmy gentle little wife always carries her point. Half an hour later I was\nin Cadogan Terrace with very mixed feelings, but the kindlier ones at\nthe top. I tried to think that Cullingworth’s treatment of me had been\npathological--the result of a diseased brain. If a delirious man had\nstruck me, I should not have been angry with him. That must be my way of\nlooking at it.\n\nIf Cullingworth still bore any resentment, he concealed it most\nadmirably. But then I knew by experience that that genial loud-voiced\nJohn-Bull manner of his COULD conceal many things. His wife was more\nopen; and I could read in her tightened lips and cold grey eyes, that\nshe at least stood fast to the old quarrel. Cullingworth was little\nchanged, and seemed to be as sanguine and as full of spirits as ever.\n\n“Sound as a trout, my boy!” he cried, drumming on his chest with his\nhands. “Played for the London Scottish in their opening match last\nweek, and was on the ball from whistle to whistle. Not so quick on a\nsprint--you find that yourself, Munro, eh what?--but a good hard-working\nbullocky forward. Last match I shall have for many a day, for I am off\nto South America next week.”\n\n“You have given up Bradfield altogether then?”\n\n“Too provincial, my boy! What’s the good of a village practice with\na miserable three thousand or so a year for a man that wants room to\nspread? My head was sticking out at one end of Bradfield and my feet at\nthe other. Why, there wasn’t room for Hetty in the place, let alone\nme! I’ve taken to the eye, my boy. There’s a fortune in the eye. A man\ngrudges a half-crown to cure his chest or his throat, but he’d spend his\nlast dollar over his eye. There’s money in ears, but the eye is a gold\nmine.”\n\n“What!” said I, “in South America?”\n\n“Just exactly in South America,” he cried, pacing with his quick little\nsteps up and down the dingy room. “Look here, laddie! There’s a great\ncontinent from the equator to the icebergs, and not a man in it who\ncould correct an astigmatism. What do they know of modern eye-surgery\nand refraction? Why, dammy, they don’t know much about it in the\nprovinces of England yet, let alone Brazil. Man, if you could only see\nit, there’s a fringe of squinting millionaires sitting ten deep round\nthe whole continent with their money in their hands waiting for\nan oculist. Eh, Munro, what? By Crums, I’ll come back and I’ll buy\nBradfield, and I’ll give it away as a tip to a waiter.”\n\n“You propose to settle in some large city, then?”\n\n“City! What use would a city be to me? I’m there to squeeze the\ncontinent. I work a town at a time. I send on an agent to the next to\nsay that I am coming. I ‘Here’s the chance of a lifetime,’ says he,\n‘no need to go back to Europe. Here’s Europe come to you. Squints,\ncataracts, iritis, refractions, what you like; here’s the great Signor\nCullingworth, right up to date and ready for anything!’ In they come of\ncourse, droves of them, and then I arrive and take the money. Here’s\nmy luggage!” he pointed to two great hampers in the corner of the room.\n“Those are glasses, my boy, concave and convex, hundreds of them. I test\nan eye, fit him on the spot, and send him away shouting. Then I load\nup a steamer and come home, unless I elect to buy one of their little\nStates and run it.”\n\nOf course it sounded absurd as he put it; but I could soon see that he\nhad worked out his details, and that there was a very practical side to\nhis visions.\n\n“I work Bahia,” said he. “My agent prepares Pernambuco. When Bahia\nis squeezed dry I move on to Pernambuco, and the agent ships to Monte\nVideo. So we work our way round with a trail of spectacles behind us.\nIt’ll go like clock-work.”\n\n“You will need to speak Spanish,” said I.\n\n“Tut, it does not take any Spanish to stick a knife into a man’s eye.\nAll I shall want to know is, ‘Money down--no credit.’ That’s Spanish\nenough for me.”\n\nWe had a long and interesting talk about all that had happened to both\nof us, without, however, any allusion to our past quarrel. He would\nnot admit that he had left Bradfield on account of a falling-off in his\npractice, or for any reason except that he found the place too small.\nHis spring-screen invention had, he said, been favourably reported upon\nby one of the first private shipbuilding firms on the Clyde, and there\nwas every probability of their adopting it.\n\n“As to the magnet,” said he, “I’m very sorry for my country, but there\nis no more command of the seas for her. I’ll have to let the thing go\nto the Germans. It’s not my fault. They must not blame me when the smash\ncomes. I put the thing before the Admiralty, and I could have made a\nboard school understand it in half the time. Such letters, Munro! Colney\nHatch on blue paper. When the war comes, and I show those letters,\nsomebody will be hanged. Questions about this--questions about that. At\nlast they asked me what I proposed to fasten my magnet to. I answered\nto any solid impenetrable object, such as the head of an Admiralty\nofficial. Well, that broke the whole thing up. They wrote with their\ncompliments, and they were returning my apparatus. I wrote with my\ncompliments, and they might go to the devil. And so ends a great\nhistorical incident, Munro--eh, what?”\n\nWe parted very good friends, but with reservations, I fancy, on both\nsides. His last advice to me was to clear out of Birchespool.\n\n“You can do better--you can do better, laddie!” said he. “Look round\nthe whole world, and when you see a little round hole, jump in feet\nforemost. There’s a lot of ‘em about if a man keeps himself ready.”\n\nSo those were the last words of Cullingworth, and the last that I may\never see of him also, for he starts almost immediately upon his strange\nventure. He must succeed. He is a man whom nothing could hold down. I\nwish him luck, and have a kindly feeling towards him, and yet I distrust\nhim from the bottom of my heart, and shall be just as pleased to know\nthat the Atlantic rolls between us.\n\nWell, my dear Bertie, a happy and tranquil, if not very ambitious\nexistence stretches before us. We are both in our twenty-fifth year, and\nI suppose that without presumption we can reckon that thirty-five more\nyears lie in front of us. I can foresee the gradually increasing routine\nof work, the wider circle of friends, the indentification with this or\nthat local movement, with perhaps a seat on the Bench, or at least\nin the Municipal Council in my later years. It’s not a very startling\nprogramme, is it? But it lies to my hand, and I see no other. I should\ndearly love that the world should be ever so little better for my\npresence. Even on this small stage we have our two sides, and something\nmight be done by throwing all one’s weight on the scale of breadth,\ntolerance, charity, temperance, peace, and kindliness to man and beast.\nWe can’t all strike very big blows, and even the little ones count for\nsomething.\n\nSo good-bye, my dear boy, and remember that when you come to England our\nhome would be the brighter for your presence. In any case, now that I\nhave your address, I shall write again in a very few weeks. My kindest\nregards to Mrs. Swanborough.\n\nYours ever,\n\nJ. STARK MUNRO.\n\n\n[This is the last letter which I was destined to receive from my poor\nfriend. He started to spend the Christmas of that year (1884) with his\npeople, and on the journey was involved in the fatal railroad accident\nat Sittingfleet, where the express ran into a freight train which was\nstanding in the depot. Dr. and Mrs. Munro were the only occupants of\nthe car next the locomotive, and were killed instantly, as were the\nbrakesman and one other passenger. It was such an end as both he and\nhis wife would have chosen; and no one who knew them would regret that\nneither was left to mourn the other. His insurance policy of eleven\nhundred pounds was sufficient to provide for the wants of his own\nfamily, which, as his father was sick, was the one worldly matter which\ncould have caused him concern.--H.
