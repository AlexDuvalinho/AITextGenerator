 "text": "THE DUCHESSE OF LANGEAIS\n\n\nBy Honore De Balzac\n\n\nTranslated by Ellen Marriage\n\n\n\nPreparer’s Note:\n\n  The Duchesse of Langeais is the second part of a trilogy. Part\n  one is entitled Ferragus and part three is The Girl with the\n  Golden Eyes. The three stories are frequently combined under the\n  title The Thirteen.\n\n\n                           To Franz Liszt\n\n\n\n\n\nTHE DUCHESSE OF LANGEAIS\n\nIn a Spanish city on an island in the Mediterranean, there stands a\nconvent of the Order of Barefoot Carmelites, where the rule instituted\nby St. Theresa is still preserved with all the first rigor of the\nreformation brought about by that illustrious woman. Extraordinary as\nthis may seem, it is none the less true. Almost every religious house\nin the Peninsula, or in Europe for that matter, was either destroyed or\ndisorganized by the outbreak of the French Revolution and the Napoleonic\nwars; but as this island was protected through those times by the\nEnglish fleet, its wealthy convent and peaceable inhabitants were secure\nfrom the general trouble and spoliation. The storms of many kinds which\nshook the first fifteen years of the nineteenth century spent their\nforce before they reached those cliffs at so short a distance from the\ncoast of Andalusia.\n\nIf the rumour of the Emperor’s name so much as reached the shore of the\nisland, it is doubtful whether the holy women kneeling in the cloisters\ngrasped the reality of his dream-like progress of glory, or the majesty\nthat blazed in flame across kingdom after kingdom during his meteor\nlife.\n\nIn the minds of the Roman Catholic world, the convent stood out\npre-eminent for a stern discipline which nothing had changed; the purity\nof its rule had attracted unhappy women from the furthest parts of\nEurope, women deprived of all human ties, sighing after the long suicide\naccomplished in the breast of God. No convent, indeed, was so well\nfitted for that complete detachment of the soul from all earthly things,\nwhich is demanded by the religious life, albeit on the continent of\nEurope there are many convents magnificently adapted to the purpose\nof their existence. Buried away in the loneliest valleys, hanging\nin mid-air on the steepest mountainsides, set down on the brink\nof precipices, in every place man has sought for the poetry of the\nInfinite, the solemn awe of Silence; in every place man has striven to\ndraw closer to God, seeking Him on mountain peaks, in the depths below\nthe crags, at the cliff’s edge; and everywhere man has found God. But\nnowhere, save on this half-European, half-African ledge of rock could\nyou find so many different harmonies, combining so to raise the soul,\nthat the sharpest pain comes to be like other memories; the strongest\nimpressions are dulled, till the sorrows of life are laid to rest in the\ndepths.\n\nThe convent stands on the highest point of the crags at the uttermost\nend of the island. On the side towards the sea the rock was once rent\nsheer away in some globe-cataclysm; it rises up a straight wall from\nthe base where the waves gnaw at the stone below high-water mark. Any\nassault is made impossible by the dangerous reefs that stretch far out\nto sea, with the sparkling waves of the Mediterranean playing over them.\nSo, only from the sea can you discern the square mass of the convent\nbuilt conformably to the minute rules laid down as to the shape, height,\ndoors, and windows of monastic buildings. From the side of the town, the\nchurch completely hides the solid structure of the cloisters and their\nroofs, covered with broad slabs of stone impervious to sun or storm or\ngales of wind.\n\nThe church itself, built by the munificence of a Spanish family, is the\ncrowning edifice of the town. Its fine, bold front gives an imposing\nand picturesque look to the little city in the sea. The sight of such\na city, with its close-huddled roofs, arranged for the most part\namphitheatre-wise above a picturesque harbour, and crowned by a glorious\ncathedral front with triple-arched Gothic doorways, belfry towers, and\nfiligree spires, is a spectacle surely in every way the sublimest on\nearth. Religion towering above daily life, to put men continually\nin mind of the End and the way, is in truth a thoroughly Spanish\nconception. But now surround this picture by the Mediterranean, and a\nburning sky, imagine a few palms here and there, a few stunted evergreen\ntrees mingling their waving leaves with the motionless flowers and\nfoliage of carved stone; look out over the reef with its white fringes\nof foam in contrast to the sapphire sea; and then turn to the city, with\nits galleries and terraces whither the townsfolk come to take the air\namong their flowers of an evening, above the houses and the tops of the\ntrees in their little gardens; add a few sails down in the harbour; and\nlastly, in the stillness of falling night, listen to the organ music,\nthe chanting of the services, the wonderful sound of bells pealing out\nover the open sea. There is sound and silence everywhere; oftener still\nthere is silence over all.\n\nThe church is divided within into a sombre mysterious nave and narrow\naisles. For some reason, probably because the winds are so high, the\narchitect was unable to build the flying buttresses and intervening\nchapels which adorn almost all cathedrals, nor are there openings of any\nkind in the walls which support the weight of the roof. Outside there\nis simply the heavy wall structure, a solid mass of grey stone further\nstrengthened by huge piers placed at intervals. Inside, the nave and its\nlittle side galleries are lighted entirely by the great stained-glass\nrose-window suspended by a miracle of art above the centre doorway; for\nupon that side the exposure permits of the display of lacework in stone\nand of other beauties peculiar to the style improperly called Gothic.\n\nThe larger part of the nave and aisles was left for the townsfolk, who\ncame and went and heard mass there. The choir was shut off from the\nrest of the church by a grating and thick folds of brown curtain, left\nslightly apart in the middle in such a way that nothing of the choir\ncould be seen from the church except the high altar and the officiating\npriest. The grating itself was divided up by the pillars which supported\nthe organ loft; and this part of the structure, with its carved wooden\ncolumns, completed the line of the arcading in the gallery carried by\nthe shafts in the nave. If any inquisitive person, therefore, had been\nbold enough to climb upon the narrow balustrade in the gallery to look\ndown into the choir, he could have seen nothing but the tall eight-sided\nwindows of stained glass beyond the high altar.\n\nAt the time of the French expedition into Spain to establish Ferdinand\nVII once more on the throne, a French general came to the island after\nthe taking of Cadiz, ostensibly to require the recognition of the King’s\nGovernment, really to see the convent and to find some means of\nentering it. The undertaking was certainly a delicate one; but a man of\npassionate temper, whose life had been, as it were, but one series of\npoems in action, a man who all his life long had lived romances instead\nof writing them, a man pre-eminently a Doer, was sure to be tempted by a\ndeed which seemed to be impossible.\n\nTo open the doors of a convent of nuns by lawful means! The metropolitan\nor the Pope would scarcely have permitted it! And as for force or\nstratagem--might not any indiscretion cost him his position, his whole\ncareer as a soldier, and the end in view to boot? The Duc d’Angouleme\nwas still in Spain; and of all the crimes which a man in favour with the\nCommander-in-Chief might commit, this one alone was certain to find him\ninexorable. The General had asked for the mission to gratify private\nmotives of curiosity, though never was curiosity more hopeless. This\nfinal attempt was a matter of conscience. The Carmelite convent on the\nisland was the only nunnery in Spain which had baffled his search.\n\nAs he crossed from the mainland, scarcely an hour’s distance, he felt a\npresentiment that his hopes were to be fulfilled; and afterwards, when\nas yet he had seen nothing of the convent but its walls, and of the nuns\nnot so much as their robes; while he had merely heard the chanting of\nthe service, there were dim auguries under the walls and in the sound of\nthe voices to justify his frail hope. And, indeed, however faint those\nso unaccountable presentiments might be, never was human passion more\nvehemently excited than the General’s curiosity at that moment. There\nare no small events for the heart; the heart exaggerates everything; the\nheart weighs the fall of a fourteen-year-old Empire and the dropping of\na woman’s glove in the same scales, and the glove is nearly always\nthe heavier of the two. So here are the facts in all their prosaic\nsimplicity. The facts first, the emotions will follow.\n\nAn hour after the General landed on the island, the royal authority was\nre-established there. Some few Constitutional Spaniards who had found\ntheir way thither after the fall of Cadiz were allowed to charter\na vessel and sail for London. So there was neither resistance nor\nreaction. But the change of government could not be effected in the\nlittle town without a mass, at which the two divisions under the\nGeneral’s command were obliged to be present. Now, it was upon this mass\nthat the General had built his hopes of gaining some information as\nto the sisters in the convent; he was quite unaware how absolutely the\nCarmelites were cut off from the world; but he knew that there might be\namong them one whom he held dearer than life, dearer than honour.\n\nHis hopes were cruelly dashed at once. Mass, it is true, was celebrated\nin state. In honour of such a solemnity, the curtains which always hid\nthe choir were drawn back to display its riches, its valuable paintings\nand shrines so bright with gems that they eclipsed the glories of\nthe ex-votos of gold and silver hung up by sailors of the port on\nthe columns in the nave. But all the nuns had taken refuge in the\norgan-loft. And yet, in spite of this first check, during this very mass\nof thanksgiving, the most intimately thrilling drama that ever set a\nman’s heart beating opened out widely before him.\n\nThe sister who played the organ aroused such intense enthusiasm, that\nnot a single man regretted that he had come to the service. Even the men\nin the ranks were delighted, and the officers were in ecstasy. As for\nthe General, he was seemingly calm and indifferent. The sensations\nstirred in him as the sister played one piece after another belong to\nthe small number of things which it is not lawful to utter; words are\npowerless to express them; like death, God, eternity, they can only be\nrealised through their one point of contact with humanity. Strangely\nenough, the organ music seemed to belong to the school of Rossini, the\nmusician who brings most human passion into his art.\n\nSome day his works, by their number and extent, will receive the\nreverence due to the Homer of music. From among all the scores that we\nowe to his great genius, the nun seemed to have chosen _Moses in Egypt_\nfor special study, doubtless because the spirit of sacred music finds\ntherein its supreme expression. Perhaps the soul of the great musician,\nso gloriously known to Europe, and the soul of this unknown executant\nhad met in the intuitive apprehension of the same poetry. So at least\nthought two dilettanti officers who must have missed the Theatre Favart\nin Spain.\n\nAt last in the _Te Deum_ no one could fail to discern a French soul in\nthe sudden change that came over the music. Joy for the victory of the\nMost Christian King evidently stirred this nun’s heart to the depths.\nShe was a Frenchwoman beyond mistake. Soon the love of country shone\nout, breaking forth like shafts of light from the fugue, as the sister\nintroduced variations with all a Parisienne’s fastidious taste, and\nblended vague suggestions of our grandest national airs with her music.\nA Spaniard’s fingers would not have brought this warmth into a\ngraceful tribute paid to the victorious arms of France. The musician’s\nnationality was revealed.\n\n“We find France everywhere, it seems,” said one of the men.\n\nThe General had left the church during the _Te Deum_; he could not\nlisten any longer. The nun’s music had been a revelation of a woman\nloved to frenzy; a woman so carefully hidden from the world’s eyes,\nso deeply buried in the bosom of the Church, that hitherto the most\ningenious and persistent efforts made by men who brought great influence\nand unusual powers to bear upon the search had failed to find her. The\nsuspicion aroused in the General’s heart became all but a certainty with\nthe vague reminiscence of a sad, delicious melody, the air of _Fleuve\ndu Tage_. The woman he loved had played the prelude to the ballad in\na boudoir in Paris, how often! and now this nun had chosen the song\nto express an exile’s longing, amid the joy of those that triumphed.\nTerrible sensation! To hope for the resurrection of a lost love, to find\nher only to know that she was lost, to catch a mysterious glimpse of her\nafter five years--five years, in which the pent-up passion, chafing\nin an empty life, had grown the mightier for every fruitless effort to\nsatisfy it!\n\nWho has not known, at least once in his life, what it is to lose some\nprecious thing; and after hunting through his papers, ransacking his\nmemory, and turning his house upside down; after one or two days spent\nin vain search, and hope, and despair; after a prodigious expenditure\nof the liveliest irritation of soul, who has not known the ineffable\npleasure of finding that all-important nothing which had come to be a\nking of monomania? Very good. Now, spread that fury of search over five\nyears; put a woman, put a heart, put love in the place of the trifle;\ntranspose the monomania into the key of high passion; and, furthermore,\nlet the seeker be a man of ardent temper, with a lion’s heart and a\nleonine head and mane, a man to inspire awe and fear in those who come\nin contact with him--realise this, and you may, perhaps, understand why\nthe General walked abruptly out of the church when the first notes of\na ballad, which he used to hear with a rapture of delight in a\ngilt-paneled boudoir, began to vibrate along the aisles of the church in\nthe sea.\n\nThe General walked away down the steep street which led to the port, and\nonly stopped when he could not hear the deep notes of the organ. Unable\nto think of anything but the love which broke out in volcanic eruption,\nfilling his heart with fire, he only knew that the _Te Deum_ was over\nwhen the Spanish congregation came pouring out of the church. Feeling\nthat his behaviour and attitude might seem ridiculous, he went back to\nhead the procession, telling the alcalde and the governor that, feeling\nsuddenly faint, he had gone out into the air. Casting about for a plea\nfor prolonging his stay, it at once occurred to him to make the most of\nthis excuse, framed on the spur of the moment. He declined, on a plea of\nincreasing indisposition, to preside at the banquet given by the town\nto the French officers, betook himself to his bed, and sent a message to\nthe Major-General, to the effect that temporary illness obliged him\nto leave the Colonel in command of the troops for the time being.\nThis commonplace but very plausible stratagem relieved him of all\nresponsibility for the time necessary to carry out his plans. The\nGeneral, nothing if not “catholic and monarchical,” took occasion to\ninform himself of the hours of the services, and manifested the greatest\nzeal for the performance of his religious duties, piety which caused no\nremark in Spain.\n\nThe very next day, while the division was marching out of the town, the\nGeneral went to the convent to be present at vespers. He found an empty\nchurch. The townsfolk, devout though they were, had all gone down to the\nquay to watch the embarkation of the troops. He felt glad to be the only\nman there. He tramped noisily up the nave, clanking his spurs till the\nvaulted roof rang with the sound; he coughed, he talked aloud to himself\nto let the nuns know, and more particularly to let the organist know\nthat if the troops were gone, one Frenchman was left behind. Was this\nsingular warning heard and understood? He thought so. It seemed to him\nthat in the _Magnificat_ the organ made response which was borne to him\non the vibrating air. The nun’s spirit found wings in music and fled\ntowards him, throbbing with the rhythmical pulse of the sounds. Then, in\nall its might, the music burst forth and filled the church with warmth.\nThe Song of Joy set apart in the sublime liturgy of Latin Christianity\nto express the exaltation of the soul in the presence of the glory of\nthe ever-living God, became the utterance of a heart almost terrified by\nits gladness in the presence of the glory of a mortal love; a love that\nyet lived, a love that had risen to trouble her even beyond the grave in\nwhich the nun is laid, that she may rise again as the bride of Christ.\n\nThe organ is in truth the grandest, the most daring, the most\nmagnificent of all instruments invented by human genius. It is a whole\norchestra in itself. It can express anything in response to a skilled\ntouch. Surely it is in some sort a pedestal on which the soul poises for\na flight forth into space, essaying on her course to draw picture after\npicture in an endless series, to paint human life, to cross the Infinite\nthat separates heaven from earth? And the longer a dreamer listens to\nthose giant harmonies, the better he realizes that nothing save this\nhundred-voiced choir on earth can fill all the space between kneeling\nmen, and a God hidden by the blinding light of the Sanctuary. The music\nis the one interpreter strong enough to bear up the prayers of humanity\nto heaven, prayer in its omnipotent moods, prayer tinged by the\nmelancholy of many different natures, coloured by meditative ecstasy,\nupspringing with the impulse of repentance--blended with the myriad\nfancies of every creed. Yes. In those long vaulted aisles the melodies\ninspired by the sense of things divine are blended with a grandeur\nunknown before, are decked with new glory and might. Out of the dim\ndaylight, and the deep silence broken by the chanting of the choir in\nresponse to the thunder of the organ, a veil is woven for God, and the\nbrightness of His attributes shines through it.\n\nAnd this wealth of holy things seemed to be flung down like a grain of\nincense upon the fragile altar raised to Love beneath the eternal throne\nof a jealous and avenging God. Indeed, in the joy of the nun there\nwas little of that awe and gravity which should harmonize with the\nsolemnities of the _Magnificat_. She had enriched the music with\ngraceful variations, earthly gladness throbbing through the rhythm of\neach. In such brilliant quivering notes some great singer might strive\nto find a voice for her love, her melodies fluttered as a bird flutters\nabout her mate. There were moments when she seemed to leap back into\nthe past, to dally there now with laughter, now with tears. Her changing\nmoods, as it were, ran riot. She was like a woman excited and happy over\nher lover’s return.\n\nBut at length, after the swaying fugues of delirium, after the\nmarvellous rendering of a vision of the past, a revulsion swept over the\nsoul that thus found utterance for itself. With a swift transition from\nthe major to the minor, the organist told her hearer of her present lot.\nShe gave the story of long melancholy broodings, of the slow course\nof her moral malady. How day by day she deadened the senses, how every\nnight cut off one more thought, how her heart was slowly reduced\nto ashes. The sadness deepened shade after shade through languid\nmodulations, and in a little while the echoes were pouring out a torrent\nof grief. Then on a sudden, high notes rang out like the voices of\nangels singing together, as if to tell the lost but not forgotten lover\nthat their spirits now could only meet in heaven. Pathetic hope! Then\nfollowed the _Amen_. No more joy, no more tears in the air, no sadness,\nno regrets. The _Amen_ was the return to God. The final chord was deep,\nsolemn, even terrible; for the last rumblings of the bass sent a shiver\nthrough the audience that raised the hair on their heads; the nun shook\nout her veiling of crepe, and seemed to sink again into the grave from\nwhich she had risen for a moment. Slowly the reverberations died away;\nit seemed as if the church, but now so full of light, had returned to\nthick darkness.\n\nThe General had been caught up and borne swiftly away by this\nstrong-winged spirit; he had followed the course of its flight from\nbeginning to end. He understood to the fullest extent the imagery of\nthat burning symphony; for him the chords reached deep and far. For\nhim, as for the sister, the poem meant future, present, and past. Is\nnot music, and even opera music, a sort of text, which a susceptible\nor poetic temper, or a sore and stricken heart, may expand as memories\nshall determine? If a musician must needs have the heart of a poet, must\nnot the listener too be in a manner a poet and a lover to hear all that\nlies in great music? Religion, love, and music--what are they but a\nthreefold expression of the same fact, of that craving for expansion\nwhich stirs in every noble soul. And these three forms of poetry ascend\nto God, in whom all passion on earth finds its end. Wherefore the holy\nhuman trinity finds a place amid the infinite glories of God; of God,\nwhom we always represent surrounded with the fires of love and seistrons\nof gold--music and light and harmony. Is not He the Cause and the End of\nall our strivings?\n\nThe French General guessed rightly that here in the desert, on this bare\nrock in the sea, the nun had seized upon music as an outpouring of the\npassion that still consumed her. Was this her manner of offering up her\nlove as a sacrifice to God? Or was it Love exultant in triumph over God?\nThe questions were hard to answer. But one thing at least the General\ncould not mistake--in this heart, dead to the world, the fire of passion\nburned as fiercely as in his own.\n\nVespers over, he went back to the alcalde with whom he was staying.\nIn the all-absorbing joy which comes in such full measure when a\nsatisfaction sought long and painfully is attained at last, he could see\nnothing beyond this--he was still loved! In her heart love had grown\nin loneliness, even as his love had grown stronger as he surmounted one\nbarrier after another which this woman had set between them! The glow of\nsoul came to its natural end. There followed a longing to see her again,\nto contend with God for her, to snatch her away--a rash scheme, which\nappealed to a daring nature. He went to bed, when the meal was over, to\navoid questions; to be alone and think at his ease; and he lay absorbed\nby deep thought till day broke.\n\nHe rose only to go to mass. He went to the church and knelt close to\nthe screen, with his forehead touching the curtain; he would have torn\na hole in it if he had been alone, but his host had come with him out of\npoliteness, and the least imprudence might compromise the whole future\nof his love, and ruin the new hopes.\n\nThe organ sounded, but it was another player, and not the nun of the\nlast two days whose hands touched the keys. It was all colorless and\ncold for the General. Was the woman he loved prostrated by emotion which\nwell-nigh overcame a strong man’s heart? Had she so fully realised and\nshared an unchanged, longed-for love, that now she lay dying on her bed\nin her cell? While innumerable thoughts of this kind perplexed his mind,\nthe voice of the woman he worshipped rang out close beside him; he knew\nits clear resonant soprano. It was her voice, with that faint tremor in\nit which gave it all the charm that shyness and diffidence gives to a\nyoung girl; her voice, distinct from the mass of singing as a _prima\ndonna’s_ in the chorus of a finale. It was like a golden or silver\nthread in dark frieze.\n\nIt was she! There could be no mistake. Parisienne now as ever, she had\nnot laid coquetry aside when she threw off worldly adornments for the\nveil and the Carmelite’s coarse serge. She who had affirmed her love\nlast evening in the praise sent up to God, seemed now to say to her\nlover, “Yes, it is I. I am here. My love is unchanged, but I am beyond\nthe reach of love. You will hear my voice, my soul shall enfold you,\nand I shall abide here under the brown shroud in the choir from which no\npower on earth can tear me. You shall never see me more!”\n\n“It is she indeed!” the General said to himself, raising his head. He\nhad leant his face on his hands, unable at first to bear the intolerable\nemotion that surged like a whirlpool in his heart, when that well-known\nvoice vibrated under the arcading, with the sound of the sea for\naccompaniment.\n\nStorm was without, and calm within the sanctuary. Still that rich voice\npoured out all its caressing notes; it fell like balm on the lover’s\nburning heart; it blossomed upon the air--the air that a man would fain\nbreathe more deeply to receive the effluence of a soul breathed forth\nwith love in the words of the prayer. The alcalde coming to join\nhis guest found him in tears during the elevation, while the nun was\nsinging, and brought him back to his house. Surprised to find so much\npiety in a French military man, the worthy magistrate invited the\nconfessor of the convent to meet his guest. Never had news given the\nGeneral more pleasure; he paid the ecclesiastic a good deal of attention\nat supper, and confirmed his Spanish hosts in the high opinion they had\nformed of his piety by a not wholly disinterested respect.\n\nHe inquired with gravity how many sisters there were in the convent, and\nasked for particulars of its endowment and revenues, as if from\ncourtesy he wished to hear the good priest discourse on the subject most\ninteresting to him. He informed himself as to the manner of life led by\nthe holy women. Were they allowed to go out of the convent, or to see\nvisitors?\n\n“Senor,” replied the venerable churchman, “the rule is strict. A woman\ncannot enter a monastery of the order of St. Bruno without a special\npermission from His Holiness, and the rule here is equally stringent.\nNo man may enter a convent of Barefoot Carmelites unless he is a priest\nspecially attached to the services of the house by the Archbishop. None\nof the nuns may leave the convent; though the great Saint, St. Theresa,\noften left her cell. The Visitor or the Mothers Superior can alone give\npermission, subject to an authorization from the Archbishop, for a nun\nto see a visitor, and then especially in a case of illness. Now we are\none of the principal houses, and consequently we have a Mother Superior\nhere. Among other foreign sisters there is one Frenchwoman, Sister\nTheresa; she it is who directs the music in the chapel.”\n\n“Oh!” said the General, with feigned surprise. “She must have rejoiced\nover the victory of the House of Bourbon.”\n\n“I told them the reason of the mass; they are always a little bit\ninquisitive.”\n\n“But Sister Theresa may have interests in France. Perhaps she would like\nto send some message or to hear news.”\n\n“I do not think so. She would have come to ask me.”\n\n“As a fellow-countryman, I should be quite curious to see her,” said the\nGeneral. “If it is possible, if the Lady Superior consents, if----”\n\n“Even at the grating and in the Reverend Mother’s presence, an interview\nwould be quite impossible for anybody whatsoever; but, strict as the\nMother is, for a deliverer of our holy religion and the throne of his\nCatholic Majesty, the rule might be relaxed for a moment,” said the\nconfessor, blinking. “I will speak about it.”\n\n“How old is Sister Theresa?” inquired the lover. He dared not ask any\nquestions of the priest as to the nun’s beauty.\n\n“She does not reckon years now,” the good man answered, with a\nsimplicity that made the General shudder.\n\nNext day before siesta, the confessor came to inform the French General\nthat Sister Theresa and the Mother consented to receive him at the\ngrating in the parlour before vespers. The General spent the siesta in\npacing to and fro along the quay in the noonday heat. Thither the priest\ncame to find him, and brought him to the convent by way of the gallery\nround the cemetery. Fountains, green trees, and rows of arcading\nmaintained a cool freshness in keeping with the place.\n\nAt the further end of the long gallery the priest led the way into a\nlarge room divided in two by a grating covered with a brown curtain. In\nthe first, and in some sort of public half of the apartment, where the\nconfessor left the newcomer, a wooden bench ran round the wall, and two\nor three chairs, also of wood, were placed near the grating. The ceiling\nconsisted of bare unornamented joists and cross-beams of ilex wood. As\nthe two windows were both on the inner side of the grating, and the dark\nsurface of the wood was a bad reflector, the light in the place was so\ndim that you could scarcely see the great black crucifix, the portrait\nof Saint Theresa, and a picture of the Madonna which adorned the grey\nparlour walls. Tumultuous as the General’s feelings were, they took\nsomething of the melancholy of the place. He grew calm in that homely\nquiet. A sense of something vast as the tomb took possession of him\nbeneath the chill unceiled roof. Here, as in the grave, was there not\neternal silence, deep peace--the sense of the Infinite? And besides this\nthere was the quiet and the fixed thought of the cloister--a thought\nwhich you felt like a subtle presence in the air, and in the dim dusk\nof the room; an all-pervasive thought nowhere definitely expressed, and\nlooming the larger in the imagination; for in the cloister the great\nsaying, “Peace in the Lord,” enters the least religious soul as a living\nforce.\n\nThe monk’s life is scarcely comprehensible. A man seems confessed a\nweakling in a monastery; he was born to act, to live out a life of work;\nhe is evading a man’s destiny in his cell. But what man’s strength,\nblended with pathetic weakness, is implied by a woman’s choice of the\nconvent life! A man may have any number of motives for burying himself\nin a monastery; for him it is the leap over the precipice. A woman\nhas but one motive--she is a woman still; she betrothes herself to a\nHeavenly Bridegroom. Of the monk you may ask, “Why did you not fight\nyour battle?” But if a woman immures herself in the cloister, is there\nnot always a sublime battle fought first?\n\nAt length it seemed to the General that that still room, and the lonely\nconvent in the sea, were full of thoughts of him. Love seldom attains\nto solemnity; yet surely a love still faithful in the breast of God was\nsomething solemn, something more than a man had a right to look for\nas things are in this nineteenth century? The infinite grandeur of the\nsituation might well produce an effect upon the General’s mind; he had\nprecisely enough elevation of soul to forget politics, honours, Spain,\nand society in Paris, and to rise to the height of this lofty climax.\nAnd what in truth could be more tragic? How much must pass in the souls\nof these two lovers, brought together in a place of strangers, on\na ledge of granite in the sea; yet held apart by an intangible,\nunsurmountable barrier! Try to imagine the man saying within himself,\n“Shall I triumph over God in her heart?” when a faint rustling sound\nmade him quiver, and the curtain was drawn aside.\n\nBetween him and the light stood a woman. Her face was hidden by the veil\nthat drooped from the folds upon her head; she was dressed according\nto the rule of the order in a gown of the colour become proverbial. Her\nbare feet were hidden; if the General could have seen them, he would\nhave known how appallingly thin she had grown; and yet in spite of the\nthick folds of her coarse gown, a mere covering and no ornament, he\ncould guess how tears, and prayer, and passion, and loneliness had\nwasted the woman before him.\n\nAn ice-cold hand, belonging, no doubt, to the Mother Superior, held back\nthe curtain. The General gave the enforced witness of their interview a\nsearching glance, and met the dark, inscrutable gaze of an aged recluse.\nThe Mother might have been a century old, but the bright, youthful eyes\nbelied the wrinkles that furrowed her pale face.\n\n“Mme la Duchesse,” he began, his voice shaken with emotion, “does your\ncompanion understand French?” The veiled figure bowed her head at the\nsound of his voice.\n\n“There is no duchess here,” she replied. “It is Sister Theresa whom you\nsee before you. She whom you call my companion is my mother in God, my\nsuperior here on earth.”\n\nThe words were so meekly spoken by the voice that sounded in other years\namid harmonious surroundings of refined luxury, the voice of a queen of\nfashion in Paris. Such words from the lips that once spoke so lightly\nand flippantly struck the General dumb with amazement.\n\n“The Holy Mother only speaks Latin and Spanish,” she added.\n\n“I understand neither. Dear Antoinette, make my excuses to her.”\n\nThe light fell full upon the nun’s figure; a thrill of deep emotion\nbetrayed itself in a faint quiver of her veil as she heard her name\nsoftly spoken by the man who had been so hard in the past.\n\n“My brother,” she said, drawing her sleeve under her veil, perhaps to\nbrush tears away, “I am Sister Theresa.”\n\nThen, turning to the Superior, she spoke in Spanish; the General knew\nenough of the language to understand what she said perfectly well;\npossibly he could have spoken it had he chosen to do so.\n\n“Dear Mother, the gentleman presents his respects to you, and begs you\nto pardon him if he cannot pay them himself, but he knows neither of the\nlanguages which you speak----”\n\nThe aged nun bent her head slowly, with an expression of angelic\nsweetness, enhanced at the same time by the consciousness of her power\nand dignity.\n\n“Do you know this gentleman?” she asked, with a keen glance.\n\n“Yes, Mother.”\n\n“Go back to your cell, my daughter!” said the Mother imperiously.\n\nThe General slipped aside behind the curtain lest the dreadful tumult\nwithin him should appear in his face; even in the shadow it seemed to\nhim that he could still see the Superior’s piercing eyes. He was afraid\nof her; she held his little, frail, hardly-won happiness in her hands;\nand he, who had never quailed under a triple row of guns, now trembled\nbefore this nun. The Duchess went towards the door, but she turned back.\n\n“Mother,” she said, with dreadful calmness, “the Frenchman is one of my\nbrothers.”\n\n“Then stay, my daughter,” said the Superior, after a pause.\n\nThe piece of admirable Jesuitry told of such love and regret, that a man\nless strongly constituted might have broken down under the keen delight\nin the midst of a great and, for him, an entirely novel peril. Oh! how\nprecious words, looks, and gestures became when love must baffle lynx\neyes and tiger’s claws! Sister Theresa came back.\n\n“You see, my brother, what I have dared to do only to speak to you for\na moment of your salvation and of the prayers that my soul puts up for\nyour soul daily. I am committing mortal sin. I have told a lie. How many\ndays of penance must expiate that lie! But I shall endure it for your\nsake. My brother, you do not know what happiness it is to love in\nheaven; to feel that you can confess love purified by religion, love\ntransported into the highest heights of all, so that we are permitted\nto lose sight of all but the soul. If the doctrine and the spirit of\nthe Saint to whom we owe this refuge had not raised me above earth’s\nanguish, and caught me up and set me, far indeed beneath the Sphere\nwherein she dwells, yet truly above this world, I should not have\nseen you again. But now I can see you, and hear your voice, and remain\ncalm----”\n\nThe General broke in, “But, Antoinette, let me see you, you whom I love\npassionately, desperately, as you could have wished me to love you.”\n\n“Do not call me Antoinette, I implore you. Memories of the past hurt me.\nYou must see no one here but Sister Theresa, a creature who trusts in\nthe Divine mercy.” She paused for a little, and then added, “You must\ncontrol yourself, my brother. Our Mother would separate us without pity\nif there is any worldly passion in your face, or if you allow the tears\nto fall from your eyes.”\n\nThe General bowed his head to regain self-control; when he looked up\nagain he saw her face beyond the grating--the thin, white, but still\nimpassioned face of the nun. All the magic charm of youth that once\nbloomed there, all the fair contrast of velvet whiteness and the colour\nof the Bengal rose, had given place to a burning glow, as of a porcelain\njar with a faint light shining through it. The wonderful hair in which\nshe took such pride had been shaven; there was a bandage round her\nforehead and about her face. An ascetic life had left dark traces about\nthe eyes, which still sometimes shot out fevered glances; their ordinary\ncalm expression was but a veil. In a few words, she was but the ghost of\nher former self.\n\n“Ah! you that have come to be my life, you must come out of this tomb!\nYou were mine; you had no right to give yourself, even to God. Did you\nnot promise me to give up all at the least command from me? You may\nperhaps think me worthy of that promise now when you hear what I have\ndone for you. I have sought you all through the world. You have been in\nmy thoughts at every moment for five years; my life has been given to\nyou. My friends, very powerful friends, as you know, have helped with\nall their might to search every convent in France, Italy, Spain, Sicily,\nand America. Love burned more brightly for every vain search. Again and\nagain I made long journeys with a false hope; I have wasted my life and\nthe heaviest throbbings of my heart in vain under many a dark convent\nwall. I am not speaking of a faithfulness that knows no bounds, for what\nis it?--nothing compared with the infinite longings of my love. If your\nremorse long ago was sincere, you ought not to hesitate to follow me\ntoday.”\n\n“You forget that I am not free.”\n\n“The Duke is dead,” he answered quickly.\n\nSister Theresa flushed red.\n\n“May heaven be open to him!” she cried with a quick rush of feeling. “He\nwas generous to me.--But I did not mean such ties; it was one of my sins\nthat I was ready to break them all without scruple--for you.”\n\n“Are you speaking of your vows?” the General asked, frowning. “I did not\nthink that anything weighed heavier with your heart than love. But do\nnot think twice of it, Antoinette; the Holy Father himself shall absolve\nyou of your oath. I will surely go to Rome, I will entreat all the\npowers of earth; if God could come down from heaven, I would----”\n\n“Do not blaspheme.”\n\n“So do not fear the anger of God. Ah! I would far rather hear that\nyou would leave your prison for me; that this very night you would let\nyourself down into a boat at the foot of the cliffs. And we would go\naway to be happy somewhere at the world’s end, I know not where. And\nwith me at your side, you should come back to life and health under the\nwings of love.”\n\n“You must not talk like this,” said Sister Theresa; “you do not know\nwhat you are to me now. I love you far better than I ever loved you\nbefore. Every day I pray for you; I see you with other eyes. Armand, if\nyou but knew the happiness of giving yourself up, without shame, to a\npure friendship which God watches over! You do not know what joy it is\nto me to pray for heaven’s blessing on you. I never pray for myself: God\nwill do with me according to His will; but, at the price of my soul, I\nwish I could be sure that you are happy here on earth, and that you\nwill be happy hereafter throughout all ages. My eternal life is all that\ntrouble has left me to offer up to you. I am old now with weeping; I am\nneither young nor fair; and in any case, you could not respect the\nnun who became a wife; no love, not even motherhood, could give me\nabsolution.... What can you say to outweigh the uncounted thoughts that\nhave gathered in my heart during the past five years, thoughts that have\nchanged, and worn, and blighted it? I ought to have given a heart less\nsorrowful to God.”\n\n“What can I say? Dear Antoinette, I will say this, that I love you; that\naffection, love, a great love, the joy of living in another heart that\nis ours, utterly and wholly ours, is so rare a thing and so hard to\nfind, that I doubted you, and put you to sharp proof; but now, today, I\nlove you, Antoinette, with all my soul’s strength.... If you will follow\nme into solitude, I will hear no voice but yours, I will see no other\nface.”\n\n“Hush, Armand! You are shortening the little time that we may be\ntogether here on earth.”\n\n“Antoinette, will you come with me?”\n\n“I am never away from you. My life is in your heart, not through the\nselfish ties of earthly happiness, or vanity, or enjoyment; pale and\nwithered as I am, I live here for you, in the breast of God. As God is\njust, you shall be happy----”\n\n“Words, words all of it! Pale and withered? How if I want you? How if I\ncannot be happy without you? Do you still think of nothing but duty with\nyour lover before you? Is he never to come first and above all things\nelse in your heart? In time past you put social success, yourself,\nheaven knows what, before him; now it is God, it is the welfare of my\nsoul! In Sister Theresa I find the Duchess over again, ignorant of\nthe happiness of love, insensible as ever, beneath the semblance of\nsensibility. You do not love me; you have never loved me----”\n\n“Oh, my brother----!”\n\n“You do not wish to leave this tomb. You love my soul, do you say?\nVery well, through you it will be lost forever. I shall make away with\nmyself----”\n\n“Mother!” Sister Theresa called aloud in Spanish, “I have lied to you;\nthis man is my lover!”\n\nThe curtain fell at once. The General, in his stupor, scarcely heard the\ndoors within as they clanged.\n\n“Ah! she loves me still!” he cried, understanding all the sublimity of\nthat cry of hers. “She loves me still. She must be carried off....”\n\n\n\nThe General left the island, returned to headquarters, pleaded\nill-health, asked for leave of absence, and forthwith took his departure\nfor France.\n\nAnd now for the incidents which brought the two personages in this Scene\ninto their present relation to each other.\n\n\n\nThe thing known in France as the Faubourg Saint-Germain is neither a\nQuarter, nor a sect, nor an institution, nor anything else that admits\nof a precise definition. There are great houses in the Place Royale, the\nFaubourg Saint-Honore, and the Chaussee d’Antin, in any one of which you\nmay breathe the same atmosphere of Faubourg Saint-Germain. So, to begin\nwith, the whole Faubourg is not within the Faubourg. There are men and\nwomen born far enough away from its influences who respond to them and\ntake their place in the circle; and again there are others, born within\nits limits, who may yet be driven forth forever. For the last forty\nyears the manners, and customs, and speech, in a word, the tradition of\nthe Faubourg Saint-Germain, has been to Paris what the Court used to be\nin other times; it is what the Hotel Saint-Paul was to the fourteenth\ncentury; the Louvre to the fifteenth; the Palais, the Hotel Rambouillet,\nand the Place Royale to the sixteenth; and lastly, as Versailles was to\nthe seventeenth and the eighteenth.\n\nJust as the ordinary workaday Paris will always centre about some point;\nso, through all periods of history, the Paris of the nobles and\nthe upper classes converges towards some particular spot. It is a\nperiodically recurrent phenomenon which presents ample matter for\nreflection to those who are fain to observe or describe the various\nsocial zones; and possibly an enquiry into the causes that bring about\nthis centralization may do more than merely justify the probability of\nthis episode; it may be of service to serious interests which some\nday will be more deeply rooted in the commonwealth, unless, indeed,\nexperience is as meaningless for political parties as it is for youth.\n\nIn every age the great nobles, and the rich who always ape the great\nnobles, build their houses as far as possible from crowded streets. When\nthe Duc d’Uzes built his splendid hotel in the Rue Montmartre in\nthe reign of Louis XIV, and set the fountain at his gates--for which\nbeneficent action, to say nothing of his other virtues, he was held in\nsuch veneration that the whole quarter turned out in a body to follow\nhis funeral--when the Duke, I say, chose this site for his house, he\ndid so because that part of Paris was almost deserted in those days. But\nwhen the fortifications were pulled down, and the market gardens beyond\nthe line of the boulevards began to fill with houses, then the d’Uzes\nfamily left their fine mansion, and in our time it was occupied by a\nbanker. Later still, the noblesse began to find themselves out of their\nelement among shopkeepers, left the Place Royale and the centre of\nParis for good, and crossed the river to breathe freely in the Faubourg\nSaint-Germain, where palaces were reared already about the great\nhotel built by Louis XIV for the Duc de Maine--the Benjamin among his\nlegitimated offspring. And indeed, for people accustomed to a stately\nlife, can there be more unseemly surroundings than the bustle, the mud,\nthe street cries, the bad smells, and narrow thoroughfares of a populous\nquarter? The very habits of life in a mercantile or manufacturing\ndistrict are completely at variance with the lives of nobles. The\nshopkeeper and artisan are just going to bed when the great world is\nthinking of dinner; and the noisy stir of life begins among the former\nwhen the latter have gone to rest. Their day’s calculations never\ncoincide; the one class represents the expenditure, the other the\nreceipts. Consequently their manners and customs are diametrically\nopposed.\n\nNothing contemptuous is intended by this statement. An aristocracy is in\na manner the intellect of the social system, as the middle classes and\nthe proletariat may be said to be its organizing and working power. It\nnaturally follows that these forces are differently situated; and of\ntheir antagonism there is bred a seeming antipathy produced by the\nperformance of different functions, all of them, however, existing for\none common end.\n\nSuch social dissonances are so inevitably the outcome of any charter\nof the constitution, that however much a Liberal may be disposed to\ncomplain of them, as of treason against those sublime ideas with which\nthe ambitious plebeian is apt to cover his designs, he would none the\nless think it a preposterous notion that M. le Prince de Montmorency,\nfor instance, should continue to live in the Rue Saint-Martin at the\ncorner of the street which bears that nobleman’s name; or that M. le Duc\nde Fitz-James, descendant of the royal house of Scotland, should have\nhis hotel at the angle of the Rue Marie Stuart and the Rue Montorgueil.\n_Sint ut sunt, aut non sint_, the grand words of the Jesuit, might be\ntaken as a motto by the great in all countries. These social differences\nare patent in all ages; the fact is always accepted by the people; its\n“reasons of state” are self-evident; it is at once cause and effect, a\nprinciple and a law. The common sense of the masses never deserts them\nuntil demagogues stir them up to gain ends of their own; that common\nsense is based on the verities of social order; and the social order is\nthe same everywhere, in Moscow as in London, in Geneva as in Calcutta.\nGiven a certain number of families of unequal fortune in any given\nspace, you will see an aristocracy forming under your eyes; there will\nbe the patricians, the upper classes, and yet other ranks below them.\nEquality may be a _right_, but no power on earth can convert it into\n_fact_. It would be a good thing for France if this idea could be\npopularized. The benefits of political harmony are obvious to the least\nintelligent classes. Harmony is, as it were, the poetry of order, and\norder is a matter of vital importance to the working population. And\nwhat is order, reduced to its simplest expression, but the agreement\nof things among themselves--unity, in short? Architecture, music, and\npoetry, everything in France, and in France more than in any other\ncountry, is based upon this principle; it is written upon the very\nfoundations of her clear accurate language, and a language must always\nbe the most infallible index of national character. In the same way\nyou may note that the French popular airs are those most calculated to\nstrike the imagination, the best-modulated melodies are taken over by\nthe people; clearness of thought, the intellectual simplicity of an idea\nattracts them; they like the incisive sayings that hold the greatest\nnumber of ideas. France is the one country in the world where a little\nphrase may bring about a great revolution. Whenever the masses have\nrisen, it has been to bring men, affairs, and principles into agreement.\nNo nation has a clearer conception of that idea of unity which should\npermeate the life of an aristocracy; possibly no other nation has so\nintelligent a comprehension of a political necessity; history will never\nfind her behind the time. France has been led astray many a time, but\nshe is deluded, woman-like, by generous ideas, by a glow of enthusiasm\nwhich at first outstrips sober reason.\n\nSo, to begin with, the most striking characteristic of the Faubourg\nis the splendour of its great mansions, its great gardens, and a\nsurrounding quiet in keeping with princely revenues drawn from great\nestates. And what is this distance set between a class and a whole\nmetropolis but visible and outward expression of the widely different\nattitude of mind which must inevitably keep them apart? The position of\nthe head is well defined in every organism. If by any chance a nation\nallows its head to fall at its feet, it is pretty sure sooner or later\nto discover that this is a suicidal measure; and since nations have no\ndesire to perish, they set to work at once to grow a new head. If they\nlack the strength for this, they perish as Rome perished, and Venice,\nand so many other states.\n\nThis distinction between the upper and lower spheres of social activity,\nemphasized by differences in their manner of living, necessarily\nimplies that in the highest aristocracy there is real worth and some\ndistinguishing merit. In any state, no matter what form of “government”\n is affected, so soon as the patrician class fails to maintain that\ncomplete superiority which is the condition of its existence, it ceases\nto be a force, and is pulled down at once by the populace. The people\nalways wish to see money, power, and initiative in their leaders, hands,\nhearts, and heads; they must be the spokesmen, they must represent the\nintelligence and the glory of the nation. Nations, like women, love\nstrength in those who rule them; they cannot give love without respect;\nthey refuse utterly to obey those of whom they do not stand in awe.\nAn aristocracy fallen into contempt is a _roi faineant_, a husband in\npetticoats; first it ceases to be itself, and then it ceases to be.\n\nAnd in this way the isolation of the great, the sharply marked\ndistinction in their manner of life, or in a word, the general custom\nof the patrician caste is at once the sign of a real power, and their\ndestruction so soon as that power is lost. The Faubourg Saint-Germain\nfailed to recognise the conditions of its being, while it would still\nhave been easy to perpetuate its existence, and therefore was brought\nlow for a time. The Faubourg should have looked the facts fairly in the\nface, as the English aristocracy did before them; they should have seen\nthat every institution has its climacteric periods, when words lose\ntheir old meanings, and ideas reappear in a new guise, and the whole\nconditions of politics wear a changed aspect, while the underlying\nrealities undergo no essential alteration.\n\nThese ideas demand further development which form an essential part of\nthis episode; they are given here both as a succinct statement of the\ncauses, and an explanation of the things which happen in the course of\nthe story.\n\nThe stateliness of the castles and palaces where nobles dwell; the\nluxury of the details; the constantly maintained sumptuousness of the\nfurniture; the “atmosphere” in which the fortunate owner of landed\nestates (a rich man before he was born) lives and moves easily and\nwithout friction; the habit of mind which never descends to calculate\nthe petty workaday gains of existence; the leisure; the higher education\nattainable at a much earlier age; and lastly, the aristocratic tradition\nthat makes of him a social force, for which his opponents, by dint\nof study and a strong will and tenacity of vocation, are scarcely a\nmatch-all these things should contribute to form a lofty spirit in a\nman, possessed of such privileges from his youth up; they should\nstamp his character with that high self-respect, of which the least\nconsequence is a nobleness of heart in harmony with the noble name that\nhe bears. And in some few families all this is realised. There are\nnoble characters here and there in the Faubourg, but they are marked\nexceptions to a general rule of egoism which has been the ruin of this\nworld within a world. The privileges above enumerated are the birthright\nof the French noblesse, as of every patrician efflorescence ever formed\non the surface of a nation; and will continue to be theirs so long as\ntheir existence is based upon real estate, or money; _domaine-sol_ and\n_domaine-argent_ alike, the only solid bases of an organized society;\nbut such privileges are held upon the understanding that the patricians\nmust continue to justify their existence. There is a sort of moral\n_fief_ held on a tenure of service rendered to the sovereign, and here\nin France the people are undoubtedly the sovereigns nowadays. The times\nare changed, and so are the weapons. The knight-banneret of old wore\na coat of chain armor and a hauberk; he could handle a lance well and\ndisplay his pennon, and no more was required of him; today he is bound\nto give proof of his intelligence. A stout heart was enough in the days\nof old; in our days he is required to have a capacious brain-pan. Skill\nand knowledge and capital--these three points mark out a social triangle\non which the scutcheon of power is blazoned; our modern aristocracy must\ntake its stand on these.\n\nA fine theorem is as good as a great name. The Rothschilds, the Fuggers\nof the nineteenth century, are princes _de facto_. A great artist is in\nreality an oligarch; he represents a whole century, and almost always he\nis a law to others. And the art of words, the high pressure machinery\nof the writer, the poet’s genius, the merchant’s steady endurance,\nthe strong will of the statesman who concentrates a thousand dazzling\nqualities in himself, the general’s sword--all these victories, in\nshort, which a single individual will win, that he may tower above the\nrest of the world, the patrician class is now bound to win and keep\nexclusively. They must head the new forces as they once headed the\nmaterial forces; how should they keep the position unless they are\nworthy of it? How, unless they are the soul and brain of a nation,\nshall they set its hands moving? How lead a people without the power of\ncommand? And what is the marshal’s baton without the innate power of\nthe captain in the man who wields it? The Faubourg Saint-Germain took to\nplaying with batons, and fancied that all the power was in its hands.\nIt inverted the terms of the proposition which called it into existence.\nAnd instead of flinging away the insignia which offended the people,\nand quietly grasping the power, it allowed the bourgeoisie to seize the\nauthority, clung with fatal obstinacy to its shadow, and over and over\nagain forgot the laws which a minority must observe if it would live.\nWhen an aristocracy is scarce a thousandth part of the body social, it\nis bound today, as of old, to multiply its points of action, so as to\ncounterbalance the weight of the masses in a great crisis. And in our\ndays those means of action must be living forces, and not historical\nmemories.\n\nIn France, unluckily, the noblesse were still so puffed up with the\nnotion of their vanished power, that it was difficult to contend against\na kind of innate presumption in themselves. Perhaps this is a national\ndefect. The Frenchman is less given than anyone else to undervalue\nhimself; it comes natural to him to go from his degree to the one above\nit; and while it is a rare thing for him to pity the unfortunates\nover whose heads he rises, he always groans in spirit to see so many\nfortunate people above him. He is very far from heartless, but too\noften he prefers to listen to his intellect. The national instinct which\nbrings the Frenchman to the front, the vanity that wastes his substance,\nis as much a dominant passion as thrift in the Dutch. For three\ncenturies it swayed the noblesse, who, in this respect, were certainly\npre-eminently French. The scion of the Faubourg Saint-Germain, beholding\nhis material superiority, was fully persuaded of his intellectual\nsuperiority. And everything contributed to confirm him in his belief;\nfor ever since the Faubourg Saint-Germain existed at all--which is\nto say, ever since Versailles ceased to be the royal residence--the\nFaubourg, with some few gaps in continuity, was always backed up by the\ncentral power, which in France seldom fails to support that side. Thence\nits downfall in 1830.\n\nAt that time the party of the Faubourg Saint-Germain was rather like\nan army without a base of operation. It had utterly failed to take\nadvantage of the peace to plant itself in the heart of the nation.\nIt sinned for want of learning its lesson, and through an utter\nincapability of regarding its interests as a whole. A future certainty\nwas sacrificed to a doubtful present gain. This blunder in policy may\nperhaps be attributed to the following cause.\n\nThe class-isolation so strenuously kept up by the noblesse brought about\nfatal results during the last forty years; even caste-patriotism was\nextinguished by it, and rivalry fostered among themselves. When the\nFrench noblesse of other times were rich and powerful, the nobles\n(_gentilhommes_) could choose their chiefs and obey them in the hour\nof danger. As their power diminished, they grew less amenable to\ndiscipline; and as in the last days of the Byzantine Empire, everyone\nwished to be emperor. They mistook their uniform weakness for uniform\nstrength.\n\nEach family ruined by the Revolution and the abolition of the law of\nprimogeniture thought only of itself, and not at all of the great family\nof the noblesse. It seemed to them that as each individual grew rich,\nthe party as a whole would gain in strength. And herein lay their\nmistake. Money, likewise, is only the outward and visible sign of\npower. All these families were made up of persons who preserved a high\ntradition of courtesy, of true graciousness of life, of refined speech,\nwith a family pride, and a squeamish sense of _noblesse oblige_ which\nsuited well with the kind of life they led; a life wholly filled with\noccupations which become contemptible so soon as they cease to be\naccessories and take the chief place in existence. There was a certain\nintrinsic merit in all these people, but the merit was on the surface,\nand none of them were worth their face-value.\n\nNot a single one among those families had courage to ask itself the\nquestion, “Are we strong enough for the responsibility of power?” They\nwere cast on the top, like the lawyers of 1830; and instead of taking\nthe patron’s place, like a great man, the Faubourg Saint-Germain showed\nitself greedy as an upstart. The most intelligent nation in the world\nperceived clearly that the restored nobles were organizing everything\nfor their own particular benefit. From that day the noblesse was doomed.\nThe Faubourg Saint-Germain tried to be an aristocracy when it could\nonly be an oligarchy--two very different systems, as any man may see\nfor himself if he gives an intelligent perusal to the list of the\npatronymics of the House of Peers.\n\nThe King’s Government certainly meant well; but the maxim that the\npeople must be made to _will_ everything, even their own welfare, was\npretty constantly forgotten, nor did they bear in mind that La France is\na woman and capricious, and must be happy or chastised at her own good\npleasure. If there had been many dukes like the Duc de Laval, whose\nmodesty made him worthy of the name he bore, the elder branch would have\nbeen as securely seated on the throne as the House of Hanover at this\nday.\n\nIn 1814 the noblesse of France were called upon to assert their\nsuperiority over the most aristocratic bourgeoisie in the most feminine\nof all countries, to take the lead in the most highly educated epoch the\nworld had yet seen. And this was even more notably the case in 1820. The\nFaubourg Saint-Germain might very easily have led and amused the middle\nclasses in days when people’s heads were turned with distinctions, and\nart and science were all the rage. But the narrow-minded leaders of\na time of great intellectual progress all of them detested art and\nscience. They had not even the wit to present religion in attractive\ncolours, though they needed its support. While Lamartine, Lamennais,\nMontalembert, and other writers were putting new life and elevation into\nmen’s ideas of religion, and gilding it with poetry, these bunglers in\nthe Government chose to make the harshness of their creed felt all over\nthe country. Never was nation in a more tractable humour; La France,\nlike a tired woman, was ready to agree to anything; never was\nmismanagement so clumsy; and La France, like a woman, would have\nforgiven wrongs more easily than bungling.\n\nIf the noblesse meant to reinstate themselves, the better to found a\nstrong oligarchy, they should have honestly and diligently searched\ntheir Houses for men of the stamp that Napoleon used; they should\nhave turned themselves inside out to see if peradventure there was a\nConstitutionalist Richelieu lurking in the entrails of the Faubourg; and\nif that genius was not forthcoming from among them, they should have set\nout to find him, even in the fireless garret where he might happen to\nbe perishing of cold; they should have assimilated him, as the English\nHouse of Lords continually assimilates aristocrats made by chance; and\nfinally ordered him to be ruthless, to lop away the old wood, and cut\nthe tree down to the living shoots. But, in the first place, the great\nsystem of English Toryism was far too large for narrow minds; the\nimportation required time, and in France a tardy success is no better\nthan a fiasco. So far, moreover, from adopting a policy of redemption,\nand looking for new forces where God puts them, these petty great folk\ntook a dislike to any capacity that did not issue from their midst; and,\nlastly, instead of growing young again, the Faubourg Saint-Germain grew\npositively older.\n\nEtiquette, not an institution of primary necessity, might have been\nmaintained if it had appeared only on state occasions, but as it was,\nthere was a daily wrangle over precedence; it ceased to be a matter of\nart or court ceremonial, it became a question of power. And if from\nthe outset the Crown lacked an adviser equal to so great a crisis, the\naristocracy was still more lacking in a sense of its wider interests, an\ninstinct which might have supplied the deficiency. They stood nice about\nM. de Talleyrand’s marriage, when M. de Talleyrand was the one man among\nthem with the steel-encompassed brains that can forge a new political\nsystem and begin a new career of glory for a nation. The Faubourg\nscoffed at a minister if he was not gently born, and produced no one of\ngentle birth that was fit to be a minister. There were plenty of nobles\nfitted to serve their country by raising the dignity of justices of\nthe peace, by improving the land, by opening out roads and canals, and\ntaking an active and leading part as country gentlemen; but these had\nsold their estates to gamble on the Stock Exchange. Again the Faubourg\nmight have absorbed the energetic men among the bourgeoisie, and opened\ntheir ranks to the ambition which was undermining authority; they\npreferred instead to fight, and to fight unarmed, for of all that\nthey once possessed there was nothing left but tradition. For their\nmisfortune there was just precisely enough of their former wealth left\nthem as a class to keep up their bitter pride. They were content with\ntheir past. Not one of them seriously thought of bidding the son of the\nhouse take up arms from the pile of weapons which the nineteenth century\nflings down in the market-place. Young men, shut out from office, were\ndancing at Madame’s balls, while they should have been doing the\nwork done under the Republic and the Empire by young, conscientious,\nharmlessly employed energies. It was their place to carry out at Paris\nthe programme which their seniors should have been following in the\ncountry. The heads of houses might have won back recognition of their\ntitles by unremitting attention to local interests, by falling in with\nthe spirit of the age, by recasting their order to suit the taste of the\ntimes.\n\nBut, pent up together in the Faubourg Saint-Germain, where the spirit of\nthe ancient court and traditions of bygone feuds between the nobles and\nthe Crown still lingered on, the aristocracy was not whole-hearted in\nits allegiance to the Tuileries, and so much the more easily defeated\nbecause it was concentrated in the Chamber of Peers, and badly organized\neven there. If the noblesse had woven themselves into a network over\nthe country, they could have held their own; but cooped up in their\nFaubourg, with their backs against the Chateau, or spread at full length\nover the Budget, a single blow cut the thread of a fast-expiring life,\nand a petty, smug-faced lawyer came forward with the axe. In spite of M.\nRoyer-Collard’s admirable discourse, the hereditary peerage and law of\nentail fell before the lampoons of a man who made it a boast that he had\nadroitly argued some few heads out of the executioner’s clutches, and\nnow forsooth must clumsily proceed to the slaying of old institutions.\n\nThere are examples and lessons for the future in all this. For if there\nwere not still a future before the French aristocracy, there would be\nno need to do more than find a suitable sarcophagus; it were something\npitilessly cruel to burn the dead body of it with fire of Tophet. But\nthough the surgeon’s scalpel is ruthless, it sometimes gives back life\nto a dying man; and the Faubourg Saint-Germain may wax more powerful\nunder persecution than in its day of triumph, if it but chooses to\norganize itself under a leader.\n\nAnd now it is easy to give a summary of this semi-political survey. The\nwish to re-establish a large fortune was uppermost in everyone’s mind;\na lack of broad views, and a mass of small defects, a real need of\nreligion as a political factor, combined with a thirst for pleasure\nwhich damaged the cause of religion and necessitated a good deal of\nhypocrisy; a certain attitude of protest on the part of loftier and\nclearer-sighted men who set their faces against Court jealousies; and\nthe disaffection of the provincial families, who often came of\npurer descent than the nobles of the Court which alienated them from\nitself--all these things combined to bring about a most discordant state\nof things in the Faubourg Saint-Germain. It was neither compact in its\norganisation, nor consequent in its action; neither completely moral,\nnor frankly dissolute; it did not corrupt, nor was it corrupted; it\nwould neither wholly abandon the disputed points which damaged its\ncause, nor yet adopt the policy that might have saved it. In short,\nhowever effete individuals might be, the party as a whole was none\nthe less armed with all the great principles which lie at the roots of\nnational existence. What was there in the Faubourg that it should perish\nin its strength?\n\nIt was very hard to please in the choice of candidates; the Faubourg\nhad good taste, it was scornfully fastidious, yet there was nothing very\nglorious nor chivalrous truly about its fall.\n\nIn the Emigration of 1789 there were some traces of a loftier feeling;\nbut in the Emigration of 1830 from Paris into the country there was\nnothing discernible but self-interest. A few famous men of letters, a\nfew oratorical triumphs in the Chambers, M. de Talleyrand’s attitude\nin the Congress, the taking of Algiers, and not a few names that found\ntheir way from the battlefield into the pages of history--all these\nthings were so many examples set before the French noblesse to show that\nit was still open to them to take their part in the national existence,\nand to win recognition of their claims, if, indeed, they could\ncondescend thus far. In every living organism the work of bringing\nthe whole into harmony within itself is always going on. If a man is\nindolent, the indolence shows itself in everything that he does; and,\nin the same manner, the general spirit of a class is pretty plainly\nmanifested in the face it turns on the world, and the soul informs the\nbody.\n\nThe women of the Restoration displayed neither the proud disregard\nof public opinion shown by the court ladies of olden time in their\nwantonness, nor yet the simple grandeur of the tardy virtues by which\nthey expiated their sins and shed so bright a glory about their names.\nThere was nothing either very frivolous or very serious about the woman\nof the Restoration. She was hypocritical as a rule in her passion, and\ncompounded, so to speak, with its pleasures. Some few families led\nthe domestic life of the Duchesse d’Orleans, whose connubial couch was\nexhibited so absurdly to visitors at the Palais Royal. Two or three kept\nup the traditions of the Regency, filling cleverer women with something\nlike disgust. The great lady of the new school exercised no influence at\nall over the manners of the time; and yet she might have done much.\nShe might, at worst, have presented as dignified a spectacle as\nEnglish-women of the same rank. But she hesitated feebly among old\nprecedents, became a bigot by force of circumstances, and allowed\nnothing of herself to appear, not even her better qualities.\n\nNot one among the Frenchwomen of that day had the ability to create a\nsalon whither leaders of fashion might come to take lessons in taste and\nelegance. Their voices, which once laid down the law to literature, that\nliving expression of a time, now counted absolutely for nought. Now\nwhen a literature lacks a general system, it fails to shape a body for\nitself, and dies out with its period.\n\nWhen in a nation at any time there is a people apart thus constituted,\nthe historian is pretty certain to find some representative figure,\nsome central personage who embodies the qualities and the defects of the\nwhole party to which he belongs; there is Coligny, for instance, among\nthe Huguenots, the Coadjuteur in the time of the Fronde, the Marechal de\nRichelieu under Louis XV, Danton during the Terror. It is in the nature\nof things that the man should be identified with the company in which\nhistory finds him. How is it possible to lead a party without conforming\nto its ideas? or to shine in any epoch unless a man represents the ideas\nof his time? The wise and prudent head of a party is continually obliged\nto bow to the prejudices and follies of its rear; and this is the\ncause of actions for which he is afterwards criticised by this or that\nhistorian sitting at a safer distance from terrific popular explosions,\ncoolly judging the passion and ferment without which the great struggles\nof the world could not be carried on at all. And if this is true of\nthe Historical Comedy of the Centuries, it is equally true in a more\nrestricted sphere in the detached scenes of the national drama known as\nthe _Manners of the Age_.\n\n\n\nAt the beginning of that ephemeral life led by the Faubourg\nSaint-Germain under the Restoration, to which, if there is any truth in\nthe above reflections, they failed to give stability, the most perfect\ntype of the aristocratic caste in its weakness and strength, its\ngreatness and littleness, might have been found for a brief space in a\nyoung married woman who belonged to it. This was a woman artificially\neducated, but in reality ignorant; a woman whose instincts and feelings\nwere lofty while the thought which should have controlled them was\nwanting. She squandered the wealth of her nature in obedience to social\nconventions; she was ready to brave society, yet she hesitated till her\nscruples degenerated into artifice. With more wilfulness than real force\nof character, impressionable rather than enthusiastic, gifted with more\nbrain than heart; she was supremely a woman, supremely a coquette,\nand above all things a Parisienne, loving a brilliant life and gaiety,\nreflecting never, or too late; imprudent to the verge of poetry, and\nhumble in the depths of her heart, in spite of her charming insolence.\nLike some straight-growing reed, she made a show of independence; yet,\nlike the reed, she was ready to bend to a strong hand. She talked much\nof religion, and had it not at heart, though she was prepared to find in\nit a solution of her life. How explain a creature so complex? Capable\nof heroism, yet sinking unconsciously from heroic heights to utter a\nspiteful word; young and sweet-natured, not so much old at heart as\naged by the maxims of those about her; versed in a selfish philosophy in\nwhich she was all unpractised, she had all the vices of a courtier, all\nthe nobleness of developing womanhood. She trusted nothing and no one,\nyet there were times when she quitted her sceptical attitude for a\nsubmissive credulity.\n\nHow should any portrait be anything but incomplete of her, in whom the\nplay of swiftly-changing colour made discord only to produce a poetic\nconfusion? For in her there shone a divine brightness, a radiance of\nyouth that blended all her bewildering characteristics in a certain\ncompleteness and unity informed by her charm. Nothing was feigned. The\npassion or semi-passion, the ineffectual high aspirations, the actual\npettiness, the coolness of sentiment and warmth of impulse, were all\nspontaneous and unaffected, and as much the outcome of her own position\nas of the position of the aristocracy to which she belonged. She was\nwholly self-contained; she put herself proudly above the world and\nbeneath the shelter of her name. There was something of the egoism of\nMedea in her life, as in the life of the aristocracy that lay a-dying,\nand would not so much as raise itself or stretch out a hand to any\npolitical physician; so well aware of its feebleness, or so conscious\nthat it was already dust, that it refused to touch or be touched.\n\nThe Duchesse de Langeais (for that was her name) had been married for\nabout four years when the Restoration was finally consummated, which is\nto say, in 1816. By that time the revolution of the Hundred Days had let\nin the light on the mind of Louis XVIII. In spite of his surroundings,\nhe comprehended the situation and the age in which he was living; and it\nwas only later, when this Louis XI, without the axe, lay stricken down\nby disease, that those about him got the upper hand. The Duchesse de\nLangeais, a Navarreins by birth, came of a ducal house which had made\na point of never marrying below its rank since the reign of Louis XIV.\nEvery daughter of the house must sooner or later take a _tabouret_ at\nCourt. So, Antoinette de Navarreins, at the age of eighteen, came out of\nthe profound solitude in which her girlhood had been spent to marry the\nDuc de Langeais’ eldest son. The two families at that time were living\nquite out of the world; but after the invasion of France, the return\nof the Bourbons seemed to every Royalist mind the only possible way of\nputting an end to the miseries of the war.\n\nThe Ducs de Navarreins and de Langeais had been faithful throughout to\nthe exiled Princes, nobly resisting all the temptations of glory under\nthe Empire. Under the circumstances they naturally followed out the old\nfamily policy; and Mlle Antoinette, a beautiful and portionless girl,\nwas married to M. le Marquis de Langeais only a few months before the\ndeath of the Duke his father.\n\nAfter the return of the Bourbons, the families resumed their rank,\noffices, and dignity at Court; once more they entered public life, from\nwhich hitherto they held aloof, and took their place high on the sunlit\nsummits of the new political world. In that time of general baseness and\nsham political conversions, the public conscience was glad to recognise\nthe unstained loyalty of the two houses, and a consistency in political\nand private life for which all parties involuntarily respected them.\nBut, unfortunately, as so often happens in a time of transition, the\nmost disinterested persons, the men whose loftiness of view and wise\nprinciples would have gained the confidence of the French nation and led\nthem to believe in the generosity of a novel and spirited policy--these\nmen, to repeat, were taken out of affairs, and public business was\nallowed to fall into the hands of others, who found it to their interest\nto push principles to their extreme consequences by way of proving their\ndevotion.\n\nThe families of Langeais and Navarreins remained about the Court,\ncondemned to perform the duties required by Court ceremonial amid the\nreproaches and sneers of the Liberal party. They were accused of gorging\nthemselves with riches and honours, and all the while their family\nestates were no larger than before, and liberal allowances from the\ncivil list were wholly expended in keeping up the state necessary for\nany European government, even if it be a Republic.\n\nIn 1818, M. le Duc de Langeais commanded a division of the army, and the\nDuchess held a post about one of the Princesses, in virtue of which she\nwas free to live in Paris and apart from her husband without scandal.\nThe Duke, moreover, besides his military duties, had a place at Court,\nto which he came during his term of waiting, leaving his major-general\nin command. The Duke and Duchess were leading lives entirely apart, the\nworld none the wiser. Their marriage of convention shared the fate\nof nearly all family arrangements of the kind. Two more antipathetic\ndispositions could not well have been found; they were brought together;\nthey jarred upon each other; there was soreness on either side; then\nthey were divided once for all. Then they went their separate ways,\nwith a due regard for appearances. The Duc de Langeais, by nature\nas methodical as the Chevalier de Folard himself, gave himself up\nmethodically to his own tastes and amusements, and left his wife at\nliberty to do as she pleased so soon as he felt sure of her character.\nHe recognised in her a spirit pre-eminently proud, a cold heart, a\nprofound submissiveness to the usages of the world, and a youthful\nloyalty. Under the eyes of great relations, with the light of a prudish\nand bigoted Court turned full upon the Duchess, his honour was safe.\n\nSo the Duke calmly did as the _grands seigneurs_ of the eighteenth\ncentury did before him, and left a young wife of two-and-twenty to her\nown devices. He had deeply offended that wife, and in her nature there\nwas one appalling characteristic--she would never forgive an offence\nwhen woman’s vanity and self-love, with all that was best in her nature\nperhaps, had been slighted, wounded in secret. Insult and injury in the\nface of the world a woman loves to forget; there is a way open to her of\nshowing herself great; she is a woman in her forgiveness; but a secret\noffence women never pardon; for secret baseness, as for hidden virtues\nand hidden love, they have no kindness.\n\nThis was Mme la Duchesse de Langeais’ real position, unknown to the\nworld. She herself did not reflect upon it. It was the time of the\nrejoicings over the Duc de Berri’s marriage. The Court and the Faubourg\nroused itself from its listlessness and reserve. This was the real\nbeginning of that unheard-of splendour which the Government of the\nRestoration carried too far. At that time the Duchess, whether for\nreasons of her own, or from vanity, never appeared in public without a\nfollowing of women equally distinguished by name and fortune. As queen\nof fashion she had her _dames d’atours_, her ladies, who modeled their\nmanner and their wit on hers. They had been cleverly chosen. None of her\nsatellites belonged to the inmost Court circle, nor to the highest\nlevel of the Faubourg Saint-Germain; but they had set their minds upon\nadmission to those inner sanctuaries. Being as yet simple denominations,\nthey wished to rise to the neighbourhood of the throne, and mingle with\nthe seraphic powers in the high sphere known as _le petit chateau_. Thus\nsurrounded, the Duchess’s position was stronger and more commanding and\nsecure. Her “ladies” defended her character and helped her to play her\ndetestable part of a woman of fashion. She could laugh at men at her\nease, play with fire, receive the homage on which the feminine nature is\nnourished, and remain mistress of herself.\n\nAt Paris, in the highest society of all, a woman is a woman still; she\nlives on incense, adulation, and honours. No beauty, however undoubted,\nno face, however fair, is anything without admiration. Flattery and\na lover are proofs of power. And what is power without recognition?\nNothing. If the prettiest of women were left alone in a corner of a\ndrawing-room, she would droop. Put her in the very centre and summit of\nsocial grandeur, she will at once aspire to reign over all hearts--often\nbecause it is out of her power to be the happy queen of one. Dress and\nmanner and coquetry are all meant to please one of the poorest creatures\nextant--the brainless coxcomb, whose handsome face is his sole merit;\nit was for such as these that women threw themselves away. The gilded\nwooden idols of the Restoration, for they were neither more nor less,\nhad neither the antecedents of the _petits maitres_ of the time of the\nFronde, nor the rough sterling worth of Napoleon’s heroes, not the wit\nand fine manners of their grandsires; but something of all three they\nmeant to be without any trouble to themselves. Brave they were, like\nall young Frenchmen; ability they possessed, no doubt, if they had had\na chance of proving it, but their places were filled up by the old\nworn-out men, who kept them in leading strings. It was a day of\nsmall things, a cold prosaic era. Perhaps it takes a long time for a\nRestoration to become a Monarchy.\n\nFor the past eighteen months the Duchesse de Langeais had been leading\nthis empty life, filled with balls and subsequent visits, objectless\ntriumphs, and the transient loves that spring up and die in an evening’s\nspace. All eyes were turned on her when she entered a room; she reaped\nher harvest of flatteries and some few words of warmer admiration, which\nshe encouraged by a gesture or a glance, but never suffered to penetrate\ndeeper than the skin. Her tone and bearing and everything else about her\nimposed her will upon others. Her life was a sort of fever of vanity\nand perpetual enjoyment, which turned her head. She was daring enough in\nconversation; she would listen to anything, corrupting the surface, as\nit were, of her heart. Yet when she returned home, she often blushed at\nthe story that had made her laugh; at the scandalous tale that supplied\nthe details, on the strength of which she analyzed the love that she had\nnever known, and marked the subtle distinctions of modern passion, not\nwith comment on the part of complacent hypocrites. For women know how\nto say everything among themselves, and more of them are ruined by each\nother than corrupted by men.\n\nThere came a moment when she discerned that not until a woman is loved\nwill the world fully recognise her beauty and her wit. What does a\nhusband prove? Simply that a girl or woman was endowed with wealth, or\nwell brought up; that her mother managed cleverly that in some way she\nsatisfied a man’s ambitions. A lover constantly bears witness to her\npersonal perfections. Then followed the discovery still in Mme de\nLangeais’ early womanhood, that it was possible to be loved without\ncommitting herself, without permission, without vouchsafing any\nsatisfaction beyond the most meagre dues. There was more than one demure\nfeminine hypocrite to instruct her in the art of playing such dangerous\ncomedies.\n\nSo the Duchess had her court, and the number of her adorers and\ncourtiers guaranteed her virtue. She was amiable and fascinating; she\nflirted till the ball or the evening’s gaiety was at an end. Then the\ncurtain dropped. She was cold, indifferent, self-contained again till\nthe next day brought its renewed sensations, superficial as before. Two\nor three men were completely deceived, and fell in love in earnest.\nShe laughed at them, she was utterly insensible. “I am loved!” she told\nherself. “He loves me!” The certainty sufficed her. It is enough for the\nmiser to know that his every whim might be fulfilled if he chose; so it\nwas with the Duchess, and perhaps she did not even go so far as to form\na wish.\n\nOne evening she chanced to be at the house of an intimate friend Mme la\nVicomtesse de Fontaine, one of the humble rivals who cordially detested\nher, and went with her everywhere. In a “friendship” of this sort both\nsides are on their guard, and never lay their armor aside; confidences\nare ingeniously indiscreet, and not unfrequently treacherous. Mme de\nLangeais had distributed her little patronizing, friendly, or freezing\nbows, with the air natural to a woman who knows the worth of her smiles,\nwhen her eyes fell upon a total stranger. Something in the man’s large\ngravity of aspect startled her, and, with a feeling almost like dread,\nshe turned to Mme de Maufrigneuse with, “Who is the newcomer, dear?”\n\n“Someone that you have heard of, no doubt. The Marquis de Montriveau.”\n\n“Oh! is it he?”\n\nShe took up her eyeglass and submitted him to a very insolent scrutiny,\nas if he had been a picture meant to receive glances, not to return\nthem.\n\n“Do introduce him; he ought to be interesting.”\n\n“Nobody more tiresome and dull, dear. But he is the fashion.”\n\nM. Armand de Montriveau, at that moment all unwittingly the object of\ngeneral curiosity, better deserved attention than any of the idols that\nParis needs must set up to worship for a brief space, for the city is\nvexed by periodical fits of craving, a passion for _engouement_ and sham\nenthusiasm, which must be satisfied. The Marquis was the only son of\nGeneral de Montriveau, one of the _ci-devants_ who served the Republic\nnobly, and fell by Joubert’s side at Novi. Bonaparte had placed his son\nat the school at Chalons, with the orphans of other generals who fell\non the battlefield, leaving their children under the protection of the\nRepublic. Armand de Montriveau left school with his way to make, entered\nthe artillery, and had only reached a major’s rank at the time of the\nFontainebleau disaster. In his section of the service the chances of\nadvancement were not many. There are fewer officers, in the first place,\namong the gunners than in any other corps; and in the second place, the\nfeeling in the artillery was decidedly Liberal, not to say Republican;\nand the Emperor, feeling little confidence in a body of highly educated\nmen who were apt to think for themselves, gave promotion grudgingly in\nthe service. In the artillery, accordingly, the general rule of the\narmy did not apply; the commanding officers were not invariably the most\nremarkable men in their department, because there was less to be feared\nfrom mediocrities. The artillery was a separate corps in those days, and\nonly came under Napoleon in action.\n\nBesides these general causes, other reasons, inherent in Armand de\nMontriveau’s character, were sufficient in themselves to account for his\ntardy promotion. He was alone in the world. He had been thrown at\nthe age of twenty into the whirlwind of men directed by Napoleon; his\ninterests were bounded by himself, any day he might lose his life; it\nbecame a habit of mind with him to live by his own self-respect and\nthe consciousness that he had done his duty. Like all shy men, he was\nhabitually silent; but his shyness sprang by no means from timidity;\nit was a kind of modesty in him; he found any demonstration of vanity\nintolerable. There was no sort of swagger about his fearlessness in\naction; nothing escaped his eyes; he could give sensible advice to his\nchums with unshaken coolness; he could go under fire, and duck upon\noccasion to avoid bullets. He was kindly; but his expression was haughty\nand stern, and his face gained him this character. In everything he was\nrigorous as arithmetic; he never permitted the slightest deviation from\nduty on any plausible pretext, nor blinked the consequences of a fact.\nHe would lend himself to nothing of which he was ashamed; he never asked\nanything for himself; in short, Armand de Montriveau was one of many\ngreat men unknown to fame, and philosophical enough to despise it;\nliving without attaching themselves to life, because they have not found\ntheir opportunity of developing to the full their power to do and feel.\n\nPeople were afraid of Montriveau; they respected him, but he was not\nvery popular. Men may indeed allow you to rise above them, but to\ndecline to descend as low as they can do is the one unpardonable sin.\nIn their feeling towards loftier natures, there is a trace of hate and\nfear. Too much honour with them implies censure of themselves, a thing\nforgiven neither to the living nor to the dead.\n\nAfter the Emperor’s farewells at Fontainebleau, Montriveau, noble though\nhe was, was put on half-pay. Perhaps the heads of the War Office took\nfright at uncompromising uprightness worthy of antiquity, or perhaps it\nwas known that he felt bound by his oath to the Imperial Eagle. During\nthe Hundred Days he was made a Colonel of the Guard, and left on the\nfield of Waterloo. His wounds kept him in Belgium he was not present\nat the disbanding of the Army of the Loire, but the King’s government\ndeclined to recognise promotion made during the Hundred Days, and Armand\nde Montriveau left France.\n\nAn adventurous spirit, a loftiness of thought hitherto satisfied by\nthe hazards of war, drove him on an exploring expedition through Upper\nEgypt; his sanity or impulse directed his enthusiasm to a project of\ngreat importance, he turned his attention to that unexplored Central\nAfrica which occupies the learned of today. The scientific expedition\nwas long and unfortunate. He had made a valuable collection of notes\nbearing on various geographical and commercial problems, of which\nsolutions are still eagerly sought; and succeeded, after surmounting\nmany obstacles, in reaching the heart of the continent, when he was\nbetrayed into the hands of a hostile native tribe. Then, stripped of all\nthat he had, for two years he led a wandering life in the desert,\nthe slave of savages, threatened with death at every moment, and more\ncruelly treated than a dumb animal in the power of pitiless children.\nPhysical strength, and a mind braced to endurance, enabled him to\nsurvive the horrors of that captivity; but his miraculous escape\nwell-nigh exhausted his energies. When he reached the French colony at\nSenegal, a half-dead fugitive covered with rags, his memories of his\nformer life were dim and shapeless. The great sacrifices made in his\ntravels were all forgotten like his studies of African dialects, his\ndiscoveries, and observations. One story will give an idea of all that\nhe passed through. Once for several days the children of the sheikh of\nthe tribe amused themselves by putting him up for a mark and flinging\nhorses’ knuckle-bones at his head.\n\nMontriveau came back to Paris in 1818 a ruined man. He had no interest,\nand wished for none. He would have died twenty times over sooner than\nask a favour of anyone; he would not even press the recognition of his\nclaims. Adversity and hardship had developed his energy even in trifles,\nwhile the habit of preserving his self-respect before that spiritual\nself which we call conscience led him to attach consequence to the most\napparently trivial actions. His merits and adventures became known,\nhowever, through his acquaintances, among the principal men of science\nin Paris, and some few well-read military men. The incidents of his\nslavery and subsequent escape bore witness to a courage, intelligence,\nand coolness which won him celebrity without his knowledge, and that\ntransient fame of which Paris salons are lavish, though the artist that\nfain would keep it must make untold efforts.\n\nMontriveau’s position suddenly changed towards the end of that year. He\nhad been a poor man, he was now rich; or, externally at any rate, he had\nall the advantages of wealth. The King’s government, trying to attach\ncapable men to itself and to strengthen the army, made concessions\nabout that time to Napoleon’s old officers if their known loyalty and\ncharacter offered guarantees of fidelity. M. de Montriveau’s name once\nmore appeared in the army list with the rank of colonel; he received his\narrears of pay and passed into the Guards. All these favours, one\nafter another, came to seek the Marquis de Montriveau; he had asked\nfor nothing however small. Friends had taken the steps for him which he\nwould have refused to take for himself.\n\nAfter this, his habits were modified all at once; contrary to his\ncustom, he went into society. He was well received, everywhere he met\nwith great deference and respect. He seemed to have found some end\nin life; but everything passed within the man, there were no external\nsigns; in society he was silent and cold, and wore a grave, reserved\nface. His social success was great, precisely because he stood out in\nsuch strong contrast to the conventional faces which line the walls\nof Paris salons. He was, indeed, something quite new there. Terse\nof speech, like a hermit or a savage, his shyness was thought to be\nhaughtiness, and people were greatly taken with it. He was something\nstrange and great. Women generally were so much the more smitten\nwith this original person because he was not to be caught by their\nflatteries, however adroit, nor by the wiles with which they circumvent\nthe strongest men and corrode the steel temper. Their Parisian’s\ngrimaces were lost upon M. de Montriveau; his nature only responded to\nthe sonorous vibration of lofty thought and feeling. And he would very\npromptly have been dropped but for the romance that hung about his\nadventures and his life; but for the men who cried him up behind his\nback; but for a woman who looked for a triumph for her vanity, the woman\nwho was to fill his thoughts.\n\nFor these reasons the Duchesse de Langeais’ curiosity was no less lively\nthan natural. Chance had so ordered it that her interest in the man\nbefore her had been aroused only the day before, when she heard the\nstory of one of M. de Montriveau’s adventures, a story calculated to\nmake the strongest impression upon a woman’s ever-changing fancy.\n\nDuring M. de Montriveau’s voyage of discovery to the sources of the\nNile, he had had an argument with one of his guides, surely the most\nextraordinary debate in the annals of travel. The district that he\nwished to explore could only be reached on foot across a tract of\ndesert. Only one of his guides knew the way; no traveller had penetrated\nbefore into that part of the country, where the undaunted officer hoped\nto find a solution of several scientific problems. In spite of the\nrepresentations made to him by the guide and the older men of the place,\nhe started upon the formidable journey. Summoning up courage, already\nhighly strung by the prospect of dreadful difficulties, he set out in\nthe morning.\n\nThe loose sand shifted under his feet at every step; and when, at the\nend of a long day’s march, he lay down to sleep on the ground, he had\nnever been so tired in his life. He knew, however, that he must be up\nand on his way before dawn next day, and his guide assured him that they\nshould reach the end of their journey towards noon. That promise kept\nup his courage and gave him new strength. In spite of his sufferings,\nhe continued his march, with some blasphemings against science; he was\nashamed to complain to his guide, and kept his pain to himself. After\nmarching for a third of the day, he felt his strength failing, his feet\nwere bleeding, he asked if they should reach the place soon. “In an\nhour’s time,” said the guide. Armand braced himself for another hour’s\nmarch, and they went on.\n\nThe hour slipped by; he could not so much as see against the sky the\npalm-trees and crests of hill that should tell of the end of the journey\nnear at hand; the horizon line of sand was vast as the circle of the\nopen sea.\n\nHe came to a stand, refused to go farther, and threatened the guide--he\nhad deceived him, murdered him; tears of rage and weariness flowed over\nhis fevered cheeks; he was bowed down with fatigue upon fatigue, his\nthroat seemed to be glued by the desert thirst. The guide meanwhile\nstood motionless, listening to these complaints with an ironical\nexpression, studying the while, with the apparent indifference of an\nOriental, the scarcely perceptible indications in the lie of the sands,\nwhich looked almost black, like burnished gold.\n\n“I have made a mistake,” he remarked coolly. “I could not make out the\ntrack, it is so long since I came this way; we are surely on it now, but\nwe must push on for two hours.”\n\n“The man is right,” thought M. de Montriveau.\n\nSo he went on again, struggling to follow the pitiless native. It seemed\nas if he were bound to his guide by some thread like the invisible tie\nbetween the condemned man and the headsman. But the two hours went by,\nMontriveau had spent his last drops of energy, and the skyline was a\nblank, there were no palm-trees, no hills. He could neither cry out\nnor groan, he lay down on the sand to die, but his eyes would have\nfrightened the boldest; something in his face seemed to say that he\nwould not die alone. His guide, like a very fiend, gave him back a cool\nglance like a man that knows his power, left him to lie there, and kept\nat a safe distance out of reach of his desperate victim. At last M.\nMontriveau recovered strength enough for a last curse. The guide came\nnearer, silenced him with a steady look, and said, “Was it not your own\nwill to go where I am taking you, in spite of us all? You say that I\nhave lied to you. If I had not, you would not be even here. Do you want\nthe truth? Here it is. _We have still another five hours’ march before\nus, and we cannot go back_. Sound yourself; if you have not courage\nenough, here is my dagger.”\n\nStartled by this dreadful knowledge of pain and human strength, M.\nde Montriveau would not be behind a savage; he drew a fresh stock of\ncourage from his pride as a European, rose to his feet, and followed\nhis guide. The five hours were at an end, and still M. de Montriveau\nsaw nothing, he turned his failing eyes upon his guide; but the Nubian\nhoisted him on his shoulders, and showed him a wide pool of water with\ngreenness all about it, and a noble forest lighted up by the sunset. It\nlay only a hundred paces away; a vast ledge of granite hid the glorious\nlandscape. It seemed to Armand that he had taken a new lease of life.\nHis guide, that giant in courage and intelligence, finished his work of\ndevotion by carrying him across the hot, slippery, scarcely discernible\ntrack on the granite. Behind him lay the hell of burning sand, before\nhim the earthly paradise of the most beautiful oasis in the desert.\n\nThe Duchess, struck from the first by the appearance of this romantic\nfigure, was even more impressed when she learned that this was that\nMarquis de Montriveau of whom she had dreamed during the night. She had\nbeen with him among the hot desert sands, he had been the companion of\nher nightmare wanderings; for such a woman was not this a delightful\npresage of a new interest in her life? And never was a man’s exterior\na better exponent of his character; never were curious glances so well\njustified. The principal characteristic of his great, square-hewn head\nwas the thick, luxuriant black hair which framed his face, and gave him\na strikingly close resemblance to General Kleber; and the likeness still\nheld good in the vigorous forehead, in the outlines of his face, the\nquiet fearlessness of his eyes, and a kind of fiery vehemence expressed\nby strongly marked features. He was short, deep-chested, and muscular\nas a lion. There was something of the despot about him, and an\nindescribable suggestion of the security of strength in his gait,\nbearing, and slightest movements. He seemed to know that his will was\nirresistible, perhaps because he wished for nothing unjust. And yet,\nlike all really strong men, he was mild of speech, simple in his\nmanners, and kindly natured; although it seemed as if, in the stress of\na great crisis, all these finer qualities must disappear, and the man\nwould show himself implacable, unshaken in his resolve, terrific in\naction. There was a certain drawing in of the inner line of the lips\nwhich, to a close observer, indicated an ironical bent.\n\nThe Duchesse de Langeais, realising that a fleeting glory was to be\nwon by such a conquest, made up her mind to gain a lover in Armand de\nMontriveau during the brief interval before the Duchesse de Maufrigneuse\nbrought him to be introduced. She would prefer him above the others; she\nwould attach him to herself, display all her powers of coquetry for him.\nIt was a fancy, such a merest Duchess’s whim as furnished a Lope or a\nCalderon with the plot of the _Dog in the Manger_. She would not suffer\nanother woman to engross him; but she had not the remotest intention of\nbeing his.\n\nNature had given the Duchess every qualification for the part of\ncoquette, and education had perfected her. Women envied her, and men\nfell in love with her, not without reason. Nothing that can inspire\nlove, justify it, and give it lasting empire was wanting in her. Her\nstyle of beauty, her manner, her voice, her bearing, all combined to\ngive her that instinctive coquetry which seems to be the consciousness\nof power. Her shape was graceful; perhaps there was a trace of\nself-consciousness in her changes of movement, the one affectation that\ncould be laid to her charge; but everything about her was a part of her\npersonality, from her least little gesture to the peculiar turn of her\nphrases, the demure glance of her eyes. Her great lady’s grace, her\nmost striking characteristic, had not destroyed the very French quick\nmobility of her person. There was an extraordinary fascination in her\nswift, incessant changes of attitude. She seemed as if she surely would\nbe a most delicious mistress when her corset and the encumbering costume\nof her part were laid aside. All the rapture of love surely was latent\nin the freedom of her expressive glances, in her caressing tones, in the\ncharm of her words. She gave glimpses of the high-born courtesan within\nher, vainly protesting against the creeds of the duchess.\n\nYou might sit near her through an evening, she would be gay and\nmelancholy in turn, and her gaiety, like her sadness, seemed\nspontaneous. She could be gracious, disdainful, insolent, or confiding\nat will. Her apparent good nature was real; she had no temptation to\ndescend to malignity. But at each moment her mood changed; she was full\nof confidence or craft; her moving tenderness would give place to a\nheart-breaking hardness and insensibility. Yet how paint her as she\nwas, without bringing together all the extremes of feminine nature? In\na word, the Duchess was anything that she wished to be or to seem.\nHer face was slightly too long. There was a grace in it, and a certain\nthinness and fineness that recalled the portraits of the Middle Ages.\nHer skin was white, with a faint rose tint. Everything about her erred,\nas it were, by an excess of delicacy.\n\nM. de Montriveau willingly consented to be introduced to the Duchesse\nde Langeais; and she, after the manner of persons whose sensitive taste\nleads them to avoid banalities, refrained from overwhelming him with\nquestions and compliments. She received him with a gracious deference\nwhich could not fail to flatter a man of more than ordinary powers,\nfor the fact that a man rises above the ordinary level implies that\nhe possesses something of that tact which makes women quick to read\nfeeling. If the Duchess showed any curiosity, it was by her glances;\nher compliments were conveyed in her manner; there was a winning grace\ndisplayed in her words, a subtle suggestion of a desire to please which\nshe of all women knew the art of manifesting. Yet her whole conversation\nwas but, in a manner, the body of the letter; the postscript with the\nprincipal thought in it was still to come. After half an hour spent in\nordinary talk, in which the words gained all their value from her tone\nand smiles, M. de Montriveau was about to retire discreetly, when the\nDuchess stopped him with an expressive gesture.\n\n“I do not know, monsieur, whether these few minutes during which I have\nhad the pleasure of talking to you proved so sufficiently attractive,\nthat I may venture to ask you to call upon me; I am afraid that it may\nbe very selfish of me to wish to have you all to myself. If I should\nbe so fortunate as to find that my house is agreeable to you, you will\nalways find me at home in the evening until ten o’clock.”\n\nThe invitation was given with such irresistible grace, that M. de\nMontriveau could not refuse to accept it. When he fell back again among\nthe groups of men gathered at a distance from the women, his\nfriends congratulated him, half laughingly, half in earnest, on the\nextraordinary reception vouchsafed him by the Duchesse de Langeais. The\ndifficult and brilliant conquest had been made beyond a doubt, and the\nglory of it was reserved for the Artillery of the Guard. It is easy to\nimagine the jests, good and bad, when this topic had once been started;\nthe world of Paris salons is so eager for amusement, and a joke lasts\nfor such a short time, that everyone is eager to make the most of it\nwhile it is fresh.\n\nAll unconsciously, the General felt flattered by this nonsense. From his\nplace where he had taken his stand, his eyes were drawn again and again\nto the Duchess by countless wavering reflections. He could not help\nadmitting to himself that of all the women whose beauty had captivated\nhis eyes, not one had seemed to be a more exquisite embodiment of faults\nand fair qualities blended in a completeness that might realise the\ndreams of earliest manhood. Is there a man in any rank of life that has\nnot felt indefinable rapture in his secret soul over the woman singled\nout (if only in his dreams) to be his own; when she, in body, soul, and\nsocial aspects, satisfies his every requirement, a thrice perfect woman?\nAnd if this threefold perfection that flatters his pride is no argument\nfor loving her, it is beyond cavil one of the great inducements to the\nsentiment. Love would soon be convalescent, as the eighteenth century\nmoralist remarked, were it not for vanity. And it is certainly true\nthat for everyone, man or woman, there is a wealth of pleasure in\nthe superiority of the beloved. Is she set so high by birth that a\ncontemptuous glance can never wound her? is she wealthy enough to\nsurround herself with state which falls nothing short of royalty, of\nkings, of finance during their short reign of splendour? is she so\nready-witted that a keen-edged jest never brings her into confusion?\nbeautiful enough to rival any woman?--Is it such a small thing to know\nthat your self-love will never suffer through her? A man makes these\nreflections in the twinkling of an eye. And how if, in the future opened\nout by early ripened passion, he catches glimpses of the changeful\ndelight of her charm, the frank innocence of a maiden soul, the perils\nof love’s voyage, the thousand folds of the veil of coquetry? Is not\nthis enough to move the coldest man’s heart?\n\nThis, therefore, was M. de Montriveau’s position with regard to woman;\nhis past life in some measure explaining the extraordinary fact. He\nhad been thrown, when little more than a boy, into the hurricane of\nNapoleon’s wars; his life had been spent on fields of battle. Of women\nhe knew just so much as a traveller knows of a country when he travels\nacross it in haste from one inn to another. The verdict which Voltaire\npassed upon his eighty years of life might, perhaps, have been applied\nby Montriveau to his own thirty-seven years of existence; had he not\nthirty-seven follies with which to reproach himself? At his age he was\nas much a novice in love as the lad that has just been furtively reading\n_Faublas_. Of women he had nothing to learn; of love he knew nothing;\nand thus, desires, quite unknown before, sprang from this virginity of\nfeeling.\n\nThere are men here and there as much engrossed in the work demanded of\nthem by poverty or ambition, art or science, as M. de Montriveau by war\nand a life of adventure--these know what it is to be in this unusual\nposition if they very seldom confess to it. Every man in Paris is\nsupposed to have been in love. No woman in Paris cares to take what\nother women have passed over. The dread of being taken for a fool is the\nsource of the coxcomb’s bragging so common in France; for in France to\nhave the reputation of a fool is to be a foreigner in one’s own country.\nVehement desire seized on M. de Montriveau, desire that had gathered\nstrength from the heat of the desert and the first stirrings of a heart\nunknown as yet in its suppressed turbulence.\n\nA strong man, and violent as he was strong, he could keep mastery over\nhimself; but as he talked of indifferent things, he retired within\nhimself, and swore to possess this woman, for through that thought lay\nthe only way to love for him. Desire became a solemn compact made with\nhimself, an oath after the manner of the Arabs among whom he had lived;\nfor among them a vow is a kind of contract made with Destiny a man’s\nwhole future is solemnly pledged to fulfil it, and everything even his\nown death, is regarded simply as a means to the one end.\n\nA younger man would have said to himself, “I should very much like to\nhave the Duchess for my mistress!” or, “If the Duchesse de Langeais\ncared for a man, he would be a very lucky rascal!” But the General said,\n“I will have Mme de Langeais for my mistress.” And if a man takes such\nan idea into his head when his heart has never been touched before, and\nlove begins to be a kind of religion with him, he little knows in what a\nhell he has set his foot.\n\nArmand de Montriveau suddenly took flight and went home in the first hot\nfever-fit of the first love that he had known. When a man has kept all\nhis boyish beliefs, illusions, frankness, and impetuosity into middle\nage, his first impulse is, as it were, to stretch out a hand to take the\nthing that he desires; a little later he realizes that there is a gulf\nset between them, and that it is all but impossible to cross it. A sort\nof childish impatience seizes him, he wants the thing the more,\nand trembles or cries. Wherefore, the next day, after the stormiest\nreflections that had yet perturbed his mind, Armand de Montriveau\ndiscovered that he was under the yoke of the senses, and his bondage\nmade the heavier by his love.\n\nThe woman so cavalierly treated in his thoughts of yesterday had become\na most sacred and dreadful power. She was to be his world, his life,\nfrom this time forth. The greatest joy, the keenest anguish, that he\nhad yet known grew colorless before the bare recollection of the least\nsensation stirred in him by her. The swiftest revolutions in a man’s\noutward life only touch his interests, while passion brings a complete\nrevulsion of feeling. And so in those who live by feeling, rather than\nby self-interest, the doers rather than the reasoners, the sanguine\nrather than the lymphatic temperaments, love works a complete\nrevolution. In a flash, with one single reflection, Armand de Montriveau\nwiped out his whole past life.\n\nA score of times he asked himself, like a boy, “Shall I go, or shall I\nnot?” and then at last he dressed, came to the Hotel de Langeais\ntowards eight o’clock that evening, and was admitted. He was to see the\nwoman--ah! not the woman--the idol that he had seen yesterday, among\nlights, a fresh innocent girl in gauze and silken lace and veiling.\nHe burst in upon her to declare his love, as if it were a question of\nfiring the first shot on a field of battle.\n\nPoor novice! He found his ethereal sylphide shrouded in a brown cashmere\ndressing-gown ingeniously befrilled, lying languidly stretched out upon\na sofa in a dimly lighted boudoir. Mme de Langeais did not so much as\nrise, nothing was visible of her but her face, her hair was loose but\nconfined by a scarf. A hand indicated a seat, a hand that seemed white\nas marble to Montriveau by the flickering light of a single candle at\nthe further side of the room, and a voice as soft as the light said:\n\n“If it had been anyone else, M. le Marquis, a friend with whom I could\ndispense with ceremony, or a mere acquaintance in whom I felt but slight\ninterest, I should have closed my door. I am exceedingly unwell.”\n\n“I will go,” Armand said to himself.\n\n“But I do not know how it is,” she continued (and the simple warrior\nattributed the shining of her eyes to fever), “perhaps it was a\npresentiment of your kind visit (and no one can be more sensible of the\nprompt attention than I), but the vapors have left my head.”\n\n“Then may I stay?”\n\n“Oh, I should be very sorry to allow you to go. I told myself this\nmorning that it was impossible that I should have made the slightest\nimpression on your mind, and that in all probability you took my request\nfor one of the commonplaces of which Parisians are lavish on every\noccasion. And I forgave your ingratitude in advance. An explorer\nfrom the deserts is not supposed to know how exclusive we are in our\nfriendships in the Faubourg.”\n\nThe gracious, half-murmured words dropped one by one, as if they had\nbeen weighted with the gladness that apparently brought them to her\nlips. The Duchess meant to have the full benefit of her headache, and\nher speculation was fully successful. The General, poor man, was really\ndistressed by the lady’s simulated distress. Like Crillon listening to\nthe story of the Crucifixion, he was ready to draw his sword against the\nvapors. How could a man dare to speak just then to this suffering woman\nof the love that she inspired? Armand had already felt that it would be\nabsurd to fire off a declaration of love point-blank at one so far above\nother women. With a single thought came understanding of the delicacies\nof feeling, of the soul’s requirements. To love: what was that but to\nknow how to plead, to beg for alms, to wait? And as for the love that\nhe felt, must he not prove it? His tongue was mute, it was frozen by the\nconventions of the noble Faubourg, the majesty of a sick headache, the\nbashfulness of love. But no power on earth could veil his glances; the\nheat and the Infinite of the desert blazed in eyes calm as a panther’s,\nbeneath the lids that fell so seldom. The Duchess enjoyed the steady\ngaze that enveloped her in light and warmth.\n\n“Mme la Duchesse,” he answered, “I am afraid I express my gratitude for\nyour goodness very badly. At this moment I have but one desire--I wish\nit were in my power to cure the pain.”\n\n“Permit me to throw this off, I feel too warm now,” she said, gracefully\ntossing aside a cushion that covered her feet.\n\n“Madame, in Asia your feet would be worth some ten thousand sequins.\n\n“A traveler’s compliment!” smiled she.\n\nIt pleased the sprightly lady to involve a rough soldier in a labyrinth\nof nonsense, commonplaces, and meaningless talk, in which he manoeuvred,\nin military language, as Prince Charles might have done at close\nquarters with Napoleon. She took a mischievous amusement in\nreconnoitring the extent of his infatuation by the number of foolish\nspeeches extracted from a novice whom she led step by step into a\nhopeless maze, meaning to leave him there in confusion. She began by\nlaughing at him, but nevertheless it pleased her to make him forget how\ntime went.\n\nThe length of a first visit is frequently a compliment, but Armand was\ninnocent of any such intent. The famous explorer spent an hour in chat\non all sorts of subjects, said nothing that he meant to say, and was\nfeeling that he was only an instrument on whom this woman played, when\nshe rose, sat upright, drew the scarf from her hair, and wrapped it\nabout her throat, leant her elbow on the cushions, did him the honour\nof a complete cure, and rang for lights. The most graceful movement\nsucceeded to complete repose. She turned to M. de Montriveau, from whom\nshe had just extracted a confidence which seemed to interest her deeply,\nand said:\n\n“You wish to make game of me by trying to make me believe that you\nhave never loved. It is a man’s great pretension with us. And we always\nbelieve it! Out of pure politeness. Do we not know what to expect\nfrom it for ourselves? Where is the man that has found but a single\nopportunity of losing his heart? But you love to deceive us, and we\nsubmit to be deceived, poor foolish creatures that we are; for your\nhypocrisy is, after all, a homage paid to the superiority of our\nsentiments, which are all purity.”\n\nThe last words were spoken with a disdainful pride that made the novice\nin love feel like a worthless bale flung into the deep, while the\nDuchess was an angel soaring back to her particular heaven.\n\n“Confound it!” thought Armand de Montriveau, “how am I to tell this wild\nthing that I love her?”\n\nHe had told her already a score of times; or rather, the Duchess had\na score of times read his secret in his eyes; and the passion in this\nunmistakably great man promised her amusement, and an interest in her\nempty life. So she prepared with no little dexterity to raise a certain\nnumber of redoubts for him to carry by storm before he should gain an\nentrance into her heart. Montriveau should overleap one difficulty after\nanother; he should be a plaything for her caprice, just as an insect\nteased by children is made to jump from one finger to another, and in\nspite of all its pains is kept in the same place by its mischievous\ntormentor. And yet it gave the Duchess inexpressible happiness to see\nthat this strong man had told her the truth. Armand had never loved, as\nhe had said. He was about to go, in a bad humour with himself, and still\nmore out of humour with her; but it delighted her to see a sullenness\nthat she could conjure away with a word, a glance, or a gesture.\n\n“Will you come tomorrow evening?” she asked. “I am going to a ball, but\nI shall stay at home for you until ten o’clock.”\n\nMontriveau spent most of the next day in smoking an indeterminate\nquantity of cigars in his study window, and so got through the hours\ntill he could dress and go to the Hotel de Langeais. To anyone who had\nknown the magnificent worth of the man, it would have been grievous to\nsee him grown so small, so distrustful of himself; the mind that might\nhave shed light over undiscovered worlds shrunk to the proportions of\na she-coxcomb’s boudoir. Even he himself felt that he had fallen so low\nalready in his happiness that to save his life he could not have told\nhis love to one of his closest friends. Is there not always a trace\nof shame in the lover’s bashfulness, and perhaps in woman a certain\nexultation over diminished masculine stature? Indeed, but for a host of\nmotives of this kind, how explain why women are nearly always the first\nto betray the secret?--a secret of which, perhaps, they soon weary.\n\n“Mme la Duchesse cannot see visitors, monsieur,” said the man; “she is\ndressing, she begs you to wait for her here.”\n\nArmand walked up and down the drawing-room, studying her taste in the\nleast details. He admired Mme de Langeais herself in the objects of her\nchoosing; they revealed her life before he could grasp her personality\nand ideas. About an hour later the Duchess came noiselessly out of her\nchamber. Montriveau turned, saw her flit like a shadow across the room,\nand trembled. She came up to him, not with a bourgeoise’s enquiry, “How\ndo I look?” She was sure of herself; her steady eyes said plainly, “I am\nadorned to please you.”\n\nNo one surely, save the old fairy godmother of some princess in\ndisguise, could have wound a cloud of gauze about the dainty throat, so\nthat the dazzling satin skin beneath should gleam through the gleaming\nfolds. The Duchess was dazzling. The pale blue colour of her gown,\nrepeated in the flowers in her hair, appeared by the richness of its hue\nto lend substance to a fragile form grown too wholly ethereal; for as\nshe glided towards Armand, the loose ends of her scarf floated about\nher, putting that valiant warrior in mind of the bright damosel flies\nthat hover now over water, now over the flowers with which they seem to\nmingle and blend.\n\n“I have kept you waiting,” she said, with the tone that a woman can\nalways bring into her voice for the man whom she wishes to please.\n\n“I would wait patiently through an eternity,” said he, “if I were sure\nof finding a divinity so fair; but it is no compliment to speak of your\nbeauty to you; nothing save worship could touch you. Suffer me only to\nkiss your scarf.”\n\n“Oh, fie!” she said, with a commanding gesture, “I esteem you enough to\ngive you my hand.”\n\nShe held it out for his kiss. A woman’s hand, still moist from the\nscented bath, has a soft freshness, a velvet smoothness that sends a\ntingling thrill from the lips to the soul. And if a man is attracted to\na woman, and his senses are as quick to feel pleasure as his heart is\nfull of love, such a kiss, though chaste in appearance, may conjure up a\nterrific storm.\n\n“Will you always give it me like this?” the General asked humbly when he\nhad pressed that dangerous hand respectfully to his lips.\n\n“Yes, but there we must stop,” she said, smiling. She sat down,\nand seemed very slow over putting on her gloves, trying to slip the\nunstretched kid over all her fingers at once, while she watched M.\nde Montriveau; and he was lost in admiration of the Duchess and those\nrepeated graceful movements of hers.\n\n“Ah! you were punctual,” she said; “that is right. I like punctuality.\nIt is the courtesy of kings, His Majesty says; but to my thinking, from\nyou men it is the most respectful flattery of all. Now, is it not? Just\ntell me.”\n\nAgain she gave him a side glance to express her insidious friendship,\nfor he was dumb with happiness sheer happiness through such nothings\nas these! Oh, the Duchess understood _son metier de femme_--the art\nand mystery of being a woman--most marvelously well; she knew, to\nadmiration, how to raise a man in his own esteem as he humbled himself\nto her; how to reward every step of the descent to sentimental folly\nwith hollow flatteries.\n\n“You will never forget to come at nine o’clock.”\n\n“No; but are you going to a ball every night?”\n\n“Do I know?” she answered, with a little childlike shrug of the\nshoulders; the gesture was meant to say that she was nothing if not\ncapricious, and that a lover must take her as she was.--“Besides,” she\nadded, “what is that to you? You shall be my escort.”\n\n“That would be difficult tonight,” he objected; “I am not properly\ndressed.”\n\n“It seems to me,” she returned loftily, “that if anyone has a right\nto complain of your costume, it is I. Know, therefore, _monsieur le\nvoyageur_, that if I accept a man’s arm, he is forthwith above the laws\nof fashion, nobody would venture to criticise him. You do not know the\nworld, I see; I like you the better for it.”\n\nAnd even as she spoke she swept him into the pettiness of that world by\nthe attempt to initiate him into the vanities of a woman of fashion.\n\n“If she chooses to do a foolish thing for me, I should be a simpleton to\nprevent her,” said Armand to himself. “She has a liking for me beyond a\ndoubt; and as for the world, she cannot despise it more than I do. So,\nnow for the ball if she likes.”\n\nThe Duchess probably thought that if the General came with her and\nappeared in a ballroom in boots and a black tie, nobody would hesitate\nto believe that he was violently in love with her. And the General was\nwell pleased that the queen of fashion should think of compromising\nherself for him; hope gave him wit. He had gained confidence, he brought\nout his thoughts and views; he felt nothing of the restraint that\nweighed on his spirits yesterday. His talk was interesting and animated,\nand full of those first confidences so sweet to make and to receive.\n\nWas Mme de Langeais really carried away by his talk, or had she\ndevised this charming piece of coquetry? At any rate, she looked up\nmischievously as the clock struck twelve.\n\n“Ah! you have made me too late for the ball!” she exclaimed, surprised\nand vexed that she had forgotten how time was going.\n\nThe next moment she approved the exchange of pleasures with a smile that\nmade Armand’s heart give a sudden leap.\n\n“I certainly promised Mme de Beauseant,” she added. “They are all\nexpecting me.”\n\n“Very well--go.”\n\n“No--go on. I will stay. Your Eastern adventures fascinate me. Tell\nme the whole story of your life. I love to share in a brave man’s\nhardships, and I feel them all, indeed I do!”\n\nShe was playing with her scarf, twisting it and pulling it to\npieces, with jerky, impatient movements that seemed to tell of inward\ndissatisfaction and deep reflection.\n\n“_We_ are fit for nothing,” she went on. “Ah! we are contemptible,\nselfish, frivolous creatures. We can bore ourselves with amusements,\nand that is all we can do. Not one of us that understands that she has\na part to play in life. In old days in France, women were beneficent\nlights; they lived to comfort those that mourned, to encourage high\nvirtues, to reward artists and stir new life with noble thoughts. If the\nworld has grown so petty, ours is the fault. You make me loathe the ball\nand this world in which I live. No, I am not giving up much for you.”\n\nShe had plucked her scarf to pieces, as a child plays with a flower,\npulling away all the petals one by one; and now she crushed it into a\nball, and flung it away. She could show her swan’s neck.\n\nShe rang the bell. “I shall not go out tonight,” she told the footman.\nHer long, blue eyes turned timidly to Armand; and by the look of\nmisgiving in them, he knew that he was meant to take the order for a\nconfession, for a first and great favour. There was a pause, filled with\nmany thoughts, before she spoke with that tenderness which is often in\nwomen’s voices, and not so often in their hearts. “You have had a hard\nlife,” she said.\n\n“No,” returned Armand. “Until today I did not know what happiness was.”\n\n“Then you know it now?” she asked, looking at him with a demure, keen\nglance.\n\n“What is happiness for me henceforth but this--to see you, to hear\nyou?... Until now I have only known privation; now I know that I can be\nunhappy----”\n\n“That will do, that will do,” she said. “You must go; it is past\nmidnight. Let us regard appearances. People must not talk about us. I\ndo not know quite what I shall say; but the headache is a good-natured\nfriend, and tells no tales.”\n\n“Is there to be a ball tomorrow night?”\n\n“You would grow accustomed to the life, I think. Very well. Yes, we will\ngo again tomorrow night.”\n\nThere was not a happier man in the world than Armand when he went out\nfrom her. Every evening he came to Mme de Langeais’ at the hour kept for\nhim by a tacit understanding.\n\nIt would be tedious, and, for the many young men who carry a redundance\nof such sweet memories in their hearts, it were superfluous to follow\nthe story step by step--the progress of a romance growing in those hours\nspent together, a romance controlled entirely by a woman’s will. If\nsentiment went too fast, she would raise a quarrel over a word, or when\nwords flagged behind her thoughts, she appealed to the feelings. Perhaps\nthe only way of following such Penelope’s progress is by marking its\noutward and visible signs.\n\nAs, for instance, within a few days of their first meeting, the\nassiduous General had won and kept the right to kiss his lady’s\ninsatiable hands. Wherever Mme de Langeais went, M. de Montriveau\nwas certain to be seen, till people jokingly called him “Her Grace’s\norderly.” And already he had made enemies; others were jealous, and\nenvied him his position. Mme de Langeais had attained her end. The\nMarquis de Montriveau was among her numerous train of adorers, and a\nmeans of humiliating those who boasted of their progress in her good\ngraces, for she publicly gave him preference over them all.\n\n“Decidedly, M. de Montriveau is the man for whom the Duchess shows a\npreference,” pronounced Mme de Serizy.\n\nAnd who in Paris does not know what it means when a woman “shows a\npreference?” All went on therefore according to prescribed rule. The\nanecdotes which people were pleased to circulate concerning the General\nput that warrior in so formidable a light, that the more adroit quietly\ndropped their pretensions to the Duchess, and remained in her train\nmerely to turn the position to account, and to use her name and\npersonality to make better terms for themselves with certain stars of\nthe second magnitude. And those lesser powers were delighted to take a\nlover away from Mme de Langeais. The Duchess was keen-sighted enough to\nsee these desertions and treaties with the enemy; and her pride would\nnot suffer her to be the dupe of them. As M. de Talleyrand, one of her\ngreat admirers, said, she knew how to take a second edition of revenge,\nlaying the two-edged blade of a sarcasm between the pairs in these\n“morganatic” unions. Her mocking disdain contributed not a little to\nincrease her reputation as an extremely clever woman and a person to\nbe feared. Her character for virtue was consolidated while she amused\nherself with other people’s secrets, and kept her own to herself. Yet,\nafter two months of assiduities, she saw with a vague dread in the\ndepths of her soul that M. de Montriveau understood nothing of the\nsubtleties of flirtation after the manner of the Faubourg Saint-Germain;\nhe was taking a Parisienne’s coquetry in earnest.\n\n“You will not tame _him_, dear Duchess,” the old Vidame de Pamiers had\nsaid. “‘Tis a first cousin to the eagle; he will carry you off to his\neyrie if you do not take care.”\n\nThen Mme de Langeais felt afraid. The shrewd old noble’s words sounded\nlike a prophecy. The next day she tried to turn love to hate. She was\nharsh, exacting, irritable, unbearable; Montriveau disarmed her with\nangelic sweetness. She so little knew the great generosity of a large\nnature, that the kindly jests with which her first complaints were met\nwent to her heart. She sought a quarrel, and found proofs of affection.\nShe persisted.\n\n“When a man idolizes you, how can he have vexed you?” asked Armand.\n\n“You do not vex me,” she answered, suddenly grown gentle and submissive.\n“But why do you wish to compromise me? For me you ought to be nothing\nbut a _friend_. Do you not know it? I wish I could see that you had the\ninstincts, the delicacy of real friendship, so that I might lose neither\nyour respect nor the pleasure that your presence gives me.”\n\n“Nothing but your _friend_!” he cried out. The terrible word sent an\nelectric shock through his brain. “On the faith of these happy hours\nthat you grant me, I sleep and wake in your heart. And now today, for no\nreason, you are pleased to destroy all the secret hopes by which I live.\nYou have required promises of such constancy in me, you have said so\nmuch of your horror of women made up of nothing but caprice; and now do\nyou wish me to understand that, like other women here in Paris, you have\npassions, and know nothing of love? If so, why did you ask my life of\nme? why did you accept it?”\n\n“I was wrong, my friend. Oh, it is wrong of a woman to yield to such\nintoxication when she must not and cannot make any return.”\n\n“I understand. You have merely been coquetting with me, and----”\n\n“Coquetting?” she repeated. “I detest coquetry. A coquette Armand, makes\npromises to many, and gives herself to none; and a woman who keeps such\npromises is a libertine. This much I believed I had grasped of our code.\nBut to be melancholy with humorists, gay with the frivolous, and politic\nwith ambitious souls; to listen to a babbler with every appearance\nof admiration, to talk of war with a soldier, wax enthusiastic with\nphilanthropists over the good of the nation, and to give to each one his\nlittle dole of flattery--it seems to me that this is as much a matter of\nnecessity as dress, diamonds, and gloves, or flowers in one’s hair. Such\ntalk is the moral counterpart of the toilette. You take it up and lay it\naside with the plumed head-dress. Do you call this coquetry? Why, I have\nnever treated you as I treat everyone else. With you, my friend, I am\nsincere. Have I not always shared your views, and when you convinced me\nafter a discussion, was I not always perfectly glad? In short, I love\nyou, but only as a devout and pure woman may love. I have thought it\nover. I am a married woman, Armand. My way of life with M. de Langeais\ngives me liberty to bestow my heart; but law and custom leave me no\nright to dispose of my person. If a woman loses her honour, she is\nan outcast in any rank of life; and I have yet to meet with a single\nexample of a man that realizes all that our sacrifices demand of him in\nsuch a case. Quite otherwise. Anyone can foresee the rupture between Mme\nde Beauseant and M. d’Ajuda (for he is going to marry Mlle de Rochefide,\nit seems), that affair made it clear to my mind that these very\nsacrifices on the woman’s part are almost always the cause of the man’s\ndesertion. If you had loved me sincerely, you would have kept away for a\ntime.--Now, I will lay aside all vanity for you; is not that something?\nWhat will not people say of a woman to whom no man attaches himself?\nOh, she is heartless, brainless, soulless; and what is more, devoid\nof charm! Coquettes will not spare me. They will rob me of the very\nqualities that mortify them. So long as my reputation is safe, what do I\ncare if my rivals deny my merits? They certainly will not inherit them.\nCome, my friend; give up something for her who sacrifices so much for\nyou. Do not come quite so often; I shall love you none the less.”\n\n“Ah!” said Armand, with the profound irony of a wounded heart in his\nwords and tone. “Love, so the scribblers say, only feeds on illusions.\nNothing could be truer, I see; I am expected to imagine that I am loved.\nBut, there!--there are some thoughts like wounds, from which there is no\nrecovery. My belief in you was one of the last left to me, and now I see\nthat there is nothing left to believe in this earth.”\n\nShe began to smile.\n\n“Yes,” Montriveau went on in an unsteady voice, “this Catholic faith to\nwhich you wish to convert me is a lie that men make for themselves; hope\nis a lie at the expense of the future; pride, a lie between us and our\nfellows; and pity, and prudence, and terror are cunning lies. And now\nmy happiness is to be one more lying delusion; I am expected to delude\nmyself, to be willing to give gold coin for silver to the end. If you\ncan so easily dispense with my visits; if you can confess me neither\nas your friend nor your lover, you do not care for me! And I, poor fool\nthat I am, tell myself this, and know it, and love you!”\n\n“But, dear me, poor Armand, you are flying into a passion!”\n\n“I flying into a passion?”\n\n“Yes. You think that the whole question is opened because I ask you to\nbe careful.”\n\nIn her heart of hearts she was delighted with the anger that leapt out\nin her lover’s eyes. Even as she tortured him, she was criticising\nhim, watching every slightest change that passed over his face. If\nthe General had been so unluckily inspired as to show himself generous\nwithout discussion (as happens occasionally with some artless souls),\nhe would have been a banished man forever, accused and convicted of not\nknowing how to love. Most women are not displeased to have their code of\nright and wrong broken through. Do they not flatter themselves that they\nnever yield except to force? But Armand was not learned enough in this\nkind of lore to see the snare ingeniously spread for him by the Duchess.\nSo much of the child was there in the strong man in love.\n\n“If all you want is to preserve appearances,” he began in his\nsimplicity, “I am willing to----”\n\n“Simply to preserve appearances!” the lady broke in; “why, what idea can\nyou have of me? Have I given you the slightest reason to suppose that I\ncan be yours?”\n\n“Why, what else are we talking about?” demanded Montriveau.\n\n“Monsieur, you frighten me!... No, pardon me. Thank you,” she added,\ncoldly; “thank you, Armand. You have given me timely warning of\nimprudence; committed quite unconsciously, believe it, my friend. You\nknow how to endure, you say. I also know how to endure. We will not\nsee each other for a time; and then, when both of us have contrived to\nrecover calmness to some extent, we will think about arrangements for\na happiness sanctioned by the world. I am young, Armand; a man with no\ndelicacy might tempt a woman of four-and-twenty to do many foolish, wild\nthings for his sake. But _you_! You will be my friend, promise me that\nyou will?”\n\n“The woman of four-and-twenty,” returned he, “knows what she is about.”\n\nHe sat down on the sofa in the boudoir, and leant his head on his hands.\n\n“Do you love me, madame?” he asked at length, raising his head, and\nturning a face full of resolution upon her. “Say it straight out; Yes or\nNo!”\n\nHis direct question dismayed the Duchess more than a threat of suicide\ncould have done; indeed, the woman of the nineteenth century is not to\nbe frightened by that stale stratagem, the sword has ceased to be part\nof the masculine costume. But in the effect of eyelids and lashes, in\nthe contraction of the gaze, in the twitching of the lips, is there not\nsome influence that communicates the terror which they express with such\nvivid magnetic power?\n\n“Ah, if I were free, if----”\n\n“Oh! is it only your husband that stands in the way?” the General\nexclaimed joyfully, as he strode to and fro in the boudoir. “Dear\nAntoinette, I wield a more absolute power than the Autocrat of all the\nRussias. I have a compact with Fate; I can advance or retard destiny,\nso far as men are concerned, at my fancy, as you alter the hands of a\nwatch. If you can direct the course of fate in our political machinery,\nit simply means (does it not?) that you understand the ins and outs of\nit. You shall be free before very long, and then you must remember your\npromise.”\n\n“Armand!” she cried. “What do you mean? Great heavens! Can you imagine\nthat I am to be the prize of a crime? Do you want to kill me? Why! you\ncannot have any religion in you! For my own part, I fear God. M. de\nLangeais may have given me reason to hate him, but I wish him no manner\nof harm.”\n\nM. de Montriveau beat a tattoo on the marble chimney-piece, and only\nlooked composedly at the lady.\n\n“Dear,” continued she, “respect him. He does not love me, he is not kind\nto me, but I have duties to fulfil with regard to him. What would I not\ndo to avert the calamities with which you threaten him?--Listen,” she\ncontinued after a pause, “I will not say another word about separation;\nyou shall come here as in the past, and I will still give you my\nforehead to kiss. If I refused once or twice, it was pure coquetry,\nindeed it was. But let us understand each other,” she added as he came\ncloser. “You will permit me to add to the number of my satellites; to\nreceive even more visitors in the morning than heretofore; I mean to be\ntwice as frivolous; I mean to use you to all appearance very badly;\nto feign a rupture; you must come not quite so often, and then,\nafterwards----”\n\nWhile she spoke, she had allowed him to put an arm about her waist,\nMontriveau was holding her tightly to him, and she seemed to feel the\nexceeding pleasure that women usually feel in that close contact, an\nearnest of the bliss of a closer union. And then, doubtless she meant to\nelicit some confidence, for she raised herself on tiptoe, and laid her\nforehead against Armand’s burning lips.\n\n“And then,” Montriveau finished her sentence for her, “you shall not\nspeak to me of your husband. You ought not to think of him again.”\n\nMme de Langeais was silent awhile.\n\n“At least,” she said, after a significant pause, “at least you will do\nall that I wish without grumbling, you will not be naughty; tell me so,\nmy friend? You wanted to frighten me, did you not? Come, now, confess\nit?... You are too good ever to think of crimes. But is it possible that\nyou can have secrets that I do not know? How can you control Fate?”\n\n“Now, when you confirm the gift of the heart that you have already given\nme, I am far too happy to know exactly how to answer you. I can trust\nyou, Antoinette; I shall have no suspicion, no unfounded jealousy of\nyou. But if accident should set you free, we shall be one----”\n\n“Accident, Armand?” (With that little dainty turn of the head that seems\nto say so many things, a gesture that such women as the Duchess can use\non light occasions, as a great singer can act with her voice.) “Pure\naccident,” she repeated. “Mind that. If anything should happen to M. de\nLangeais by your fault, I should never be yours.”\n\nAnd so they parted, mutually content. The Duchess had made a pact\nthat left her free to prove to the world by words and deeds that M. de\nMontriveau was no lover of hers. And as for him, the wily Duchess\nvowed to tire him out. He should have nothing of her beyond the little\nconcessions snatched in the course of contests that she could stop\nat her pleasure. She had so pretty an art of revoking the grant\nof yesterday, she was so much in earnest in her purpose to remain\ntechnically virtuous, that she felt that there was not the slightest\ndanger for her in preliminaries fraught with peril for a woman less sure\nof her self-command. After all, the Duchess was practically separated\nfrom her husband; a marriage long since annulled was no great sacrifice\nto make to her love.\n\nMontriveau on his side was quite happy to win the vaguest promise, glad\nonce for all to sweep aside, with all scruples of conjugal fidelity, her\nstock of excuses for refusing herself to his love. He had gained ground\na little, and congratulated himself. And so for a time he took unfair\nadvantage of the rights so hardly won. More a boy than he had ever been\nin his life, he gave himself up to all the childishness that makes first\nlove the flower of life. He was a child again as he poured out all\nhis soul, all the thwarted forces that passion had given him, upon her\nhands, upon the dazzling forehead that looked so pure to his eyes; upon\nher fair hair; on the tufted curls where his lips were pressed. And the\nDuchess, on whom his love was poured like a flood, was vanquished by\nthe magnetic influence of her lover’s warmth; she hesitated to begin\nthe quarrel that must part them forever. She was more a woman than she\nthought, this slight creature, in her effort to reconcile the demands\nof religion with the ever-new sensations of vanity, the semblance of\npleasure which turns a Parisienne’s head. Every Sunday she went to Mass;\nshe never missed a service; then, when evening came, she was steeped in\nthe intoxicating bliss of repressed desire. Armand and Mme de Langeais,\nlike Hindoo fakirs, found the reward of their continence in the\ntemptations to which it gave rise. Possibly, the Duchess had ended by\nresolving love into fraternal caresses, harmless enough, as it might\nhave seemed to the rest of the world, while they borrowed extremes\nof degradation from the license of her thoughts. How else explain the\nincomprehensible mystery of her continual fluctuations? Every morning\nshe proposed to herself to shut her door on the Marquis de Montriveau;\nevery evening, at the appointed hour, she fell under the charm of his\npresence. There was a languid defence; then she grew less unkind. Her\nwords were sweet and soothing. They were lovers--lovers only could have\nbeen thus. For him the Duchess would display her most sparkling wit, her\nmost captivating wiles; and when at last she had wrought upon his senses\nand his soul, she might submit herself passively to his fierce caresses,\nbut she had her _nec plus ultra_ of passion; and when once it was\nreached, she grew angry if he lost the mastery of himself and made\nas though he would pass beyond. No woman on earth can brave the\nconsequences of refusal without some motive; nothing is more natural\nthan to yield to love; wherefore Mme de Langeais promptly raised a\nsecond line of fortification, a stronghold less easy to carry than\nthe first. She evoked the terrors of religion. Never did Father of\nthe Church, however eloquent, plead the cause of God better than the\nDuchess. Never was the wrath of the Most High better justified than\nby her voice. She used no preacher’s commonplaces, no rhetorical\namplifications. No. She had a “pulpit-tremor” of her own. To Armand’s\nmost passionate entreaty, she replied with a tearful gaze, and a gesture\nin which a terrible plenitude of emotion found expression. She stopped\nhis mouth with an appeal for mercy. She would not hear another word; if\nshe did, she must succumb; and better death than criminal happiness.\n\n“Is it nothing to disobey God?” she asked him, recovering a voice grown\nfaint in the crises of inward struggles, through which the fair\nactress appeared to find it hard to preserve her self-control. “I would\nsacrifice society, I would give up the whole world for you, gladly; but\nit is very selfish of you to ask my whole after-life of me for a moment\nof pleasure. Come, now! are you not happy?” she added, holding out her\nhand; and certainly in her careless toilette the sight of her afforded\nconsolations to her lover, who made the most of them.\n\nSometimes from policy, to keep her hold on a man whose ardent passion\ngave her emotions unknown before, sometimes in weakness, she suffered\nhim to snatch a swift kiss; and immediately, in feigned terror, she\nflushed red and exiled Armand from the sofa so soon as the sofa became\ndangerous ground.\n\n“Your joys are sins for me to expiate, Armand; they are paid for by\npenitence and remorse,” she cried.\n\nAnd Montriveau, now at two chairs’ distance from that aristocratic\npetticoat, betook himself to blasphemy and railed against Providence.\nThe Duchess grew angry at such times.\n\n“My friend,” she said drily, “I do not understand why you decline to\nbelieve in God, for it is impossible to believe in man. Hush, do not\ntalk like that. You have too great a nature to take up their Liberal\nnonsense with its pretension to abolish God.”\n\nTheological and political disputes acted like a cold douche on\nMontriveau; he calmed down; he could not return to love when the Duchess\nstirred up his wrath by suddenly setting him down a thousand miles away\nfrom the boudoir, discussing theories of absolute monarchy, which she\ndefended to admiration. Few women venture to be democrats; the attitude\nof democratic champion is scarcely compatible with tyrannous feminine\nsway. But often, on the other hand, the General shook out his mane,\ndropped politics with a leonine growling and lashing of the flanks, and\nsprang upon his prey; he was no longer capable of carrying a heart and\nbrain at such variance for very far; he came back, terrible with love,\nto his mistress. And she, if she felt the prick of fancy stimulated to\na dangerous point, knew that it was time to leave her boudoir; she came\nout of the atmosphere surcharged with desires that she drew in with\nher breath, sat down to the piano, and sang the most exquisite songs\nof modern music, and so baffled the physical attraction which at times\nshowed her no mercy, though she was strong enough to fight it down.\n\nAt such times she was something sublime in Armand’s eyes; she was not\nacting, she was genuine; the unhappy lover was convinced that she loved\nhim. Her egoistic resistance deluded him into a belief that she was a\npure and sainted woman; he resigned himself; he talked of Platonic love,\ndid this artillery officer!\n\nWhen Mme de Langeais had played with religion sufficiently to suit her\nown purposes, she played with it again for Armand’s benefit. She wanted\nto bring him back to a Christian frame of mind; she brought out her\nedition of _Le Genie du Christianisme_, adapted for the use of military\nmen. Montriveau chafed; his yoke was heavy. Oh! at that, possessed by\nthe spirit of contradiction, she dinned religion into his ears, to see\nwhether God might not rid her of this suitor, for the man’s persistence\nwas beginning to frighten her. And in any case she was glad to prolong\nany quarrel, if it bade fair to keep the dispute on moral grounds for\nan indefinite period; the material struggle which followed it was more\ndangerous.\n\nBut if the time of her opposition on the ground of the marriage law\nmight be said to be the _epoque civile_ of this sentimental warfare, the\nensuing phase which might be taken to constitute the _epoque religieuse_\nhad also its crisis and consequent decline of severity.\n\nArmand happening to come in very early one evening, found M. l’Abbe\nGondrand, the Duchess’s spiritual director, established in an armchair\nby the fireside, looking as a spiritual director might be expected to\nlook while digesting his dinner and the charming sins of his penitent.\nIn the ecclesiastic’s bearing there was a stateliness befitting a\ndignitary of the Church; and the episcopal violet hue already appeared\nin his dress. At sight of his fresh, well-preserved complexion, smooth\nforehead, and ascetic’s mouth, Montriveau’s countenance grew uncommonly\ndark; he said not a word under the malicious scrutiny of the other’s\ngaze, and greeted neither the lady nor the priest. The lover apart,\nMontriveau was not wanting in tact; so a few glances exchanged with the\nbishop-designate told him that here was the real forger of the Duchess’s\narmory of scruples.\n\nThat an ambitious abbe should control the happiness of a man of\nMontriveau’s temper, and by underhand ways! The thought burst in a\nfurious tide over his face, clenched his fists, and set him chafing and\npacing to and fro; but when he came back to his place intending to make\na scene, a single look from the Duchess was enough. He was quiet.\n\nAny other woman would have been put out by her lover’s gloomy silence;\nit was quite otherwise with Mme de Langeais. She continued her\nconversation with M. de Gondrand on the necessity of re-establishing the\nChurch in its ancient splendour. And she talked brilliantly.\n\nThe Church, she maintained, ought to be a temporal as well as a\nspiritual power, stating her case better than the Abbe had done, and\nregretting that the Chamber of Peers, unlike the English House of Lords,\nhad no bench of bishops. Nevertheless, the Abbe rose, yielded his place\nto the General, and took his leave, knowing that in Lent he could play a\nreturn game. As for the Duchess, Montriveau’s behaviour had excited\nher curiosity to such a pitch that she scarcely rose to return her\ndirector’s low bow.\n\n“What is the matter with you, my friend?”\n\n“Why, I cannot stomach that Abbe of yours.”\n\n“Why did you not take a book?” she asked, careless whether the Abbe,\nthen closing the door, heard her or no.\n\nThe General paused, for the gesture which accompanied the Duchess’s\nspeech further increased the exceeding insolence of her words.\n\n“My dear Antoinette, thank you for giving love precedence of the Church;\nbut, for pity’s sake, allow me to ask one question.”\n\n“Oh! you are questioning me! I am quite willing. You are my friend, are\nyou not? I certainly can open the bottom of my heart to you; you will\nsee only one image there.”\n\n“Do you talk about our love to that man?”\n\n“He is my confessor.”\n\n“Does he know that I love you?”\n\n“M. de Montriveau, you cannot claim, I think, to penetrate the secrets\nof the confessional?”\n\n“Does that man know all about our quarrels and my love for you?”\n\n“That man, monsieur; say God!”\n\n“God again! _I_ ought to be alone in your heart. But leave God alone\nwhere He is, for the love of God and me. Madame, you _shall not_ go to\nconfession again, or----”\n\n“Or?” she repeated sweetly.\n\n“Or I will never come back here.”\n\n“Then go, Armand. Good-bye, good-bye forever.”\n\nShe rose and went to her boudoir without so much as a glance at Armand,\nas he stood with his hand on the back of a chair. How long he stood\nthere motionless he himself never knew. The soul within has the\nmysterious power of expanding as of contracting space.\n\nHe opened the door of the boudoir. It was dark within. A faint voice was\nraised to say sharply:\n\n“I did not ring. What made you come in without orders? Go away,\nSuzette.”\n\n“Then you are ill,” exclaimed Montriveau.\n\n“Stand up, monsieur, and go out of the room for a minute at any rate,”\n she said, ringing the bell.\n\n“Mme la Duchesse rang for lights?” said the footman, coming in with the\ncandles. When the lovers were alone together, Mme de Langeais still lay\non her couch; she was just as silent and motionless as if Montriveau had\nnot been there.\n\n“Dear, I was wrong,” he began, a note of pain and a sublime kindness in\nhis voice. “Indeed, I would not have you without religion----”\n\n“It is fortunate that you can recognise the necessity of a conscience,”\n she said in a hard voice, without looking at him. “I thank you in God’s\nname.”\n\nThe General was broken down by her harshness; this woman seemed as\nif she could be at will a sister or a stranger to him. He made one\ndespairing stride towards the door. He would leave her forever without\nanother word. He was wretched; and the Duchess was laughing within\nherself over mental anguish far more cruel than the old judicial\ntorture. But as for going away, it was not in his power to do it. In any\nsort of crisis, a woman is, as it were, bursting with a certain quantity\nof things to say; so long as she has not delivered herself of them,\nshe experiences the sensation which we are apt to feel at the sight of\nsomething incomplete. Mme de Langeais had not said all that was in her\nmind. She took up her parable and said:\n\n“We have not the same convictions, General, I am pained to think. It\nwould be dreadful if a woman could not believe in a religion which\npermits us to love beyond the grave. I set Christian sentiments aside;\nyou cannot understand them. Let me simply speak to you of expediency.\nWould you forbid a woman at court the table of the Lord when it is\ncustomary to take the sacrament at Easter? People must certainly do\nsomething for their party. The Liberals, whatever they may wish to do,\nwill never destroy the religious instinct. Religion will always be\na political necessity. Would you undertake to govern a nation of\nlogic-choppers? Napoleon was afraid to try; he persecuted ideologists.\nIf you want to keep people from reasoning, you must give them something\nto feel. So let us accept the Roman Catholic Church with all its\nconsequences. And if we would have France go to mass, ought we not to\nbegin by going ourselves? Religion, you see, Armand, is a bond uniting\nall the conservative principles which enable the rich to live in\ntranquillity. Religion and the rights of property are intimately\nconnected. It is certainly a finer thing to lead a nation by ideas of\nmorality than by fear of the scaffold, as in the time of the Terror--the\none method by which your odious Revolution could enforce obedience.\nThe priest and the king--that means you, and me, and the Princess\nmy neighbour; and, in a word, the interests of all honest people\npersonified. There, my friend, just be so good as to belong to your\nparty, you that might be its Scylla if you had the slightest ambition\nthat way. I know nothing about politics myself; I argue from my own\nfeelings; but still I know enough to guess that society would\nbe overturned if people were always calling its foundations in\nquestion----”\n\n“If that is how your Court and your Government think, I am sorry for\nyou,” broke in Montriveau. “The Restoration, madam, ought to say, like\nCatherine de Medici, when she heard that the battle of Dreux was lost,\n‘Very well; now we will go to the meeting-house.’ Now 1815 was your\nbattle of Dreux. Like the royal power of those days, you won in\nfact, while you lost in right. Political Protestantism has gained an\nascendancy over people’s minds. If you have no mind to issue your Edict\nof Nantes; or if, when it is issued, you publish a Revocation; if you\nshould one day be accused and convicted of repudiating the Charter,\nwhich is simply a pledge given to maintain the interests established\nunder the Republic, then the Revolution will rise again, terrible in her\nstrength, and strike but a single blow. It will not be the Revolution\nthat will go into exile; she is the very soil of France. Men die, but\npeople’s interests do not die. ... Eh, great Heavens! what are France\nand the crown and rightful sovereigns, and the whole world besides, to\nus? Idle words compared with my happiness. Let them reign or be hurled\nfrom the throne, little do I care. Where am I now?”\n\n“In the Duchesse de Langeais’ boudoir, my friend.”\n\n“No, no. No more of the Duchess, no more of Langeais; I am with my dear\nAntoinette.”\n\n“Will you do me the pleasure to stay where you are,” she said, laughing\nand pushing him back, gently however.\n\n“So you have never loved me,” he retorted, and anger flashed in\nlightning from his eyes.\n\n“No, dear”; but the “No” was equivalent to “Yes.”\n\n“I am a great ass,” he said, kissing her hands. The terrible queen was a\nwoman once more.--“Antoinette,” he went on, laying his head on her feet,\n“you are too chastely tender to speak of our happiness to anyone in this\nworld.”\n\n“Oh!” she cried, rising to her feet with a swift, graceful spring,\n“you are a great simpleton.” And without another word she fled into the\ndrawing-room.\n\n“What is it now?” wondered the General, little knowing that the touch of\nhis burning forehead had sent a swift electric thrill through her from\nfoot to head.\n\nIn hot wrath he followed her to the drawing-room, only to hear divinely\nsweet chords. The Duchess was at the piano. If the man of science or the\npoet can at once enjoy and comprehend, bringing his intelligence to bear\nupon his enjoyment without loss of delight, he is conscious that the\nalphabet and phraseology of music are but cunning instruments for\nthe composer, like the wood and copper wire under the hands of the\nexecutant. For the poet and the man of science there is a music existing\napart, underlying the double expression of this language of the spirit\nand senses. _Andiamo mio ben_ can draw tears of joy or pitying laughter\nat the will of the singer; and not unfrequently one here and there in\nthe world, some girl unable to live and bear the heavy burden of an\nunguessed pain, some man whose soul vibrates with the throb of passion,\nmay take up a musical theme, and lo! heaven is opened for them, or they\nfind a language for themselves in some sublime melody, some song lost to\nthe world.\n\nThe General was listening now to such a song; a mysterious music unknown\nto all other ears, as the solitary plaint of some mateless bird dying\nalone in a virgin forest.\n\n“Great Heavens! what are you playing there?” he asked in an unsteady\nvoice.\n\n“The prelude of a ballad, called, I believe, _Fleuve du Tage_.”\n\n“I did not know that there was such music in a piano,” he returned.\n\n“Ah!” she said, and for the first time she looked at him as a woman\nlooks at the man she loves, “nor do you know, my friend, that I love\nyou, and that you cause me horrible suffering; and that I feel that I\nmust utter my cry of pain without putting it too plainly into words. If\nI did not, I should yield----But you see nothing.”\n\n“And you will not make me happy!”\n\n“Armand, I should die of sorrow the next day.”\n\nThe General turned abruptly from her and went. But out in the street he\nbrushed away the tears that he would not let fall.\n\nThe religious phase lasted for three months. At the end of that time the\nDuchess grew weary of vain repetitions; the Deity, bound hand and foot,\nwas delivered up to her lover. Possibly she may have feared that by\nsheer dint of talking of eternity she might perpetuate his love in this\nworld and the next. For her own sake, it must be believed that no man\nhad touched her heart, or her conduct would be inexcusable. She was\nyoung; the time when men and women feel that they cannot afford to lose\ntime or to quibble over their joys was still far off. She, no doubt, was\non the verge not of first love, but of her first experience of the bliss\nof love. And from inexperience, for want of the painful lessons which\nwould have taught her to value the treasure poured out at her feet, she\nwas playing with it. Knowing nothing of the glory and rapture of the\nlight, she was fain to stay in the shadow.\n\nArmand was just beginning to understand this strange situation; he put\nhis hope in the first word spoken by nature. Every evening, as he came\naway from Mme de Langeais’, he told himself that no woman would accept\nthe tenderest, most delicate proofs of a man’s love during seven months,\nnor yield passively to the slighter demands of passion, only to cheat\nlove at the last. He was waiting patiently for the sun to gain power,\nnot doubting but that he should receive the earliest fruits. The married\nwoman’s hesitations and the religious scruples he could quite well\nunderstand. He even rejoiced over those battles. He mistook the\nDuchess’s heartless coquetry for modesty; and he would not have had her\notherwise. So he had loved to see her devising obstacles; was he not\ngradually triumphing over them? Did not every victory won swell the\nmeagre sum of lovers’ intimacies long denied, and at last conceded with\nevery sign of love? Still, he had had such leisure to taste the full\nsweetness of every small successive conquest on which a lover feeds\nhis love, that these had come to be matters of use and wont. So far as\nobstacles went, there were none now save his own awe of her; nothing\nelse left between him and his desire save the whims of her who allowed\nhim to call her Antoinette. So he made up his mind to demand more, to\ndemand all. Embarrassed like a young lover who cannot dare to believe\nthat his idol can stoop so low, he hesitated for a long time. He passed\nthrough the experience of terrible reactions within himself. A set\npurpose was annihilated by a word, and definite resolves died within him\non the threshold. He despised himself for his weakness, and still his\ndesire remained unuttered. Nevertheless, one evening, after sitting\nin gloomy melancholy, he brought out a fierce demand for his illegally\nlegitimate rights. The Duchess had not to wait for her bond-slave’s\nrequest to guess his desire. When was a man’s desire a secret? And have\nnot women an intuitive knowledge of the meaning of certain changes of\ncountenance?\n\n“What! you wish to be my friend no longer?” she broke in at the first\nwords, and a divine red surging like new blood under the transparent\nskin, lent brightness to her eyes. “As a reward for my generosity, you\nwould dishonor me? Just reflect a little. I myself have thought much\nover this; and I think always for us _both_. There is such a thing as\na woman’s loyalty, and we can no more fail in it than you can fail in\nhonour. _I_ cannot blind myself. If I am yours, how, in any sense, can\nI be M. de Langeais’ wife? Can you require the sacrifice of my position,\nmy rank, my whole life in return for a doubtful love that could not wait\npatiently for seven months? What! already you would rob me of my right\nto dispose of myself? No, no; you must not talk like this again. No, not\nanother word. I will not, I cannot listen to you.”\n\nMme de Langeais raised both hands to her head to push back the tufted\ncurls from her hot forehead; she seemed very much excited.\n\n“You come to a weak woman with your purpose definitely planned out. You\nsay--‘For a certain length of time she will talk to me of her husband,\nthen of God, and then of the inevitable consequences. But I will use\nand abuse the ascendancy I shall gain over her; I will make myself\nindispensable; all the bonds of habit, all the misconstructions of\noutsiders, will make for me; and at length, when our _liaison_ is taken\nfor granted by all the world, I shall be this woman’s master.’--Now, be\nfrank; these are your thoughts! Oh! you calculate, and you say that you\nlove. Shame on you! You are enamoured? Ah! that I well believe! You\nwish to possess me, to have me for your mistress, that is all! Very well\nthen, No! The _Duchesse de Langeais_ will not descend so far. Simple\n_bourgeoises_ may be the victims of your treachery--I, never! Nothing\ngives me assurance of your love. You speak of my beauty; I may lose\nevery trace of it in six months, like the dear Princess, my neighbour.\nYou are captivated by my wit, my grace. Great Heavens! you would soon\ngrow used to them and to the pleasures of possession. Have not the\nlittle concessions that I was weak enough to make come to be a matter of\ncourse in the last few months? Some day, when ruin comes, you will give\nme no reason for the change in you beyond a curt, ‘I have ceased to\ncare for you.’--Then, rank and fortune and honour and all that was the\nDuchesse de Langeais will be swallowed up in one disappointed hope.\nI shall have children to bear witness to my shame, and----” With an\ninvoluntary gesture she interrupted herself, and continued: “But I am\ntoo good-natured to explain all this to you when you know it better than\nI. Come! let us stay as we are. I am only too fortunate in that I can\nstill break these bonds which you think so strong. Is there anything so\nvery heroic in coming to the Hotel de Langeais to spend an evening\nwith a woman whose prattle amuses you?--a woman whom you take for a\nplaything? Why, half a dozen young coxcombs come here just as regularly\nevery afternoon between three and five. They, too, are very generous, I\nam to suppose? I make fun of them; they stand my petulance and insolence\npretty quietly, and make me laugh; but as for you, I give all the\ntreasures of my soul to you, and you wish to ruin me, you try my\npatience in endless ways. Hush, that will do, that will do,” she\ncontinued, seeing that he was about to speak, “you have no heart,\nno soul, no delicacy. I know what you want to tell me. Very well,\nthen--yes. I would rather you should take me for a cold, insensible\nwoman, with no devotion in her composition, no heart even, than be\ntaken by everybody else for a vulgar person, and be condemned to your\nso-called pleasures, of which you would most certainly tire, and to\neverlasting punishment for it afterwards. Your selfish love is not worth\nso many sacrifices....”\n\nThe words give but a very inadequate idea of the discourse which the\nDuchess trilled out with the quick volubility of a bird-organ. Nor,\ntruly, was there anything to prevent her from talking on for some time\nto come, for poor Armand’s only reply to the torrent of flute notes was\na silence filled with cruelly painful thoughts. He was just beginning to\nsee that this woman was playing with him; he divined instinctively\nthat a devoted love, a responsive love, does not reason and count\nthe consequences in this way. Then, as he heard her reproach him with\ndetestable motives, he felt something like shame as he remembered that\nunconsciously he had made those very calculations. With angelic honesty\nof purpose, he looked within, and self-examination found nothing but\nselfishness in all his thoughts and motives, in the answers which he\nframed and could not utter. He was self-convicted. In his despair\nhe longed to fling himself from the window. The egoism of it was\nintolerable.\n\nWhat indeed can a man say when a woman will not believe in love?--Let me\nprove how much I love you.--The _I_ is always there.\n\nThe heroes of the boudoir, in such circumstances, can follow the example\nof the primitive logician who preceded the Pyrrhonists and denied\nmovement. Montriveau was not equal to this feat. With all his audacity,\nhe lacked this precise kind which never deserts an adept in the formulas\nof feminine algebra. If so many women, and even the best of women, fall\na prey to a kind of expert to whom the vulgar give a grosser name, it is\nperhaps because the said experts are great _provers_, and love, in spite\nof its delicious poetry of sentiment, requires a little more geometry\nthan people are wont to think.\n\nNow the Duchess and Montriveau were alike in this--they were both\nequally unversed in love lore. The lady’s knowledge of theory was but\nscanty; in practice she knew nothing whatever; she felt nothing, and\nreflected over everything. Montriveau had had but little experience, was\nabsolutely ignorant of theory, and felt too much to reflect at all. Both\ntherefore were enduring the consequences of the singular situation.\nAt that supreme moment the myriad thoughts in his mind might have\nbeen reduced to the formula--“Submit to be mine----” words which seem\nhorribly selfish to a woman for whom they awaken no memories, recall no\nideas. Something nevertheless he must say. And what was more, though her\nbarbed shafts had set his blood tingling, though the short phrases that\nshe discharged at him one by one were very keen and sharp and cold, he\nmust control himself lest he should lose all by an outbreak of anger.\n\n“Mme la Duchesse, I am in despair that God should have invented no way\nfor a woman to confirm the gift of her heart save by adding the gift of\nher person. The high value which you yourself put upon the gift teaches\nme that I cannot attach less importance to it. If you have given me\nyour inmost self and your whole heart, as you tell me, what can the rest\nmatter? And besides, if my happiness means so painful a sacrifice, let\nus say no more about it. But you must pardon a man of spirit if he feels\nhumiliated at being taken for a spaniel.”\n\nThe tone in which the last remark was uttered might perhaps have\nfrightened another woman; but when the wearer of a petticoat has allowed\nherself to be addressed as a Divinity, and thereby set herself above all\nother mortals, no power on earth can be so haughty.\n\n“M. le Marquis, I am in despair that God should not have invented\nsome nobler way for a man to confirm the gift of his heart than by the\nmanifestation of prodigiously vulgar desires. We become bond-slaves\nwhen we give ourselves body and soul, but a man is bound to nothing by\naccepting the gift. Who will assure me that love will last? The very\nlove that I might show for you at every moment, the better to keep your\nlove, might serve you as a reason for deserting me. I have no wish to be\na second edition of Mme de Beauseant. Who can ever know what it is that\nkeeps you beside us? Our persistent coldness of heart is the cause of\nan unfailing passion in some of you; other men ask for an untiring\ndevotion, to be idolized at every moment; some for gentleness, others\nfor tyranny. No woman in this world as yet has really read the riddle of\nman’s heart.”\n\nThere was a pause. When she spoke again it was in a different tone.\n\n“After all, my friend, you cannot prevent a woman from trembling at the\nquestion, ‘Will this love last always?’ Hard though my words may be,\nthe dread of losing you puts them into my mouth. Oh, me! it is not I\nwho speaks, dear, it is reason; and how should anyone so mad as I be\nreasonable? In truth, I am nothing of the sort.”\n\nThe poignant irony of her answer had changed before the end into the\nmost musical accents in which a woman could find utterance for ingenuous\nlove. To listen to her words was to pass in a moment from martyrdom to\nheaven. Montriveau grew pale; and for the first time in his life, he\nfell on his knees before a woman. He kissed the Duchess’s skirt hem, her\nknees, her feet; but for the credit of the Faubourg Saint-Germain it is\nnecessary to respect the mysteries of its boudoirs, where many are fain\nto take the utmost that Love can give without giving proof of love in\nreturn.\n\nThe Duchess thought herself generous when she suffered herself to be\nadored. But Montriveau was in a wild frenzy of joy over her complete\nsurrender of the position.\n\n“Dear Antoinette,” he cried. “Yes, you are right; I will not have you\ndoubt any longer. I too am trembling at this moment--lest the angel of\nmy life should leave me; I wish I could invent some tie that might bind\nus to each other irrevocably.”\n\n“Ah!” she said, under her breath, “so I was right, you see.”\n\n“Let me say all that I have to say; I will scatter all your fears with\na word. Listen! if I deserted you, I should deserve to die a thousand\ndeaths. Be wholly mine, and I will give you the right to kill me if I\nam false. I myself will write a letter explaining certain reasons for\ntaking my own life; I will make my final arrangements, in short. You\nshall have the letter in your keeping; in the eye of the law it will be\na sufficient explanation of my death. You can avenge yourself, and fear\nnothing from God or men.”\n\n“What good would the letter be to me? What would life be if I had lost\nyour love? If I wished to kill you, should I not be ready to follow? No;\nthank you for the thought, but I do not want the letter. Should I not\nbegin to dread that you were faithful to me through fear? And if a man\nknows that he must risk his life for a stolen pleasure, might it not\nseem more tempting? Armand, the thing I ask of you is the one hard thing\nto do.”\n\n“Then what is it that you wish?”\n\n“Your obedience and my liberty.”\n\n“Ah, God!” cried he, “I am a child.”\n\n“A wayward, much spoilt child,” she said, stroking the thick hair,\nfor his head still lay on her knee. “Ah! and loved far more than he\nbelieves, and yet he is very disobedient. Why not stay as we are? Why\nnot sacrifice to me the desires that hurt me? Why not take what I can\ngive, when it is all that I can honestly grant? Are you not happy?”\n\n“Oh yes, I am happy when I have not a doubt left. Antoinette, doubt in\nlove is a kind of death, is it not?”\n\nIn a moment he showed himself as he was, as all men are under the\ninfluence of that hot fever; he grew eloquent, insinuating. And the\nDuchess tasted the pleasures which she reconciled with her conscience\nby some private, Jesuitical ukase of her own; Armand’s love gave her a\nthrill of cerebral excitement which custom made as necessary to her as\nsociety, or the Opera. To feel that she was adored by this man, who rose\nabove other men, whose character frightened her; to treat him like a\nchild; to play with him as Poppaea played with Nero--many women, like\nthe wives of King Henry VIII, have paid for such a perilous delight with\nall the blood in their veins. Grim presentiment! Even as she surrendered\nthe delicate, pale, gold curls to his touch, and felt the close pressure\nof his hand, the little hand of a man whose greatness she could not\nmistake; even as she herself played with his dark, thick locks, in that\nboudoir where she reigned a queen, the Duchess would say to herself:\n\n“This man is capable of killing me if he once finds out that I am\nplaying with him.”\n\nArmand de Montriveau stayed with her till two o’clock in the morning.\nFrom that moment this woman, whom he loved, was neither a duchess nor a\nNavarreins; Antoinette, in her disguises, had gone so far as to appear\nto be a woman. On that most blissful evening, the sweetest prelude ever\nplayed by a Parisienne to what the world calls “a slip”; in spite of all\nher affectations of a coyness which she did not feel, the General saw\nall maidenly beauty in her. He had some excuse for believing that so\nmany storms of caprice had been but clouds covering a heavenly soul;\nthat these must be lifted one by one like the veils that hid her divine\nloveliness. The Duchess became, for him, the most simple and girlish\nmistress; she was the one woman in the world for him; and he went away\nquite happy in that at last he had brought her to give him such pledges\nof love, that it seemed to him impossible but that he should be but her\nhusband henceforth in secret, her choice sanctioned by Heaven.\n\nArmand went slowly home, turning this thought in his mind with the\nimpartiality of a man who is conscious of all the responsibilities that\nlove lays on him while he tastes the sweetness of its joys. He went\nalong the Quais to see the widest possible space of sky; his heart had\ngrown in him; he would fain have had the bounds of the firmament and of\nearth enlarged. It seemed to him that his lungs drew an ampler breath.\nIn the course of his self-examination, as he walked, he vowed to love\nthis woman so devoutly, that every day of her life she should find\nabsolution for her sins against society in unfailing happiness. Sweet\nstirrings of life when life is at the full! The man that is strong\nenough to steep his soul in the colour of one emotion, feels infinite\njoy as glimpses open out for him of an ardent lifetime that knows no\ndiminution of passion to the end; even so it is permitted to certain\nmystics, in ecstasy, to behold the Light of God. Love would be naught\nwithout the belief that it would last forever; love grows great\nthrough constancy. It was thus that, wholly absorbed by his happiness,\nMontriveau understood passion.\n\n“We belong to each other forever!”\n\nThe thought was like a talisman fulfilling the wishes of his life. He\ndid not ask whether the Duchess might not change, whether her love might\nnot last. No, for he had faith. Without that virtue there is no future\nfor Christianity, and perhaps it is even more necessary to society.\nA conception of life as feeling occurred to him for the first time;\nhitherto he had lived by action, the most strenuous exertion of human\nenergies, the physical devotion, as it may be called, of the soldier.\n\nNext day M. de Montriveau went early in the direction of the Faubourg\nSaint-Germain. He had made an appointment at a house not far from the\nHotel de Langeais; and the business over, he went thither as if to his\nown home. The General’s companion chanced to be a man for whom he felt\na kind of repulsion whenever he met him in other houses. This was the\nMarquis de Ronquerolles, whose reputation had grown so great in Paris\nboudoirs. He was witty, clever, and what was more--courageous; he set\nthe fashion to all the young men in Paris. As a man of gallantry, his\nsuccess and experience were equally matters of envy; and neither fortune\nnor birth was wanting in his case, qualifications which add such lustre\nin Paris to a reputation as a leader of fashion.\n\n“Where are you going?” asked M. de Ronquerolles.\n\n“To Mme de Langeais’.”\n\n“Ah, true. I forgot that you had allowed her to lime(sp) you. You are\nwasting your affections on her when they might be much better employed\nelsewhere. I could have told you of half a score of women in the\nfinancial world, any one of them a thousand times better worth your\nwhile than that titled courtesan, who does with her brains what less\nartificial women do with----”\n\n“What is this, my dear fellow?” Armand broke in. “The Duchess is an\nangel of innocence.”\n\nRonquerolles began to laugh.\n\n“Things being thus, dear boy,” said he, “it is my duty to enlighten you.\nJust a word; there is no harm in it between ourselves. Has the Duchess\nsurrendered? If so, I have nothing more to say. Come, give me your\nconfidence. There is no occasion to waste your time in grafting\nyour great nature on that unthankful stock, when all your hopes and\ncultivation will come to nothing.”\n\nArmand ingenuously made a kind of general report of his position,\nenumerating with much minuteness the slender rights so hardly won.\nRonquerolles burst into a peal of laughter so heartless, that it would\nhave cost any other man his life. But from their manner of speaking and\nlooking at each other during that colloquy beneath the wall, in a corner\nalmost as remote from intrusion as the desert itself, it was easy to\nimagine the friendship between the two men knew no bounds, and that no\npower on earth could estrange them.\n\n“My dear Armand, why did you not tell me that the Duchess was a puzzle\nto you? I would have given you a little advice which might have brought\nyour flirtation properly through. You must know, to begin with, that the\nwomen of our Faubourg, like any other women, love to steep themselves in\nlove; but they have a mind to possess and not to be possessed. They have\nmade a sort of compromise with human nature. The code of their parish\ngives them a pretty wide latitude short of the last transgression. The\nsweets enjoyed by this fair Duchess of yours are so many venial sins\nto be washed away in the waters of penitence. But if you had the\nimpertinence to ask in earnest for the moral sin to which naturally\nyou are sure to attach the highest importance, you would see the deep\ndisdain with which the door of the boudoir and the house would be\nincontinently shut upon you. The tender Antoinette would dismiss\neverything from her memory; you would be less than a cipher for her.\nShe would wipe away your kisses, my dear friend, as indifferently as she\nwould perform her ablutions. She would sponge love from her cheeks as\nshe washes off rouge. We know women of that sort--the thorough-bred\nParisienne. Have you ever noticed a grisette tripping along the street?\nHer face is as good as a picture. A pretty cap, fresh cheeks, trim hair,\na guileful smile, and the rest of her almost neglected. Is not this true\nto the life? Well, that is the Parisienne. She knows that her face is\nall that will be seen, so she devotes all her care, finery, and vanity\nto her head. The Duchess is the same; the head is everything with her.\nShe can only feel through her intellect, her heart lies in her brain,\nshe is a sort of intellectual epicure, she has a head-voice. We call\nthat kind of poor creature a Lais of the intellect. You have been taken\nin like a boy. If you doubt it, you can have proof of it tonight, this\nmorning, this instant. Go up to her, try the demand as an experiment,\ninsist peremptorily if it is refused. You might set about it like the\nlate Marechal de Richelieu, and get nothing for your pains.”\n\nArmand was dumb with amazement.\n\n“Has your desire reached the point of infatuation?”\n\n“I want her at any cost!” Montriveau cried out despairingly.\n\n“Very well. Now, look here. Be as inexorable as she is herself. Try to\nhumiliate her, to sting her vanity. Do _not_ try to move her heart,\nnor her soul, but the woman’s nerves and temperament, for she is both\nnervous and lymphatic. If you can once awaken desire in her, you are\nsafe. But you must drop these romantic boyish notions of yours. If when\nonce you have her in your eagle’s talons you yield a point or draw back,\nif you so much as stir an eyelid, if she thinks that she can regain her\nascendancy over you, she will slip out of your clutches like a fish, and\nyou will never catch her again. Be as inflexible as law. Show no more\ncharity than the headsman. Hit hard, and then hit again. Strike and keep\non striking as if you were giving her the knout. Duchesses are made of\nhard stuff, my dear Armand; there is a sort of feminine nature that is\nonly softened by repeated blows; and as suffering develops a heart in\nwomen of that sort, so it is a work of charity not to spare the rod.\nDo you persevere. Ah! when pain has thoroughly relaxed those nerves and\nsoftened the fibres that you take to be so pliant and yielding; when\na shriveled heart has learned to expand and contract and to beat under\nthis discipline; when the brain has capitulated--then, perhaps, passion\nmay enter among the steel springs of this machinery that turns out tears\nand affectations and languors and melting phrases; then you shall see a\nmost magnificent conflagration (always supposing that the chimney takes\nfire). The steel feminine system will glow red-hot like iron in the\nforge; that kind of heat lasts longer than any other, and the glow of it\nmay possibly turn to love.\n\n“Still,” he continued, “I have my doubts. And, after all, is it worth\nwhile to take so much trouble with the Duchess? Between ourselves a man\nof my stamp ought first to take her in hand and break her in; I would\nmake a charming woman of her; she is a thoroughbred; whereas, you two\nleft to yourselves will never get beyond the A B C. But you are in love\nwith her, and just now you might not perhaps share my views on this\nsubject----. A pleasant time to you, my children,” added Ronquerolles,\nafter a pause. Then with a laugh: “I have decided myself for facile\nbeauties; they are tender, at any rate, the natural woman appears in\ntheir love without any of your social seasonings. A woman that haggles\nover herself, my poor boy, and only means to inspire love! Well, have\nher like an extra horse--for show. The match between the sofa and\nconfessional, black and white, queen and knight, conscientious scruples\nand pleasure, is an uncommonly amusing game of chess. And if a man knows\nthe game, let him be never so little of a rake, he wins in three moves.\nNow, if I undertook a woman of that sort, I should start with the\ndeliberate purpose of----” His voice sank to a whisper over the last\nwords in Armand’s ear, and he went before there was time to reply.\n\nAs for Montriveau, he sprang at a bound across the courtyard of the\nHotel de Langeais, went unannounced up the stairs straight to the\nDuchess’s bedroom.\n\n“This is an unheard-of thing,” she said, hastily wrapping her\ndressing-gown about her. “Armand! this is abominable of you! Come, leave\nthe room, I beg. Just go out of the room, and go at once. Wait for me in\nthe drawing-room.--Come now!”\n\n“Dear angel, has a plighted lover no privilege whatsoever?”\n\n“But, monsieur, it is in the worst possible taste of a plighted lover or\na wedded husband to break in like this upon his wife.”\n\nHe came up to the Duchess, took her in his arms, and held her tightly to\nhim.\n\n“Forgive, dear Antoinette; but a host of horrid doubts are fermenting in\nmy heart.”\n\n“_Doubts_? Fie!--Oh, fie on you!”\n\n“Doubts all but justified. If you loved me, would you make this quarrel?\nWould you not be glad to see me? Would you not have felt a something\nstir in your heart? For I, that am not a woman, feel a thrill in my\ninmost self at the mere sound of your voice. Often in a ballroom a\nlonging has come upon me to spring to your side and put my arms about\nyour neck.”\n\n“Oh! if you have doubts of me so long as I am not ready to spring to\nyour arms before all the world, I shall be doubted all my life long, I\nsuppose. Why, Othello was a mere child compared with you!”\n\n“Ah!” he cried despairingly, “you have no love for me----”\n\n“Admit, at any rate, that at this moment you are not lovable.”\n\n“Then I have still to find favour in your sight?”\n\n“Oh, I should think so. Come,” added she, “with a little imperious air,\ngo out of the room, leave me. I am not like you; I wish always to find\nfavour in your eyes.”\n\nNever woman better understood the art of putting charm into insolence,\nand does not the charm double the effect? is it not enough to infuriate\nthe coolest of men? There was a sort of untrammeled freedom about Mme\nde Langeais; a something in her eyes, her voice, her attitude, which is\nnever seen in a woman who loves when she stands face to face with him at\nthe mere sight of whom her heart must needs begin to beat. The Marquis\nde Ronquerolles’ counsels had cured Armand of sheepishness; and further,\nthere came to his aid that rapid power of intuition which passion will\ndevelop at moments in the least wise among mortals, while a great man\nat such a time possesses it to the full. He guessed the terrible truth\nrevealed by the Duchess’s nonchalance, and his heart swelled with the\nstorm like a lake rising in flood.\n\n“If you told me the truth yesterday, be mine, dear Antoinette,” he\ncried; “you shall----”\n\n“In the first place,” said she composedly, thrusting him back as he\ncame nearer--“in the first place, you are not to compromise me. My woman\nmight overhear you. Respect me, I beg of you. Your familiarity is all\nvery well in my boudoir in an evening; here it is quite different.\nBesides, what may your ‘you shall’ mean? ‘You shall.’ No one as yet\nhas ever used that word to me. It is quite ridiculous, it seems to me,\nabsolutely ridiculous.\n\n“Will you surrender nothing to me on this point?”\n\n“Oh! do you call a woman’s right to dispose of herself a ‘point?’ A\ncapital point indeed; you will permit me to be entirely my own mistress\non that ‘point.’”\n\n“And how if, believing in your promises to me, I should absolutely\nrequire it?”\n\n“Oh! then you would prove that I made the greatest possible mistake when\nI made you a promise of any kind; and I should beg you to leave me in\npeace.”\n\nThe General’s face grew white; he was about to spring to her side, when\nMme de Langeais rang the bell, the maid appeared, and, smiling with a\nmocking grace, the Duchess added, “Be so good as to return when I am\nvisible.”\n\nThen Montriveau felt the hardness of a woman as cold and keen as a steel\nblade; she was crushing in her scorn. In one moment she had snapped\nthe bonds which held firm only for her lover. She had read Armand’s\nintention in his face, and held that the moment had come for teaching\nthe Imperial soldier his lesson. He was to be made to feel that though\nduchesses may lend themselves to love, they do not give themselves, and\nthat the conquest of one of them would prove a harder matter than the\nconquest of Europe.\n\n“Madame,” returned Armand, “I have not time to wait. I am a spoilt\nchild, as you told me yourself. When I seriously resolve to have that of\nwhich we have been speaking, I shall have it.”\n\n“You will have it?” queried she, and there was a trace of surprise in\nher loftiness.\n\n“I shall have it.”\n\n“Oh! you would do me a great pleasure by ‘resolving’ to have it. For\ncuriosity’s sake, I should be delighted to know how you would set about\nit----”\n\n“I am delighted to put a new interest into your life,” interrupted\nMontriveau, breaking into a laugh which dismayed the Duchess. “Will you\npermit me to take you to the ball tonight?”\n\n“A thousand thanks. M. de Marsay has been beforehand with you. I gave\nhim my promise.”\n\nMontriveau bowed gravely and went.\n\n“So Ronquerolles was right,” thought he, “and now for a game of chess.”\n\nThenceforward he hid his agitation by complete composure. No man is\nstrong enough to bear such sudden alternations from the height of\nhappiness to the depths of wretchedness. So he had caught a glimpse of\nhappy life the better to feel the emptiness of his previous existence?\nThere was a terrible storm within him; but he had learned to endure,\nand bore the shock of tumultuous thoughts as a granite cliff stands out\nagainst the surge of an angry sea.\n\n“I could say nothing. When I am with her my wits desert me. She does not\nknow how vile and contemptible she is. Nobody has ventured to bring her\nface to face with herself. She has played with many a man, no doubt; I\nwill avenge them all.”\n\nFor the first time, it may be, in a man’s heart, revenge and love were\nblended so equally that Montriveau himself could not know whether love\nor revenge would carry all before it. That very evening he went to the\nball at which he was sure of seeing the Duchesse de Langeais, and almost\ndespaired of reaching her heart. He inclined to think that there was\nsomething diabolical about this woman, who was gracious to him and\nradiant with charming smiles; probably because she had no wish to\nallow the world to think that she had compromised herself with M. de\nMontriveau. Coolness on both sides is a sign of love; but so long as\nthe Duchess was the same as ever, while the Marquis looked sullen and\nmorose, was it not plain that she had conceded nothing? Onlookers know\nthe rejected lover by various signs and tokens; they never mistake the\ngenuine symptoms for a coolness such as some women command their adorers\nto feign, in the hope of concealing their love. Everyone laughed at\nMontriveau; and he, having omitted to consult his cornac, was abstracted\nand ill at ease. M. de Ronquerolles would very likely have bidden him\ncompromise the Duchess by responding to her show of friendliness by\npassionate demonstrations; but as it was, Armand de Montriveau came away\nfrom the ball, loathing human nature, and even then scarcely ready to\nbelieve in such complete depravity.\n\n“If there is no executioner for such crimes,” he said, as he looked up\nat the lighted windows of the ballroom where the most enchanting women\nin Paris were dancing, laughing, and chatting, “I will take you by the\nnape of the neck, Mme la Duchesse, and make you feel something that\nbites more deeply than the knife in the Place de la Greve. Steel against\nsteel; we shall see which heart will leave the deeper mark.”\n\nFor a week or so Mme de Langeais hoped to see the Marquis de Montriveau\nagain; but he contented himself with sending his card every morning to\nthe Hotel de Langeais. The Duchess could not help shuddering each time\nthat the card was brought in, and a dim foreboding crossed her mind, but\nthe thought was vague as a presentiment of disaster. When her eyes fell\non the name, it seemed to her that she felt the touch of the implacable\nman’s strong hand in her hair; sometimes the words seemed like a\nprognostication of a vengeance which her lively intellect invented in\nthe most shocking forms. She had studied him too well not to dread him.\nWould he murder her, she wondered? Would that bull-necked man dash out\nher vitals by flinging her over his head? Would he trample her body\nunder his feet? When, where, and how would he get her into his power?\nWould he make her suffer very much, and what kind of pain would he\ninflict? She repented of her conduct. There were hours when, if he had\ncome, she would have gone to his arms in complete self-surrender.\n\nEvery night before she slept she saw Montriveau’s face; every night it\nwore a different aspect. Sometimes she saw his bitter smile, sometimes\nthe Jovelike knitting of the brows; or his leonine look, or some\ndisdainful movement of the shoulders made him terrible for her. Next day\nthe card seemed stained with blood. The name of Montriveau stirred her\nnow as the presence of the fiery, stubborn, exacting lover had never\ndone. Her apprehensions gathered strength in the silence. She was\nforced, without aid from without, to face the thought of a hideous duel\nof which she could not speak. Her proud hard nature was more responsive\nto thrills of hate than it had ever been to the caresses of love. Ah! if\nthe General could but have seen her, as she sat with her forehead\ndrawn into folds between her brows; immersed in bitter thoughts in that\nboudoir where he had enjoyed such happy moments, he might perhaps\nhave conceived high hopes. Of all human passions, is not pride alone\nincapable of engendering anything base? Mme de Langeais kept her\nthoughts to herself, but is it not permissible to suppose that M. de\nMontriveau was no longer indifferent to her? And has not a man gained\nground immensely when a woman thinks about him? He is bound to make\nprogress with her either one way or the other afterwards.\n\nPut any feminine creature under the feet of a furious horse or other\nfearsome beast; she will certainly drop on her knees and look for death;\nbut if the brute shows a milder mood and does not utterly slay her,\nshe will love the horse, lion, bull, or what not, and will speak of him\nquite at her ease. The Duchess felt that she was under the lion’s paws;\nshe quaked, but she did not hate him.\n\nThe man and woman thus singularly placed with regard to each other met\nthree times in society during the course of that week. Each time,\nin reply to coquettish questioning glances, the Duchess received a\nrespectful bow, and smiles tinged with such savage irony, that all her\napprehensions over the card in the morning were revived at night.\nOur lives are simply such as our feelings shape them for us; and the\nfeelings of these two had hollowed out a great gulf between them.\n\nThe Comtesse de Serizy, the Marquis de Ronquerolles’ sister, gave a\ngreat ball at the beginning of the following week, and Mme de Langeais\nwas sure to go to it. Armand was the first person whom the Duchess saw\nwhen she came into the room, and this time Armand was looking out for\nher, or so she thought at least. The two exchanged a look, and suddenly\nthe woman felt a cold perspiration break from every pore. She had\nthought all along that Montriveau was capable of taking reprisals in\nsome unheard-of way proportioned to their condition, and now the revenge\nhad been discovered, it was ready, heated, and boiling. Lightnings\nflashed from the foiled lover’s eyes, his face was radiant with exultant\nvengeance. And the Duchess? Her eyes were haggard in spite of her\nresolution to be cool and insolent. She went to take her place beside\nthe Comtesse de Serizy, who could not help exclaiming, “Dear Antoinette!\nwhat is the matter with you? You are enough to frighten one.”\n\n“I shall be all right after a quadrille,” she answered, giving a hand to\na young man who came up at that moment.\n\nMme de Langeais waltzed that evening with a sort of excitement and\ntransport which redoubled Montriveau’s lowering looks. He stood in front\nof the line of spectators, who were amusing themselves by looking on.\nEvery time that _she_ came past him, his eyes darted down upon her\neddying face; he might have been a tiger with the prey in his grasp. The\nwaltz came to an end, Mme de Langeais went back to her place beside the\nCountess, and Montriveau never took his eyes off her, talking all the\nwhile with a stranger.\n\n“One of the things that struck me most on the journey,” he was saying\n(and the Duchess listened with all her ears), “was the remark which the\nman makes at Westminster when you are shown the axe with which a man in\na mask cut off Charles the First’s head, so they tell you. The King made\nit first of all to some inquisitive person, and they repeat it still in\nmemory of him.”\n\n“What does the man say?” asked Mme de Serizy.\n\n“‘Do not touch the axe!’” replied Montriveau, and there was menace in\nthe sound of his voice.\n\n“Really, my Lord Marquis,” said Mme de Langeais, “you tell this old\nstory that everybody knows if they have been to London, and look at my\nneck in such a melodramatic way that you seem to me to have an axe in\nyour hand.”\n\nThe Duchess was in a cold sweat, but nevertheless she laughed as she\nspoke the last words.\n\n“But circumstances give the story a quite new application,” returned he.\n\n“How so; pray tell me, for pity’s sake?”\n\n“In this way, madame--you have touched the axe,” said Montriveau,\nlowering his voice.\n\n“What an enchanting prophecy!” returned she, smiling with assumed grace.\n“And when is my head to fall?”\n\n“I have no wish to see that pretty head of yours cut off. I only fear\nsome great misfortune for you. If your head were clipped close, would\nyou feel no regrets for the dainty golden hair that you turn to such\ngood account?”\n\n“There are those for whom a woman would love to make such a sacrifice;\neven if, as often happens, it is for the sake of a man who cannot make\nallowances for an outbreak of temper.”\n\n“Quite so. Well, and if some wag were to spoil your beauty on a sudden\nby some chemical process, and you, who are but eighteen for us, were to\nbe a hundred years old?”\n\n“Why, the smallpox is our Battle of Waterloo, monsieur,” she\ninterrupted. “After it is over we find out those who love us sincerely.”\n\n“Would you not regret the lovely face that?”\n\n“Oh! indeed I should, but less for my own sake than for the sake of\nsomeone else whose delight it might have been. And, after all, if I were\nloved, always loved, and truly loved, what would my beauty matter to\nme?--What do you say, Clara?”\n\n“It is a dangerous speculation,” replied Mme de Serizy.\n\n“Is it permissible to ask His Majesty the King of Sorcerers when I made\nthe mistake of touching the axe, since I have not been to London as\nyet?----”\n\n“_Not so_,” he answered in English, with a burst of ironical laughter.\n\n“And when will the punishment begin?”\n\nAt this Montriveau coolly took out his watch, and ascertained the hour\nwith a truly appalling air of conviction.\n\n“A dreadful misfortune will befall you before this day is out.”\n\n“I am not a child to be easily frightened, or rather, I am a child\nignorant of danger,” said the Duchess. “I shall dance now without fear\non the edge of the precipice.”\n\n“I am delighted to know that you have so much strength of character,” he\nanswered, as he watched her go to take her place in a square dance.\n\nBut the Duchess, in spite of her apparent contempt for Armand’s dark\nprophecies, was really frightened. Her late lover’s presence weighed\nupon her morally and physically with a sense of oppression that scarcely\nceased when he left the ballroom. And yet when she had drawn freer\nbreath, and enjoyed the relief for a moment, she found herself\nregretting the sensation of dread, so greedy of extreme sensations is\nthe feminine nature. The regret was not love, but it was certainly akin\nto other feelings which prepare the way for love. And then--as if the\nimpression which Montriveau had made upon her were suddenly revived--she\nrecollected his air of conviction as he took out his watch, and in a\nsudden spasm of dread she went out.\n\nBy this time it was about midnight. One of her servants, waiting with\nher pelisse, went down to order her carriage. On her way home she fell\nnaturally enough to musing over M. de Montriveau’s prediction. Arrived\nin her own courtyard, as she supposed, she entered a vestibule almost\nlike that of her own hotel, and suddenly saw that the staircase was\ndifferent. She was in a strange house. Turning to call her servants, she\nwas attacked by several men, who rapidly flung a handkerchief over her\nmouth, bound her hand and foot, and carried her off. She shrieked aloud.\n\n“Madame, our orders are to kill you if you scream,” a voice said in her\near.\n\nSo great was the Duchess’s terror, that she could never recollect how\nnor by whom she was transported. When she came to herself, she was lying\non a couch in a bachelor’s lodging, her hands and feet tied with silken\ncords. In spite of herself, she shrieked aloud as she looked round and\nmet Armand de Montriveau’s eyes. He was sitting in his dressing-gown,\nquietly smoking a cigar in his armchair.\n\n“Do not cry out, Mme la Duchesse,” he said, coolly taking the cigar out\nof his mouth; “I have a headache. Besides, I will untie you. But listen\nattentively to what I have the honour to say to you.”\n\nVery carefully he untied the knots that bound her feet.\n\n“What would be the use of calling out? Nobody can hear your cries.\nYou are too well bred to make any unnecessary fuss. If you do not stay\nquietly, if you insist upon a struggle with me, I shall tie your\nhands and feet again. All things considered, I think that you have\nself-respect enough to stay on this sofa as if you were lying on your\nown at home; cold as ever, if you will. You have made me shed many tears\non this couch, tears that I hid from all other eyes.”\n\nWhile Montriveau was speaking, the Duchess glanced about her; it was\na woman’s glance, a stolen look that saw all things and seemed to see\nnothing. She was much pleased with the room. It was rather like a\nmonk’s cell. The man’s character and thoughts seemed to pervade it. No\ndecoration of any kind broke the grey painted surface of the walls.\nA green carpet covered the floor. A black sofa, a table littered with\npapers, two big easy-chairs, a chest of drawers with an alarum clock by\nway of ornament, a very low bedstead with a coverlet flung over it--a\nred cloth with a black key border--all these things made part of a\nwhole that told of a life reduced to its simplest terms. A triple\ncandle-sconce of Egyptian design on the chimney-piece recalled the\nvast spaces of the desert and Montriveau’s long wanderings; a huge\nsphinx-claw stood out beneath the folds of stuff at the bed-foot;\nand just beyond, a green curtain with a black and scarlet border was\nsuspended by large rings from a spear handle above a door near one\ncorner of the room. The other door by which the band had entered was\nlikewise curtained, but the drapery hung from an ordinary curtain-rod.\nAs the Duchess finally noted that the pattern was the same on both, she\nsaw that the door at the bed-foot stood open; gleams of ruddy light\nfrom the room beyond flickered below the fringed border. Naturally, the\nominous light roused her curiosity; she fancied she could distinguish\nstrange shapes in the shadows; but as it did not occur to her at the\ntime that danger could come from that quarter, she tried to gratify a\nmore ardent curiosity.\n\n“Monsieur, if it is not indiscreet, may I ask what you mean to do with\nme?” The insolence and irony of the tone stung through the words. The\nDuchess quite believed that she read extravagant love in Montriveau’s\nspeech. He had carried her off; was not that in itself an acknowledgment\nof her power?\n\n“Nothing whatever, madame,” he returned, gracefully puffing the last\nwhiff of cigar smoke. “You will remain here for a short time. First\nof all, I should like to explain to you what you are, and what I am. I\ncannot put my thoughts into words whilst you are twisting on the sofa\nin your boudoir; and besides, in your own house you take offence at the\nslightest hint, you ring the bell, make an outcry, and turn your lover\nout at the door as if he were the basest of wretches. Here my mind is\nunfettered. Here nobody can turn me out. Here you shall be my victim for\na few seconds, and you are going to be so exceedingly kind as to listen\nto me. You need fear nothing. I did not carry you off to insult you, nor\nyet to take by force what you refused to grant of your own will to my\nunworthiness. I could not stoop so low. You possibly think of outrage;\nfor myself, I have no such thoughts.”\n\nHe flung his cigar coolly into the fire.\n\n“The smoke is unpleasant to you, no doubt, madame?” he said, and rising\nat once, he took a chafing-dish from the hearth, burnt perfumes, and\npurified the air. The Duchess’s astonishment was only equaled by her\nhumiliation. She was in this man’s power; and he would not abuse his\npower. The eyes in which love had once blazed like flame were now quiet\nand steady as stars. She trembled. Her dread of Armand was increased by\na nightmare sensation of restlessness and utter inability to move; she\nfelt as if she were turned to stone. She lay passive in the grip of\nfear. She thought she saw the light behind the curtains grow to a blaze,\nas if blown up by a pair of bellows; in another moment the gleams of\nflame grew brighter, and she fancied that three masked figures suddenly\nflashed out; but the terrible vision disappeared so swiftly that she\ntook it for an optical delusion.\n\n“Madame,” Armand continued with cold contempt, “one minute, just one\nminute is enough for me, and you shall feel it afterwards at every\nmoment throughout your lifetime, the one eternity over which I have\npower. I am not God. Listen carefully to me,” he continued, pausing to\nadd solemnity to his words. “Love will always come at your call. You\nhave boundless power over men: but remember that once you called love,\nand love came to you; love as pure and true-hearted as may be on earth,\nand as reverent as it was passionate; fond as a devoted woman’s, as a\nmother’s love; a love so great indeed, that it was past the bounds of\nreason. You played with it, and you committed a crime. Every woman has a\nright to refuse herself to love which she feels she cannot share; and\nif a man loves and cannot win love in return, he is not to be pitied,\nhe has no right to complain. But with a semblance of love to attract\nan unfortunate creature cut off from all affection; to teach him to\nunderstand happiness to the full, only to snatch it from him; to rob him\nof his future of felicity; to slay his happiness not merely today,\nbut as long as his life lasts, by poisoning every hour of it and every\nthought--this I call a fearful crime!”\n\n“Monsieur----”\n\n“I cannot allow you to answer me yet. So listen to me still. In any case\nI have rights over you; but I only choose to exercise one--the right of\nthe judge over the criminal, so that I may arouse your conscience. If\nyou had no conscience left, I should not reproach you at all; but you\nare so young! You must feel some life still in your heart; or so I like\nto believe. While I think of you as depraved enough to do a wrong which\nthe law does not punish, I do not think you so degraded that you cannot\ncomprehend the full meaning of my words. I resume.”\n\nAs he spoke the Duchess heard the smothered sound of a pair of bellows.\nThose mysterious figures which she had just seen were blowing up the\nfire, no doubt; the glow shone through the curtain. But Montriveau’s\nlurid face was turned upon her; she could not choose but wait with a\nfast-beating heart and eyes fixed in a stare. However curious she felt,\nthe heat in Armand’s words interested her even more than the crackling\nof the mysterious flames.\n\n“Madame,” he went on after a pause, “if some poor wretch commits a\nmurder in Paris, it is the executioner’s duty, you know, to lay hands on\nhim and stretch him on the plank, where murderers pay for their crimes\nwith their heads. Then the newspapers inform everyone, rich and poor, so\nthat the former are assured that they may sleep in peace, and the latter\nare warned that they must be on the watch if they would live. Well, you\nthat are religious, and even a little of a bigot, may have masses said\nfor such a man’s soul. You both belong to the same family, but yours is\nthe elder branch; and the elder branch may occupy high places in peace\nand live happily and without cares. Want or anger may drive your brother\nthe convict to take a man’s life; you have taken more, you have taken\nthe joy out of a man’s life, you have killed all that was best in his\nlife--his dearest beliefs. The murderer simply lay in wait for his\nvictim, and killed him reluctantly, and in fear of the scaffold; but\n_you_ ...! You heaped up every sin that weakness can commit against\nstrength that suspected no evil; you tamed a passive victim, the better\nto gnaw his heart out; you lured him with caresses; you left nothing\nundone that could set him dreaming, imagining, longing for the bliss of\nlove. You asked innumerable sacrifices of him, only to refuse to make\nany in return. He should see the light indeed before you put out his\neyes! It is wonderful how you found the heart to do it! Such villainies\ndemand a display of resource quite above the comprehension of those\nbourgeoises whom you laugh at and despise. They can give and forgive;\nthey know how to love and suffer. The grandeur of their devotion dwarfs\nus. Rising higher in the social scale, one finds just as much mud as at\nthe lower end; but with this difference, at the upper end it is hard and\ngilded over.\n\n“Yes, to find baseness in perfection, you must look for a noble bringing\nup, a great name, a fair woman, a duchess. You cannot fall lower than\nthe lowest unless you are set high above the rest of the world.--I\nexpress my thoughts badly; the wounds you dealt me are too painful as\nyet, but do not think that I complain. My words are not the expression\nof any hope for myself; there is no trace of bitterness in them. Know\nthis, madame, for a certainty--I forgive you. My forgiveness is so\ncomplete that you need not feel in the least sorry that you came hither\nto find it against your will.... But you might take advantage of other\nhearts as child-like as my own, and it is my duty to spare them anguish.\nSo you have inspired the thought of justice. Expiate your sin here\non earth; God may perhaps forgive you; I wish that He may, but He is\ninexorable, and will strike.”\n\nThe broken-spirited, broken-hearted woman looked up, her eyes filled\nwith tears.\n\n“Why do you cry? Be true to your nature. You could look on indifferently\nat the torture of a heart as you broke it. That will do, madame, do not\ncry. I cannot bear it any longer. Other men will tell you that you have\ngiven them life; as for myself, I tell you, with rapture, that you have\ngiven me blank extinction. Perhaps you guess that I am not my own, that\nI am bound to live for my friends, that from this time forth I must\nendure the cold chill of death, as well as the burden of life? Is it\npossible that there can be so much kindness in you? Are you like the\ndesert tigress that licks the wounds she has inflicted?”\n\nThe Duchess burst out sobbing.\n\n“Pray spare your tears, madame. If I believed in them at all, it would\nmerely set me on my guard. Is this another of your artifices? or is it\nnot? You have used so many with me; how can one think that there is any\ntruth in you? Nothing that you do or say has any power now to move me.\nThat is all I have to say.”\n\nMme de Langeais rose to her feet, with a great dignity and humility in\nher bearing.\n\n“You are right to treat me very hardly,” she said, holding out a hand to\nthe man who did not take it; “you have not spoken hardly enough; and I\ndeserve this punishment.”\n\n“_I_ punish you, madame! A man must love still, to punish, must he not?\nFrom me you must expect no feeling, nothing resembling it. If I chose, I\nmight be accuser and judge in my cause, and pronounce and carry out the\nsentence. But I am about to fulfil a duty, not a desire of vengeance of\nany kind. The cruelest revenge of all, I think, is scorn of revenge when\nit is in our power to take it. Perhaps I shall be the minister of your\npleasures; who knows? Perhaps from this time forth, as you gracefully\nwear the tokens of disgrace by which society marks out the criminal, you\nmay perforce learn something of the convict’s sense of honour. And then,\nyou will love!”\n\nThe Duchess sat listening; her meekness was unfeigned; it was no\ncoquettish device. When she spoke at last, it was after a silence.\n\n“Armand,” she began, “it seems to me that when I resisted love, I was\nobeying all the instincts of woman’s modesty; I should not have looked\nfor such reproaches from _you_. I was weak; you have turned all my\nweaknesses against me, and made so many crimes of them. How could you\nfail to understand that the curiosity of love might have carried me\nfurther than I ought to go; and that next morning I might be angry\nwith myself, and wretched because I had gone too far? Alas! I sinned in\nignorance. I was as sincere in my wrongdoing, I swear to you, as in\nmy remorse. There was far more love for you in my severity than in my\nconcessions. And besides, of what do you complain? I gave you my heart;\nthat was not enough; you demanded, brutally, that I should give my\nperson----”\n\n“Brutally?” repeated Montriveau. But to himself he said, “If I once\nallow her to dispute over words, I am lost.”\n\n“Yes. You came to me as if I were one of those women. You showed none\nof the respect, none of the attentions of love. Had I not reason to\nreflect? Very well, I reflected. The unseemliness of your conduct is not\ninexcusable; love lay at the source of it; let me think so, and\njustify you to myself.--Well, Armand, this evening, even while you were\nprophesying evil, I felt convinced that there was happiness in store for\nus both. Yes, I put my faith in the noble, proud nature so often tested\nand proved.” She bent lower. “And I was yours wholly,” she murmured in\nhis ear. “I felt a longing that I cannot express to give happiness to a\nman so violently tried by adversity. If I must have a master, my master\nshould be a great man. As I felt conscious of my height, the less I\ncared to descend. I felt I could trust you, I saw a whole lifetime of\nlove, while you were pointing to death.... Strength and kindness always\ngo together. My friend, you are so strong, you will not be unkind to\na helpless woman who loves you. If I was wrong, is there no way of\nobtaining forgiveness? No way of making reparation? Repentance is the\ncharm of love; I should like to be very charming for you. How could I,\nalone among women, fail to know a woman’s doubts and fears, the timidity\nthat it is so natural to feel when you bind yourself for life, and\nknow how easily a man snaps such ties? The bourgeoises, with whom you\ncompared me just now, give themselves, but they struggle first. Very\nwell--I struggled; but here I am!--Ah! God, he does not hear me!” she\nbroke off, and wringing her hands, she cried out “But I love you! I am\nyours!” and fell at Armand’s feet.\n\n“Yours! yours! my one and only master!”\n\nArmand tried to raise her.\n\n“Madame, it is too late! Antoinette cannot save the Duchesse de\nLangeais. I cannot believe in either. Today you may give yourself;\ntomorrow, you may refuse. No power in earth or heaven can insure me the\nsweet constancy of love. All love’s pledges lay in the past; and now\nnothing of that past exists.”\n\nThe light behind the curtain blazed up so brightly, that the Duchess\ncould not help turning her head; this time she distinctly saw the three\nmasked figures.\n\n“Armand,” she said, “I would not wish to think ill of you. Why are those\nmen there? What are you going to do to me?”\n\n“Those men will be as silent as I myself with regard to the thing which\nis about to be done. Think of them simply as my hands and my heart. One\nof them is a surgeon----”\n\n“A surgeon! Armand, my friend, of all things, suspense is the hardest\nto bear. Just speak; tell me if you wish for my life; I will give it to\nyou, you shall not take it----”\n\n“Then you did not understand me? Did I not speak just now of justice?\nTo put an end to your misapprehensions,” continued he, taking up a small\nsteel object from the table, “I will now explain what I have decided\nwith regard to you.”\n\nHe held out a Lorraine cross, fastened to the tip of a steel rod.\n\n“Two of my friends at this very moment are heating another cross, made\non this pattern, red-hot. We are going to stamp it upon your forehead,\nhere between the eyes, so that there will be no possibility of hiding\nthe mark with diamonds, and so avoiding people’s questions. In short,\nyou shall bear on your forehead the brand of infamy which your brothers\nthe convicts wear on their shoulders. The pain is a mere trifle, but I\nfeared a nervous crisis of some kind, of resistance----”\n\n“Resistance?” she cried, clapping her hands for joy. “Oh no, no! I would\nhave the whole world here to see. Ah, my Armand, brand her quickly,\nthis creature of yours; brand her with your mark as a poor little trifle\nbelonging to you. You asked for pledges of my love; here they are all in\none. Ah! for me there is nothing but mercy and forgiveness and eternal\nhappiness in this revenge of yours. When you have marked this woman with\nyour mark, when you set your crimson brand on her, your slave in soul,\nyou can never afterwards abandon her, you will be mine for evermore?\nWhen you cut me off from my kind, you make yourself responsible for my\nhappiness, or you prove yourself base; and I know that you are noble and\ngreat! Why, when a woman loves, the brand of love is burnt into her\nsoul by her own will.--Come in, gentlemen! come in and brand her,\nthis Duchesse de Langeais. She is M. de Montriveau’s forever! Ah! come\nquickly, all of you, my forehead burns hotter than your fire!”\n\nArmand turned his head sharply away lest he should see the Duchess\nkneeling, quivering with the throbbings of her heart. He said some word,\nand his three friends vanished.\n\nThe women of Paris salons know how one mirror reflects another. The\nDuchess, with every motive for reading the depths of Armand’s heart, was\nall eyes; and Armand, all unsuspicious of the mirror, brushed away two\ntears as they fell. Her whole future lay in those two tears. When he\nturned round again to help her to rise, she was standing before him,\nsure of love. Her pulses must have throbbed fast when he spoke with the\nfirmness she had known so well how to use of old while she played with\nhim.\n\n“I spare you, madame. All that has taken place shall be as if it had\nnever been, you may believe me. But now, let us bid each other goodbye.\nI like to think that you were sincere in your coquetries on your sofa,\nsincere again in this outpouring of your heart. Good-bye. I feel that\nthere is no faith in you left in me. You would torment me again; you\nwould always be the Duchess, and----But there, good-bye, we shall never\nunderstand each other.\n\n“Now, what do you wish?” he continued, taking the tone of a master of\nthe ceremonies--“to return home, or to go back to Mme de Serizy’s\nball? I have done all in my power to prevent any scandal. Neither your\nservants nor anyone else can possibly know what has passed between us\nin the last quarter of an hour. Your servants have no idea that you have\nleft the ballroom; your carriage never left Mme de Serizy’s courtyard;\nyour brougham may likewise be found in the court of your own hotel.\nWhere do you wish to be?”\n\n“What do you counsel, Armand?”\n\n“There is no Armand now, Mme la Duchesse. We are strangers to each\nother.”\n\n“Then take me to the ball,” she said, still curious to put Armand’s\npower to the test. “Thrust a soul that suffered in the world, and must\nalways suffer there, if there is no happiness for her now, down into\nhell again. And yet, oh my friend, I love you as your bourgeoises love;\nI love you so that I could come to you and fling my arms about your neck\nbefore all the world if you asked it off me. The hateful world has not\ncorrupted me. I am young at least, and I have grown younger still. I am\na child, yes, your child, your new creature. Ah! do not drive me forth\nout of my Eden!”\n\nArmand shook his head.\n\n“Ah! let me take something with me, if I go, some little thing to wear\ntonight on my heart,” she said, taking possession of Armand’s glove,\nwhich she twisted into her handkerchief.\n\n“No, I am _not_ like all those depraved women. You do not know the\nworld, and so you cannot know my worth. You shall know it now! There are\nwomen who sell themselves for money; there are others to be gained by\ngifts, it is a vile world! Oh, I wish I were a simple bourgeoise, a\nworking girl, if you would rather have a woman beneath you than a woman\nwhose devotion is accompanied by high rank, as men count it. Oh, my\nArmand, there are noble, high, and chaste and pure natures among us;\nand then they are lovely indeed. I would have all nobleness that I might\noffer it all up to you. Misfortune willed that I should be a duchess;\nI would I were a royal princess, that my offering might be complete. I\nwould be a grisette for you, and a queen for everyone besides.”\n\nHe listened, damping his cigars with his lips.\n\n“You will let me know when you wish to go,” he said.\n\n“But I should like to stay----”\n\n“That is another matter!”\n\n“Stay, that was badly rolled,” she cried, seizing on a cigar and\ndevouring all that Armand’s lips had touched.\n\n“Do you smoke?”\n\n“Oh, what would I not do to please you?”\n\n“Very well. Go, madame.”\n\n“I will obey you,” she answered, with tears in her eyes.\n\n“You must be blindfolded; you must not see a glimpse of the way.”\n\n“I am ready, Armand,” she said, bandaging her eyes.\n\n“Can you see?”\n\n“No.”\n\nNoiselessly he knelt before her.\n\n“Ah! I can hear you!” she cried, with a little fond gesture, thinking\nthat the pretence of harshness was over.\n\nHe made as if he would kiss her lips; she held up her face.\n\n“You can see, madame.”\n\n“I am just a little bit curious.”\n\n“So you always deceive me?”\n\n“Ah! take off this handkerchief, sir,” she cried out, with the passion\nof a great generosity repelled with scorn, “lead me; I will not open my\neyes.”\n\nArmand felt sure of her after that cry. He led the way; the Duchess\nnobly true to her word, was blind. But while Montriveau held her hand\nas a father might, and led her up and down flights of stairs, he was\nstudying the throbbing pulses of this woman’s heart so suddenly invaded\nby Love. Mme de Langeais, rejoicing in this power of speech, was glad to\nlet him know all; but he was inflexible; his hand was passive in reply\nto the questionings of her hand.\n\nAt length, after some journey made together, Armand bade her go forward;\nthe opening was doubtless narrow, for as she went she felt that his hand\nprotected her dress. His care touched her; it was a revelation surely\nthat there was a little love still left; yet it was in some sort a\nfarewell, for Montriveau left her without a word. The air was warm; the\nDuchess, feeling the heat, opened her eyes, and found herself standing\nby the fire in the Comtesse de Serizy’s boudoir.\n\nShe was alone. Her first thought was for her disordered toilette; in a\nmoment she had adjusted her dress and restored her picturesque coiffure.\n\n“Well, dear Antoinette, we have been looking for you everywhere.” It was\nthe Comtesse de Serizy who spoke as she opened the door.\n\n“I came here to breathe,” said the Duchess; “it is unbearably hot in the\nrooms.”\n\n“People thought that you had gone; but my brother Ronquerolles told me\nthat your servants were waiting for you.”\n\n“I am tired out, dear, let me stay and rest here for a minute,” and the\nDuchess sat down on the sofa.\n\n“Why, what is the matter with you? You are shaking from head to foot!”\n\nThe Marquis de Ronquerolles came in.\n\n“Mme la Duchesse, I was afraid that something might have happened. I\nhave just come across your coachman, the man is as tipsy as all the\nSwiss in Switzerland.”\n\nThe Duchess made no answer; she was looking round the room, at the\nchimney-piece and the tall mirrors, seeking the trace of an opening.\nThen with an extraordinary sensation she recollected that she was again\nin the midst of the gaiety of the ballroom after that terrific scene\nwhich had changed the whole course of her life. She began to shiver\nviolently.\n\n“M. de Montriveau’s prophecy has shaken my nerves,” she said. “It was\na joke, but still I will see whether his axe from London will haunt me\neven in my sleep. So good-bye, dear.--Good-bye, M. le Marquis.”\n\nAs she went through the rooms she was beset with inquiries and regrets.\nHer world seemed to have dwindled now that she, its queen, had fallen so\nlow, was so diminished. And what, moreover, were these men compared with\nhim whom she loved with all her heart; with the man grown great by all\nthat she had lost in stature? The giant had regained the height that he\nhad lost for a while, and she exaggerated it perhaps beyond measure. She\nlooked, in spite of herself, at the servant who had attended her to the\nball. He was fast asleep.\n\n“Have you been here all the time?” she asked.\n\n“Yes, madame.”\n\nAs she took her seat in her carriage she saw, in fact, that her coachman\nwas drunk--so drunk, that at any other time she would have been afraid;\nbut after a great crisis in life, fear loses its appetite for common\nfood. She reached home, at any rate, without accident; but even there\nshe felt a change in herself, a new feeling that she could not shake\noff. For her, there was now but one man in the world; which is to say\nthat henceforth she cared to shine for his sake alone.\n\nWhile the physiologist can define love promptly by following out natural\nlaws, the moralist finds a far more perplexing problem before him if\nhe attempts to consider love in all its developments due to social\nconditions. Still, in spite of the heresies of the endless sects that\ndivide the church of Love, there is one broad and trenchant line of\ndifference in doctrine, a line that all the discussion in the world can\nnever deflect. A rigid application of this line explains the nature\nof the crisis through which the Duchess, like most women, was to pass.\nPassion she knew, but she did not love as yet.\n\nLove and passion are two different conditions which poets and men of the\nworld, philosophers and fools, alike continually confound. Love implies\na give and take, a certainty of bliss that nothing can change; it\nmeans so close a clinging of the heart, and an exchange of happiness so\nconstant, that there is no room left for jealousy. Then possession is a\nmeans and not an end; unfaithfulness may give pain, but the bond is not\nless close; the soul is neither more nor less ardent or troubled, but\nhappy at every moment; in short, the divine breath of desire spreading\nfrom end to end of the immensity of Time steeps it all for us in the\nselfsame hue; life takes the tint of the unclouded heaven. But Passion\nis the foreshadowing of Love, and of that Infinite to which all\nsuffering souls aspire. Passion is a hope that may be cheated. Passion\nmeans both suffering and transition. Passion dies out when hope is\ndead. Men and women may pass through this experience many times without\ndishonor, for it is so natural to spring towards happiness; but there is\nonly one love in a lifetime. All discussions of sentiment ever\nconducted on paper or by word of mouth may therefore be resumed by\ntwo questions--“Is it passion? Is it love?” So, since love comes into\nexistence only through the intimate experience of the bliss which gives\nit lasting life, the Duchess was beneath the yoke of passion as yet; and\nas she knew the fierce tumult, the unconscious calculations, the fevered\ncravings, and all that is meant by that word _passion_--she suffered.\nThrough all the trouble of her soul there rose eddying gusts of tempest,\nraised by vanity or self-love, or pride or a high spirit; for all these\nforms of egoism make common cause together.\n\nShe had said to this man, “I love you; I am yours!” Was it possible that\nthe Duchesse de Langeais should have uttered those words--in vain? She\nmust either be loved now or play her part of queen no longer. And then\nshe felt the loneliness of the luxurious couch where pleasure had never\nyet set his glowing feet; and over and over again, while she tossed and\nwrithed there, she said, “I want to be loved.”\n\nBut the belief that she still had in herself gave her hope of success.\nThe Duchess might be piqued, the vain Parisienne might be humiliated;\nbut the woman saw glimpses of wedded happiness, and imagination,\navenging the time lost for nature, took a delight in kindling the\ninextinguishable fire in her veins. She all but attained to the\nsensations of love; for amid her poignant doubt whether she was loved in\nreturn, she felt glad at heart to say to herself, “I love him!” As for\nher scruples, religion, and the world she could trample them under foot!\nMontriveau was her religion now. She spent the next day in a state\nof moral torpor, troubled by a physical unrest, which no words could\nexpress. She wrote letters and tore them all up, and invented a thousand\nimpossible fancies.\n\nWhen M. de Montriveau’s usual hour arrived, she tried to think that he\nwould come, and enjoyed the feeling of expectation. Her whole life was\nconcentrated in the single sense of hearing. Sometimes she shut her\neyes, straining her ears to listen through space, wishing that she\ncould annihilate everything that lay between her and her lover, and so\nestablish that perfect silence which sounds may traverse from afar. In\nher tense self-concentration, the ticking of the clock grew hateful\nto her; she stopped its ill-omened garrulity. The twelve strokes of\nmidnight sounded from the drawing-room.\n\n“Ah, God!” she cried, “to see him here would be happiness. And yet, it\nis not so very long since he came here, brought by desire, and the tones\nof his voice filled this boudoir. And now there is nothing.”\n\nShe remembered the times that she had played the coquette with him, and\nhow that her coquetry had cost her her lover, and the despairing tears\nflowed for long.\n\nHer woman came at length with, “Mme la Duchesse does not know, perhaps,\nthat it is two o’clock in the morning; I thought that madame was not\nfeeling well.”\n\n“Yes, I am going to bed,” said the Duchess, drying her eyes. “But\nremember, Suzanne, never to come in again without orders; I tell you\nthis for the last time.”\n\nFor a week, Mme de Langeais went to every house where there was a hope\nof meeting M. de Montriveau. Contrary to her usual habits, she came\nearly and went late; gave up dancing, and went to the card-tables. Her\nexperiments were fruitless. She did not succeed in getting a glimpse of\nArmand. She did not dare to utter his name now. One evening, however, in\na fit of despair, she spoke to Mme de Serizy, and asked as carelessly as\nshe could, “You must have quarreled with M. de Montriveau? He is not to\nbe seen at your house now.”\n\nThe Countess laughed. “So he does not come here either?” she returned.\n“He is not to be seen anywhere, for that matter. He is interested in\nsome woman, no doubt.”\n\n“I used to think that the Marquis de Ronquerolles was one of his\nfriends----” the Duchess began sweetly.\n\n“I have never heard my brother say that he was acquainted with him.”\n\nMme de Langeais did not reply. Mme de Serizy concluded from the\nDuchess’s silence that she might apply the scourge with impunity to a\ndiscreet friendship which she had seen, with bitterness of soul, for a\nlong time past.\n\n“So you miss that melancholy personage, do you? I have heard most\nextraordinary things of him. Wound his feelings, he never comes back,\nhe forgives nothing; and, if you love him, he keeps you in chains. To\neverything that I said of him, one of those that praise him sky-high\nwould always answer, ‘He knows how to love!’ People are always telling\nme that Montriveau would give up all for his friend; that his is a great\nnature. Pooh! society does not want such tremendous natures. Men of that\nstamp are all very well at home; let them stay there and leave us to our\npleasant littlenesses. What do you say, Antoinette?”\n\nWoman of the world though she was, the Duchess seemed agitated, yet she\nreplied in a natural voice that deceived her fair friend:\n\n“I am sorry to miss him. I took a great interest in him, and promised\nto myself to be his sincere friend. I like great natures, dear friend,\nridiculous though you may think it. To give oneself to a fool is a clear\nconfession, is it not, that one is governed wholly by one’s senses?”\n\nMme de Serizy’s “preferences” had always been for commonplace men; her\nlover at the moment, the Marquis d’Aiglemont, was a fine, tall man.\n\nAfter this, the Countess soon took her departure, you may be sure Mme\nde Langeais saw hope in Armand’s withdrawal from the world; she wrote to\nhim at once; it was a humble, gentle letter, surely it would bring him\nif he loved her still. She sent her footman with it next day. On the\nservant’s return, she asked whether he had given the letter to M. de\nMontriveau himself, and could not restrain the movement of joy at the\naffirmative answer. Armand was in Paris! He stayed alone in his house;\nhe did not go out into society! So she was loved! All day long she\nwaited for an answer that never came. Again and again, when impatience\ngrew unbearable, Antoinette found reasons for his delay. Armand felt\nembarrassed; the reply would come by post; but night came, and she could\nnot deceive herself any longer. It was a dreadful day, a day of pain\ngrown sweet, of intolerable heart-throbs, a day when the heart squanders\nthe very forces of life in riot.\n\nNext day she sent for an answer.\n\n“M. le Marquis sent word that he would call on Mme la Duchesse,”\n reported Julien.\n\nShe fled lest her happiness should be seen in her face, and flung\nherself on her couch to devour her first sensations.\n\n“He is coming!”\n\nThe thought rent her soul. And, in truth, woe unto those for whom\nsuspense is not the most horrible time of tempest, while it increases\nand multiplies the sweetest joys; for they have nothing in them of\nthat flame which quickens the images of things, giving to them a second\nexistence, so that we cling as closely to the pure essence as to its\noutward and visible manifestation. What is suspense in love but a\nconstant drawing upon an unfailing hope?--a submission to the terrible\nscourging of passion, while passion is yet happy, and the disenchantment\nof reality has not set in. The constant putting forth of strength and\nlonging, called suspense, is surely, to the human soul, as fragrance\nto the flower that breathes it forth. We soon leave the brilliant,\nunsatisfying colours of tulips and coreopsis, but we turn again and\nagain to drink in the sweetness of orange-blossoms or volkameria-flowers\ncompared separately, each in its own land, to a betrothed bride, full of\nlove, made fair by the past and future.\n\nThe Duchess learned the joys of this new life of hers through the\nrapture with which she received the scourgings of love. As this change\nwrought in her, she saw other destinies before her, and a better\nmeaning in the things of life. As she hurried to her dressing-room, she\nunderstood what studied adornment and the most minute attention to\nher toilet mean when these are undertaken for love’s sake and not for\nvanity. Even now this making ready helped her to bear the long time of\nwaiting. A relapse of intense agitation set in when she was dressed; she\npassed through nervous paroxysms brought on by the dreadful power which\nsets the whole mind in ferment. Perhaps that power is only a disease,\nthough the pain of it is sweet. The Duchess was dressed and waiting\nat two o clock in the afternoon. At half-past eleven that night M.\nde Montriveau had not arrived. To try to give an idea of the anguish\nendured by a woman who might be said to be the spoilt child of\ncivilization, would be to attempt to say how many imaginings the heart\ncan condense into one thought. As well endeavour to measure the forces\nexpended by the soul in a sigh whenever the bell rang; to estimate the\ndrain of life when a carriage rolled past without stopping, and left her\nprostrate.\n\n“Can he be playing with me?” she said, as the clocks struck midnight.\n\nShe grew white; her teeth chattered; she struck her hands together and\nleapt up and crossed the boudoir, recollecting as she did so how often\nhe had come thither without a summons. But she resigned herself. Had she\nnot seen him grow pale, and start up under the stinging barbs of irony?\nThen Mme de Langeais felt the horror of the woman’s appointed lot; a\nman’s is the active part, a woman must wait passively when she loves. If\na woman goes beyond her beloved, she makes a mistake which few men can\nforgive; almost every man would feel that a woman lowers herself by this\npiece of angelic flattery. But Armand’s was a great nature; he surely\nmust be one of the very few who can repay such exceeding love by love\nthat lasts forever.\n\n“Well, I will make the advance,” she told herself, as she tossed on her\nbed and found no sleep there; “I will go to him. I will not weary myself\nwith holding out a hand to him, but I will hold it out. A man of a\nthousand will see a promise of love and constancy in every step that a\nwoman takes towards him. Yes, the angels must come down from heaven to\nreach men; and I wish to be an angel for him.”\n\nNext day she wrote. It was a billet of the kind in which the intellects\nof the ten thousand Sevignes that Paris now can number particularly\nexcel. And yet only a Duchesse de Langeais, brought up by Mme la\nPrincesse de Blamont-Chauvry, could have written that delicious note; no\nother woman could complain without lowering herself; could spread wings\nin such a flight without draggling her pinions in humiliation; rise\ngracefully in revolt; scold without giving offence; and pardon without\ncompromising her personal dignity.\n\nJulien went with the note. Julien, like his kind, was the victim of\nlove’s marches and countermarches.\n\n“What did M. de Montriveau reply?” she asked, as indifferently as she\ncould, when the man came back to report himself.\n\n“M. le Marquis requested me to tell Mme la Duchesse that it was all\nright.”\n\nOh the dreadful reaction of the soul upon herself! To have her heart\nstretched on the rack before curious witnesses; yet not to utter a\nsound, to be forced to keep silence! One of the countless miseries of\nthe rich!\n\nMore than three weeks went by. Mme de Langeais wrote again and again,\nand no answer came from Montriveau. At last she gave out that she was\nill, to gain a dispensation from attendance on the Princess and from\nsocial duties. She was only at home to her father the Duc de Navarreins,\nher aunt the Princesse de Blamont-Chauvry, the old Vidame de Pamiers\n(her maternal great-uncle), and to her husband’s uncle, the Duc de\nGrandlieu. These persons found no difficulty in believing that the\nDuchess was ill, seeing that she grew thinner and paler and more\ndejected every day. The vague ardour of love, the smart of wounded\npride, the continual prick of the only scorn that could touch her,\nthe yearnings towards joys that she craved with a vain continual\nlonging--all these things told upon her, mind and body; all the forces\nof her nature were stimulated to no purpose. She was paying the arrears\nof her life of make-believe.\n\nShe went out at last to a review. M. de Montriveau was to be there. For\nthe Duchess, on the balcony of the Tuileries with the Royal Family,\nit was one of those festival days that are long remembered. She looked\nsupremely beautiful in her languor; she was greeted with admiration in\nall eyes. It was Montriveau’s presence that made her so fair.\n\nOnce or twice they exchanged glances. The General came almost to her\nfeet in all the glory of that soldier’s uniform, which produces an\neffect upon the feminine imagination to which the most prudish will\nconfess. When a woman is very much in love, and has not seen her lover\nfor two months, such a swift moment must be something like the phase of\na dream when the eyes embrace a world that stretches away forever.\nOnly women or young men can imagine the dull, frenzied hunger in the\nDuchess’s eyes. As for older men, if during the paroxysms of early\npassion in youth they had experience of such phenomena of nervous power;\nat a later day it is so completely forgotten that they deny the very\nexistence of the luxuriant ecstasy--the only name that can be given to\nthese wonderful intuitions. Religious ecstasy is the aberration of a\nsoul that has shaken off its bonds of flesh; whereas in amorous ecstasy\nall the forces of soul and body are embraced and blended in one. If\na woman falls a victim to the tyrannous frenzy before which Mme de\nLangeais was forced to bend, she will take one decisive resolution\nafter another so swiftly that it is impossible to give account of them.\nThought after thought rises and flits across her brain, as clouds are\nwhirled by the wind across the grey veil of mist that shuts out the sun.\nThenceforth the facts reveal all. And the facts are these.\n\nThe day after the review, Mme de Langeais sent her carriage and liveried\nservants to wait at the Marquis de Montriveau’s door from eight o’clock\nin the morning till three in the afternoon. Armand lived in the Rue de\nTournon, a few steps away from the Chamber of Peers, and that very\nday the House was sitting; but long before the peers returned to their\npalaces, several people had recognised the Duchess’s carriage and\nliveries. The first of these was the Baron de Maulincour. That young\nofficer had met with disdain from Mme de Langeais and a better reception\nfrom Mme de Serizy; he betook himself at once therefore to his mistress,\nand under seal of secrecy told her of this strange freak.\n\nIn a moment the news was spread with telegraphic speed through all the\ncoteries in the Faubourg Saint-Germain; it reached the Tuileries and the\nElysee-Bourbon; it was the sensation of the day, the matter of all the\ntalk from noon till night. Almost everywhere the women denied the facts,\nbut in such a manner that the report was confirmed; the men one and\nall believed it, and manifested a most indulgent interest in Mme de\nLangeais. Some among them threw the blame on Armand.\n\n“That savage of a Montriveau is a man of bronze,” said they; “he\ninsisted on making this scandal, no doubt.”\n\n“Very well, then,” others replied, “Mme de Langeais has been guilty of\na most generous piece of imprudence. To renounce the world and rank, and\nfortune, and consideration for her lover’s sake, and that in the face\nof all Paris, is as fine a _coup d’etat_ for a woman as that barber’s\nknife-thrust, which so affected Canning in a court of assize. Not one\nof the women who blame the Duchess would make a declaration worthy of\nancient times. It is heroic of Mme de Langeais to proclaim herself so\nfrankly. Now there is nothing left to her but to love Montriveau. There\nmust be something great about a woman if she says, ‘I will have but one\npassion.’”\n\n“But what is to become of society, monsieur, if you honour vice in this\nway without respect for virtue?” asked the Comtesse de Granville, the\nattorney-general’s wife.\n\nWhile the Chateau, the Faubourg, and the Chaussee d’Antin were\ndiscussing the shipwreck of aristocratic virtue; while excited young men\nrushed about on horseback to make sure that the carriage was standing in\nthe Rue de Tournon, and the Duchess in consequence was beyond a doubt in\nM. de Montriveau’s rooms, Mme de Langeais, with heavy throbbing pulses,\nwas lying hidden away in her boudoir. And Armand?--he had been out all\nnight, and at that moment was walking with M. de Marsay in the Gardens\nof the Tuileries. The elder members, of Mme de Langeais’ family were\nengaged in calling upon one another, arranging to read her a homily\nand to hold a consultation as to the best way of putting a stop to the\nscandal.\n\nAt three o’clock, therefore, M. le Duc de Navarreins, the Vidame de\nPamiers, the old Princesse de Blamont-Chauvry, and the Duc de Grandlieu\nwere assembled in Mme la Duchesse de Langeais’ drawing-room. To them, as\nto all curious inquirers, the servants said that their mistress was not\nat home; the Duchess had made no exceptions to her orders. But these\nfour personages shone conspicuous in that lofty sphere, of which the\nrevolutions and hereditary pretensions are solemnly recorded year by\nyear in the _Almanach de Gotha_, wherefore without some slight sketch of\neach of them this picture of society were incomplete.\n\nThe Princesse de Blamont-Chauvry, in the feminine world, was a most\npoetic wreck of the reign of Louis Quinze. In her beautiful prime, so it\nwas said, she had done her part to win for that monarch his appellation\nof _le Bien-aime_. Of her past charms of feature, little remained save\na remarkably prominent slender nose, curved like a Turkish scimitar, now\nthe principal ornament of a countenance that put you in mind of an old\nwhite glove. Add a few powdered curls, high-heeled pantoufles, a cap\nwith upstanding loops of lace, black mittens, and a decided taste for\n_ombre_. But to do full justice to the lady, it must be said that she\nappeared in low-necked gowns of an evening (so high an opinion of her\nruins had she), wore long gloves, and raddled her cheeks with Martin’s\nclassic rouge. An appalling amiability in her wrinkles, a prodigious\nbrightness in the old lady’s eyes, a profound dignity in her whole\nperson, together with the triple barbed wit of her tongue, and an\ninfallible memory in her head, made of her a real power in the land. The\nwhole Cabinet des Chartes was entered in duplicate on the parchment\nof her brain. She knew all the genealogies of every noble house in\nEurope--princes, dukes, and counts--and could put her hand on the last\ndescendants of Charlemagne in the direct line. No usurpation of title\ncould escape the Princesse de Blamont-Chauvry.\n\nYoung men who wished to stand well at Court, ambitious men, and young\nmarried women paid her assiduous homage. Her salon set the tone of the\nFaubourg Saint-Germain. The words of this Talleyrand in petticoats\nwere taken as final decrees. People came to consult her on questions of\netiquette or usages, or to take lessons in good taste. And, in truth,\nno other old woman could put back her snuff-box in her pocket as the\nPrincess could; while there was a precision and a grace about the\nmovements of her skirts, when she sat down or crossed her feet, which\ndrove the finest ladies of the young generation to despair. Her voice\nhad remained in her head during one-third of her lifetime; but she could\nnot prevent a descent into the membranes of the nose, which lent to it a\npeculiar expressiveness. She still retained a hundred and fifty thousand\nlivres of her great fortune, for Napoleon had generously returned her\nwoods to her; so that personally and in the matter of possessions she\nwas a woman of no little consequence.\n\nThis curious antique, seated in a low chair by the fireside, was\nchatting with the Vidame de Pamiers, a contemporary ruin. The Vidame was\na big, tall, and spare man, a seigneur of the old school, and had been\na Commander of the Order of Malta. His neck had always been so tightly\ncompressed by a strangulation stock, that his cheeks pouched over it a\nlittle, and he held his head high; to many people this would have given\nan air of self-sufficiency, but in the Vidame it was justified by a\nVoltairean wit. His wide prominent eyes seemed to see everything, and as\na matter of fact there was not much that they had not seen. Altogether,\nhis person was a perfect model of aristocratic outline, slim and\nslender, supple and agreeable. He seemed as if he could be pliant or\nrigid at will, and twist and bend, or rear his head like a snake.\n\nThe Duc de Navarreins was pacing up and down the room with the Duc de\nGrandlieu. Both were men of fifty-six or thereabouts, and still hale;\nboth were short, corpulent, flourishing, somewhat florid-complexioned\nmen with jaded eyes, and lower lips that had begun to hang already. But\nfor an exquisite refinement of accent, an urbane courtesy, and an ease\nof manner that could change in a moment to insolence, a superficial\nobserver might have taken them for a couple of bankers. Any such mistake\nwould have been impossible, however, if the listener could have heard\nthem converse, and seen them on their guard with men whom they feared,\nvapid and commonplace with their equals, slippery with the inferiors\nwhom courtiers and statesmen know how to tame by a tactful word, or to\nhumiliate with an unexpected phrase.\n\nSuch were the representatives of the great noblesse that determined to\nperish rather than submit to any change. It was a noblesse that deserved\npraise and blame in equal measure; a noblesse that will never be judged\nimpartially until some poet shall arise to tell how joyfully the nobles\nobeyed the King though their heads fell under a Richelieu’s axe, and how\ndeeply they scorned the guillotine of ‘89 as a foul revenge.\n\nAnother noticeable trait in all the four was a thin voice that agreed\npeculiarly well with their ideas and bearing. Among themselves, at any\nrate, they were on terms of perfect equality. None of them betrayed\nany sign of annoyance over the Duchess’s escapade, but all of them had\nlearned at Court to hide their feelings.\n\nAnd here, lest critics should condemn the puerility of the opening of\nthe forthcoming scene, it is perhaps as well to remind the reader that\nLocke, once happening to be in the company of several great lords,\nrenowned no less for their wit than for their breeding and political\nconsistency, wickedly amused himself by taking down their conversation\nby some shorthand process of his own; and afterwards, when he read\nit over to them to see what they could make of it, they all burst out\nlaughing. And, in truth, the tinsel jargon which circulates among the\nupper ranks in every country yields mighty little gold to the crucible\nwhen washed in the ashes of literature or philosophy. In every rank of\nsociety (some few Parisian salons excepted) the curious observer finds\nfolly a constant quantity beneath a more or less transparent varnish.\nConversation with any substance in it is a rare exception, and\nboeotianism is current coin in every zone. In the higher regions they\nmust perforce talk more, but to make up for it they think the less.\nThinking is a tiring exercise, and the rich like their lives to flow by\neasily and without effort. It is by comparing the fundamental matter of\njests, as you rise in the social scale from the street-boy to the peer\nof France, that the observer arrives at a true comprehension of M. de\nTalleyrand’s maxim, “The manner is everything”; an elegant rendering of\nthe legal axiom, “The form is of more consequence than the matter.” In\nthe eyes of the poet the advantage rests with the lower classes, for\nthey seldom fail to give a certain character of rude poetry to their\nthoughts. Perhaps also this same observation may explain the sterility\nof the salons, their emptiness, their shallowness, and the repugnance\nfelt by men of ability for bartering their ideas for such pitiful small\nchange.\n\nThe Duke suddenly stopped as if some bright idea occurred to him, and\nremarked to his neighbour:\n\n“So you have sold Tornthon?”\n\n“No, he is ill. I am very much afraid I shall lose him, and I should be\nuncommonly sorry. He is a very good hunter. Do you know how the Duchesse\nde Marigny is?”\n\n“No. I did not go this morning. I was just going out to call when\nyou came in to speak about Antoinette. But yesterday she was very ill\nindeed; they had given her up, she took the sacrament.”\n\n“Her death will make a change in your cousin’s position.”\n\n“Not at all. She gave away her property in her lifetime, only keeping\nan annuity. She made over the Guebriant estate to her niece, Mme de\nSoulanges, subject to a yearly charge.”\n\n“It will be a great loss for society. She was a kind woman. Her family\nwill miss her; her experience and advice carried weight. Her son Marigny\nis an amiable man; he has a sharp wit, he can talk. He is pleasant, very\npleasant. Pleasant? oh, that no one can deny, but--ill regulated to\nthe last degree. Well, and yet it is an extraordinary thing, he is\nvery acute. He was dining at the club the other day with that moneyed\nChaussee-d’Antin set. Your uncle (he always goes there for his game\nof cards) found him there to his astonishment, and asked if he was a\nmember. ‘Yes,’ said he, ‘I don’t go into society now; I am living among\nthe bankers.’--You know why?” added the Marquis, with a meaning smile.\n\n“No,” said the Duke.\n\n“He is smitten with that little Mme Keller, Gondreville’s daughter; she\nis only lately married, and has a great vogue, they say, in that set.”\n\n“Well, Antoinette does not find time heavy on her hands, it seems,”\n remarked the Vidame.\n\n“My affection for that little woman has driven me to find a singular\npastime,” replied the Princess, as she returned her snuff-box to her\npocket.\n\n“Dear aunt, I am extremely vexed,” said the Duke, stopping short in his\nwalk. “Nobody but one of Bonaparte’s men could ask such an indecorous\nthing of a woman of fashion. Between ourselves, Antoinette might have\nmade a better choice.”\n\n“The Montriveaus are a very old family and very well connected, my\ndear,” replied the Princess; “they are related to all the noblest houses\nof Burgundy. If the Dulmen branch of the Arschoot Rivaudoults should\ncome to an end in Galicia, the Montriveaus would succeed to the Arschoot\ntitle and estates. They inherit through their great-grandfather.\n\n“Are you sure?”\n\n“I know it better than this Montriveau’s father did. I told him about\nit, I used to see a good deal of him; and, Chevalier of several orders\nthough he was, he only laughed; he was an encyclopaedist. But his\nbrother turned the relationship to good account during the emigration.\nI have heard it said that his northern kinsfolk were most kind in every\nway----”\n\n“Yes, to be sure. The Comte de Montriveau died at St. Petersburg,”\n said the Vidame. “I met him there. He was a big man with an incredible\npassion for oysters.”\n\n“However many did he eat?” asked the Duc de Grandlieu.\n\n“Ten dozen every day.”\n\n“And did they not disagree with him?”\n\n“Not the least bit in the world.”\n\n“Why, that is extraordinary! Had he neither the stone nor gout, nor any\nother complaint, in consequence?”\n\n“No; his health was perfectly good, and he died through an accident.”\n\n“By accident! Nature prompted him to eat oysters, so probably he\nrequired them; for up to a certain point our predominant tastes are\nconditions of our existence.”\n\n“I am of your opinion,” said the Princess, with a smile.\n\n“Madame, you always put a malicious construction on things,” returned\nthe Marquis.\n\n“I only want you to understand that these remarks might leave a wrong\nimpression on a young woman’s mind,” said she, and interrupted herself\nto exclaim, “But this niece, this niece of mine!”\n\n“Dear aunt, I still refuse to believe that she can have gone to M. de\nMontriveau,” said the Duc de Navarreins.\n\n“Bah!” returned the Princess.\n\n“What do you think, Vidame?” asked the Marquis.\n\n“If the Duchess were an artless simpleton, I should think that----”\n\n“But when a woman is in love she becomes an artless simpleton,” retorted\nthe Princess. “Really, my poor Vidame, you must be getting older.”\n\n“After all, what is to be done?” asked the Duke.\n\n“If my dear niece is wise,” said the Princess, “she will go to Court\nthis evening--fortunately, today is Monday, and reception day--and you\nmust see that we all rally round her and give the lie to this absurd\nrumour. There are hundreds of ways of explaining things; and if the\nMarquis de Montriveau is a gentleman, he will come to our assistance. We\nwill bring these children to listen to reason----”\n\n“But, dear aunt, it is not easy to tell M. de Montriveau the truth to\nhis face. He is one of Bonaparte’s pupils, and he has a position. Why,\nhe is one of the great men of the day; he is high up in the Guards, and\nvery useful there. He has not a spark of ambition. He is just the man to\nsay, ‘Here is my commission, leave me in peace,’ if the King should say\na word that he did not like.”\n\n“Then, pray, what are his opinions?”\n\n“Very unsound.”\n\n“Really,” sighed the Princess, “the King is, as he always has been, a\nJacobin under the Lilies of France.”\n\n“Oh! not quite so bad,” said the Vidame.\n\n“Yes; I have known him for a long while. The man that pointed out the\nCourt to his wife on the occasion of her first state dinner in public\nwith, ‘These are our people,’ could only be a black-hearted scoundrel.\nI can see Monsieur exactly the same as ever in the King. The bad brother\nwho voted so wrongly in his department of the Constituent Assembly was\nsure to compound with the Liberals and allow them to argue and talk.\nThis philosophical cant will be just as dangerous now for the younger\nbrother as it used to be for the elder; this fat man with the little\nmind is amusing himself by creating difficulties, and how his successor\nis to get out of them I do not know; he holds his younger brother in\nabhorrence; he would be glad to think as he lay dying, ‘He will not\nreign very long----’”\n\n“Aunt, he is the King, and I have the honour to be in his service----”\n\n“But does your post take away your right of free speech, my dear? You\ncome of quite as good a house as the Bourbons. If the Guises had shown a\nlittle more resolution, His Majesty would be a nobody at this day. It is\ntime I went out of this world, the noblesse is dead. Yes, it is all\nover with you, my children,” she continued, looking as she spoke at the\nVidame. “What has my niece done that the whole town should be talking\nabout her? She is in the wrong; I disapprove of her conduct, a useless\nscandal is a blunder; that is why I still have my doubts about this want\nof regard for appearances; I brought her up, and I know that----”\n\nJust at that moment the Duchess came out of her boudoir. She had\nrecognised her aunt’s voice and heard the name of Montriveau. She\nwas still in her loose morning-gown; and even as she came in, M.\nde Grandlieu, looking carelessly out of the window, saw his niece’s\ncarriage driving back along the street. The Duke took his daughter’s\nface in both hands and kissed her on the forehead.\n\n“So, dear girl,” he said, “you do not know what is going on?”\n\n“Has anything extraordinary happened, father dear?”\n\n“Why, all Paris believes that you are with M. de Montriveau.”\n\n“My dear Antoinette, you were at home all the time, were you not?”\n said the Princess, holding out a hand, which the Duchess kissed with\naffectionate respect.\n\n“Yes, dear mother; I was at home all the time. And,” she added, as she\nturned to greet the Vidame and the Marquis, “I wished that all Paris\nshould think that I was with M. de Montriveau.”\n\nThe Duke flung up his hands, struck them together in despair, and folded\nhis arms.\n\n“Then, cannot you see what will come of this mad freak?” he asked at\nlast.\n\nBut the aged Princess had suddenly risen, and stood looking steadily\nat the Duchess, the younger woman flushed, and her eyes fell. Mme de\nChauvry gently drew her closer, and said, “My little angel, let me kiss\nyou!”\n\nShe kissed her niece very affectionately on the forehead, and continued\nsmiling, while she held her hand in a tight clasp.\n\n“We are not under the Valois now, dear child. You have compromised your\nhusband and your position. Still, we will arrange to make everything\nright.”\n\n“But, dear aunt, I do not wish to make it right at all. It is my wish\nthat all Paris should say that I was with M. de Montriveau this morning.\nIf you destroy that belief, however ill grounded it may be, you will do\nme a singular disservice.”\n\n“Do you really wish to ruin yourself, child, and to grieve your family?”\n\n“My family, father, unintentionally condemned me to irreparable\nmisfortune when they sacrificed me to family considerations. You may,\nperhaps, blame me for seeking alleviations, but you will certainly feel\nfor me.”\n\n“After all the endless pains you take to settle your daughters\nsuitably!” muttered M. de Navarreins, addressing the Vidame.\n\nThe Princess shook a stray grain of snuff from her skirts. “My dear\nlittle girl,” she said, “be happy, if you can. We are not talking of\ntroubling your felicity, but of reconciling it with social usages. We\nall of us here assembled know that marriage is a defective institution\ntempered by love. But when you take a lover, is there any need to make\nyour bed in the Place du Carrousel? See now, just be a bit reasonable,\nand hear what we have to say.”\n\n“I am listening.”\n\n“Mme la Duchesse,” began the Duc de Grandlieu, “if it were any part of\nan uncle’s duty to look after his nieces, he ought to have a position;\nsociety would owe him honours and rewards and a salary, exactly as if\nhe were in the King’s service. So I am not here to talk about my nephew,\nbut of your own interests. Let us look ahead a little. If you persist in\nmaking a scandal--I have seen the animal before, and I own that I have\nno great liking for him--Langeais is stingy enough, and he does not care\na rap for anyone but himself; he will have a separation; he will stick\nto your money, and leave you poor, and consequently you will be a\nnobody. The income of a hundred thousand livres that you have just\ninherited from your maternal great-aunt will go to pay for his\nmistresses’ amusements. You will be bound and gagged by the law;\nyou will have to say _Amen_ to all these arrangements. Suppose M. de\nMontriveau leaves you----dear me! do not let us put ourselves in a\npassion, my dear niece; a man does not leave a woman while she is young\nand pretty; still, we have seen so many pretty women left disconsolate,\neven among princesses, that you will permit the supposition, an all but\nimpossible supposition I quite wish to believe.----Well, suppose that\nhe goes, what will become of you without a husband? Keep well with your\nhusband as you take care of your beauty; for beauty, after all, is a\nwoman’s parachute, and a husband also stands between you and worse. I\nam supposing that you are happy and loved to the end, and I am leaving\nunpleasant or unfortunate events altogether out of the reckoning. This\nbeing so, fortunately or unfortunately, you may have children. What are\nthey to be? Montriveaus? Very well; they certainly will not succeed to\ntheir father’s whole fortune. You will want to give them all that you\nhave; he will wish to do the same. Nothing more natural, dear me!\nAnd you will find the law against you. How many times have we\nseen heirs-at-law bringing a law-suit to recover the property from\nillegitimate children? Every court of law rings with such actions all\nover the world. You will create a _fidei commissum_ perhaps; and if the\ntrustee betrays your confidence, your children have no remedy against\nhim; and they are ruined. So choose carefully. You see the perplexities\nof the position. In every possible way your children will be sacrificed\nof necessity to the fancies of your heart; they will have no recognised\nstatus. While they are little they will be charming; but, Lord! some day\nthey will reproach you for thinking of no one but your two selves. We\nold gentlemen know all about it. Little boys grow up into men, and men\nare ungrateful beings. When I was in Germany, did I not hear young de\nHorn say, after supper, ‘If my mother had been an honest woman, I should\nbe prince-regnant!’ _If_?’ We have spent our lives in hearing plebeians\nsay _if_. _If_ brought about the Revolution. When a man cannot lay the\nblame on his father or mother, he holds God responsible for his hard\nlot. In short, dear child, we are here to open your eyes. I will say all\nI have to say in a few words, on which you had better meditate: A woman\nought never to put her husband in the right.”\n\n“Uncle, so long as I cared for nobody, I could calculate; I looked at\ninterests then, as you do; now, I can only feel.”\n\n“But, my dear little girl,” remonstrated the Vidame, “life is simply a\ncomplication of interests and feelings; to be happy, more particularly\nin your position, one must try to reconcile one’s feelings with\none’s interests. A grisette may love according to her fancy, that is\nintelligible enough, but you have a pretty fortune, a family, a name and\na place at Court, and you ought not to fling them out of the window.\nAnd what have we been asking you to do to keep them all?--To manoeuvre\ncarefully instead of falling foul of social conventions. Lord! I shall\nvery soon be eighty years old, and I cannot recollect, under any regime,\na love worth the price that you are willing to pay for the love of this\nlucky young man.”\n\nThe Duchess silenced the Vidame with a look; if Montriveau could have\nseen that glance, he would have forgiven all.\n\n“It would be very effective on the stage,” remarked the Duc de\nGrandlieu, “but it all amounts to nothing when your jointure and\nposition and independence is concerned. You are not grateful, my dear\nniece. You will not find many families where the relatives have courage\nenough to teach the wisdom gained by experience, and to make rash young\nheads listen to reason. Renounce your salvation in two minutes, if it\npleases you to damn yourself; well and good; but reflect well beforehand\nwhen it comes to renouncing your income. I know of no confessor who\nremits the pains of poverty. I have a right, I think, to speak in this\nway to you; for if you are ruined, I am the one person who can offer you\na refuge. I am almost an uncle to Langeais, and I alone have a right to\nput him in the wrong.”\n\nThe Duc de Navarreins roused himself from painful reflections.\n\n“Since you speak of feeling, my child,” he said, “let me remind you that\na woman who bears your name ought to be moved by sentiments which do\nnot touch ordinary people. Can you wish to give an advantage to the\nLiberals, to those Jesuits of Robespierre’s that are doing all they\ncan to vilify the noblesse? Some things a Navarreins cannot do\nwithout failing in duty to his house. You would not be alone in your\ndishonor----”\n\n“Come, come!” said the Princess. “Dishonor? Do not make such a fuss\nabout the journey of an empty carriage, children, and leave me alone\nwith Antoinette. All three of you come and dine with me. I will\nundertake to arrange matters suitably. You men understand nothing;\nyou are beginning to talk sourly already, and I have no wish to see a\nquarrel between you and my dear child. Do me the pleasure to go.”\n\nThe three gentlemen probably guessed the Princess’s intentions; they\ntook their leave. M. de Navarreins kissed his daughter on the forehead\nwith, “Come, be good, dear child. It is not too late yet if you choose.”\n\n“Couldn’t we find some good fellow in the family to pick a quarrel with\nthis Montriveau?” said the Vidame, as they went downstairs.\n\nWhen the two women were alone, the Princess beckoned her niece to a\nlittle low chair by her side.\n\n“My pearl,” said she, “in this world below, I know nothing worse\ncalumniated than God and the eighteenth century; for as I look back over\nmy own young days, I do not recollect that a single duchess trampled the\nproprieties underfoot as you have just done. Novelists and scribblers\nbrought the reign of Louis XV into disrepute. Do not believe them. The\ndu Barry, my dear, was quite as good as the Widow Scarron, and the more\nagreeable woman of the two. In my time a woman could keep her dignity\namong her gallantries. Indiscretion was the ruin of us, and the\nbeginning of all the mischief. The philosophists--the nobodies whom we\nadmitted into our salons--had no more gratitude or sense of decency than\nto make an inventory of our hearts, to traduce us one and all, and to\nrail against the age by way of a return for our kindness. The people are\nnot in a position to judge of anything whatsoever; they looked at the\nfacts, not at the form. But the men and women of those times, my heart,\nwere quite as remarkable as at any other period of the Monarchy. Not one\nof your Werthers, none of your notabilities, as they are called, never\na one of your men in yellow kid gloves and trousers that disguise the\npoverty of their legs, would cross Europe in the dress of a travelling\nhawker to brave the daggers of a Duke of Modena, and to shut himself up\nin the dressing-room of the Regent’s daughter at the risk of his life.\nNot one of your little consumptive patients with their tortoiseshell\neyeglasses would hide himself in a closet for six weeks, like Lauzun,\nto keep up his mistress’s courage while she was lying in of her child.\nThere was more passion in M. de Jaucourt’s little finger than in\nyour whole race of higglers that leave a woman to better themselves\nelsewhere! Just tell me where to find the page that would be cut in\npieces and buried under the floorboards for one kiss on the Konigsmark’s\ngloved finger!\n\n“Really, it would seem today that the roles are exchanged, and women\nare expected to show their devotion for men. These modern gentlemen are\nworth less, and think more of themselves. Believe me, my dear, all these\nadventures that have been made public, and now are turned against our\ngood Louis XV, were kept quite secret at first. If it had not been for\na pack of poetasters, scribblers, and moralists, who hung about our\nwaiting-women, and took down their slanders, our epoch would have\nappeared in literature as a well-conducted age. I am justifying the\ncentury and not its fringe. Perhaps a hundred women of quality were\nlost; but for every one, the rogues set down ten, like the gazettes\nafter a battle when they count up the losses of the beaten side. And in\nany case I do not know that the Revolution and the Empire can reproach\nus; they were coarse, dull, licentious times. Faugh! it is revolting.\nThose are the brothels of French history.\n\n“This preamble, my dear child,” she continued after a pause, “brings\nme to the thing that I have to say. If you care for Montriveau, you are\nquite at liberty to love him at your ease, and as much as you can. I\nknow by experience that, unless you are locked up (but locking people\nup is out of fashion now), you will do as you please; I should have done\nthe same at your age. Only, sweetheart, I should not have given up my\nright to be the mother of future Ducs de Langeais. So mind appearances.\nThe Vidame is right. No man is worth a single one of the sacrifices\nwhich we are foolish enough to make for their love. Put yourself in\nsuch a position that you may still be M. de Langeais’ wife, in case you\nshould have the misfortune to repent. When you are an old woman, you\nwill be very glad to hear mass said at Court, and not in some provincial\nconvent. Therein lies the whole question. A single imprudence means an\nallowance and a wandering life; it means that you are at the mercy of\nyour lover; it means that you must put up with insolence from women\nthat are not so honest, precisely because they have been very vulgarly\nsharp-witted. It would be a hundred times better to go to Montriveau’s\nat night in a cab, and disguised, instead of sending your carriage in\nbroad daylight. You are a little fool, my dear child! Your carriage\nflattered his vanity; your person would have ensnared his heart. All\nthis that I have said is just and true; but, for my own part, I do not\nblame you. You are two centuries behind the times with your false ideas\nof greatness. There, leave us to arrange your affairs, and say that\nMontriveau made your servants drunk to gratify his vanity and to\ncompromise you----”\n\nThe Duchess rose to her feet with a spring. “In Heaven’s name, aunt, do\nnot slander him!”\n\nThe old Princess’s eyes flashed.\n\n“Dear child,” she said, “I should have liked to spare such of your\nillusions as were not fatal. But there must be an end of all illusions\nnow. You would soften me if I were not so old. Come, now, do not vex\nhim, or us, or anyone else. I will undertake to satisfy everybody; but\npromise me not to permit yourself a single step henceforth until you\nhave consulted me. Tell me all, and perhaps I may bring it all right\nagain.”\n\n“Aunt, I promise----”\n\n“To tell me everything?”\n\n“Yes, everything. Everything that can be told.”\n\n“But, my sweetheart, it is precisely what cannot be told that I want\nto know. Let us understand each other thoroughly. Come, let me put my\nwithered old lips on your beautiful forehead. No; let me do as I wish. I\nforbid you to kiss my bones. Old people have a courtesy of their own....\nThere, take me down to my carriage,” she added, when she had kissed her\nniece.\n\n“Then may I go to him in disguise, dear aunt?”\n\n“Why--yes. The story can always be denied,” said the old Princess.\n\nThis was the one idea which the Duchess had clearly grasped in the\nsermon. When Mme de Chauvry was seated in the corner of her carriage,\nMme de Langeais bade her a graceful adieu and went up to her room. She\nwas quite happy again.\n\n“My person would have snared his heart; my aunt is right; a man cannot\nsurely refuse a pretty woman when she understands how to offer herself.”\n\nThat evening, at the Elysee-Bourbon, the Duc de Navarreins, M. de\nPamiers, M. de Marsay, M. de Grandlieu, and the Duc de Maufrigneuse\ntriumphantly refuted the scandals that were circulating with regard to\nthe Duchesse de Langeais. So many officers and other persons had seen\nMontriveau walking in the Tuileries that morning, that the silly story\nwas set down to chance, which takes all that is offered. And so,\nin spite of the fact that the Duchess’s carriage had waited before\nMontriveau’s door, her character became as clear and as spotless as\nMembrino’s sword after Sancho had polished it up.\n\nBut, at two o’clock, M. de Ronquerolles passed Montriveau in a deserted\nalley, and said with a smile, “She is coming on, is your Duchess. Go on,\nkeep it up!” he added, and gave a significant cut of the riding whip to\nhis mare, who sped off like a bullet down the avenue.\n\nTwo days after the fruitless scandal, Mme de Langeais wrote to M. de\nMontriveau. That letter, like the preceding ones, remained unanswered.\nThis time she took her own measures, and bribed M. de Montriveau’s man,\nAuguste. And so at eight o’clock that evening she was introduced into\nArmand’s apartment. It was not the room in which that secret scene had\npassed; it was entirely different. The Duchess was told that the General\nwould not be at home that night. Had he two houses? The man would give\nno answer. Mme de Langeais had bought the key of the room, but not the\nman’s whole loyalty.\n\nWhen she was left alone she saw her fourteen letters lying on an\nold-fashioned stand, all of them uncreased and unopened. He had not\nread them. She sank into an easy-chair, and for a while she lost\nconsciousness. When she came to herself, Auguste was holding vinegar for\nher to inhale.\n\n“A carriage; quick!” she ordered.\n\nThe carriage came. She hastened downstairs with convulsive speed, and\nleft orders that no one was to be admitted. For twenty-four hours she\nlay in bed, and would have no one near her but her woman, who brought\nher a cup of orange-flower water from time to time. Suzette heard\nher mistress moan once or twice, and caught a glimpse of tears in the\nbrilliant eyes, now circled with dark shadows.\n\nThe next day, amid despairing tears, Mme de Langeais took her\nresolution. Her man of business came for an interview, and no doubt\nreceived instructions of some kind. Afterwards she sent for the\nVidame de Pamiers; and while she waited, she wrote a letter to M.\nde Montriveau. The Vidame punctually came towards two o’clock that\nafternoon, to find his young cousin looking white and worn, but\nresigned; never had her divine loveliness been more poetic than now in\nthe languor of her agony.\n\n“You owe this assignation to your eighty-four years, dear cousin,” she\nsaid. “Ah! do not smile, I beg of you, when an unhappy woman has reached\nthe lowest depths of wretchedness. You are a gentleman, and after the\nadventures of your youth you must feel some indulgence for women.”\n\n“None whatever,” said he.\n\n“Indeed!”\n\n“Everything is in their favour.”\n\n“Ah! Well, you are one of the inner family circle; possibly you will be\nthe last relative, the last friend whose hand I shall press, so I can\nask your good offices. Will you, dear Vidame, do me a service which I\ncould not ask of my own father, nor of my uncle Grandlieu, nor of any\nwoman? You cannot fail to understand. I beg of you to do my bidding, and\nthen to forget what you have done, whatever may come of it. It is this:\nWill you take this letter and go to M. de Montriveau? will you see him\nyourself, give it into his hands, and ask him, as you men can ask things\nbetween yourselves--for you have a code of honour between man and man\nwhich you do not use with us, and a different way of regarding things\nbetween yourselves--ask him if he will read this letter? Not in\nyour presence. Certain feelings men hide from each other. I give you\nauthority to say, if you think it necessary to bring him, that it is a\nquestion of life or death for me. If he deigns----”\n\n“_Deigns_!” repeated the Vidame.\n\n“If he deigns to read it,” the Duchess continued with dignity, “say one\nthing more. You will go to see him about five o’clock, for I know that\nhe will dine at home today at that time. Very good. By way of answer he\nmust come to see me. If, three hours afterwards, by eight o’clock, he\ndoes not leave his house, all will be over. The Duchesse de Langeais\nwill have vanished from the world. I shall not be dead, dear friend, no,\nbut no human power will ever find me again on this earth. Come and dine\nwith me; I shall at least have one friend with me in the last agony.\nYes, dear cousin, tonight will decide my fate; and whatever happens to\nme, I pass through an ordeal by fire. There! not a word. I will hear\nnothing of the nature of comment or advice----Let us chat and laugh\ntogether,” she added, holding out a hand, which he kissed. “We will be\nlike two grey-headed philosophers who have learned how to enjoy life to\nthe last moment. I will look my best; I will be very enchanting for\nyou. You perhaps will be the last man to set eyes on the Duchesse de\nLangeais.”\n\nThe Vicomte bowed, took the letter, and went without a word. At five\no’clock he returned. His cousin had studied to please him, and she\nlooked lovely indeed. The room was gay with flowers as if for a\nfestivity; the dinner was exquisite. For the grey-headed Vidame the\nDuchess displayed all the brilliancy of her wit; she was more charming\nthan she had ever been before. At first the Vidame tried to look on\nall these preparations as a young woman’s jest; but now and again the\nattempted illusion faded, the spell of his fair cousin’s charm was\nbroken. He detected a shudder caused by some kind of sudden dread, and\nonce she seemed to listen during a pause.\n\n“What is the matter?” he asked.\n\n“Hush!” she said.\n\nAt seven o’clock the Duchess left him for a few minutes. When she came\nback again she was dressed as her maid might have dressed for a journey.\nShe asked her guest to be her escort, took his arm, sprang into a\nhackney coach, and by a quarter to eight they stood outside M. de\nMontriveau’s door.\n\nArmand meantime had been reading the following letter:--\n\n\n“MY FRIEND,--I went to your rooms for a few minutes without your\nknowledge; I found my letters there, and took them away. This cannot\nbe indifference, Armand, between us; and hatred would show itself quite\ndifferently. If you love me, make an end of this cruel play, or you will\nkill me, and afterwards, learning how much you were loved, you might be\nin despair. If I have not rightly understood you, if you have no feeling\ntowards me but aversion, which implies both contempt and disgust, then\nI give up all hope. A man never recovers from those feelings. You will\nhave no regrets. Dreadful though that thought may be, it will comfort me\nin my long sorrow. Regrets? Oh, my Armand, may I never know of them; if\nI thought that I had caused you a single regret----But, no, I will not\ntell you what desolation I should feel. I should be living still, and I\ncould not be your wife; it would be too late!\n\n“Now that I have given myself wholly to you in thought, to whom else\nshould I give myself?--to God. The eyes that you loved for a little\nwhile shall never look on another man’s face; and may the glory of God\nblind them to all besides. I shall never hear human voices more since I\nheard yours--so gentle at the first, so terrible yesterday; for it seems\nto me that I am still only on the morrow of your vengeance. And now\nmay the will of God consume me. Between His wrath and yours, my friend,\nthere will be nothing left for me but a little space for tears and\nprayers.\n\n“Perhaps you wonder why I write to you? Ah! do not think ill of me if I\nkeep a gleam of hope, and give one last sigh to happy life before I take\nleave of it forever. I am in a hideous position. I feel all the inward\nserenity that comes when a great resolution has been taken, even while I\nhear the last growlings of the storm. When you went out on that terrible\nadventure which so drew me to you, Armand, you went from the desert to\nthe oasis with a good guide to show you the way. Well, I am going out of\nthe oasis into the desert, and you are a pitiless guide to me. And yet\nyou only, my friend, can understand how melancholy it is to look back\nfor the last time on happiness--to you, and you only, I can make moan\nwithout a blush. If you grant my entreaty, I shall be happy; if you are\ninexorable, I shall expiate the wrong that I have done. After all, it is\nnatural, is it not, that a woman should wish to live, invested with all\nnoble feelings, in her friend’s memory? Oh! my one and only love, let\nher to whom you gave life go down into the tomb in the belief that she\nis great in your eyes. Your harshness led me to reflect; and now that I\nlove you so, it seems to me that I am less guilty than you think. Listen\nto my justification, I owe it to you; and you that are all the world to\nme, owe me at least a moment’s justice.\n\n“I have learned by my own anguish all that I made you suffer by my\ncoquetry; but in those days I was utterly ignorant of love. _You_ know\nwhat the torture is, and you mete it out to me! During those first eight\nmonths that you gave me you never roused any feeling of love in me. Do\nyou ask why this was so, my friend? I can no more explain it than I can\ntell you why I love you now. Oh! certainly it flattered my vanity that I\nshould be the subject of your passionate talk, and receive those burning\nglances of yours; but you left me cold. No, I was not a woman; I had\nno conception of womanly devotion and happiness. Who was to blame? You\nwould have despised me, would you not, if I had given myself without\nthe impulse of passion? Perhaps it is the highest height to which we\ncan rise--to give all and receive no joy; perhaps there is no merit in\nyielding oneself to bliss that is foreseen and ardently desired. Alas,\nmy friend, I can say this now; these thoughts came to me when I played\nwith you; and you seemed to me so great even then that I would not have\nyou owe the gift to pity----What is this that I have written?\n\n“I have taken back all my letters; I am flinging them one by one on the\nfire; they are burning. You will never know what they confessed--all the\nlove and the passion and the madness----\n\n“I will say no more, Armand; I will stop. I will not say another word of\nmy feelings. If my prayers have not echoed from my soul through yours,\nI also, woman that I am, decline to owe your love to your pity. It is my\nwish to be loved, because you cannot choose but love me, or else to\nbe left without mercy. If you refuse to read this letter, it shall be\nburnt. If, after you have read it, you do not come to me within three\nhours, to be henceforth forever my husband, the one man in the world for\nme; then I shall never blush to know that this letter is in your hands,\nthe pride of my despair will protect my memory from all insult, and my\nend shall be worthy of my love. When you see me no more on earth, albeit\nI shall still be alive, you yourself will not think without a shudder\nof the woman who, in three hours’ time, will live only to overwhelm\nyou with her tenderness; a woman consumed by a hopeless love, and\nfaithful--not to memories of past joys--but to a love that was slighted.\n\n“The Duchesse de la Valliere wept for lost happiness and vanished power;\nbut the Duchesse de Langeais will be happy that she may weep and be a\npower for you still. Yes, you will regret me. I see clearly that I was\nnot of this world, and I thank you for making it clear to me.\n\n“Farewell; you will never touch _my_ axe. Yours was the executioner’s\naxe, mine is God’s; yours kills, mine saves. Your love was but mortal,\nit could not endure disdain or ridicule; mine can endure all things\nwithout growing weaker, it will last eternally. Ah! I feel a sombre joy\nin crushing you that believe yourself so great; in humbling you with the\ncalm, indulgent smile of one of the least among the angels that lie at\nthe feet of God, for to them is given the right and the power to protect\nand watch over men in His name. You have but felt fleeting desires,\nwhile the poor nun will shed the light of her ceaseless and ardent\nprayer about you, she will shelter you all your life long beneath the\nwings of a love that has nothing of earth in it.\n\n“I have a presentiment of your answer; our trysting place shall be--in\nheaven. Strength and weakness can both enter there, dear Armand; the\nstrong and the weak are bound to suffer. This thought soothes the\nanguish of my final ordeal. So calm am I that I should fear that I had\nceased to love you if I were not about to leave the world for your sake.\n\n                                                “ANTOINETTE.”\n\n\n“Dear Vidame,” said the Duchess as they reached Montriveau’s house, “do\nme the kindness to ask at the door whether he is at home.” The Vidame,\nobedient after the manner of the eighteenth century to a woman’s wish,\ngot out, and came back to bring his cousin an affirmative answer that\nsent a shudder through her. She grasped his hand tightly in hers,\nsuffered him to kiss her on either cheek, and begged him to go at once.\nHe must not watch her movements nor try to protect her. “But the people\npassing in the street,” he objected.\n\n“No one can fail in respect to me,” she said. It was the last word\nspoken by the Duchess and the woman of fashion.\n\nThe Vidame went. Mme de Langeais wrapped herself about in her cloak,\nand stood on the doorstep until the clocks struck eight. The last stroke\ndied away. The unhappy woman waited ten, fifteen minutes; to the last\nshe tried to see a fresh humiliation in the delay, then her faith ebbed.\nShe turned to leave the fatal threshold.\n\n“Oh, God!” the cry broke from her in spite of herself; it was the first\nword spoken by the Carmelite.\n\n\n\nMontriveau and some of his friends were talking together. He tried to\nhasten them to a conclusion, but his clock was slow, and by the time he\nstarted out for the Hotel de Langeais the Duchess was hurrying on foot\nthrough the streets of Paris, goaded by the dull rage in her heart. She\nreached the Boulevard d’Enfer, and looked out for the last time through\nfalling tears on the noisy, smoky city that lay below in a red mist,\nlighted up by its own lamps. Then she hailed a cab, and drove away,\nnever to return. When the Marquis de Montriveau reached the Hotel de\nLangeais, and found no trace of his mistress, he thought that he had\nbeen duped. He hurried away at once to the Vidame, and found that worthy\ngentleman in the act of slipping on his flowered dressing-gown, thinking\nthe while of his fair cousin’s happiness.\n\nMontriveau gave him one of the terrific glances that produced the effect\nof an electric shock on men and women alike.\n\n“Is it possible that you have lent yourself to some cruel hoax,\nmonsieur?” Montriveau exclaimed. “I have just come from Mme de Langeais’\nhouse; the servants say that she is out.”\n\n“Then a great misfortune has happened, no doubt,” returned the Vidame,\n“and through your fault. I left the Duchess at your door----”\n\n“When?”\n\n“At a quarter to eight.”\n\n“Good evening,” returned Montriveau, and he hurried home to ask the\nporter whether he had seen a lady standing on the doorstep that evening.\n\n“Yes, my Lord Marquis, a handsome woman, who seemed very much put out.\nShe was crying like a Magdalen, but she never made a sound, and stood\nas upright as a post. Then at last she went, and my wife and I that were\nwatching her while she could not see us, heard her say, ‘Oh, God!’ so\nthat it went to our hearts, asking your pardon, to hear her say it.”\n\nMontriveau, in spite of all his firmness, turned pale at those few\nwords. He wrote a few lines to Ronquerolles, sent off the message at\nonce, and went up to his rooms. Ronquerolles came just about midnight.\n\nArmand gave him the Duchess’s letter to read.\n\n“Well?” asked Ronquerolles.\n\n“She was here at my door at eight o’clock; at a quarter-past eight she\nhad gone. I have lost her, and I love her. Oh! if my life were my own, I\ncould blow my brains out.”\n\n“Pooh, pooh! Keep cool,” said Ronquerolles. “Duchesses do not fly off\nlike wagtails. She cannot travel faster than three leagues an hour, and\ntomorrow we will ride six.--Confound it! Mme de Langeais is no ordinary\nwoman,” he continued. “Tomorrow we will all of us mount and ride.\nThe police will put us on her track during the day. She must have a\ncarriage; angels of that sort have no wings. We shall find her whether\nshe is on the road or hidden in Paris. There is the semaphore. We can\nstop her. You shall be happy. But, my dear fellow, you have made a\nblunder, of which men of your energy are very often guilty. They judge\nothers by themselves, and do not know the point when human nature gives\nway if you strain the cords too tightly. Why did you not say a word\nto me sooner? I would have told you to be punctual. Good-bye till\ntomorrow,” he added, as Montriveau said nothing. “Sleep if you can,” he\nadded, with a grasp of the hand.\n\nBut the greatest resources which society has ever placed at the disposal\nof statesmen, kings, ministers, bankers, or any human power, in fact,\nwere all exhausted in vain. Neither Montriveau nor his friends could\nfind any trace of the Duchess. It was clear that she had entered a\nconvent. Montriveau determined to search, or to institute a search, for\nher through every convent in the world. He must have her, even at the\ncost of all the lives in a town. And in justice to this extraordinary\nman, it must be said that his frenzied passion awoke to the same\nardour daily and lasted through five years. Only in 1829 did the Duc de\nNavarreins hear by chance that his daughter had travelled to Spain as\nLady Julia Hopwood’s maid, that she had left her service at Cadiz, and\nthat Lady Julia never discovered that Mlle Caroline was the illustrious\nduchess whose sudden disappearance filled the minds of the highest\nsociety of Paris.\n\n\n\nThe feelings of the two lovers when they met again on either side of the\ngrating in the Carmelite convent should now be comprehended to the full,\nand the violence of the passion awakened in either soul will doubtless\nexplain the catastrophe of the story.\n\nIn 1823 the Duc de Langeais was dead, and his wife was free. Antoinette\nde Navarreins was living, consumed by love, on a ledge of rock in\nthe Mediterranean; but it was in the Pope’s power to dissolve Sister\nTheresa’s vows. The happiness bought by so much love might yet bloom\nfor the two lovers. These thoughts sent Montriveau flying from Cadiz to\nMarseilles, and from Marseilles to Paris.\n\nA few months after his return to France, a merchant brig, fitted out and\nmunitioned for active service, set sail from the port of Marseilles for\nSpain. The vessel had been chartered by several distinguished men, most\nof them Frenchmen, who, smitten with a romantic passion for the East,\nwished to make a journey to those lands. Montriveau’s familiar knowledge\nof Eastern customs made him an invaluable travelling companion, and at\nthe entreaty of the rest he had joined the expedition; the Minister\nof War appointed him lieutenant-general, and put him on the Artillery\nCommission to facilitate his departure.\n\nTwenty-fours hours later the brig lay to off the north-west shore of an\nisland within sight of the Spanish coast. She had been specially chosen\nfor her shallow keel and light mastage, so that she might lie at anchor\nin safety half a league away from the reefs that secure the island from\napproach in this direction. If fishing vessels or the people on the\nisland caught sight of the brig, they were scarcely likely to feel\nsuspicious of her at once; and besides, it was easy to give a reason for\nher presence without delay. Montriveau hoisted the flag of the United\nStates before they came in sight of the island, and the crew of the\nvessel were all American sailors, who spoke nothing but English. One\nof M. de Montriveau’s companions took the men ashore in the ship’s\nlongboat, and made them so drunk at an inn in the little town that\nthey could not talk. Then he gave out that the brig was manned by\ntreasure-seekers, a gang of men whose hobby was well known in the United\nStates; indeed, some Spanish writer had written a history of them. The\npresence of the brig among the reefs was now sufficiently explained.\nThe owners of the vessel, according to the self-styled boatswain’s mate,\nwere looking for the wreck of a galleon which foundered thereabouts in\n1778 with a cargo of treasure from Mexico. The people at the inn and the\nauthorities asked no more questions.\n\nArmand, and the devoted friends who were helping him in his difficult\nenterprise, were all from the first of the opinion that there was no\nhope of rescuing or carrying off Sister Theresa by force or stratagem\nfrom the side of the little town. Wherefore these bold spirits, with one\naccord, determined to take the bull by the horns. They would make a way\nto the convent at the most seemingly inaccessible point; like General\nLamarque, at the storming of Capri, they would conquer Nature. The cliff\nat the end of the island, a sheer block of granite, afforded even less\nhold than the rock of Capri. So it seemed at least to Montriveau, who\nhad taken part in that incredible exploit, while the nuns in his eyes\nwere much more redoubtable than Sir Hudson Lowe. To raise a hubbub over\ncarrying off the Duchess would cover them with confusion. They might as\nwell set siege to the town and convent, like pirates, and leave not a\nsingle soul to tell of their victory. So for them their expedition wore\nbut two aspects. There should be a conflagration and a feat of arms\nthat should dismay all Europe, while the motives of the crime remained\nunknown; or, on the other hand, a mysterious, aerial descent which\nshould persuade the nuns that the Devil himself had paid them a visit.\nThey had decided upon the latter course in the secret council held\nbefore they left Paris, and subsequently everything had been done to\ninsure the success of an expedition which promised some real excitement\nto jaded spirits weary of Paris and its pleasures.\n\nAn extremely light pirogue, made at Marseilles on a Malayan model,\nenabled them to cross the reef, until the rocks rose from out of the\nwater. Then two cables of iron wire were fastened several feet apart\nbetween one rock and another. These wire ropes slanted upwards and\ndownwards in opposite directions, so that baskets of iron wire could\ntravel to and fro along them; and in this manner the rocks were covered\nwith a system of baskets and wire-cables, not unlike the filaments\nwhich a certain species of spider weaves about a tree. The Chinese, an\nessentially imitative people, were the first to take a lesson from the\nwork of instinct. Fragile as these bridges were, they were always ready\nfor use; high waves and the caprices of the sea could not throw them\nout of working order; the ropes hung just sufficiently slack, so as to\npresent to the breakers that particular curve discovered by Cachin, the\nimmortal creator of the harbour at Cherbourg. Against this cunningly\ndevised line the angry surge is powerless; the law of that curve was\na secret wrested from Nature by that faculty of observation in which\nnearly all human genius consists.\n\nM. de Montriveau’s companions were alone on board the vessel, and out of\nsight of every human eye. No one from the deck of a passing vessel could\nhave discovered either the brig hidden among the reefs, or the men at\nwork among the rocks; they lay below the ordinary range of the most\npowerful telescope. Eleven days were spent in preparation, before the\nThirteen, with all their infernal power, could reach the foot of the\ncliffs. The body of the rock rose up straight from the sea to a height\nof thirty fathoms. Any attempt to climb the sheer wall of granite seemed\nimpossible; a mouse might as well try to creep up the slippery sides of\na plain china vase. Still there was a cleft, a straight line of fissure\nso fortunately placed that large blocks of wood could be wedged firmly\ninto it at a distance of about a foot apart. Into these blocks the\ndaring workers drove iron cramps, specially made for the purpose, with\na broad iron bracket at the outer end, through which a hole had been\ndrilled. Each bracket carried a light deal board which corresponded with\na notch made in a pole that reached to the top of the cliffs, and was\nfirmly planted in the beach at their feet. With ingenuity worthy of\nthese men who found nothing impossible, one of their number, a skilled\nmathematician, had calculated the angle from which the steps must start;\nso that from the middle they rose gradually, like the sticks of a fan,\nto the top of the cliff, and descended in the same fashion to its\nbase. That miraculously light, yet perfectly firm, staircase cost them\ntwenty-two days of toil. A little tinder and the surf of the sea would\ndestroy all trace of it forever in a single night. A betrayal of the\nsecret was impossible; and all search for the violators of the convent\nwas doomed to failure.\n\nAt the top of the rock there was a platform with sheer precipice on all\nsides. The Thirteen, reconnoitring the ground with their glasses from\nthe masthead, made certain that though the ascent was steep and rough,\nthere would be no difficulty in gaining the convent garden, where the\ntrees were thick enough for a hiding-place. After such great efforts\nthey would not risk the success of their enterprise, and were compelled\nto wait till the moon passed out of her last quarter.\n\nFor two nights Montriveau, wrapped in his cloak, lay out on the rock\nplatform. The singing at vespers and matins filled him with unutterable\njoy. He stood under the wall to hear the music of the organ, listening\nintently for one voice among the rest. But in spite of the silence, the\nconfused effect of music was all that reached his ears. In those sweet\nharmonies defects of execution are lost; the pure spirit of art comes\ninto direct communication with the spirit of the hearer, making\nno demand on the attention, no strain on the power of listening.\nIntolerable memories awoke. All the love within him seemed to break into\nblossom again at the breath of that music; he tried to find auguries of\nhappiness in the air. During the last night he sat with his eyes fixed\nupon an ungrated window, for bars were not needed on the side of the\nprecipice. A light shone there all through the hours; and that instinct\nof the heart, which is sometimes true, and as often false, cried within\nhim, “She is there!”\n\n“She is certainly there! Tomorrow she will be mine,” he said to himself,\nand joy blended with the slow tinkling of a bell that began to ring.\n\nStrange unaccountable workings of the heart! The nun, wasted by yearning\nlove, worn out with tears and fasting, prayer and vigils; the woman of\nnine-and-twenty, who had passed through heavy trials, was loved more\npassionately than the lighthearted girl, the woman of four-and-twenty,\nthe sylphide, had ever been. But is there not, for men of vigorous\ncharacter, something attractive in the sublime expression engraven on\nwomen’s faces by the impetuous stirrings of thought and misfortunes of\nno ignoble kind? Is there not a beauty of suffering which is the most\ninteresting of all beauty to those men who feel that within them there\nis an inexhaustible wealth of tenderness and consoling pity for a\ncreature so gracious in weakness, so strong with love? It is the\nordinary nature that is attracted by young, smooth, pink-and-white\nbeauty, or, in one word, by prettiness. In some faces love awakens\namid the wrinkles carved by sorrow and the ruin made by melancholy;\nMontriveau could not but feel drawn to these. For cannot a lover,\nwith the voice of a great longing, call forth a wholly new creature? a\ncreature athrob with the life but just begun breaks forth for him alone,\nfrom the outward form that is fair for him, and faded for all the world\nbesides. Does he not love two women?--One of them, as others see her,\nis pale and wan and sad; but the other, the unseen love that his heart\nknows, is an angel who understands life through feeling, and is adorned\nin all her glory only for love’s high festivals.\n\nThe General left his post before sunrise, but not before he had heard\nvoices singing together, sweet voices full of tenderness sounding\nfaintly from the cell. When he came down to the foot of the cliffs where\nhis friends were waiting, he told them that never in his life had\nhe felt such enthralling bliss, and in the few words there was that\nunmistakable thrill of repressed strong feeling, that magnificent\nutterance which all men respect.\n\n\n\nThat night eleven of his devoted comrades made the ascent in the\ndarkness. Each man carried a poniard, a provision of chocolate, and\na set of house-breaking tools. They climbed the outer walls with\nscaling-ladders, and crossed the cemetery of the convent. Montriveau\nrecognised the long, vaulted gallery through which he went to the\nparlour, and remembered the windows of the room. His plans were made and\nadopted in a moment. They would effect an entrance through one of the\nwindows in the Carmelite’s half of the parlour, find their way along\nthe corridors, ascertain whether the sister’s names were written on the\ndoors, find Sister Theresa’s cell, surprise her as she slept, and carry\nher off, bound and gagged. The programme presented no difficulties to\nmen who combined boldness and a convict’s dexterity with the knowledge\npeculiar to men of the world, especially as they would not scruple to\ngive a stab to ensure silence.\n\nIn two hours the bars were sawn through. Three men stood on guard\noutside, and two inside the parlour. The rest, barefooted, took up their\nposts along the corridor. Young Henri de Marsay, the most dexterous\nman among them, disguised by way of precaution in a Carmelite’s robe,\nexactly like the costume of the convent, led the way, and Montriveau\ncame immediately behind him. The clock struck three just as the two men\nreached the dormitory cells. They soon saw the position. Everything was\nperfectly quiet. With the help of a dark lantern they read the names\nluckily written on every door, together with the picture of a saint or\nsaints and the mystical words which every nun takes as a kind of\nmotto for the beginning of her new life and the revelation of her\nlast thought. Montriveau reached Sister Theresa’s door and read the\ninscription, _Sub invocatione sanctae matris Theresae_, and her motto,\n_Adoremus in aeternum_. Suddenly his companion laid a hand on his\nshoulder. A bright light was streaming through the chinks of the door.\nM. de Ronquerolles came up at that moment.\n\n“All the nuns are in the church,” he said; “they are beginning the\nOffice for the Dead.”\n\n“I will stay here,” said Montriveau. “Go back into the parlour, and shut\nthe door at the end of the passage.”\n\nHe threw open the door and rushed in, preceded by his disguised\ncompanion, who let down the veil over his face.\n\nThere before them lay the dead Duchess; her plank bed had been laid on\nthe floor of the outer room of her cell, between two lighted candles.\nNeither Montriveau nor de Marsay spoke a word or uttered a cry; but they\nlooked into each other’s faces. The General’s dumb gesture tried to say,\n“Let us carry her away!”\n\n“Quickly” shouted Ronquerolles, “the procession of nuns is leaving the\nchurch. You will be caught!”\n\nWith magical swiftness of movement, prompted by an intense desire, the\ndead woman was carried into the convent parlour, passed through the\nwindow, and lowered from the walls before the Abbess, followed by the\nnuns, returned to take up Sister Theresa’s body. The sister left in\ncharge had imprudently left her post; there were secrets that she longed\nto know; and so busy was she ransacking the inner room, that she heard\nnothing, and was horrified when she came back to find that the body was\ngone. Before the women, in their blank amazement, could think of making\na search, the Duchess had been lowered by a cord to the foot of the\ncrags, and Montriveau’s companions had destroyed all traces of their\nwork. By nine o’clock that morning there was not a sign to show that\neither staircase or wire-cables had ever existed, and Sister Theresa’s\nbody had been taken on board. The brig came into the port to ship her\ncrew, and sailed that day.\n\nMontriveau, down in the cabin, was left alone with Antoinette\nde Navarreins. For some hours it seemed as if her dead face was\ntransfigured for him by that unearthly beauty which the calm of death\ngives to the body before it perishes.\n\n“Look here,” said Ronquerolles when Montriveau reappeared on deck,\n“_that_ was a woman once, now it is nothing. Let us tie a cannon ball\nto both feet and throw the body overboard; and if ever you think of her\nagain, think of her as of some book that you read as a boy.”\n\n“Yes,” assented Montriveau, “it is nothing now but a dream.”\n\n“That is sensible of you. Now, after this, have passions; but as for\nlove, a man ought to know how to place it wisely; it is only a woman’s\nlast love that can satisfy a man’s first love.”\n\n\n\n\nADDENDUM\n\nNote: The Duchesse de Langeais is the second part of a trilogy.
