THE LAST DAYS\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER I\n\nTHE EARLY DAYS\n\nRichard Harding Davis was born in Philadelphia on April 18, 1864, but,\nso far as memory serves me, his life and mine began together several\nyears later in the three-story brick house on South Twenty-first\nStreet, to which we had just moved.  For more than forty years this was\nour home in all that the word implies, and I do not believe that there\nwas ever a moment when it was not the predominating influence in\nRichard's life and in his work.  As I learned in later years, the house\nhad come into the possession of my father and mother after a period on\ntheir part of hard endeavor and unusual sacrifice.  It was their\nambition to add to this home not only the comforts and the beautiful\ninanimate things of life, but to create an atmosphere which would prove\na constant help to those who lived under its roof--an inspiration to\ntheir children that should endure so long as they lived.  At the time\nof my brother's death the fact was frequently commented upon that,\nunlike most literary folk, he had never known what it was to be poor\nand to suffer the pangs of hunger and failure.  That he never suffered\nfrom the lack of a home was certainly as true as that in his work he\nknew but little of failure, for the first stories he wrote for the\nmagazines brought him into a prominence and popularity that lasted\nuntil the end.  But if Richard gained his success early in life and was\nblessed with a very lovely home to which he could always return, he was\nnot brought up in a manner which in any way could be called lavish.\nLavish he may have been in later years, but if he was it was with the\nmoney for which those who knew him best knew how very hard he had\nworked.\n\nIn a general way, I cannot remember that our life as boys differed in\nany essential from that of other boys.  My brother went to the\nEpiscopal Academy and his weekly report never failed to fill the whole\nhouse with an impenetrable gloom and ever-increasing fears as to the\npossibilities of his future.  At school and at college Richard was, to\nsay the least, an indifferent student.  And what made this undeniable\nfact so annoying, particularly to his teachers, was that morally he\nstood so very high.  To \"crib,\" to lie, or in any way to cheat or to do\nany unworthy act was, I believe, quite beyond his understanding.\nTherefore, while his constant lack of interest in his studies goaded\nhis teachers to despair, when it came to a question of stamping out\nwrongdoing on the part of the student body he was invariably found\naligned on the side of the faculty.  Not that Richard in any way\nresembled a prig or was even, so far as I know, ever so considered by\nthe most reprehensible of his fellow students.  He was altogether too\nred-blooded for that, and I believe the students whom he antagonized\nrather admired his chivalric point of honor even if they failed to\nimitate it.  As a schoolboy he was aggressive, radical, outspoken,\nfearless, usually of the opposition and, indeed, often the sole member\nof his own party.  Among the students at the several schools he\nattended he had but few intimate friends; but of the various little\ngroups of which he happened to be a member his aggressiveness and his\nimagination usually made him the leader.  As far back as I can\nremember, Richard was always starting something--usually a new club or\na violent reform movement.  And in school or college, as in all the\nother walks of life, the reformer must, of necessity, lead a somewhat\ntempestuous, if happy, existence.  The following letter, written to his\nfather when Richard was a student at Swarthmore, and about fifteen,\nwill give an idea of his conception of the ethics in the case:\n\n\nSWARTHMORE--1880.\n\nDEAR PAPA:\n\nI am quite on the Potomac.  I with all the boys at our table were\ncalled up, there is seven of us, before Prex. for stealing sugar-bowls\nand things off the table.  All the youths said, \"O President, I didn't\ndo it.\"  When it came my turn I merely smiled gravely, and he passed on\nto the last.  Then he said, \"The only boy that doesn't deny it is\nDavis.  Davis, you are excused.  I wish to talk to the rest of them.\"\nThat all goes to show he can be a gentleman if he would only try.  I am\na natural born philosopher so I thought this idea is too idiotic for me\nto converse about so I recommend silence and I also argued that to deny\nyou must necessarily be accused and to be accused of stealing would of\ncourse cause me to bid Prex. good-by, so the only way was, taking these\ntwo considerations with each other, to deny nothing but let the\ngood-natured old duffer see how silly it was by retaining a placid\nsilence and so crushing his base but thoughtless behavior and\nmachinations.\n\nDICK.\n\n\nIn the early days at home--that is, when the sun shone--we played\ncricket and baseball and football in our very spacious back yard, and\nthe programme of our sports was always subject to Richard's change\nwithout notice.  When it rained we adjourned to the third-story front,\nwhere we played melodrama of simple plot but many thrills, and it was\nalways Richard who wrote the plays, produced them, and played the\nprincipal part.  As I recall these dramas of my early youth, the action\nwas almost endless and, although the company comprised two charming\nmisses (at least I know that they eventually grew into two very lovely\nwomen), there was no time wasted over anything so sentimental or futile\nas love-scenes.  But whatever else the play contained in the way of\ngreat scenes, there was always a mountain pass--the mountains being\ncomposed of a chair and two tables--and Richard was forever leading his\nlittle band over the pass while the band, wholly indifferent as to\nwhether the road led to honor, glory, or total annihilation, meekly\nfollowed its leader.  For some reason, probably on account of my early\nadmiration for Richard and being only too willing to obey his command,\nI was invariably cast for the villain in these early dramas, and the\nend of the play always ended in a hand-to-hand conflict between the\nhero and myself.  As Richard, naturally, was the hero and incidentally\nthe stronger of the two, it can readily be imagined that the fight\nalways ended in my complete undoing.  Strangulation was the method\nusually employed to finish me, and, whatever else Richard was at that\ntender age, I can testify to his extraordinary ability as a choker.\n\nBut these early days in the city were not at all the happiest days of\nthat period in Richard's life.  He took but little interest even in the\nsocial or the athletic side of his school life, and his failures in his\nstudies troubled him sorely, only I fear, however, because it troubled\nhis mother and father.  The great day of the year to us was the day our\nschools closed and we started for our summer vacation.  When Richard\nwas less than a year old my mother and father, who at the time was\nconvalescing from a long illness, had left Philadelphia on a search for\na complete rest in the country.  Their travels, which it seems were\nundertaken in the spirit of a voyage of discovery and adventure,\nfinally led them to the old Curtis House at Point Pleasant on the New\nJersey coast.  But the Point Pleasant of that time had very little in\ncommon with the present well-known summer resort.  In those days the\nplace was reached after a long journey by rail followed by a three\nhours' drive in a rickety stagecoach over deep sandy roads, albeit the\nroads did lead through silent, sweet-smelling pine forests.  Point\nPleasant itself was then a collection of half a dozen big farms which\nstretched from the Manasquan River to the ocean half a mile distant.\nNothing could have been more primitive or as I remember it in its\npastoral loveliness much more beautiful.  Just beyond our cottage the\nriver ran its silent, lazy course to the sea.  With the exception of\nseveral farmhouses, its banks were then unsullied by human habitation\nof any sort, and on either side beyond the low green banks lay fields\nof wheat and corn, and dense groves of pine and oak and chestnut trees.\nBetween us and the ocean were more waving fields of corn, broken by\nlittle clumps of trees, and beyond these damp Nile-green pasture\nmeadows, and then salty marshes that led to the glistening, white\nsand-dunes, and the great silver semi-circle of foaming breakers, and\nthe broad, blue sea.  On all the land that lay between us and the\nocean, where the town of Point Pleasant now stands, I think there were\nbut four farmhouses, and these in no way interfered with the landscape\nor the life of the primitive world in which we played.\n\nWhatever the mental stimulus my brother derived from his home in\nPhiladelphia, the foundation of the physical strength that stood him in\nsuch good stead in the campaigns of his later years he derived from\nthose early days at Point Pleasant.  The cottage we lived in was an old\ntwo-story frame building, to which my father had added two small\nsleeping-rooms.  Outside there was a vine-covered porch and within a\ngreat stone fireplace flanked by cupboards, from which during those\nhappy days I know Richard and I, openly and covertly, must have\nextracted tons of hardtack and cake.  The little house was called\n\"Vagabond's Rest,\" and a haven of rest and peace and content it\ncertainly proved for many years to the Davis family.  From here it was\nthat my father started forth in the early mornings on his all-day\nfishing excursions, while my mother sat on the sunlit porch and wrote\nnovels and mended the badly rent garments of her very active sons.\nAfter a seven-o'clock breakfast at the Curtis House our energies never\nceased until night closed in on us and from sheer exhaustion we dropped\nunconscious into our patch-quilted cots.  All day long we swam or\nrowed, or sailed, or played ball, or camped out, or ate enormous\nmeals--anything so long as our activities were ceaseless and our\nbreathing apparatus given no rest.  About a mile up the river there was\nan island--it's a very small, prettily wooded, sandy-beached little\nplace, but it seemed big enough in those days.  Robert Louis Stevenson\nmade it famous by rechristening it Treasure Island, and writing the new\nname and his own on a bulkhead that had been built to shore up one of\nits fast disappearing sandy banks.  But that is very modern history and\nto us it has always been \"The Island.\"  In our day, long before\nStevenson had ever heard of the Manasquan, Richard and I had discovered\nthis tight little piece of land, found great treasures there, and, hand\nin hand, had slept in a six-by-six tent while the lions and tigers\ngrowled at us from the surrounding forests.\n\nAs I recall these days of my boyhood I find the recollections of our\nlife at Point Pleasant much more distinct than those we spent in\nPhiladelphia.  For Richard these days were especially welcome.  They\nmeant a respite from the studies which were a constant menace to\nhimself and his parents; and the freedom of the open country, the\nocean, the many sports on land and on the river gave his body the\nconstant exercise his constitution seemed to demand, and a broad field\nfor an imagination which was even then very keen, certainly keen enough\nto make the rest of us his followers.\n\nIn an extremely sympathetic appreciation which Irvin S. Cobb wrote\nabout my brother at the time of his death, he says that he doubts if\nthere is such a thing as a born author.  Personally it so happened that\nI never grew up with any one, except my brother, who ever became an\nauthor, certainly an author of fiction, and so I cannot speak on the\nsubject with authority.  But in the case of Richard, if he was not born\nan author, certainly no other career was ever considered.  So far as I\nknow he never even wanted to go to sea or to be a bareback rider in a\ncircus.  A boy, if he loves his father, usually wants to follow in his\nprofessional footsteps, and in the case of Richard, he had the double\ninspiration of following both in the footsteps of his father and in\nthose of his mother.  For years before Richard's birth his father had\nbeen a newspaper editor and a well-known writer of stories and his\nmother a novelist and short-story writer of great distinction.  Of\nthose times at Point Pleasant I fear I can remember but a few of our\nelders.  There were George Lambdin, Margaret Ruff, and Milne Ramsay,\nall painters of some note; a strange couple, Colonel Olcott and the\nafterward famous Madam Blavatsky, trying to start a Buddhist cult in\nthis country; Mrs. Frances Hodgson Burnett, with her foot on the first\nrung of the ladder of fame, who at the time loved much millinery\nfinery.  One day my father took her out sailing and, much to the lady's\ndiscomfiture and greatly to Richard's and my delight, upset the famous\nauthoress.  At a later period the Joseph Jeffersons used to visit us;\nHorace Howard Furness, one of my father's oldest friends, built a\nsummer home very near us on the river, and Mrs. John Drew and her\ndaughter Georgie Barrymore spent their summers in a near-by hostelry.\nI can remember Mrs. Barrymore at that time very well---wonderfully\nhandsome and a marvellously cheery manner.  Richard and I both loved\nher greatly, even though it were in secret.  Her daughter Ethel I\nremember best as she appeared on the beach, a sweet, long-legged child\nin a scarlet bathing-suit running toward the breakers and then dashing\nmadly back to her mother's open arms.  A pretty figure of a child, but\nmuch too young for Richard to notice at that time.  In after-years the\nchild in the scarlet bathing-suit and he became great pals.  Indeed,\nduring the latter half of his life, through the good days and the bad,\nthere were very few friends who held so close a place in his sympathy\nand his affections as Ethel Barrymore.\n\nUntil the summer of 1880 my brother continued on at the Episcopal\nAcademy.  For some reason I was sent to a different school, but outside\nof our supposed hours of learning we were never apart.  With less than\ntwo years' difference in our ages our interests were much the same, and\nI fear our interests of those days were largely limited to out-of-door\nsports and the theatre.  We must have been very young indeed when my\nfather first led us by the hand to see our first play.  On Saturday\nafternoons Richard and I, unattended but not wholly unalarmed, would\nset forth from our home on this thrilling weekly adventure.  Having\njoined our father at his office, he would invariably take us to a\nchop-house situated at the end of a blind alley which lay concealed\nsomewhere in the neighborhood of Walnut and Third Streets, and where we\nate a most wonderful luncheon of English chops and apple pie.  As the\nluncheon drew to its close I remember how Richard and I used to fret\nand fume while my father in a most leisurely manner used to finish off\nhis mug of musty ale.  But at last the three of us, hand in hand, my\nfather between us, were walking briskly toward our happy destination.\nAt that time there were only a few first-class theatres in\nPhiladelphia--the Arch Street Theatre, owned by Mrs. John Drew; the\nChestnut Street, and the Walnut Street--all of which had stock\ncompanies, but which on the occasion of a visiting star acted as the\nsupporting company.  These were the days of Booth, Jefferson, Adelaide\nNeilson, Charles Fletcher, Lotta, John McCullough, John Sleeper Clark,\nand the elder Sothern.  And how Richard and I worshipped them all--not\nonly these but every small-bit actor in every stock company in town.\nIndeed, so many favorites of the stage did my brother and I admire that\nordinary frames would not begin to hold them all, and to overcome this\ndefect we had our bedroom entirely redecorated.  The new scheme called\nfor a gray wallpaper supported by a maroon dado.  At the top of the\nlatter ran two parallel black picture mouldings between which we could\neasily insert cabinet photographs of the actors and actresses which for\nthe moment we thought most worthy of a place in our collection.  As the\nroom was fairly large and as the mouldings ran entirely around it, we\nhad plenty of space for even our very elastic love for the heroes and\nheroines of the footlights.\n\nEdwin Forrest ended his stage career just before our time, but I know\nthat Richard at least saw him and heard that wonderful voice of\nthunder.  It seems that one day, while my mother and Richard were\nreturning home, they got on a street-car which already held the great\ntragedian.  At the moment Forrest was suffering severely from gout and\nhad his bad leg stretched well out before him.  My brother, being very\nyoung at the time and never very much of a respecter of persons,\npromptly fell over the great man's gouty foot.  Whereat (according to\nmy mother, who was always a most truthful narrator) Forrest broke forth\nin a volcano of oaths and for blocks continued to hurl thunderous\nbroadsides at Richard, which my mother insisted included the curse of\nRome and every other famous tirade in the tragedian's repertory which\nin any way fitted the occasion.  Nearly forty years later my father\nbecame the president of the Edwin Forrest Home, the greatest charity\never founded by an actor for actors, and I am sure by his efforts of\nyears on behalf of the institution did much to atone for Richard's\nearly unhappy meeting with the greatest of all the famous\nleather-lunged tragedians.\n\nFrom his youth my father had always been a close student of the classic\nand modern drama, and throughout his life numbered among his friends\nmany of the celebrated actors and actresses of his time.  In those\nearly days Booth used to come to rather formal luncheons, and at all\nsuch functions Richard and I ate our luncheon in the pantry, and when\nthe great meal was nearly over in the dining-room we were allowed to\ncome in in time for the ice-cream and to sit, figuratively, at the feet\nof the honored guest and generally, literally, on his or her knees.\nYoung as I was in those days I can readily recall one of those\nlunch-parties when the contrast between Booth and Dion Boucicault\nstruck my youthful mind most forcibly.  Booth, with his deep-set, big\nblack eyes, shaggy hair, and lank figure, his wonderfully modulated\nvoice, rolled out his theories of acting, while the bald-headed, rotund\nBoucicault, his twinkling eyes snapping like a fox-terrier's,\ninterrupted the sonorous speeches of the tragedian with crisp, witty\ncriticisms or \"asides\" that made the rest of the company laugh and even\nbrought a smile to the heavy, tragic features of Booth himself.  But\nthere was nothing formal about our relations with John Sleeper Clark\nand the Jefferson family.  They were real \"home folks\" and often\noccupied our spare room, and when they were with us Richard and I were\nallowed to come to all the meals, and, even if unsolicited, freely\nexpress our views on the modern drama.\n\nIn later years to our Philadelphia home came Henry Irving and his\nfellow player Ellen Terry and Augustin Daly and that wonderful quartet,\nAda Rehan, Mrs. Gilbert, James Lewis, and our own John Drew.  Sir Henry\nI always recall by the first picture I had of him in our dining-room,\nsitting far away from the table, his long legs stretched before him,\npeering curiously at Richard and myself over black-rimmed glasses and\nthen, with equal interest, turning back to the ash of a long cigar and\ntalking drama with the famous jerky, nasal voice but always with a\nmarvellous poise and convincing authority.  He took a great liking to\nRichard in those days, sent him a church-warden's pipe that he had used\nas Corporal Brewster, and made much of him later when my brother was in\nLondon.  Miss Terry was a much less formal and forbidding guest,\nrushing into the house like a whirlwind and filling the place with the\nsunshine and happiness that seemed to fairly exude from her beautiful\nmagnetic presence.  Augustin Daly usually came with at least three of\nthe stars of his company which I have already mentioned, but even the\nbeautiful Rehan and the nice old Mrs. Gilbert seemed thoroughly awed in\nthe presence of \"the Guv'nor.\"  He was a most crusty, dictatorial\nparty, as I remember him with his searching eyes and raven locks,\nalways dressed in black and always failing to find virtue in any actor\nor actress not a member of his own company.  I remember one\nparticularly acrid discussion between him and my father in regard to\nJulia Marlowe, who was then making her first bow to the public.  Daly\ncontended that in a few years the lady would be absolutely unheard of\nand backed his opinion by betting a dinner for those present with my\nfather that his judgment would prove correct.  However, he was very\nkind to Richard and myself and frequently allowed us to play about\nbehind the scenes, which was a privilege I imagine he granted to very\nfew of his friends' children.  One night, long after this, when Richard\nwas a reporter in New York, he and Miss Rehan were burlesquing a scene\nfrom a play on which the last curtain had just fallen.  It was on the\nstage of Daly's theatre at Thirtieth Street and Broadway, and from his\nvelvet box at the prompt-entrance Daly stood gloomily watching their\nfooling.  When they had finished the mock scene Richard went over to\nDaly and said, \"How bad do you think I am as an actor, Mr. Daly?\" and\ngreatly to my brother's delight the greatest manager of them all of\nthose days grumbled back at him:  \"You're so bad, Richard, that I'll\ngive you a hundred dollars a week, and you can sign the contract\nwhenever you're ready.\"  Although that was much more than my brother\nwas making in his chosen profession at the time, and in spite of the\nintense interest he had in the theatre, he never considered the offer\nseriously.  As a matter of fact, Richard had many natural\nqualifications that fitted him for the stage, and in after-years, when\nhe was rehearsing one of his own plays, he could and frequently would\ngo up on the stage and read almost any part better than the actor\nemployed to do it.  Of course, he lacked the ease of gesture and the\nart of timing which can only be attained after sound experience, but\nhis reading of lines and his knowledge of characterization was quite\nunusual.  In proof of this I know of at least two managers who, when\nRichard wanted to sell them plays, refused to have him read them the\nmanuscript on the ground that his reading gave the dialogue a value it\ndid not really possess.\n\nIn the spring of 1880 Richard left the Episcopal Academy, and the\nfollowing September went to Swarthmore College, situated just outside\nof Philadelphia.  I fear, however, the change was anything but a\nsuccess.  The life of the big coeducational school did not appeal to\nhim at all and, in spite of two or three friendships he made among the\ngirls and boys, he depended for amusement almost wholly on his own\nresources.  In the afternoons and on holidays he took long walks over\nthe country roads and in search of adventure visited many farmhouses.\nHis excuse for these calls was that he was looking for old furniture\nand china, and he frequently remained long enough to make sketches of\nsuch objects as he pretended had struck his artistic fancy.  Of these\nadventures he wrote at great length to his mother and father, and the\nletters were usually profusely decorated with illustrations of the most\nstriking incidents of the various escapades.  Several of these\nSwarthmore experiences he used afterward in short stories, and both the\nletters and sketches he sent to his parents at the time he regarded in\nthe light of preparation for his future work.  In his studies he was\nperhaps less successful than he had been at the Episcopal Academy, and\nalthough he played football and took part in the track sports he was\nreally but little interested in either.  There were half-holidays on\nWednesdays and Saturdays, and when my brother did not come to town I\nwent to Swarthmore and we spent the afternoons in first cooking our\nlunch in a hospitable woods and then playing some games in the open\nthat Richard had devised.  But as I recall these outings they were not\nvery joyous occasions, as Richard was extremely unhappy over his\nfailures at school and greatly depressed about the prospects for the\nfuture.\n\nHe finished the college year at Swarthmore, but so unhappy had he been\nthere that there was no thought in his mind or in that of his parents\nof his returning.  At that time my uncle, H.  Wilson Harding, was a\nprofessor at Lehigh University, and it was arranged that Richard should\ngo to Bethlehem the following fall, live with his uncle, and continue\nhis studies at Ulrich's Preparatory School, which made a specialty of\npreparing boys for Lehigh.  My uncle lived in a charming old house on\nMarket Street in Bethlehem, quite near the Moravian settlement and\nacross the river from the university and the iron mills.  He was a\nbachelor, but of a most gregarious and hospitable disposition, and\nRichard therefore found himself largely his own master, in a big, roomy\nhouse which was almost constantly filled with the most charming and\ncultivated people.  There my uncle and Richard, practically of about\nthe same age so far as their viewpoint of life was concerned, kept open\nhouse, and if it had not been for the occasional qualms his innate\nhatred of mathematics caused him, I think my brother would have been\ncompletely happy.  Even studies no longer worried him particularly and\nhe at once started in to make friendships, many of which lasted\nthroughout his life.  As is usual with young men of seventeen, most of\nthese men and women friends were several times Richard's age, but at\nthe period Richard was a particularly precocious and amusing youth and\na difference of a few decades made but little difference--certainly not\nto Richard.  Finley Peter Dunne once wrote of my brother that he\n\"probably knew more waiters, generals, actors, and princes than any man\nwho lived,\" and I think it was during the first year of his life at\nBethlehem that he began the foundation for the remarkable collection of\nfriends, both as to numbers and variety, of which he died possessed.\nAlthough a \"prep,\" he made many friends among the undergraduates of\nLehigh.  He made friends with the friends of his uncle and many friends\nin both of the Bethlehems of which his uncle had probably never heard.\nEven at that early age he counted among his intimates William W.\nThurston, who was president of the Bethlehem Iron Company, and J. Davis\nBrodhead, one of Pennsylvania's most conspicuous Democratic congressmen\nand attorneys.  Those who knew him at that time can easily understand\nwhy Richard attracted men and women so much older than himself.  He was\nbrimming over with physical health and animal spirits and took the\nkeenest interest in every one he met and in everything that was going\non about him.  And in the broadest sense he saw to it then, as he did\nthroughout his life, that he always did his share.\n\nDuring those early days at Bethlehem his letters to his family were\nfull of his social activities, with occasional references to his work\nat school.  He was always going to dinners or dances, entertaining\nmembers of visiting theatrical companies; and on Friday night my mother\nusually received a telegram, saying that he would arrive the next day\nwith a party of friends whom he had inadvertently asked to lunch and a\nmatinee.  It was after one of these weekly visits that my mother wrote\nRichard the following:\n\n\nMonday Night.  MY DARLING Boy:\n\n\nYou went off in such a hurry that it took my breath at the last.  You\nsay coming down helps you.  It certainly does me.  It brings a real\nsunshine to Papa and me.  He was saying that to-day.  I gave Nolly a\nsort of holiday after her miseries last night.  We went down street and\ngot Papa a present for our wedding day, a picture, after all, and then\nI took Miss Baker some tickets for a concert.  I saw her father who\nsaid he \"must speak about my noble looking boy.\"  I always thought him\na genius but now I think him a man of penetration as well.  Then Nolly\nand I went over to see the Russians.  But they are closely boxed up and\nnot allowed to-day to see visitors.  So we came home cross and hungry.\nAll evening I have been writing business letters.\n\nPapa has gone to a reception and Charley is hard at work at his desk.\n\nI answered Mr. Allen's letter this morning, dear, and told him you\nwould talk to him.  When you do, dear, talk freely to him as to me.\nYou will not perhaps agree with all he says.  But your own thoughts\nwill be healthier for bringing them--as I might say, out of doors.  You\nsaw how it was by coming down here.  Love of Christ is not a melancholy\nnor a morbid thing, dear love, but ought to make one more social and\ncheerful and alive.\n\nI wish you could come home oftener.  Try and get ahead with lessons so\nthat you can come oftener.  And when you feel as if prayer was a\nburden, stop praying and go out and try to put your Christianity into\nreal action by doing some kindness--even speaking in a friendly way to\nsomebody.  Bring yourself into contact with new people--not John, Hugh,\nUncle and Grandma, and try to act to them as Christ would have you act,\nand my word for it, you will go home with a new light on your own\nrelations to Him and a new meaning for your prayers.  You remember the\nprayer \"give me a great thought to refresh me.\" I think you will find\nsome great thoughts in human beings--they will help you to understand\nyourself and God, when you try to help them God makes you happy my\ndarling.\n\nMAMA.\n\n\nIt was in this year that Richard enjoyed the thrill of seeing in print\nhis first contribution to a periodical.  The date of this important\nevent, important, at least, to my brother, was February 1, the\nfortunate publication was Judge, and the effusion was entitled \"The Hat\nand Its Inmate.\"  Its purport was an overheard conversation between two\nyoung ladies at a matinee and the editors thought so well of it that\nfor the privilege of printing the article they gave Richard a year's\nsubscription to Judge.  His scrap-book of that time shows that in 1884\nLife published a short burlesque on George W.  Cable's novel, \"Dr.\nSevier,\" and in the same year The Evening Post paid him  $1.05 for an\narticle about \"The New Year at Lehigh.\"  It was also in the spring of\n1884 that Richard published his first book, \"The Adventures of My\nFreshman,\" a neat little paper-covered volume including half a dozen of\nthe short stories that had already appeared in The Lehigh Burr.  In\nwriting in a copy of this book in later years, Richard said:  \"This is\na copy of the first book of mine published.  My family paid to have it\nprinted and finding no one else was buying it, bought up the entire\nedition.  Finding the first edition had gone so quickly, I urged them\nto finance a second one, and when they were unenthusiastic I was hurt.\nSeveral years later when I found the entire edition in our attic, I\nunderstood their reluctance.  The reason the book did not sell is, I\nthink, because some one must have read it.\"\n\nIn the summer of 1882 Richard went to Boston, and in the following\nletter unhesitatingly expressed his opinion of that city and its people.\n\n\nBOSTON, Wednesday.\n\nJuly 1882.\n\nDEAR FAMILY:--\n\nI left Newport last night or rather this morning.  I stopped at Beverly\nand called on Dr. Holmes.  He talked a great deal about mama and about\na great many other things equally lovely in a very easy, charming way.\nAll I had to do was to listen and I was only too willing to do that.\nWe got along splendidly.  He asked me to stay to dinner but I refused\nwith thanks, as I had only come to pay my respects and put off to Dr.\nBartol's.  Dr. Holmes accompanied me to the depot and saw me safely\noff.  Of all the lovely men I ever saw Dr. Bartol is the one.  He lives\nin a great, many roomed with as many gables, house.  Elizabethan, of\ncourse, with immense fireplaces, brass and dark woods, etchings and\nengravings, with the sea and rocks immediately under the window and the\nocean stretching out for miles, lighthouses and more Elizabethan houses\nhalf hid on the bank, and ships and small boats pushing by within a\nhundred rods of the windows.  I stayed to dinner there and we had a\nvery jolly time.  There were two other young men and another maiden\nbesides Miss Bartol.  They talked principally about the stage; that is,\nthe Boston Stock Company, which is their sole thought and knowledge of\nthe drama.  The Dr. would strike off now and then to philosophizing and\nmoralizing but his daughter would immediately sit upon him, much to my\ndisgust but to the evident relief of the rest.  His wife is as lovely\nas he is but I can't give it to you all now.  Wait until I get home.\n\nThe young lady, the youths and myself came up to Boston together and\nhad as pleasant a ride, as the heat would allow.  I left them at the\ndepot and went up to the Parker House and then to the Art Museum.  The\nstatuary is plaster, the coins are copies, and by the way, I found one\nexactly like mine, which, if it is genuine is worth, \"well\nconsiderable\", as the personage in charge remarked.  The pictures were\nsimply vile, only two or three that I recognized and principally Millet\nand some charcoal sketches of Hunt's, who is the Apostle of Art here.\nThe china was very fine but they had a collection of old furniture and\narmor which was better than anything else.  Fresh from or rather musty\nfrom these antiques, who should I meet but the cheerful Dixey and\nPowers.  We had a very jolly talk and I enjoyed it immensely, not only\nmyself but all the surrounding populace, as Dixey would persist in\nshowing the youthful some new \"gag,\" and would break into a clog or\ndialect much to the delectation of the admiring Bostonians.  I am\nstranded here for to night and will push on to Newport to-morrow.  I'll\ngo see the \"babes\" to night, as there is nothing else in the city that\nis worth seeing that I haven't investigated.  I left the\nNewburyportians in grief with regret.  I met lots of nice people and\nevery one was so very kind to me, from the authoresses to the serving\nmaids.  Good-bye.\n\nDICK.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER II\n\nCOLLEGE DAYS\n\nIn the fall of 1882 Richard entered Lehigh, but the first year of his\ncollege life varied very little from the one he had spent in the\npreparatory school.  During that year he had met most of the upper\nclassmen, and the only difference was that he could now take an active\ninstead of a friendly interest in the life and the sports of the\ncollege.  Also he had formed certain theories which he promptly\nproceeded to put into practical effect.  Perhaps the most conspicuous\nof these was his belief that cane-rushes and hazing were wholly\nunnecessary and barbarous customs, and should have no place in the\ncollege of his day.  Against the former he spoke at college meetings,\nand wrote long letters to the local papers decrying the custom.  His\nstand against hazing was equally vehement, and he worked hand in hand\nwith the faculty to eradicate it entirely from the college life.  That\nhis stand was purely for a principle and not from any fear of personal\ninjury, I think the following letter to his father will show:\n\n\nBETHLEHEM, February 1882.\n\nDEAR DAD:\n\nYou may remember a conversation we had at Squan about hazing in which\nyou said it was a very black-guardly thing and a cowardly thing.  I\ndidn't agree with you, but when I saw how it really was and how silly\nand undignified it was, besides being brutal, I thought it over and\nchanged my mind completely, agreeing with you in every respect.  A\nlarge number of our class have been hazed, taking it as a good joke,\nand have been laughed at by the whole college.  I talked to the boys\nabout it, and said what I would do and so on, without much effect.\nWednesday a junior came to me, and told me I was to be hazed as I left\nthe Opera House Friday night.  After that a great many came to me and\nadvised and warned me as to what I should do.  I decided to get about\nfifty of our class outside and then fight it out; that was before I\nchanged my mind.  As soon as I did I regretted it very much, but, as it\nturned out, the class didn't come, so I was alone, as I wished to be.\nYou see, I'd not a very good place here; the fellows looked on me as a\nsort of special object of ridicule, on account of the hat and cane,\nwalk, and so on, though I thought I'd got over that by this time.  The\nOpera House was partly filled with college men, a large number of\nsophomores and a few upper class men.  It was pretty generally known I\nwas going to have a row, and that brought them as much as the show.\nPoor Ruff was in agony all day.  He supposed I'd get into the fight,\nand he knew he'd get in, too, sooner or later.  If he did he'd be held\nand not be able to do anything, and then the next day be blamed by the\nwhole college for interfering in a class matter.  He hadn't any money\nto get into the show, and so wandered around outside in the rain in a\ngreat deal more excited state than I was.  Howe went all over town\nafter putting on his old clothes, in case of personal damage, in search\nof freshmen who were at home out of the wet.  As I left the building a\nman grabbed me by my arm, and the rest, with the seniors gathered\naround; the only freshman present, who was half scared to death, clung\nas near to me as possible.  I withdrew my arm and faced them.  \"If this\nmeans hazing,\" I said, \"I'm not with you.  There's not enough men here\nto haze me, but there's enough to thrash me, and I'd rather be thrashed\nthan hazed.\"  You see, I wanted them to understand exactly how I looked\nat it, and they wouldn't think I was simply hotheaded and stubborn.  I\nwas very cool about it all.  They broke in with all sorts of\nexplanations; hazing was the last thing they had thought of.  No,\nindeed, Davis, old fellow, you're mistaken.  I told them if that was\nso, all right, I was going home.  I saw several of my friends in the\ncrowd waiting for me, but as I didn't want them to interfere, I said\nnothing, and they did not recognize me.  When among the crowd of\nsophomores, the poor freshman made a last effort, he pulled me by the\ncoat and begged me to come with him.  I said no, I was going home.\nWhen I reached the next corner I stopped.  \"I gave you fair warning,\nkeep off.  I tell you I'll strike the first man, the first one, that\ntouches me.\"  Then the four who had been appointed to seize me jumped\non me, and I only got one good blow in before they had me down in the\ngutter and were beating me on the face and head.  I put my hands across\nmy face, and so did not get any hard blows directly in the face.  They\nslipped back in a moment, and when I was ready I scrambled up pretty\nwet and muddy, and with my face stinging where they had struck.  It had\nall been done so quickly, and there was such a large crowd coming from\nthe theatre, that, of course, no one saw it.  When I got up there was a\ncircle all around me.  They hadn't intended to go so far.  The men,\nexcept those four who had beaten me, were rather ashamed and wished\nthey were out of it.  I turned to Emmerich, a postgraduate, and told\nhim to give me room.  \"Now,\" I said, \"you're not able to haze me, and I\ncan't thrash twelve of you, but I'll fight any one man you bring out.\"\nI asked for the man that struck me, and named another, but there was no\nresponse.\n\nThe upper classmen, who had just arrived, called out that was fair, and\nthey'd see it fair.  Goodnough, Purnell and Douglas, who don't like me\nmuch, either.  Ruff was beside me by this time.\n\nHe hadn't seen anything of it, and did not get there until he heard me\ncalling for a fair chance and challenging the class for a man.  I\ncalled out again, the second time, and still no one came, so I took\noccasion to let them know why I had done as I did in a short speech to\nthe crowd.  I said I was a peaceable fellow, thought hazing silly, and\nas I never intended to haze myself, I didn't intend any one to haze me.\nThen I said again, \"This is the third time, will one of your men fight\nthis fair?  I can't fight twelve of you.\"  Just then two officers who\nhad called on some mill-hands, who are always dying for a fight, and a\ncitizen to help them, burst into the crowd of students, shouldering\nthem around like sheep until they got to me, when one of them put his\narm around me, and said, \"I don't know anything about this crowd, but\nI'll see you're protected, sir.  I'll give 'em fair play.\"  One officer\ngot hold of Ruff and pretty near shook him to pieces until I had to\ninterfere and explain.  They were for forming a body-guard, and were\nloud in their denunciations of the college, and declaring they'd see me\nthrough if I was a stranger to 'em.\n\nTwo or three of the sophomores, when they saw how things were going,\nset up a yell, but Griffin struck out and sent one of them flying one\nway and his hat another, so the yells ended.  Howe and Murray Stuart\ntook me up to their rooms, and Ruff went off for beefsteak for my eye,\nand treated the crowd who had come to the rescue, at Dixon's, to beer.\nThe next day was Saturday, and as there was to be a meeting of the\nAthletic Association, of course, I wanted to show up.  The fellows all\nlooked at my eye pretty hard and said nothing.  I felt pretty sure that\nthe sympathy was all with me.\n\nFour men are elected from the college to be on the athletic committee.\nThey can be nominated by any one, though generally it is done by a man\nin their own class.  We had agreed the day before to vote for Tolman\nfor our class, so when the president announced nominations were in\norder for the freshmen class, Tolman was instantly nominated.  At the\nsame time one of the leading sophomores jumped up and nominated Mr.\nDavis, and a number of men from the same class seconded it.  I knew\nevery one in the college knew of what had happened, and especially the\nsophomores, so I was, of course, very much surprised.  I looked\nunconscious, though, and waited.  One of the seniors asked that the\nnominees should stand up, as they didn't know their names only their\nfaces.  As each man rose he was hissed and groaned down again.  When I\nstood up the sophomores burst into a yell and clapped and stamped,\nyelling, \"Davis!  Davis!  vote for D!\" until I sat down.  As I had\nalready decided to nominate Tolman, I withdrew my name from the\nnominees, a movement which was received by loud cries of \"No!  No!\"\nfrom the sophs.  So, you see, Dad, I did as you said, as I thought was\nright, and came out well indeed.  You see, I am now the hero of the\nhour, every one in town knows it, and every one congratulates me, and,\n\"Well done, me boy,\" as Morrow '83 said, seems to be the idea, one gets\ntaken care of in this world if you do what's the right thing, if it is\nonly a street fight.  In fact, as one of the seniors said, I've made\nfive friends where I had one before.  The sophs are ashamed and sorry,\nas their conduct in chapel, which was more marked, than I made it,\nshows.  I've nothing to show for it but a red mark under the eye, and\nso it is the best thing that could possibly have happened.  Poor Ruff\nhugged me all the way home, and I've started out well in a good way, I\nthink, though not a very logical one.\n\nUncle says to tell you that my conduct has his approval throughout.\n\nDICK.\n\n\nTo which letter my father promptly replied:\n\n\nPHILADELPHIA.  February 25th, 1882.\n\nDEAR OLD BOY:\n\nI'm glad the affair ended so well.  I don't want you to fight, but if\nyou have to fight a cuss like that do it with all your might, and don't\ninsist that either party shall too strictly observe the Markis O'\nQueensbury rules.  Hit first and hardest so that thine adversary shall\nbeware of you.\n\nDAD.\n\n\nAt that time the secret societies played a very important part in the\ncollege life at Lehigh, and while I do not believe that Richard shared\nthe theory of some of the students that they were a serious menace to\nthe social fabric, he was quite firm in his belief that it was\ninadvisable to be a member of any fraternity.  In a general way he did\nnot like the idea of secrecy even in its mildest form, and then, as\nthroughout his life, he refused to join any body that would in any way\nlimit his complete independence of word or action.  In connection with\nthis phase of his college life I quote from an appreciation which M. A.\nDe W. Howe, one of Richard's best friends both at college and in\nafter-life, wrote for The Lehigh Burr at the time of my brother's death:\n\n\"To the credit of the perceptive faculty of undergraduates, it ought to\nbe said that the classmates and contemporaries of Richard Harding Davis\nknew perfectly well, while he and they were young together, that in him\nLehigh had a son so marked in his individuality, so endowed with\ntalents and character that he stood quite apart from the other\ncollegians of his day.  Prophets were as rare in the eighties as they\nhave always been, before and since, and nobody could have foreseen that\nthe name and work of Dick Davis would long before his untimely death,\nindeed within a few years from leaving college, be better known\nthroughout the world than those of any other Lehigh man.  We who knew\nhim in his college days could not feel the smallest surprise that he\nwon himself quickly a brilliant name, and kept a firm hold upon it to\nthe last.\n\n\"What was it that made him so early a marked man?  I think it was the\nspirit of confidence and enthusiasm which turned every enterprise he\nundertook into an adventure,--the brave and humorous playing of the\ngame of life, the true heart, the wholesome body and soul of my friend\nand classmate.  He did not excel in studies or greatly, in athletics.\nBut in his own field, that of writing, he was so much better than the\nrest of us that no one of his fellow-editors of the Epitome or Burr\nneeded to be considered in comparison with him.  No less, in spite of\nhis voluntary nonmembership in the fraternities of his day, was he a\nleader in the social activities of the University.  The 'Arcadian Club'\ndevoted in its beginnings to the 'pipes, books, beer and gingeralia' of\nDavis's song about it and the 'Mustard and Cheese' were his creations.\nIn all his personal relationships he was the most amusing and\nstimulating of companions.  With garb and ways of unique\npicturesqueness, rarer even in college communities a generation ago\nthan at present, it was inevitable that he sometimes got himself\nlaughed at as well as with.  But what did it all matter, even then?\nTo-day it adds a glow of color to what would be in any case a vivid,\ndeeply valued memory.\n\n\"It is hard to foresee in youth what will come most sharply and\npermanently in the long run.  After all these years it is good to find\nthat Davis and what his companionship gave one hold their place with\nthe strongest influences of Lehigh.\"\n\nBut Richard was naturally gregarious and at heart had a great fondness\nfor clubs and social gatherings.  Therefore, having refused the offer\nof several fraternities that did him the honor to ask him to become a\nmember, it was necessary for him to form a few clubs that held\nmeetings, but no secrets.  Perhaps the most successful of these were\n\"The Mustard and Cheese,\" a dramatic club devoted to the presentation\nof farces and musical comedies, and The Arcadia Club, to the\nfortnightly meetings of which he devoted much time and thought.  The\nfollowing letter to his father will give some idea of the scope of the\nclub, which, as in the case of \"The Mustard and Cheese,\" gained a\npermanent and important place in the social life of Lehigh.\n\n\nDEAR DAD:\n\nWe have started the best sort of a club up here which I am anxious to\ntell you of.  It consists of a spread, net price of which will be about\n30 cents each, every two or three weeks.  Only six fellows belong and\nthose the best of the College.  Purnell, Haines and myself founded it.\nI chose Charley, Purnell, Reeves, Haines and Howe.  We will meet\nSaturday nights at 9 so as not to interfere with our work, and sing,\nread, eat and box until midnight.  It is called the \"Pipe and Bowl,\"\nand is meant to take the place that The Hasty Pudding, Hammer and Tongs\nand Mermaid do at other colleges.  Two of us are to invite two\noutsiders in turn each meeting.  We will hope to have Dad a member,\nhonorary, of course, when we can persuade him to give us a night off\nwith his company.  We want to combine a literary feature and so will\nhave selected readings to provoke discussions after the pipes are lit.\nThe men are very enthusiastic about it and want to invite Mr. Allen and\nyou and every one that they can make an honorary member of immediately.\n\n\nIt was first as an associate editor and afterward as editor-in-chief of\nthe college paper, The Lehigh Burr, that Richard found his greatest\npleasure and interest during his three years at Lehigh.  In addition to\nhis editorial duties he wrote a very great part of every issue of the\npaper, and his contributions included short stories, reports of news\nevents, editorials, and numerous poems.\n\nAs, after his life at college, Richard dropped verse as a mode of\nexpression, I reprint two of the poems which show him in the lighter\nvein of those early days.\n\nA COMMENCEMENT IDYL\n\n     \"I'm a Freshman who has ended his first year,\n               But I'm new;\n     And I do whate'er the Juniors, whom I fear,\n               Bid me do.\n          Under sudden showers I thrive;\n          To be bad and bold I strive,\n          But they ask--'Is it alive?'\n          So they do.\n\n     I'm a Sophomore who has passed off his exams,\n               Let me loose!\n     With a mark as high as any other man's,\n               As obtuse\n          I'm fraternal.

Maybe,\nthis year, or some other year, when I am not with you, they may give\nyou, sometimes, comfort and strength.\n\nGod bless you my son--\n\nYOUR OLD MOTHER\n\nwho loves you dearly--dearly.\n\n\nTHE PHILADELPHIA INQUIRER\n  PHILADELPHIA, April 17th, 1883.\n\nMY DEAR BOY:\n\nYou are to be nineteen years old on Wednesday.  After two years more\nyou will be a man.  You are so manly and good a boy that I could not\nwish you to change in any serious or great thing.  You have made us\nvery happy through being what you have been, what you are.  You fill us\nwith hope of your future virtue and usefulness.\n\nTo be good is the best thing of all; it counts for more than anything\nelse in the world.  We are very grateful that you have even in youth\nbeen wise enough to choose the right road.  You will find it not easy\nto keep upon it always, but remember if you do get off struggle back to\nit.  I do not know but I think God loves the effort to do as well as\nthe act done.\n\nI congratulate you my dear son, on your new birthday.  I wish you\nhealth, happiness and God's loving care.  May he bless you my son\nforever.  I enclose a trifle for your pleasure.  My love to you always,\nbut God bless you dear Dick.\n\nDAD.\n\n\nIn the fall of 1885, Richard decided to leave Lehigh and go to John\nHopkins University, where he took a special course in such studies as\nwould best benefit him in the career which he had now carefully\nplanned.  During this year in Baltimore Richard's letters show that he\npaid considerable attention to such important subjects as political\neconomy and our own labor problems, but they also show that he did not\nneglect football or the lighter social diversions.  In a short space of\ntime he had made many friends, was very busy going to dinners and\ndances, and had fallen in love with an entirely new set of maids and\nmatrons.  Richard had already begun to send contributions to the\nmagazines, and an occasional acceptance caused him the satisfaction\ncommon to all beginners.  It was in regard to one of these early\ncontributions that my mother wrote Richard the following letter:\n\n\nPHILADELPHIA\n\nJanuary 1887.\n\nDEAR BOY:\n\nWhat has become of The Current?  It has not come yet.  If it has\nsuspended publication be sure and get your article back.  You must not\ndestroy a single page you write.  You will find every idea of use to\nyou hereafter.\n\nSometimes I am afraid you think I don't take interest enough in your\nimmediate success now with the articles you send.  But I've had thirty\nyears experience and I know how much that sort of success depends on\nthe articles suiting the present needs of the magazine, and also on the\nmood of the editor when he reads it.\n\nBesides--except for your own disappointment--I know it would be better\nif you would not publish under your own name for a little while.  Dr.\nHolland--who had lots of literary shrewdness both as writer and\npublisher--used to say for a young man or woman to rush into print was\nsure ruin to their lasting fame.  They either compromised their\nreputations by inferior work or they made a great hit and never played\nup to it, afterwards, in public opinion.\n\nNow my dear old man this sounds like awfully cold comfort.  But it is\nthe wisest idea your mother has got.  I confess I have GREAT faith in\nyou--and I try to judge you as if you were not my son.  I think you are\ngoing to take a high place among American authors, but I do not think\nyou are going to do it by articles like that you sent to The Current.\nThe qualities which I think will bring it to you, you don't seem to\nvalue at all.  They are your dramatic eye.  I mean your quick\nperception of character and of the way character shows itself in looks,\ntones, dress, etc., and in your keen sympathy--with all kinds of\npeople--Now, these are the requisites for a novelist.  Added to that\nyour humour.\n\nYou ought to make a novelist of the first class.  But you must not\nexpect to do it this week or next.  A lasting, real success takes time,\nand patient, steady work.  Read Boz's first sketches of \"London Life\"\nand compare them with \"Sydney Carton\" or \"David Copperfield\" and you\nwill see what time and hard work will do to develop genius.\n\nI suppose you will wonder why I am moved to say all this?  It is, I\nthink, because of your saying \"the article sent to St.  Nicholas was\nthe best you would be able to do for years to come\" and I saw you were\ngoing to make it a crucial test of your ability.  That is, forgive me,\nnothing but nonsense.  Whatever the article may be, you may write one\ninfinitely superior to it next week or month.  Just in proportion as\nyou feel more deeply, or notice more keenly, and as you acquire the\nfaculty of expressing your feelings or observations more delicately and\npowerfully which faculty must come into practice.  It is not\ninspiration--it never was that--without practice, with any writer from\nShakespeare down.\n\nme.  I don't say, like Papa, stop writing.  God forbid.  I would almost\nas soon say stop breathing, for it is pretty much the same thing.  But\nonly to remember that you have not yet conquered your art.  You are a\njourneyman not a master workman, so if you don't succeed, it does not\ncount.  The future is what I look to, for you.  I had to stop my work\nto say all this, so good-bye dear old chum.\n\nYours,\n\nMOTHER.\n\n\nIf anything worried Richard at all at this period, I think it was his\ndesire to get down to steady newspaper work, or indeed any kind of work\nthat would act as the first step of his career and by which he could\npay his own way in the world.  It was with this idea uppermost in his\nmind in the late spring of 1886, and without any particular regret for\nthe ending of his college career, that he left Baltimore and, returning\nto his home in Philadelphia, determined to accept the first position\nthat presented itself.  But instead of going to work at once, he once\nmore changed his plans and decided to sail for Santiago de Cuba with\nhis friend William W. Thurston, who as president of the Bethlehem Steel\nCompany, was deeply interested in the iron mines of that region.  Here\nand then it was that Richard first fell in love with Cuba--a love which\nin later years became almost an obsession with him.  Throughout his\nlife whenever it was possible, and sometimes when it seemed practically\nimpossible, my brother would listen to the call of his beloved tropics\nand, casting aside all responsibilities, would set sail for Santiago.\nAfter all it was quite natural that he should feel as he did about this\nlittle Cuban coast town, for apart from its lazy life, spicy smells,\nwaving palms and Spanish cooking, it was here that he found the\nmaterial for his first novel and greatest monetary success, \"Soldiers\nof Fortune.\"  Apart from the many purely pleasure trips he made to\nSantiago, twice he returned there to work--once as a correspondent\nduring the Spanish-American War, and again when he went with Augustus\nThomas to assist in the latter's film version of the play which years\nbefore Thomas had made from the novel.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER III\n\nFIRST NEWSPAPER EXPERIENCES\n\nIn the late summer of 1886 Richard returned from Cuba and settled down\nin Philadelphia to write an article about his experiences at Santiago\nand to look for regular newspaper work.  Early in September he wrote\nhis mother:\n\n\nSeptember, 1886.\n\nDEAR MOTHER:\n\nI saw the Record people to-day.  They said there was not an opening but\ncould give me \"chance\" work, that is, I was to report each day at one\nand get what was left over.  I said I would take it as I would have my\nmornings free to write the article and what afternoons I did not have\nnewspaper work besides.  This is satisfactory.  They are either doing\nall they can to oblige Dad or else giving me a trial trip before making\nan opening.  The article is progressing but slowly.  To paraphrase\nTalleyrand, what's done is but little and that little is not good.\nHowever, since your last letter full of such excellent \"tips\" I have\nrewritten it and think it is much improved.  I will write to Thurston\nconcerning the artist to-morrow.  He is away from B. at present.  On\nthe whole the article is not bad.\n\n\nYour boy, DICK.\n\n\nRichard's stay on The Record, however, was short-lived.  His excuse for\nthe brevity of the experience was given in an interview some years\nlater.  \"My City Editor didn't like me because on cold days I wore\ngloves.  But he was determined to make me work, and gave me about\neighteen assignments a day, and paid me $7. a week.  At the end of\nthree months he discharged me as incompetent.\"\n\nFrom The Record Richard went to The Press, which was much more to his\nliking, and, indeed it was here that he did his first real work and\nshowed his first promise.  For nearly three years he did general\nreporting and during this time gained a great deal more personal\nsuccess than comes to most members of that usually anonymous\nprofession.  His big chance came with the Johnstown flood, and the news\nstories he wired to his paper showed the first glimpse of his ability\nas a correspondent.  Later on, disguised as a crook, he joined a gang\nof yeggmen, lived with them in the worst dives of the city, and\neventually gained their good opinion to the extent of being allowed to\nassist in planning a burglary.  But before the actual robbery took\nplace, Richard had obtained enough evidence against his crook\ncompanions to turn them over to the police and eventually land them in\nprison.  It was during these days that he wrote his first story for a\nmagazine, and the following letter shows that it was something of a\nmilestone in his career.\n\nPHILADELPHIA.\n\nAugust, 1888.\n\nDEAR FAMILY:\n\nThe St. Nicholas people sent me a check for $50 for the \"pirate\" story.\nIt would be insupportable affectation to say that I was not delighted.\nJennings Crute and I were waiting for breakfast when I found the\nletter.  I opened it very slowly, for I feared they would bluff me with\nsome letter about illustrations or revision, or offering me a reduced\nsubscription to the magazine.  There was a letter inside and a check.\nI read the letter before I looked at the check, which I supposed would\nbe for $30, as the other story was valued at $20.  The note said that a\nperfect gentleman named Chichester would be pleased if I would find\nenclosed a check for $50.  I looked at Jenny helplessly, and said,\n\"It's for fifty, Jenny.\"  Crute had an insane look in his eyes as he\nmurmured \"half a hundred dollars, and on your day off, too.\"  Then I\nsat down suddenly and wondered what I would buy first, and Crute sat in\na dazed condition, and abstractedly took a handful of segars out of the\nbox dear old Dad gave me.  As I didn't say anything, he took another\nhandful, and then sat down and gazed at the check for five minutes in\nawe.  After breakfast I calculated how much I would have after I paid\nmy debts.  I still owe say $23, and I have some shoes to pay for and my\nhair to cut.  I had a wild idea of going over to New York and buying\nsome stocks, but I guess I'll go to Bond's and Baker's instead.\n\nI'm going down street now to see if Drexel wants to borrow any ready\nmoney-on the way down I will make purchases and pay bills so that my\nmarch will be a triumphal procession.\n\nI got a story on the front page this morning about an explosion at\nColumbia Avenue Station--I went out on it with another man my senior in\nyears and experience, whom Watrous expected to write the story while I\nhustled for facts.  When we got back I had all the facts, and what\nlittle he had was incorrect--so I said I would dispense with his\nservices and write the story myself.  I did it very politely, but it\nqueered the man before the men, and Watrous grew very sarcastic at his\nexpense.  Next time Andy will know better and let me get my own stories\nalone.\n\nYour Millionaire Son,\n\nDICK.\n\nI'm still the \"same old Dick\"; not proud a bit.\n\n\nThis was my mother's reply:\n\n\nThursday.\n\nAugust 1888.\n\nDEAR DICK:\n\nYour letter has just come and we are all delighted.  Well done for old\nSt. Nicholas!  I thought they meant to wait till the story was\npublished.  It took me back to the day when I got $50. for \"Life in the\nIron Mills.\"  I carried the letter half a day before opening it, being\nso sure that it was a refusal.\n\nI had a great mind to read the letter to Davis and Cecile who were on\nthe porch but was afraid you would not like it.\n\nI did read them an extremely impertinent enclosure which was so like\nthe letter I sent yesterday.  That I think you got it before writing\nthis.\n\n. . .  Well I am glad about that cheque!  Have you done anything on\nGallagher?  That is by far the best work you've done--oh, by far--Send\nthat to Gilder.  In old times The Century would not print the word\n\"brandy.\"  But those days are over.\n\nTwo more days--dear boy--\n\nMOTHER.\n\n\nIn addition to his work on The Press, Richard also found time to assist\nhis friend, Morton McMichael, 3d, in the editing of a weekly\npublication called The Stage.  In fact with the exception of the\nservices of an office boy, McMichael and Richard were The Stage.\nBetween them they wrote the editorials, criticisms, the London and\nParis special correspondence, solicited the advertisements, and\nfrequently assisted in the wrapping and mailing of the copies sent to\ntheir extremely limited list of subscribers.  During this time,\nhowever, Richard was establishing himself as a star reporter on The\nPress, and was already known as a clever news-gatherer and interviewer.\nIt was in reply to a letter that Richard wrote to Robert Louis\nStevenson enclosing an interview he had had with Walt Whitman, that\nStevenson wrote the following letter--which my brother always regarded\nas one of his greatest treasures:\n\n\nWhy, thank you so much for your frank, agreeable and natural letter.\nIt is certainly very pleasant that all you young fellows should enjoy\nmy work and get some good out of it and it was very kind in you to\nwrite and tell me so.  The tale of the suicide is excellently droll,\nand your letter, you may be sure, will be preserved.  If you are to\nescape unhurt out of your present business you must be very careful,\nand you must find in your heart much constancy.  The swiftly done work\nof the journalist and the cheap finish and ready made methods to which\nit leads, you must try to counteract in private by writing with the\nmost considerate slowness and on the most ambitious models.  And when I\nsay \"writing\"--O, believe me, it is rewriting that I have chiefly in\nmind.  If you will do this I hope to hear of you some day.\n\nPlease excuse this sermon from\n\nYour obliged\n\nROBERT LOUIS STEVENSON.\n\n\nIn the spring of 1889 Richard as the correspondent of the Philadelphia\nTelegraph, accompanied a team of Philadelphia cricketers on a tour of\nIreland and England, but as it was necessary for him to spend most of\nhis time reporting the matches played in small university towns, he saw\nonly enough of London to give him a great longing to return as soon as\nthe chance offered.  Late that summer he resumed his work on The Press,\nbut Richard was not at all satisfied with his journalistic progress,\nand for long his eyes had been turned toward New York.  There he knew\nthat there was not only a broader field for such talent as he might\npossess, but that the chance for adventure was much greater, and it was\nthis hope and love of adventure that kept Richard moving on all of his\nlife.\n\nOn a morning late in September, 1889, he started for New York to look\nfor a position as reporter on one of the metropolitan newspapers.  I do\nnot know whether he carried with him any letters or that he had any\nacquaintances in the journalistic world on whose influence he counted,\nbut, in any case, he visited a number of offices without any success\nwhatever.  Indeed, he had given up the day as wasted, and was on his\nway to take the train back to Philadelphia.  Tired and discouraged, he\nsat down on a bench in City Hall Park, and mentally shook his fist at\nthe newspaper offices on Park Row that had given him so cold a\nreception.  At this all-important moment along came Arthur Brisbane,\nwhom Richard had met in London when the former was the English\ncorrespondent of The Sun.  Brisbane had recently been appointed editor\nof The Evening Sun, and had already met with a rather spectacular\nsuccess.  On hearing the object of Richard's visit to New York, he\npromptly offered him a position on his staff and Richard as promptly\naccepted.  I remember that the joyous telegram he sent to my mother,\ntelling of his success, and demanding that the fatted calf be killed\nfor dinner that night was not received with unalloyed happiness.  To my\nmother and father it meant that their first-born was leaving home to\nseek his fortune, and that without Richard's love and sympathy the home\ncould never be quite the same.  But the fatted calf was killed, every\none pretended to be just as elated as Richard was over his good\nfortune, and in two days he left us for his first adventure.\n\nThe following note to his mother Richard scribbled off in pencil at the\nrailway-station on his way to New York:\n\n\nI am not surprised that you were sad if you thought I was going away\nfor good.  I could not think of it myself.  I am only going to make a\nlittle reputation and to learn enough of the business to enable me to\nlive at home in the centre of the universe with you.  That is truth.\nGod bless you.\n\nDICK.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER IV\n\nNEW YORK\n\nOf the many completely happy periods of Richard's life there were few\nmore joyous than the first years he spent as a reporter in New York.\nFor the first time he was completely his own master and paying his own\nway--a condition which afforded him infinite satisfaction.  He was\ngreatly attached to Brisbane and as devoted to the interests of The\nEvening Sun as if he had been the editor and publisher.  In return\nBrisbane gave him a free rein and allowed him to write very much what\nand as he chose.  The two men were constantly together, in and out of\noffice hours, and planned many of the leading features of the paper\nwhich on account of the brilliancy of its news stories and special\narticles was at that time attracting an extraordinary amount of\nattention.  Richard divided his working hours between reporting\nimportant news events, writing specials (principally about theatrical\npeople), and the Van Bibber stories, nearly all of which were published\nfor the first time in The Evening Sun.  These short tales of New York\nlife soon made a distinct hit, and, while they appeared anonymously, it\nwas generally known that Richard was their author.  In addition to his\nnewspaper work my brother was also working on short stories for the\nmagazines, and in 1890 scored his first real success in this field,\nwith \"Gallegher,\" which appeared in Scribner's.  This was shortly\nfollowed by \"The Other Woman,\"  \"Miss Catherwaite's Understudy,\"  \"A\nWalk up the Avenue,\"  \"My Disreputable Friend, Mr. Raegen,\"  \"An\nUnfinished Story,\" and other stories that soon gave him an established\nreputation as a writer of fiction.  But while Richard's success was\nattained in a remarkably short space of time and at an extremely early\nage, it was not accomplished without an enormous amount of hard work\nand considerable privation.  When he first went to New York his salary\nwas but thirty dollars a week, and while he remained on The Evening Sun\nnever over fifty dollars, and the prices he received for his first\nshort stories were extremely meagre.  During the early days on The\nEvening Sun he had a room in a little house at 108 Waverly Place, and\ntook his meals in the neighborhood where he happened to find himself\nand where they were cheapest.  He usually spent his week-ends in\nPhiladelphia, but his greatest pleasure was when he could induce some\nmember of his family to visit him in New York.  I fear I was the one\nwho most often accepted his hospitality, and wonderful visits they\nwere, certainly to me, and I think to Richard as well.  The great event\nwas our Saturday-night dinner, when we always went to a little\nrestaurant on Sixth Avenue.  I do not imagine the fifty-cent table\nd'hote (vin compris) the genial Mr. Jauss served us was any better than\nmost fifty-cent table-d'hote dinners, but the place was quaint and\nredolent of strange smells of cooking as well as of a true bohemian\natmosphere.  Those were the days when the Broadway Theatre was given\nover to the comic operas in which Francis Wilson and De Wolfe Hopper\nwere the stars, and as both of the comedians were firm friends of\nRichard, we invariably ended our evening at the Broadway.  Sometimes we\noccupied a box as the guests of the management, and at other times we\nwent behind the scenes and sat in the star's dressing-room.  I think I\nliked it best when Hopper was playing, because during Wilson's regime\nthe big dressing-room was a rather solemn sort of place, but when\nHopper ruled, the room was filled with pretty girls and he treated us\nto fine cigars and champagne.\n\nHalcyon nights those, and then on Sunday morning we always breakfasted\nat old Martin's on University Place eggs a la Martin and that wonderful\ncoffee and pain de menage.  And what a wrench it was when I tore myself\naway from the delights of the great city and scurried back to my desk\nin sleepy Philadelphia.  Had I been a prince royal Richard could not\nhave planned more carefully than he did for these visits, and to meet\nthe expense was no easy matter for him.  Indeed, I know that to pay for\nall our gayeties he usually had to carry his guitar to a neighboring\npawn-broker where the instrument was always good for an eight-dollar\nloan.  But from the time Richard first began to make his own living one\nof the great pleasures of his life was to celebrate, or as he called\nit, to \"have a party.\"  Whenever he had finished a short story he had a\nparty, and when the story had been accepted there was another party,\nand, of course, the real party was when he received the check.  And so\nit was throughout his life, giving a party to some one whom a party\nwould help, buying a picture for which he had no use to help a\nstruggling artist, sending a few tons of coal to an old lady who was\nnot quite warm enough, always writing a letter or a check for some one\nof his own craft who had been less fortunate than he--giving to every\nbeggar that he met, fearing that among all the thousand fakers he might\nrefuse one worthy case.  I think this habit of giving Richard must have\ninherited from his father, who gave out of all proportion to his means,\nand with never too close a scrutiny to the worthiness of the cause.\nBoth men were too intensely human to do that, but if this great desire\non the part of my father and brother to help others gave the recipients\npleasure I'm sure that it caused in the hearts of the givers an even\ngreater happiness.  The following letters were chosen from a great\nnumber which Richard wrote to his family, telling of his first days on\nThe Evening Sun, and of his life in New York.\n\n\nYORK Evening Sun--1890\n\nDEAR MOTHER:\n\nToday is as lovely and fresh as the morning, a real spring day, and I\nfeel good in consequence.  I have just come from a couple of raids,\nwhere we had a very lively time, and some of them had to pull their\nguns.  I found it necessary to punch a few sports myself.  The old\nsergeant from headquarters treats me like a son and takes the greatest\npride in whatever I do or write.  He regularly assigns me now to\ncertain doors, and I always obey orders like the little gentleman that\nI am.  Instead of making me unpopular, I find it helps me with the\nsports, though it hurts my chances professionally, as so many of them\nknow me now that I am no use in some districts.  For instance, in Mott\nand Pell streets, or in the Bowery, I am as safe as any precinct\ndetective.  I tell you this to keep you from worrying.  They won't\ntouch a man whom they think is an agent or an officer.  Only it spoils\nmy chances of doing reportorial-detective work.  For instance, the\ncaptain of the Bowery district refused me a detective the other morning\nto take the Shippens around the Chinese and the tougher quarters\nbecause he said they were as safe with me as with any of the other men\nwhose faces are as well known.  To-night I am going to take a party to\nthe headquarters of the fire department, where I have a cinch on the\ncaptain, a very nice fellow, who is unusually grateful for something I\nwrote about him and his men.  They are going to do the Still Alarm act\nfor me.\n\nThese clippings all came out in to-day's paper.  The ladies in the\nTombs were the Shippens, of course; and Mamie Blake is a real girl, and\nthe story is true from start to finish.  I think it is a pathetic\nlittle history.\n\nGive my love to all.  I will bring on the story I have finished and get\nyou to make some suggestions.  It is quite short.  Since Scribner's\nhave been so civil, I think I will give them a chance at the great\nprize.  I am writing a comic guide book and a history of the Haymarket\nfor the paper; both are rich in opportunities.  This weather makes me\nfeel like another person.  I will be so glad to get home.  With lots of\nlove and kisses for you and Nora.\n\nDICK-O.\n\n\nNEW YORK--1890.\n\nDEAR CHAS:\n\nBrisbane has suggested to me that the Bradley story would lead anyone\nto suppose that my evenings were spent in the boudoirs of the\nhorizontales of 34th Street and has scared me somewhat in consequence.\nIf it strikes you and Dad the same way don't show it to Mother.  Dad\nmade one mistake by thinking I wrote a gambling story which has made me\nnervous.  It is hardly the fair thing to suppose that a man must have\nan intimate acquaintance with whatever he writes of intimately.  A lot\nof hunting people, for instance, would not believe that I had written\nthe \"Traver's Only Ride\" story because they knew I did not hunt.  Don't\neither you or Dad make any mistake about this.\n\nDICK.\n\nAs a matter of fact they would not let me in the room, and I don't know\nwhether it abounded in signed etchings or Bougereau's nymphs.\n\n\nNEW YORK--1890.\n\nDEAR FAMILY:\n\nToday has been more or less feverish.  In the morning's mail I received\na letter from Berlin asking permission to translate \"Gallegher\" into\nGerman, and a proof of a paragraph from The Critic on my burlesque of\nRudyard Kipling, which was meant to please but which bored me.  Then\nthe \"Raegen\" story came in, making nine pages of the Scribner's, which\nat ten dollars a page ought to be $90.  Pretty good pay for three\nweeks' work, and it is a good story.  Then at twelve a young man came\nbustling into the office, stuck his card down on the desk and said, \"I\nam S. S. McClure.  I have sent my London representative to Berlin and\nmy New York man to London.  Will you take charge of my New York end?\"\n\nIf he thought to rattle me he was very much out of it, for I said in\nhis same tone and manner, \"Bring your New York representative back and\nsend me to London, and I'll consider it.  As long as I am in New York I\nwill not leave The Evening Sun.\"\n\n\"Edmund Gosse is my London representative,\" he said; \"you can have the\nsame work here.  Come out and take lunch.\" I said, \"Thank you, I can't;\nI'll see you on Tuesday.\"\n\n\"All right,\" he said.  \"I'll come for you.  Think of what I say.  I'll\nmake your fortune.  Bradford Merrill told me to get you.  You won't\nhave anything to do but ask people to write novels and edit them.  I'll\nsend you abroad later if you don't like New York.  Can you write any\nchildren's stories for me?\"\n\n\"No,\" I said, \"see you Tuesday.\"\n\nThis is a verbal report of all and everything that was said.  I\nconsider it a curious interview.  It will raise my salary here or I go.\nWhat do YOU think?  DICK.\n\n\n\nNEW YORK--1890.\n\nDEAR FAMILY:\n\nThe more I thought of the McClure offer the less I thought of it.  So I\ntold him last night I was satisfied where I was, and that the $75 he\noffered me was no inducement.  Brisbane says I will get $50 about the\nfirst of October, which is plenty and enough for a young man who\nintends to be good to his folks.  I cannot do better than stay where I\nam, for it is understood between Brisbane and Laffan that in the event\nof the former's going into politics I shall take his place, which will\nsuit very well until something better turns up.  Then there is the\nchance of White's coming back and my going to Lunnon, which would\nplease me now more for what I think I could make of it than what I\nthink others have made of it.  If I had gone to McClure I would have\nbeen shelved and side-tracked, and I am still in the running, and\nlearning every day.  Brisbane and I have had our first serious\ndifficulty over Mrs. R----, who is staying with Mrs. \"Bill.\"  There is\nat present the most desperate rivalry, and we discuss each other's\nchances with great anger.  He counts on his transcontinental knowledge,\nbut my short stories hit very hard, and he is not in it when I sing\n\"Thy Face Will Lead Me On\" and \"When Kerrigan Struck High C.\"  She has\na fatal fondness for Sullivan, which is most unfortunate, as Brisbane\ncan and does tell her about him by the half hour.  Yesterday we both\ntried to impress her by riding down in front of the porch and showing\noff the horses and ourselves.  Brisbane came off best, though I came\noff quickest, for my horse put his foot in a hole and went down on his\nknees, while I went over his head like the White Knight in \"Alice.\"  I\nwould think nothing of sliding off a roof now.  But I made up for this\nmishap by coming back in my grey suit and having it compared with the\npicture in The Century.  It is a very close fight, and, while Brisbane\nis chasing over town for photographs of Sullivan, I am buying books of\nverses of which she seems to be fond.  As soon as she gets her divorce\none of us is going to marry her.  We don't know which.  She is about as\nbeautiful a woman as I ever saw, and very witty and well-informed, but\nit would cost a good deal to keep her in diamonds.  She wears some the\nQueen gave her, but she wants more.\n\nDICK.\n\n\nNEW YORK--1890.\n\nDEAR MOTHER (LATE MA):\n\nI am well and with lots to do.  I went up to see Hopper the other\nnight, which was the first time in three months that I have been back\nof a theater, and it was like going home.  There is a smell about the\npainty and gassy and dusty place that I love as much as fresh earth and\nnewly cut hay, and the girls look so pretty and bold lying around on\nthe sets, and the men so out of focus and with such startling cheeks\nand lips.  They were very glad to see me and made a great fuss.  Then\nI've been to see Carmencita dance, which I enjoyed remarkably, and I\nhave been reading Rudyard Kipling's short stories, and I think it is\ndisgusting that a boy like that should write such stories.  He hasn't\nleft himself anything to do when he gets old.  He reminds me of Bret\nHarte and not a bit of Stevenson, to whom some of them compare him.\n\nI am very glad you liked the lady in mid-air story so much, but it\nwasn't a bit necessary to add the MORAL from a MOTHER.  I saw it coming\nup before I had read two lines; and a very good moral it is, too, with\nwhich I agree heartily.  But, of course, you know it is not a new idea\nto me.  Anything as good and true as that moral cannot be new at this\nlate date.  I went to the Brooklyn Handicap race yesterday.  It is one\nof the three biggest races of the year, and a man stood in front of me\nin the paddock in a white hat.  Another man asked him what he was\n\"playing.\"\n\n\"Well,\" he said, \"I fancy Fides myself.\"\n\n\"Fides!\" said his friend, \"why, she ain't in it.  She won't see home.\nRaceland's the horse for your money; she's favorite, and there isn't\nany second choice.  But Fides!  Why, she's simply impossible.  Raceland\nbeat HER last Suburban.\"\n\n\"Yes, I remember,\" said the man in the white hat, \"but I fancy Fides.\"\n\nThen another chap said to him, \"Fides is all good enough on a dust\ntrack on a sunny, pleasant day, but she can't ran in the mud.  She\nhasn't got the staying powers.  She's a pretty one to look at, but\nshe's just a 'grandstand' ladies' choice.  She ain't in it with\nRaceland or Erica.  The horse YOU want is not a pretty, dainty flyer,\nbut a stayer, that is sure and that brings in good money, not big odds,\nbut good money.  Why, I can name you a dozen better'n Fides.\"\n\n\"Still, somehow, I like Fides best,\" said the obstinate man in the\nwhite hat.\n\n\"But Fides will take the bit in her mouth and run away, or throw the\njock or break into the fence.  She isn't steady.  She's all right to\nhave a little bet on, just enough for a flyer, but she's not the horse\nto plunge on.  If you're a millionaire with money to throw away, why,\nyou might put some of it up on her, but, as it is, you want to put your\nmoney where it will be sure of a 'place,' anyway.  Now, let me mark\nyour card for you?\"\n\n\"No,\" said the man, \"what you all say is reasonable, I see that; but,\nsomehow, I rather fancy Fides best.\"\n\nI've forgotten now whether Fides won or not, and whether she landed the\nman who just fancied her without knowing why a winner or sent him home\nbroke.  But, in any event, that is quite immaterial, the story simply\nshows how obstinate some men are as regards horses and--other uncertain\ncritters.  I have no doubt but that the Methodist minister's daughter\nwould have made Hiram happy if he had loved her, but he didn't.  No\ndoubt Anne ----, Nan ----, Katy ---- and Maude ---- would have made me\nhappy if they would have consented to have me and I had happened to\nlove them, but I fancied Fides.\n\nBut now since I have scared you sufficiently, let me add for your peace\nof mind that I've not enough money to back any horses just at present,\nand before I put any money up on any one of them for the Matrimonial\nstakes, I will ask you first to look over the card and give me a few\npointers.  I mayn't follow them, you know, but I'll give you a fair\nwarning, at any rate.\n\n\"You're my sweetheart, I'm your beau.\"\n\nDICK.\n\n\nNEW YORK, May 29, 1890.\n\nThis is just a little good night note to say how I wish I was with you\ndown at that dear old place and how much I love you and Nora who is\ngetting lovelier and sweeter and prettier everyday and I know a pretty\ngirl when I see 'em, Fides, for instance.  But I won't tease you about\nthat any more.\n\nI finished a short silly story to night which I am in doubt whether to\nsend off or not.  I think I will keep it until I read it to you and\nlearn what you think.\n\nMr. Gilder has asked me to stay with them at Marion, and to go to\nCambridge with Mrs. Gilder and dear Mrs. Cleveland and Grover\nCleveland, when he reads the poem before D. K. E.\n\nI have bought a book on decorations, colored, and I am choosing what I\nwant, like a boy with a new pair of boots.\n\nGood-night, my dearest Mama.\n\nDICK.\n\n\nIn addition to his regular work on The Evening Sun, my brother, as I\nhave already said, was devoting a great part, of his leisure moments to\nthe writing of short stories, and had made a tentative agreement with a\nwell-known magazine to do a series of short sketches of New York types.\nEvidently fearful that Richard was writing too much and with a view to\npecuniary gain, my mother wrote the following note of warning:\n\n\nPHILADELPHIA, 1890.\n\nDEAR DICK:\n\nI wouldn't undertake the \"types.\"  For one thing, you will lose\nprestige writing for ----'s paper.  For another, I dread beyond\neverything your beginning to do hack work for money.  It is the\nbeginning of decadence both in work and reputation for you.  I know by\nmy own and a thousand other people.  Begin to write because it \"is a\nlot of money\" and you stop doing your best work.  You make your work\ncommon and your prices will soon go down.  George Lewes managed George\nEliot wisely.\n\nHe stopped her hack work.  Kept her at writing novels and soon one each\nyear brought her $40,000.  I am taking a purely mercenary view of the\nthing.  There is another which you understand better than I-- Mind your\nMother's advice to you--now and all the time is \"do only your best\nwork--even if you starve doing it.\"  But you won't starve.  You'll get\nyour dinner at Martin's instead of Delmonico's, which won't hurt you in\nthe long run.  Anyhow, $1000. for 12,500 words is not a great price.\n\nThat was a fine tea you gave.  I should like to have heard the good\ntalk.  It was like the regiment of brigadier generals with no privates.\n\nYour\n\nMOTHER.\n\n\nThis is a letter written by my father after the publication of\nRichard's story \"A Walk up the Avenue.\"  Richard frequently spoke of\nhis father as his \"kindest and severest critic.\"\n\n\nPHILADELPHIA, July 22nd, 1890.\n\n10.30 P. M.\n\nMY DEAR Boy:\n\nYou can do it; you have done it; it is all right.  I have read A Walk\nup the Avenue.  It is far and away the best thing you have ever\ndone--Full of fine subtle thought, of rare, manly feeling.\n\nI am not afraid of Dick the author.  He's all right.  I shall only be\nafraid--when I am afraid--that Dick the man will not live up to the\nother fellow, that he may forget how much the good Lord has given him,\nand how responsible to the good Lord and to himself he is and will be\nfor it.  A man entrusted with such talent should carry himself\nstraighter than others to whom it is denied.  He has great duties to\ndo; he owes tribute to the giver.\n\nDon't let the world's temptations in any of its forms come between you\nand your work.  Make your life worthy of your talent, and humbly by day\nand by night ask God to help you to do it.\n\nI am very proud of this work.  It is good work, with brain, bone,\nnerve, muscle in it.  It is human, with healthy pulse and heartsome\nglow in it.  Remember, hereafter, you have by it put on the bars\nagainst yourself preventing you doing any work less good.  You have\nyourself made your record, you can't lower it.  You can only beat it.\n\nLovingly, DAD.\n\n\nIn the latter part of December, 1890, Richard left The Evening Sun to\nbecome the managing editor of Harper's Weekly.  George William Curtis\nwas then its editor, and at this time no periodical had a broader or\ngreater influence for the welfare of the country.  As Richard was then\nbut twenty-six, his appointment to his new editorial duties came as a\ndistinct honor.  The two years that Richard had spent on The Evening\nSun had been probably the happiest he had ever known.  He really loved\nNew York, and at this time Paris and London held no such place in his\naffections as they did in later years.  And indeed there was small\nreason why these should not have been happy years for any young man.\nAt twenty-six Richard had already accomplished much, and his name had\nbecome a familiar one not only to New Yorkers but throughout the\ncountry.  Youth and health he had, and many friends, and a talent that\npromised to carry him far in the profession he loved.  His new position\npaid him a salary considerably larger than he had received heretofore,\nand he now demanded and received much higher terms for his stories.\nAll of which was well for Richard because as his income grew so grew\nhis tastes.  I have known few men who cared less for money than did my\nbrother, and I have known few who cared more for what it could buy for\nhis friends and for himself.  Money to him, and, during his life he\nmade very large sums of it, he always chose to regard as income but\nnever capital.  A bond or a share of stock meant to him what it would\nbring that day on the Stock Exchange.  The rainy day which is the\nbugaboo for the most of us, never seemed to show on his horizon.  For a\nman whose livelihood depended on the lasting quality of his creative\nfaculties he had an infinite faith in the future, and indeed his own\nexperience seemed to show that he was justified in this belief.  It\ncould not have been very long after his start as a fiction writer that\nhe received as high a price for his work as any of his contemporaries;\nand just previous to his death, more than twenty years later, he signed\na contract to write six stories at a figure which, so far as I know,\nwas the highest ever offered an American author.  In any case, money or\nthe lack of it certainly never caused Richard any worriment during the\nearly days of which I write.  For what he made he worked extremely\nhard, but the reputation and the spending of the money that this same\nhard work brought him caused him infinite happiness.  He enjoyed the\nreputation he had won and the friends that such a reputation helped him\nto make; he enjoyed entertaining and being entertained, and he enjoyed\npretty much all of the good things of life.  And all of this he enjoyed\nwith the naive, almost boyish enthusiasm that only one could to whom it\nhad all been made possible at twenty-six.  Of these happy days Booth\nTarkington wrote at the time of my brother's death:\n\n\"To the college boy of the early nineties Richard Harding Davis was the\n'beau ideal of jeunesse doree,' a sophisticated heart of gold.  He was\nof that college boy's own age, but already an editor--already\npublishing books!  His stalwart good looks were as familiar to us as\nwere those of our own football captain; we knew his face as we knew the\nface of the President of the United States, but we infinitely preferred\nDavis's.  When the Waldorf was wondrously completed, and we cut an\nexam. in Cuneiform Inscriptions for an excursion to see the world at\nlunch in its new magnificence, and Richard Harding Davis came into the\nPalm Room--then, oh, then, our day was radiant!  That was the top of\nour fortune; we could never have hoped for so much.  Of all the great\npeople of every continent, this was the one we most desired to see.\"\n\nRichard's intimate friends of these days were Charles Dana Gibson, who\nillustrated a number of my brother's stories, Robert Howard Russell,\nAlbert La Montagne, Helen Benedict, now Mrs. Thomas Hastings, Ethel\nBarrymore, Maude Adams, E. H.  Sothern, his brother,  Sam, and Arthur\nBrisbane.  None of this little circle was married at the time, its\nvarious members were seldom apart, and they extracted an enormous\namount of fun out of life.  I had recently settled in New York, and we\nhad rooms at 10 East Twenty-eighth Street, where we lived very\ncomfortably for many years.  Indeed Richard did not leave them until\nhis marriage in the summer of 1899.  They were very pleasant, sunny\nrooms, and in the sitting-room, which Richard had made quite\nattractive, we gave many teas and supper-parties.  But of all the happy\nincidents I can recall at the Twenty-eighth Street house, the one I\nremember most distinctly took place in the hallway the night that\nRichard received the first statement and check for his first book of\nshort stories, and before the money had begun to come in as fast as it\ndid afterward.  We were on our way to dinner at some modest resort when\nwe saw and at once recognized the long envelope on the mantel.  Richard\nguessed it would be for one hundred and ninety dollars, but with a\nrather doubting heart I raised my guess to three hundred.  And when,\nwith trembling fingers, Richard had finally torn open the envelope and\nfound a check for nine hundred and odd dollars, what a wild dance we\ndid about the hall-table, and what a dinner we had that night!  Not at\nthe modest restaurant as originally intended, but at Delmonico's! It\nwas during these days that Seymour Hicks and his lovely wife Ellaline\nTerriss first visited America, and they and Richard formed a mutual\nattachment that lasted until his death.\n\nRichard had always taken an intense interest in the drama, and at the\ntime he was managing editor of Harper's Weekly had made his first\nefforts as a playwright.  Robert Hilliard did a one-act version of\nRichard's short story, \"Her First Appearance,\" which under the title of\n\"The Littlest Girl\" he played in vaudeville for many years.  E. H.\nSothern and Richard had many schemes for writing a play together, but\nthe only actual result they ever attained was a one-act version Sothern\ndid at the old Lyceum of my brother's story, \"The Disreputable Mr.\nRaegen.\"  It was an extremely tense and absorbing drama, and Sothern\nwas very fine in the part of Raegen, but for the forty-five minutes the\nplaylet lasted Sothern had to hold the stage continuously alone, and as\nit preceded a play of the regulation length, the effort proved too much\nfor the actor's strength, and after a few performances it was taken\noff.  Although it was several years after this that my brother's first\nlong play was produced he never lost interest in the craft of\nplaywriting, and only waited for the time and means to really devote\nhimself to it.\n\n\n\nBOSTON, January 22nd, 1891.\n\nDEAR FAMILY:--\n\nThis is just to say that I am alive and sleepy, and that my head is\nstill its normal size, although I have at last found one man in Boston\nwho has read one of my stories, and that was Barrymore from New York.\nThe Fairchilds' dinner was a tremendous affair, and I was conquered\nabsolutely by Mr. Howells, who went far, far out of his way to be as\nkind and charming as an old man could be.  Yesterday Mrs. Whitman gave\na tea in her studio.  I thought she meant to have a half dozen young\npeople to drink a cup with her, and I sauntered in in the most\nnonchalant manner to find that about everybody had been asked to meet\nme.  And everybody came, principally owing to the \"Harding Davis\" part\nof the name for they all spoke of mother and so very dearly that it\nmade me pretty near weep.  Everybody came from old Dr. Holmes who never\ngoes any place, to Mrs. \"Jack\" Gardner and all the debutantes.  \"I was\non in that scene.\"  In the evening I went with the Fairchilds to Mrs.\nJulia Ward Howe's to meet the S----s but made a point not to as he was\ntalking like a cad when I heard him and Mrs. Fairchild and I agreed to\nbe the only people in Boston who had not clasped his hand.  There were\nonly a few people present and Mrs. Howe recited the Battle Hymn of the\nRepublic, which I thought very characteristic of the city.  To-day I\nposed again and Cumnock took me over Cambridge and into all of the\nClubs where I met some very nice boys and felt very old.  Then we went\nto a tea Cushing gave in his rooms and to night I go to Mrs. Deland's.\nBut the mornings with the Fairchilds are the best.  DICK.\n\n\nIn the spring of 1891 my mother and sister, Nora, went abroad for the\nsummer, and the following note was written to Richard just before my\nmother sailed:\n\nDEAR DICK:\n\nThis is just to give my dearest love to you my darling.  Some day at\nsea when I cannot hear you nor see you, whenever it is that you get\nit--night or morning---you may be sure that we are all loving and\nthinking of you.\n\nKeep close to the Lord.  Your Lord who never has refused to hear a\nprayer of yours.\n\nJust think that I have kissed you a thousand times.\n\nMOTHER.\n\n\n\nFRANKLIN SQUARE, NEW YORK.\n\nJune, 1891.\n\nDEAR MOTHER:\n\nYour letters are a great delight to me but I think you are going\nentirely too quickly.  You do not feel it now but you are simply\nhurrying through the courses of your long dinner so rapidly that when\ndessert comes you will not be up to it.  A day or two's rest and less\ngreed to see many things would be much more fun I should think, and you\nwill enjoy those days more to look back to when you wandered around\nsome little town by yourselves and made discoveries than those you\nspent doing what you feel you ought to do.  Excuse this lecture but I\nknow that when I got to Paris I wanted to do nothing but sit still and\nread and let \"sights\" go-- You will soon learn not to duplicate and\nthat one cathedral will answer for a dozen.  And I am disappointed in\nyour mad desire to get to Edinboro to get letters from home, as though\nyou couldn't get letters from me every day of your life and as if there\nwere not enough of you together to keep from getting homesick.  I am\nashamed of you.  But that is all the scolding I have to do for I do not\nknow what has given me more pleasure than your letters and Nora's\nespecially.  They tell me the best news in the world and that is, that\nyou are all getting as much happiness out of it as I have prayed you\nwould.  I may go over in September myself.  But I would only go to\nLondon.  Now, then for Home news.  I have sold the \"Reporter Who Made\nHimself King\" to McClure's for $300. to be published in the syndicate\nin August.  I have finished \"Her First Appearance\" and Gibson is doing\nthe illustrations, three.  I got $175. for it.\n\nI am now at work on a story about Arthur Cumnock, Harvard's football\ncaptain who was the hero of Class Day.  It will come out this week and\nwill match Lieut. Grant's chance.  In July I begin a story called the\n\"Traveller's Tale\" which will be used in the November Harper.  That is\nall _I_ am doing.\n\nSo far the notices of \"Gallegher\" have been very good, I mean the\nEnglish ones.\n\nI went up to Class Day on Friday and spent the day with Miss Fairchild\nand Miss Howells and with Mr. H. for chaperone.  He is getting old and\nsays he never deserved the fuss they made over him.  We had a pretty\nperfect day although it threatened rain most of the time.  We wandered\naround from one spread to another meeting beautifully dressed girls\neverywhere and \"lions\" and celebrities.  Then the fight for the roses\naround the tree was very interesting and picturesque and arena like and\nthe best of all was sitting in the broad window seats of the\ndormitories with a Girl or two, generally \"a\" girl and listening to the\nglee club sing and watching the lanterns and the crowds of people as\nbeautiful as Redfern could make them.\n\nHalf of Seabright was burnt down last week but not my half, although\nthe fire destroyed all the stores and fishermen's houses and stopped\nonly one house away from Pannachi's, where I will put up.  I am very\nwell and content and look forward to much pleasure this summer at\nSeabright and much work.  I find I have seldom been so happy as when\nworking hard and fast as I have been forced to do these last two weeks\nand so I will keep it up.  Not in such a way as to hurt me but just\nenough to keep me happy.  DICK.\n\n\nNEW YORK, August 1891.  From The Pall Mall Budget Gazette.\n\n\"The Americans are saying, by the way, that they have discovered a\nRudyard Kipling of their own.  This is Mr. Richard Harding Davis, a\nvolume of whose stories has been published this week by Mr. Osgood.\nMr. Davis is only twenty-six, was for sometime on the staff of the New\nYork Evening Sun.  He is now the editor of Harper's Weekly.\"\n\nThat is me.  I have also a mother and sister who once went to London\nand what do you think they first went to see, in London, mind you.\nThey got into a four wheeler and they said \"cabby drive as fast as you\ncan,\" not knowing that four wheelers never go faster than a dead\nmarch--\" to-- \"where do you think? St. Paul's, the Temple, the Abbey,\ntheir lodgings, the Houses of Parliament--the Pavilion Music Hall--the\nTower--no to none of these--\"To the Post Office.\"  That is what my\nmother and sister did!  After this when they hint that they would like\nto go again and say \"these muffins are not English muffins\" and \"do you\nremember the little Inn at Chester, ah, those were happy days,\" I will\nsay, \"And do you remember the Post Office in Edinburgh and London.  We\nhave none such in America.\"  And as they only go abroad to get letters\nthey will hereafter go to Rittenhouse Square and I will write letters\nto them from London.  All this shows that a simple hurriedly written\nletter from Richard Harding Davis is of more value than all the show\nplaces of London.  It makes me quite PROUD.  And so does this:\n\n\"'Gallegher' is as good as anything of Bret Harte's, although it is in\nMr. Davis's own vein, not in the borrowed vein of Bret Harte or anybody\nelse.  'The Cynical Miss Catherwaight' is very good, too, and 'Mr.\nRaegen' is still better.\"\n\nBut on the other hand, it makes me tired, and so does this:\n\n\"'The Other Woman' is a story which offends good taste in more than one\nway.  It is a blunder to have written it, a greater blunder to have\npublished it, and a greater blunder STILL to have republished it.\"\n\nI suppose now that Dad has crossed with Prince George and Nora has seen\nthe Emperor, that you will be proud too.  But you will be prouder of\nyour darling boy Charles, even though he does get wiped out at\nSeabright next week and you will be even prouder when he writes great\nstories for The Evening Sun.\n\nRICHARD.\n\n\nThe Players,\n\n16 Gramercy Park.\n\n24th, 1891.\n\nDEAR FAMILY:\n\nI had a great day at the game and going there and coming back.  I met a\ngreat many old football men and almost all of them spoke of the \"Out of\nthe Game\" story.  Cumnock, Camp, Poe, Terry and lots more whose names\nmean nothing to you, so ignorant are you, were there and we had long\ntalks.  I went to see Cleveland yesterday about a thing of which I have\nthought much and talked less and that was going into politics in this\ncountry.  To say he discouraged me in so doing would be saying the rain\nis wet.  He seemed to think breaking stones as a means of getting fame\nand fortune was quicker and more genteel.  I also saw her and the BABY.\nShe explained why she had not written you and also incidentally why she\nHAD written Childs.  I do not know as what Cleveland said made much\nimpression upon me--although I found out what I could expect from\nhim--that is nothing here but apparently a place abroad if I wanted it.\nBut he thought Congress was perfectly feasible but the greatest folly\nto go there.\n\nDICK.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER V\n\nFIRST TRAVEL ARTICLES\n\nFor Richard these first years in New York were filled to overflowing\nwith many varied interests, quite enough to satisfy most young men of\ntwenty-seven.  He had come and seen and to a degree, so far as the\nlimitation of his work would permit, had conquered New York, but\nRichard thoroughly realized that New York was not only a very small\npart of the world but of his own country, and that to write about his\nown people and his own country and other people and other lands he must\nstart his travels at an early age, and go on travelling until the end.\nAnd for the twenty-five years that followed that was what Richard did.\nEven when he was not on his travels but working on a novel or a play at\nMarion or later on at Mount Kisco, so far as it was possible he kept in\ntouch with events that were happening and the friends that he had made\nall over the globe.  He subscribed to most of the English and French\nillustrated periodicals and to one London daily newspaper which every\nday he read with the same interest that he read half a dozen New York\nnewspapers and the interest was always that of the trained editor at\nwork.  Richard was not only physically restless but his mind\npractically never relaxed.  When others, tired after a hard day's work\nor play, would devote the evening to cards or billiards or chatter,\nRichard would write letters or pore over some strange foreign magazine,\nconsult maps, make notes, or read the stories of his contemporaries.\nHe practically read every American magazine from cover to\ncover--advertisements were a delight to him, and the finding of a new\nwriter gave him as much pleasure as if he had been the fiction editor\nwho had accepted the first story by the embryo genius.  The official\norgans of our army and navy he found of particular interest.  Not only\ndid he thus follow the movements of his friends in these branches of\nthe service but if he read of a case wherein he thought a sailor or a\nsoldier had been done an injustice he would promptly take the matter up\nwith the authorities at Washington, and the results he obtained were\noften not only extremely gratifying to the wronged party but caused\nRichard no end of pleasure.\n\nAccording to my brother's arrangement with the Harpers, he was to\ndevote a certain number of months of every year to the editing of The\nWeekly, and the remainder to travel and the writing of his experiences\nfor Harper's Monthly.  He started on the first of these trips in\nJanuary, 1892, and the result was a series of articles which afterward\nappeared under the title of \"The West from a Car Window.\"\n\n\n\nJanuary, 1892.  (Some place in Texas)\n\nI left St. Louis last night, Wednesday, and went to bed and slept for\ntwelve hours.  To-day has been most trying and I shall be very glad to\nget on dry land again.  The snow has ceased although the papers say\nthis is the coldest snap they have had in San Antonio in ten years.  It\nmight have waited a month for me I think.  It has been a most dreary\ntrip from a car window point of view.  Now that the snow has gone,\nthere is mud and ice and pine trees and colored people, but no cowboys\nas yet.  They talk nothing but Chili and war and they make such funny\nmistakes.  We have a G. A. R. excursion on the train, consisting of one\nfat and prosperous G. A. R., the rest of the excursion having backed\nout on account of Garza who the salient warriors imagine as a roaring\nlion seeking whom he may devour.  One old chap with white hair came on\nboard at a desolate station and asked for \"the boys in blue\" and was\nvery much disgusted when he found that \"that grasshopper Garza\" had\nscared them away-- He had tramped five miles through the mud to greet a\npossible comrade and was much chagrined.  The excursion shook hands\nwith him and they took a drink together.  The excursion tells me he is\na glass manufacturer, an owner of a slate quarry and the best embalmer\nof bodies in the country.  He says he can keep them four years and does\nso \"for specimens\" those that are left on his hands and others he\npurchases from the morgue.  He has a son who is an actor and he fills\nme full of the most harrowing tales of Indian warfare and the details\nof the undertaking business.  He is SO funny about the latter that I\nweep with laughter and he cannot see why-- Joe Jefferson and I went to\na matinee on Wednesday and saw Robson in \"She stoops to Conquer.\"  The\nhouse was absolutely packed and when Joe came in the box they yelled\nand applauded and he nodded to them in the most fatherly, friendly way\nas though to say \"How are you, I don't just remember your name but I'm\nglad to see you--\" It was so much sweeter than if he had got up and\nbowed as I would have done.\n\n\nSAN ANTONIO\n\nI knew more about Texas than the Texans and when they told me I would\nfind summer here I smiled knowingly-- That is all the smiling I have\ndone---Did you ever see a stage set for a garden or wood scene by\ndaylight or Coney Island in March--that is what the glorious, beautiful\nbaking city of San Antonio is like.  There is mud and mud and mud--in\ncans, in the gardens of the Mexicans and snow around the palms and\npalmettos-- Does the sun shine anywhere?  Are people ever warm-- It is\nraw, ugly and muddy, the Mexicans are merely dirty and not picturesque.\nI am greatly disappointed.  But I have set my teeth hard and I will go\non and see it through to the bitter end-- But I will not write anything\nfor publication until I can take a more cheerful view of it.  I already\nhave reached the stage where I admit the laugh is on me-- But there is\nstill London to look forward to and this may get better when the sun\ncomes out---I went to the fort to-day and was most courteously\nreceived.  But they told me I should go on to Laredo, if I expected to\nsee any campaigning-- There is no fighting nor is any expected but they\nsay they will give me a horse and I can ride around the chaparral as\nlong as I want.  I will write you from Laredo, where I go to-morrow,\nSaturday--\n\nDICK.\n\n\nAt Laredo Richard left the beaten track of the traveller, and with\nTrooper Tyler, who acted as his guide, joined Captain Hardie in his\nsearch for Garza.  The famous revolutionist was supposed to be in\nhiding this side of the border, and the Mexican Government had asked\nthe United States to find him and return him to the officials of his\nown country.\n\n\nIn Camp, February 2nd.\n\nDEAR MOTHER:--\n\nWe have stopped by the side of a trail for a while and I will take the\nchance it gives me to tell you what I have been doing.  After Tyler and\nI returned to camp, we had a day of rest before Captain Hardie arrived.\nHe is a young, red-moustached, pointed-bearded chap with light blue\neyes, rough with living in the West but most kind hearted and\nenthusiastic.  He treats me as though I were his son which is rather\nabsurd as he is only up to my shoulder.  It is so hot I cannot make the\nwords go straight and you must not mind if I wander.  We are hugging a\nfence for all the shade there is and the horses and men have all\ncrawled to the dark side of it and are sleeping or swearing at the sun.\nIt is about two o'clock and we have been riding since half-past seven.\nI have had a first rate time but I do not see that there has been much\nin it to interest any one but myself and where Harper Brothers or the\n\"gentle reader\" comes in, I am afraid I cannot see, and if I cannot see\nit I fear he will be in a bad way.  It has pleased and interested me to\nsee how I could get along under difficult circumstances and with so\nmuch discomfort but as I say I was not sent out here to improve my\ntemper or my health or to make me more content with my good things in\nthe East.  If we could have a fight or something that would excuse and\nmake a climax for all this marching and reconnoitering and discomfort\nthe story would have a suitable finale and a raison d'etre.  However, I\nmay get something out of it if only to abuse the Government for their\nstupidity in chasing a jack rabbit with a brass band or by praising the\nmen for doing their duty when they know there is no duty to be done.\nThis country is more like the ocean than anything else and drives one\ncrazy with its monotony and desolation.  And to think we went to war\nwith Mexico for it-- To-day is my tenth day with the troops in the camp\nand in the field and I will leave them as soon as this scout is over\nwhich will be in three days at the most.  Then I will go to Corpus\nChristi and from there to the ranches but I will wait until I get\nbaths, hair cuts and a dinner and cool things to drink-- One thing has\npleased me very much and that is that I, with Tyler and the Mexican\nScout made the second best riding record of the troop since they have\nbeen in the field this winter.  The others rode 115 miles in 32 hours,\nfour of them under the first Sergeant, after revolutionists, and we\nmade 110 miles in 33 hours.  The rest of the detachment made 90 miles\nand our having the extra thirty to our credit was an accident.  On the\n31st Hardie sent out the scout and two troopers, of which Tyler was\none, to get a trail and as I had been resting and loafing for three\ndays, I went out with them.  We left at eight after breakfast and\nreturned at seven, having made thirty miles.  When we got in we found\nthat a detachment was going out on information sent in while we were\nout.  Tyler was in it and so we got fresh horses and put out at nine\no'clock by moonlight.  That was to keep the people in the ranch from\nknowing we were going out.  We rode until half-past three in the\nmorning and then camped at the side of the road until half--past six,\nwhen we rode on until five in the afternoon.  The men who were watching\nto see me give up grew more and more interested as the miles rolled out\nand the First Sergeant was very fearful for his record for which he has\nbeen recommended for the certificate of merit.  The Captain was very\nmuch pleased and all the men came and spoke to me.  It must have been a\ngood ride for Tyler who is a fifth year man was so tired that he paid a\nman to do his sentry duty.  We slept at Captain Hunter's camp that last\nnight and we both came on this morning, riding thirty miles up to two\no'clock to-day.  From here we go on into the brush again.  I am very\nproud of that riding record and of my beard which is fine.  I will\nfinish this when we get near a post-office.\n\nDICK.\n\n\nFebruary 4th-- We rode forty miles through the brush but saw nothing of\nGarza, who was supposed to be in it.  But we captured 3 revolutionists,\none of whom ran away but the scout got him.  Hardie, Tyler, who is his\norderly, and the scout and I took them in because the rest of the\ncolumn was lagging in the rear and the Lieutenant got bally hooly for\nit.  Tyler disarmed one and I took away the other chaps things.  Then\nwe took a fourth in and let them all go for want of evidence and after\nsome of the ranch men had identified them.\n\n\nCORPUS CHRISTI, February 6.\n\nWe ended our scout yesterday, and camped at Captain Hunter's last\nnight-- Mother can now rest her soul in peace as I have done with\nscoutings and have replaced the free and easy belt and revolver for the\nblack silk suspenders and the fire badge of civilization.  I am still\ncovered with 11 days dirt but will get lots of good things to eat and\ndrink and smoke at Corpus Christi to night, where I will stay for two\ndays.  I am writing this on the car and a ranger is shooting splinters\nout of the telegraph poles from the window in front and has a New York\ndrummer in a state of absolute nervous prostration.  I met the Rangers\nlast night as we came into camp and find them quite the most\ninteresting things yet.  They are just what I expected to find here and\nhave not disappointed me.  Everything else is either what we know it to\nbe and know all about or else is disappointingly commonplace.  I mean\nwe know certain things are picturesque and I find them so but they have\nbeen \"done\" to death and new material seems so scarce.  I am sometimes\nvery fearful of the success of the letters-- However, the Rangers I\nsimply loved.  They were gentle voiced and did not swear as the\nsoldiers do and some of them were as handsome men as I ever saw and SO\nBIG.  And such children.  They showed me all their tricks at the\nrequest of the Adjutant General, who looks upon them as his special\nproperty.  They shot four shots into a tree with a revolver, going at\nfull gallop, hit a mark with both hands at once, shot with the pistol\nupside down and the Captain put eight shots into a board with a\nWinchester, while I was putting two into the field around it.  We got\nalong very well indeed and they were quite keen for me to go back and\nchase Garza.  They are sure they have him now.  I gave the Captain\npermission to put four shots into my white helmet.  He only put two and\nthe rest of the company thinking their reputations were at stake\nwhipped out their guns and snatched up their rifles and blazed away\nuntil they danced the hat all over the ranch.  Then remorse overcame\nthem and they proposed taking up a collection to get me a sombrero,\nwhich I stopped.  So Nora's hat is gone but I am going to get another\nand save myself from sunstroke again.  The last part of the ride was\nenlivened by the presence of three Mexican murderers handcuffed and\nchained with iron bands around the neck, that is Texas civilization\nisn't it--\n\nI have had my dinner and a fine dinner it was with fresh fish and duck\nand oysters and segars which I have not had for a week.  I am finishing\nthis at Constantine's and will be here for two days to write things and\nwill then go on to King's ranch and from there to San Antonio, where I\nwill also rest a week.  I will just about get through my schedule in\nthe ten weeks at this rate.  I had a good time in the bush and am\nenjoying it very much though it is lonely now and then-- Still, it is\nvery interesting and if the stories amount to anything I will be\npleased but I am constantly wondering how on earth Chas stood it as he\ndid.  He is a hero to me for I have some hope of getting back and he\nhad not-- He is a sport-- How I will sleep to night--a real bed and\nsheets and pajamas, after the ground and the same clothes for eleven\ndays.\n\nof love.\n\nDICK.\n\n\nWhile Richard was travelling in the West, his second volume of short\nstories, \"Van Bibber and Others,\" was published.  The volume was\ndedicated to my father, who wrote Richard the following letter:\n\n\nPHILADELPHIA, February 15, 1892.\n\nMY DEAR OWN DICK:\n\nI have not been the complete letter writer I should have been, as I\ntold you on Saturday, but I know you will  understand.  Your two good\nletters came this evening, one to Mamma and one to Nora.  They were a\ngood deal to us all, most, of course, to your dear mother and sister,\nwho have a fond, foolish fancy or love for you--strange--isn't it?\nYes, dear boy, I liked the new story very, very much.  It was in your\nbest book and in fine spirit, and I liked, too, the dedication of the\nbook--its meaning and its manner.  I am glad to be associated with my\ndear boy and with his work even in that brief way.  You may not yet\nthought about it after this fashion, but I have thought a good deal\nabout it.  Reports come to me of you from many sources, and they are\nall good, and they all reflect honor upon me-- Upon me as I'm getting\nready to salute the world, as our French friends say.  It is very\npleasant to me as I think it over to feel and to know that my boy has\nhonored my name, that he has done something good and useful in the\nworld and for the world.  I have something more than pride in you.  I\nam grateful to you.  If this is a little prosie, dear old fellow,\nforgive it.  It is late at night and I am a little tired, and being\ntired stupid.  You saw The Atlantic notice of your work.  I wish you\ncould have heard Nora on the author of it, who would not have been\nhappy in his mind if he had unhappily heard her.  She went for that\nHeathen Chinee like a wild cat.  No disrespect to her, but, all the\nsame, like a wild cat.  To me it was interesting.  I did not agree with\nit, but here and there I saw the flash of truth even in the adverse\npraise.  I should have had more respect for the author's opinion if he\nhad liked that vital speck, Raegen.  If he could not see the divine,\nhuman spark in that--a flash from Calvary, what is the use of\nconsidering him?  My greatest pride in you, that which has added some\nsweetness and joy to my life, has been the recognition that something\nof the divine element was given you, and that your voice rang out sweet\nand pure at a time when other voices were sounding the fascinations of\nimpurity.  That, like Christ, you taught humanity.  Don't be afraid of\nbeing thought \"fresh,\" fear to be thought \"knowing.\"  Life isn't much\nworth at best,--it is worth nothing at all unless some good be done in\nit---the more, the better.  Don't make it too serious either.  Enjoy it\nas you go, but after a fashion that will bring no reproach to your\nmanhood.  Don't be afraid to preach the truth and above all the\nreligion of humanity.  Good night, dear boy.  I'm a little tired to\nnight.  With great love,\n\nDAD.\n\n\nANADARKO--February 26th, 1892.\n\nDEAR FAMILY:--\n\nI could not write you before as I have been traveling from pillars to\nposts, (a joke), in a stage, night and day.  I went to Fort Reno from\nOklahoma City where they drove me crazy almost with town lots and lot\nsites and homestead holdings.  It was all raw and mean, and greedy for\nmoney and a man is much better off in every way in a tenement on Second\nAvenue than the \"owner of his own home\" in one of these mushroom\ncities-- So I think.  I went to Fort Reno by stage and it seemed to me\nthat I was really in the West for the first time-- The rest has been as\nmuch like the oil towns around Pittsburgh as anything else.  But here\nthere are rolling prairie lands with millions of prairie dogs and deep\ncanons and bluffs of red clay that stand out as clear as a razor\nhollowed and carved away by the water long ago.  And the grass is as\nhigh as a stirrup and the trees very plentiful after the plains of\nTexas.  The men at Fort Reno were the best I have met, indeed I am just\na little tired of trying to talk of things of interest to the Second\nLieutenant's intellect.  But I had to leave there because I had missed\nthe beef issue and had to see it and as it was due here I pushed on.\nThis post is very beautiful but the men are very young and civil\nappointments mainly, which means that they have not been to West Point\nbut had fathers and have friends with influence and they are fresh.\nBut the scenery around the post is delightfully wild and big and there\nis an Indian camp at the foot of the hill on which the fort is stuck.\nMother, instead of going to Europe, should come here and see her\nIndians.  Only if she did she would bring a dozen or more of the\nchildren back with her.  They are the brightest spot in my trip and I\nspend the mornings and afternoons trying to get them to play with me.\nThey are very shy and pretty and beautifully barbaric and wear the most\ngorgeous trappings.  The women, the older ones, are the ugliest women I\never saw.  But the men are fine.  I never saw such color as they give\nto the landscape and one always thinks they have dressed up just to\nplease you.  I have spent most of my time and money in buying things\nfrom them but they are very dear because the Indians take long to make\nthem and do not like to part with them.  I have had rough times lately\nbut I think I would be content to remain in the west six months if I\ncould.  It is the necessity of leaving places I like and pushing on to\nplaces I don't, I dislike.  Reno was fine with a band and lots of fine\nfellows.  This post is not so queer but they are so young-- It makes a\ngreat bit of color though with the yellow capes of the cavalry and the\nsoldiers wig--waging red and white flags at other soldiers eight miles\naway on other mountains and the Indians in yellow buckskin and blankets\nand their faces painted too.  I went to the beef issue to-day--it was\nnot a pretty sight and most barbarous and cruel.  I also went to a\ncouncil at which the chiefs were protesting against the cutting down of\ntheir rations which is Commissioner Morgan's doing and which it is\nexpected will lead to war-- We went in out of curiosity and without\nknowing it was a Council and were very much ashamed when one of the\nChiefs rose and said he was glad to see the officers present as they\nwere the best friends the Indians had and the only men they could\nrespect in times of peace as a friend, or in times of war as an enemy.\nAt which we took off our hats and sat it through.  Mother's blood would\nrise if she could hear the stories they tell, and they are so dignified\nand polite.  They have an Indian troop here, like the one described in\nThe Weekly, which you should read and the Captain told them I was a\ngreat Chief from the East, whereat all the soldiers who were of noble\nlineage claimed their privilege of shaking hands with me, which had a\ndemoralizing effect upon the formation and the white privates were\neither convulsed with mirth or red with indignation.  But you cannot\ntreat them like white men who do not know their ancestors-- Dad's\nletter was the best I have ever got from him and he had always better\nwrite when he is tired.  I will always keep it.\n\nDICK.\n\n\nDENVER--March 7, 1892.\n\nDEAR FAMILY:\n\nI arrived in Denver Friday night and realized that I was in a city\nagain where the more you order people about the more they do for you,\nbeing civilized and so understanding that you mean to tip them.  I\nfound my first letter on the newsstand and was very much pleased with\nit, and with the way they put it out.  The proof was perfect and if\nthere had been more pictures I would have been entirely satisfied, as\nit was I was very much pleased.  My baggage had not come, so covered\nwith mud and dust and straw from the stages and generally disreputable\nI went to see a burlesque, and said \"Front row, end seat,\" just as\nnaturally as though I was in evening dress and high hat--and then I\nsank into a beautiful deep velvet chair and saw Amazon marches and\nladies in tights and heard the old old jokes and the old old songs we\nknow so well and sing so badly.  The next morning I went for my mail\nand the entire post office came out to see me get it.  It took me until\nseven in the evening to finish it, and I do not know that it will ever\nbe answered.  The best of it was that you were all pleased with my\nletters.  That put my mind at rest.  Then there was news of deaths and\nmarriages and engagements and the same people doing the same things\nthey did when I went away.  I did not intend to present any letters as\nI was going away that night to Creede, but I found I could not get any\nmoney unless some one identified me so I presented one to a Mr. Jerome\nwho all the bankers said they would be only too happy to oblige.  After\none has been variously taken for a drummer, photographer and has been\noffered so much a line to \"write up\" booming towns, it is a relief to\nget back to a place where people know you.--I told Mr. Jerome I had a\nletter of introduction and that I was Mr. Davis and he shook hands and\nthen looked at the letter and said \"Good Heavens are you that Mr.\nDavis\" and then rushed off and brought back the entire establishment\nbrokers, bankers and mine owners and they all sat around and told me\nfunny stories and planned more things for me to do and eat than I could\ndispose of in a month.\n\nI am now en route to Creede.  Creede when you first see it in print\nlooks like creede but after you have been in Denver or Colorado even\nfor one day it reads like C R E E D E.  All the men on this car think\nthey are going to make their fortunes, and toward that end they have on\nnew boots and flannel shirts, and some of them seeing my beautiful\nclothing and careful array came over and confided to me that they were\nreally not so tough as they looked and had never worn a flannel shirt\nbefore.  This car is typical of what they told me I would find at\nCreede.  There are rich mine owners who are pointed out by the\nconductor as the fifth part owner of the \"Pot Luck\" mine, and dudes in\nastrakan fur coats over top boots and new flannel shirts, and hardened\nold timers with their bedding and tin pans, who have prospected all\nover the state and women who are smoking and drinking.\n\nI feel awfully selfish whenever I look out of the car window.\nSwitzerland which I have never seen is a spot on the map compared to\nthis.  The mountains go up with snow on one side and black rows of\ntrees and rocks on the other, and the clouds seem packed down between\nthem.  The sun on the snow and the peaks peering above the clouds is\nall new to me and so very beautiful that I would like to buy a mountain\nand call it after my best girl.  I will finish this when I get to\nCreede.  I expect to make my fortune there.  DICK.\n\n\nCREEDE, March 7.\n\nA young man in a sweater and top boots met me at the depot and said\nthat I was Mr. Davis and that he was a young man whose life I had\nwritten in \"There was 90 and 9.\"  He was from Buffalo and was editing a\npaper in Creede.  He said I was to stop with him-- Creede is built of\nnew pine boards and lies between two immense mountains covered with\npines and snow.  The town is built in the gulley and when the spring\nfreshets come will be a second Johnstown.  Faber, the young man, took\nme to the Grub State Cabin where I found two most amusing dudes and\nthoroughbred sports from Boston, Harvard men living in a cabin ten by\neight with four bunks and a stove, two banjos and H O P E.  They own\nnumerous silver mines, lots, and shares, but I do not believe they have\nfive dollars in cash amongst them.  They have a large picture of myself\nfor one of the ORNAMENTS and are great good fellows.  We sat up in our\nbunks until two this morning talking and are planning to go to Africa\nand Mexico and Asia Minor together.--Lots of love.\n\nDICK.\n\n\nVery happy indeed to be back in his beloved town, Richard returned to\nNew York late in March, 1892, and resumed his editorial duties.  But on\nthis occasion his stay was of particularly short duration, and in May,\nhe started for his long-wished-for visit to London.  The season there\nwas not yet in full swing, and after spending a few days in town,\njourneyed to Oxford, where he settled down to amuse himself and collect\nmaterial for his first articles on English life as he found it.  In\nwriting of this visit to Oxford, H. J.  Whigham, one of Richard's\noldest friends, and who afterward served with him in several campaigns,\nsaid:\n\n\"When we first met Richard Harding Davis he was living, to all\npractical purposes, the life of an undergraduate at Balliol College,\nOxford.  Anyone at all conversant with the customs of universities,\nespecially with the idiosyncrasies of Oxford, knows that for a person\nwho is not an undergraduate to share the life of undergraduates on\nequal terms, to take part in their adventures, to be admitted to their\nconfidence is more difficult than it is for the camel to pass through\nthe eye of a needle or for the rich man to enter heaven.  It was\ncharacteristic of Davis that although he was a few years older than the\naverage university \"man\" and came from a strange country and, moreover,\nhad no official reason for being at Oxford at all, he was accepted as\none of themselves by the Balliol undergraduates, in fact, lived in\nBalliol for at least a college term, and happening to fall in with a\nsomewhat enterprising generation of Balliol men he took the lead in\nseveral escapades which have been written into Oxford history.  There\nis in the makeup of the best type of college undergraduate a wonderful\nspirit of adventure, an unprejudiced view of life, an almost Quixotic\nfeeling for romance, a disdain of sordid or materialistic motives,\nwhich together make the years spent at a great university the most\ngolden of the average man's career.  These characteristics Davis was\nfortunate enough to retain through all the years of his life.  The same\nspirit that took him out with a band of Oxford youths to break down an\niron barrier set by an insolent landowner across the navigable waters\nof Shakespeare's Avon carried him, in after years, to the battlefields\nwhere Greece fought against the yoke of Turkey, to the insurrecto camps\nof Cuba, to the dark horrors of the Congo, to Manchuria, where gallant\nJapan beat back the overwhelming power of Russia, to Belgium, where he\nsaw the legions of Germany trampling over the prostrate bodies of a\nsmall people.  Romance was never dead while Davis was alive.\"\n\nThat Richard lost no time in making friends at Oxford as, indeed, he\nnever failed to do wherever he went, the following letters to his\nmother would seem to show:\n\n\nOXFORD--May, 1892.\n\nDEAR FAMILY:\n\nI came down here on Saturday morning with the Peels, who gave an\nenormous boating party and luncheon on a tiny little island.  The day\nwas beautiful with a warm brilliant sun, and the river was just as\nnarrow and pretty as the head of the Squan river, and with old walls\nand college buildings added.  We had the prettiest Mrs. Peel in our\nboat and Mrs. Joseph Chamberlain, who was Miss Endicott and who is very\nsweet and pretty.  We raced the other punts and rowboats and soon,\nafter much splashing and exertion, reached the head of the river.  Then\nwe went to, tea in New College and to see the sights of the different\ncolleges now on the Thames.  The barges of the colleges, painted\ndifferent colors and gilded like circus band-wagons and decorated with\ncoats of arms and flying great flags, lined the one shore for a quarter\nof a mile and were covered by girls in pretty frocks and under-grads in\nblazers.  Then the boats came into sight one after another with the men\nrunning alongside on the towpath.  This was one of the most remarkable\nsights of the country so far.  There were over six hundred men coming\nsix abreast, falling and stumbling and pushing, shouting and firing\npistols.  It sounded like a cavalry charge and the line seemed endless.\nThe whole thing was most theatrical and effective.  Then we went to the\nannual dinner of the Palmerston Club, where I made a speech which was,\nas there is no one else to tell you, well received, \"being frequently\ninterrupted with applause,\" from both the diners and the ladies in the\ngallery.  It was about Free Trade and the way America was\nmisrepresented in the English papers, and composed of funny stories\nwhich had nothing to do with the speech.  I did not know I was going to\nspeak until I got there, and considering the fact, as Wilson says, that\nyour uncle was playing on a strange table with a crooked cue he did\nvery well.  The next morning we breakfasted with the Bursar of Trinity\nand had luncheon with the Viscount St. Cyres to meet Lord and Lady\nColeridge.  St. Cyres is very shy and well-bred, and we would have had\na good time had not the M. P.'s present been filled with awe of the\nLord Chief Justice and failed to draw him out.  As it was he told some\nvery funny stories; then we went to tea with Hubert Howard, in whose\nrooms I live and am now writing, and met some stupid English women and\nshy girls.  Then we dined with the dons at New College, so--called\nbecause it is eight hundred years old.  We sat at a high table in a big\nhall hung with pictures and lit by candles.  The under-grads sat\nbeneath in gowns and rattled pewter mugs.  We all wore evening dress\nand those that had them red and white fur collars.  After dinner we\nleft the room according to some process of selection, carrying our\nnapkins with us.  We entered a room called the Commons, where we drank\nwines and ate nuts and raisins.  It was all very solemn and dull and\nvery dignified.  Outside it was quite light although nine o'clock.\nThen we marched to another room where there were cigars and brandy and\nsoda, but Arthur Pollen and I had to go and take coffee with the Master\nof Balliol, the only individual of whom Pollen stands in the least awe.\nHe was a dear old man who said, \"O yes, you're from India,\" and on my\nsaying \"No, from America\"; he said, \"O yes, it's the other one.\"  I\nfound the other one was an Indian princess in a cashmere cloak and\ndiamonds, who looked so proud and lovely and beautiful that I wanted to\ntake her out to one of the seats in the quadrangle and let her weep on\nmy shoulder.  How she lives among these cold people I cannot\nunderstand.  We were all to go to a concert in the chapel, and half of\nthe party started off, but the Master's wife said, \"Oh, I am sure the\nMaster expects them to wait for him in the hall.  It is always done.\"\nAt which all the women made fluttering remarks of sympathy and the men\nraced off to bring the others back.  Only the Indian girl and I\nremained undisturbed and puzzled.  The party came back, but the Master\nsaw them and said, \"Well, it does not matter, but it is generally\ndone.\"  At which we all felt guilty.  When we got to the chapel\neverybody stood up until the Master's party sat down, but as it was\nbroken in the middle of the procession, they sat down, and then, seeing\nwe had not all passed, got up again, so that I felt like saying, \"As\nyou were, men,\" as they do out West in the barracks.  Then Lord\nColeridge in taking off his overcoat took off his undercoat, too, and\nstood unconscious of the fact before the whole of Oxford.  The faces of\nthe audience which packed the place were something wonderful to see;\ntheir desire to laugh at a tall, red-faced man who looks like a bucolic\nBill Nye struggling into his coat, and then horror at seeing the Chief\nJustice in his shirt-sleeves, was a terrible effort--and no one would\nhelp him, on the principle, I suppose, that the Queen of Spain has no\nlegs.  He would have been struggling yet if I had not, after watching\nhim and Lady Coleridge struggling with him, for a full minute, taken\nhis coat and firmly pulled the old gentleman into it, at which he\nturned his head and winked.\n\nI will go back to town by the first to see the Derby and will get into\nlodgings there.  I AM HAVING A VERY GOOD TIME AND AM VERY WELL.  The\nplace is as beautiful as one expects and yet all the time startling one\nwith its beauty.\n\nDICK.\n\n\nWhen the season at Oxford was over Richard returned to London and took\na big sunny suite of rooms in the Albany.  Here he settled down to\nlearn all he could of London, its ways and its people.  In New York he\nhad already met a number of English men and women distinguished in\nvarious walks of life, and with these as a nucleus he soon extended his\ncircle of friends until it became as large as it was varied.  In his\nyouth, and indeed throughout his life, Richard had the greatest\naffection for England and the English.  No truer American ever lived,\nbut he thought the United States and Great Britain were bound by ties\nthat must endure always.  He admired British habits, their\ncosmopolitanism and the very simplicity of their mode of living.  He\nloved their country life, and the swirl of London never failed to\nthrill him.  During the last half of his life Richard had perhaps as\nmany intimate friends in London as in New York.  His fresh point of\nview, his very eagerness to understand theirs, made them welcome him\nmore as one of their own people than as a stranger.\n\n\nLONDON, June 3, 1892.\n\nDEAR FAMILY:\n\nI went out to the Derby on Wednesday and think it is the most\ninteresting thing I ever saw over here.  It is SO like these people\nnever to have seen it.  It seems to be chiefly composed of\ncostermongers and Americans.  I got a box-seat on a public coach and\nwent out at ten.  We rode for three hours in a procession of donkey\nshays, omnibuses, coaches, carriages, vans, advertising wagons; every\nsort of conveyance stretching for sixteen miles, and with people lining\nthe sides to look on.  I spent my time when I got there wandering\naround over the grounds, which were like Barnum's circus multiplied by\nthousands.  It was a beautiful day and quite the most remarkable sight\nof my life.  Much more wonderful than Johnstown, so you see it must\nhave impressed me.  We were five hours getting back, the people singing\nall the way and pelting one another and saying funny impudent things.\n\nMy rooms are something gorgeous.  They are on the first floor, looking\ninto Piccadilly from a court, and they are filled with Hogarth's\nprints, old silver, blue and white china, Zulu weapons and fur rugs,\nand easy chairs of India silk.  You never saw such rooms!  And a very\ngood servant, who cooks and valets me and runs errands and takes such\ngood care of me that last night Cust and Balfour called at one to get\nsome supper and he would not let them in.  Think of having the Leader\nof the House of Commons come to ask you for food and having him sent\naway.  Burdett-Coutts heard of my being here in the papers and wrote me\nto dine with him tonight.  I lunched with the Tennants today; no\nrelation to Mrs. Stanley, and it was informal and funny rather.  The\nEarl of Spender was there and Lord Pembroke and a lot of women.  They\ngot up and walked about and changed places and seemed to know one\nanother better than we do at home.  I think I will go down to Oxford\nfor Whitsuntide, which is a heathen institution here which sends\neveryone away just as I want to meet them.\n\nI haven't written anything yet.  I find it hard to do so.  I think I\nwould rather wait until I get home for the most of it.  Chas. will be\nhere in less than a week now and we will have a good time.  I have\nplanned it out for days.  He must go to Oxford and meet those boys, and\nthen, if he wishes, on to Eastnor, which I learn since my return is one\nof the show places of England.  I am enjoying myself, it is needless to\nsay, very much, and am well and happy.\n\nDICK.\n\n\nDuring these first days in England Richard spent much of his time at\nEastnor, Lady Brownlow's place in Lincolnshire, and one of the most\nbeautiful estates in England.  Harry Cust, to whom my brother\nfrequently refers in his letters, was the nephew of Lady Brownlow, and\na great friend of Richard's.  At that time Cust was the Conservative\nnominee for Parliament from Lincolnshire, and Richard took a most\nactive part in the campaign.  Happily, we were both at Lady Brownlow's\nduring its last few tense days, as well as on the day the votes were\ncounted, and Cust was elected by a narrow margin.  Of our thrilling\nadventures Richard afterward wrote at great length in \"Our English\nCousins.\"\n\n\nLONDON, July 6, 1892.\n\nDEAR MOTHER:\n\nOn the Fourth of July, Lady Brownlow sent into town and had a big\nAmerican flag brought out and placed over the house, which was a great\ncompliment, as it was seen and commented on for miles around.  Cushing\nof Boston, a very nice chap and awfully handsome, is there, too.  The\nsame morning I went out to photograph the soldiers, and Lord William\nFrederick, who is their colonel, charged them after me whenever I\nappeared.  It seems he has a sense of humor and liked the idea of\nmaking an American run on the Fourth of July from Red-coats.  I doubt\nif the five hundred men who were not on horseback thought it as funny.\nThey chased me till I thought I would die.  The Conservative member for\nthe county got in last night and we rejoiced greatly, as the moral\neffect will help Harry Cust greatly.  His election takes place next\nMonday.  The men went in to hear the vote declared after dinner, and so\ndid two of the girls, who got Lady Brownlow's consent at dinner, and\nthen dashed off to change their gowns before she could change her mind.\nAs we were intent on seeing the fun and didn't want them, we took them\njust where we would have gone anyway, which was where the fighting was.\nAnd they showed real sporting blood and saw the other real sort.  There\nwere three of us to each girl, and it was most exciting, with stones\nflying and windows crashing and cheers and groans.  A political meeting\nor election at home is an afternoon tea to the English ones.  When we\ncame back the soldiers were leaving the Park to stop the row, and as we\nflew past, the tenants ran to the gate and cheered for the Tory victory\nin \"good old lopes.\"  When we got to the house the servants ran\ncheering all over the shop and rang the alarm bell and built fires, and\nwe had a supper at one-fifteen.  What they will do on the night of\nCust's election, I cannot imagine-- burn the house down probably.\nCushing and I enjoy it immensely.  We know them well enough now to be\nas funny as we like without having them stare.  They are nice when you\nknow them, but you've GOT to know them first.  I had a great dinner at\nFarrar's.  All the ecclesiastical lights of England in knee-breeches\nwere there, and the American Minister and Phillips Brooks.  It was\nquite novel and fun.  Lots of love.  I have all the money I want.\n\nDICK.\n\n\nWith Cust properly elected, Richard and I returned to the Albany and\nsettled down to enjoy London from many angles.  Although my brother had\nbeen there but a few weeks, his acquaintances among the statesmen,\nartists, social celebrities, and the prominent actors of the day was\nquite as extraordinary as his geographical and historical knowledge of\nthe city.  We gave many jolly parties, and on account of Richard's\nquickly acquired popularity were constantly being invited to dinners,\ndances, and less formal but most amusing Bohemian supper-parties.\nDuring these days there was little opportunity for my brother to do\nmuch writing, but he was very busy making mental notes not only for his\ncoming book on the English people, but for a number of short stories\nwhich he wrote afterward in less strenuous times.  We returned to New\nYork in August, and Richard went to Marion to rest from his social\nactivities, and to work on his English articles.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VI\n\nTHE MEDITERRANEAN AND PARIS\n\nIt was, I think, the year previous to this that my mother and father\nhad deserted Point Pleasant as a place to spend their summer vacations\nin favor of Marion, on Cape Cod, and Richard and I, as a matter of\ncourse, followed them there.  At that time Marion was a simple little\nfishing village where a few very charming people came every summer and\nwhere the fishing was of the best.  In all ways the life was most\nprimitive, and happily continued so for many years.  In, these early\ndays Grover Cleveland and his bride had a cottage there, and he and\nJoseph Jefferson, who lived at Buzzard's Bay, and my father went on\ndaily fishing excursions.  Richard Watson Gilder was one of the\nearliest settlers of the summer colony, and many distinguished members\nof the literary and kindred professions came there to visit him.  It\nwas a rather drowsy life for those who didn't fish--a great deal of\nsitting about on one's neighbor's porch and discussion of the latest\nnovel or the newest art, or of one's soul, and speculating as to what\nwould probably become of it.  From the first Richard formed a great\naffection for the place, and after his marriage adopted it as his\nwinter as well as his summer home.  As a workshop he had two rooms in\none of the natives' cottages, and two more charming rooms it would be\nhard to imagine.  The little shingled cottage was literally covered\nwith honeysuckle, and inside there were the old wall-papers, the open\nhearths, the mahogany furniture, and the many charming things that had\nbeen there for generations, and all of which helped to contribute to\nthe quaint peaceful atmosphere of the place.  Dana Gibson had a cottage\njust across the road, and around the corner Gouverneur Morris lived\nwith his family.  At this time neither of these friends of Richard, nor\nRichard himself, allied themselves very closely to the literary colony\nand its high thoughts, but devoted most of their time to sailing about\nSippican Harbor, playing tennis and contributing an occasional short\nstory or an illustration to a popular magazine.  But after the colony\nhad taken flight, Richard often remained long into the fall, doing\nreally serious work and a great deal of it.  At such times he had to\ndepend on a few friends who came to visit him, but principally on the\nnatives to many of whom he was greatly attached.  It was during these\ndays that he first met his future wife, Cecil Clark, whose father, John\nM. Clark of Chicago, was one of the earliest of the summer colonists to\nbuild his own home at Marion.  A most charming and hospitable home it\nwas, and it was in this same house where we had all spent so many happy\nhours that Richard was married and spent his honeymoon, and for several\nyears made his permanent home.  Of the life of Marion during this later\nperiod, he became an integral part, and performed his duties as one of\nits leading citizens with much credit to the town and its people.  For\nMarion Richard always retained a great affection, for there he had\nplayed and worked many of his best years.  He had learned to love\neverything of which the quaint old town was possessed, animate and\ninanimate, and had I needed any further proof of how deeply the good\npeople of Marion loved Richard, the letters I received from many of\nthem at the time of his death would show.\n\nIn the early fall of 1892 Richard returned to his editorial work on\nHarper's Weekly, and one of the first assignments he gave was to\ndespatch himself to Chicago to report the Dedication Exercises of the\nWorld's Fair.  That the trip at least started out little to my\nbrother's liking the following seems to show.  However, Richard's moods\nfrequently changed with the hour, and it is more than possible that\nbefore the letter was sent he was enjoying himself hugely and regarding\nChicago with his usual kindly eyes.\n\n\nChicago Club,\n\nOctober 2, 1892.\n\nDEAR FAMILY:\n\nThough lost to sight I am still thinking of you sadly.  It seems that I\ntook a coupe after leaving you and after living in it for a few years I\ngrew tired and got out on the prairie and walked along drinking in the\npure air from the lakes and reading Liebig's and Cooper's advs.  After\na brisk ten mile walk I reentered my coupe and we in time drew up\nbefore a large hotel inhabited by a clerk and a regular boarder.  I am\non the seventh floor without a bathroom or electric button--I merely\nmade remarks and then returned to town in a railroad train which runs\nconveniently near.  After gaining civilization I made my way through\nseveral parades or it may have been the same one to the reviewing\nstand.  My progress was marked by mocking remarks by the police who\nasked of each other to get on to my coat and on several occasions I was\nmistaken by a crowd of some thousand people for the P----e of W----s,\nand tumultuously cheered.  At last I found an inspector of police on\nhorseback, who agreed to get me to the stand if it took a leg.  He\naccordingly charged about 300 women and clubbed eight men--I counted\nthem--and finally got me in.  He was very drunk but he was very good to\nme.\n\n\n\nOnce back from Chicago Richard divided his time between his desk at\nFranklin Square, his rooms on Twenty-eighth Street, and in quickly\npicking up the friendships and the social activities his trip to\nEngland had temporarily broken off.  Much as he now loved London, he\nwas still an enthusiastic New Yorker, and the amount of work and play\nhe accomplished was quite extraordinary.  Indeed it is difficult to\nunderstand where he found the time to do so much.  In addition to his\nwork on Harper's he wrote many short stories and special articles, not\nonly because he loved the mere writing of them, but because he had come\nto so greatly enjoy the things he could buy with the money his labors\nnow brought him.  His pleasures had increased as steadily as the prices\nhe could now command for his stories, and in looking back on those days\nit is rather remarkable when one considers his age, the temptations\nthat surrounded him, and his extraordinary capacity for enjoyment, that\nhe never seems to have forgotten the balance between work and play, and\nstuck to both with an unswerving and unceasing enthusiasm.  However,\nafter four months of New York, he decided it was high time for him to\nbe off again, and he arranged with the Harpers to spend the late winter\nand the spring in collecting material for the two sets of articles\nwhich afterward appeared in book form under the titles of \"The Rulers\nof the Mediterranean\" and \"About Paris.\" He set sail for Gibraltar the\nearly part of February, 1893, and the following letters describe his\nleisurely progress about the Mediterranean ports.\n\n\nNEW YORK, February 3, 1893.\n\nDEAREST MOTHER:\n\nThis is a little present for you and a goodby.  Your packing-case is\nwhat I need and what I shall want, and I love it because you made it.\nBut as YOU say, we understand and do not have to write love letters;\nyou have given me all that is worth while in me, and I love you so that\nI look forward already over miles and miles and days and months, and\njust see us sitting together at Marion and telling each other how good\nit is to be together again and holding each other's hands.  I don't\nbelieve you really know how HAPPY I am in loving you, dear, and in\nhaving you say nice things about me.  God bless you, dearest, and may I\nnever do anything to make you feel less proud of your wicked son.\n\nDICK.\n\n\nOff Gibraltar,\n  February 12, 1893.\n\nDEAR MOTHER:\n\nToday is Sunday.  We arrive at Gibraltar at five tomorrow morning and\nthe boat lies there until nine o'clock.  Unless war and pestilence have\nbroken out in other places, I shall go over to Tangiers in a day or\ntwo, and from there continue on my journey as mapped out when I left.\nI have had a most delightful trip and the most enjoyable I have ever\ntaken by sea.  These small boats are as different from the big\ntwin-screw steamers as a flat from a Broadway hotel.\n\nEveryone gets to know everything about everyone else, and it has been\nmore like a yacht than a passenger steamer.  When I first came on board\nI thought I would not find in any new old country I was about to visit\nanything more foreign than the people, and I was right, but they are\nmost amusing and I have learned a great deal.  They are different from\nany people I know, and are the Americans we were talking about.  The\nones of whom I used to read in The Atlantic and Blackwood's, as\ntraveling always and sinking out of sight whenever they reached home.\nThey, with the exception of a Boston couple, know none of my friends or\nmy haunts, and I have learned a great deal in meeting them.  It has\nbeen most BROADENING and the change has been SUCH a rest.  I had no\nidea of how tired I was of talking about the theater of Arts and\nLetters and Miss Whitney's debut and my Soul.  These people are simple\nand unimaginative and bourgeois to a degree and as kind-hearted and\napparent as animal alphabets.  I do not think I have had such a\ncomplete change or rest in years, and I am sure I have not laughed so\nmuch for as long.  Of course, the idea of a six months' holiday is\nenough to make anyone laugh at anything, but I find that besides that I\nwas a good deal harassed and run down, and I am glad to cut off from\neverything and start fresh.  I feel miserably selfish about it all the\ntime.\n\nThese Germans run everything as though you were the owner of the line.\nThe discipline is like that of the German Army or of a man-of-war,\neverything moves by the stroke of a bell, and they have had dances and\nspeeches and concerts and religious services and lectures every other\nminute.  Into all of these I have gone with much enthusiasm.  We have\nat the captain's table Dr. Field, the editor of The Evangelist, John\nRussell, a Boston Democrat, who was in Congress and who has been in\npublic life for over forty years.  A Tammany sachem, who looks like and\nworships Tweed, and who says what I never heard an American off the\nstage say:  \"That's me.  That's what I do,\" he says.  \"When I have\ninsomnia, I don't believe in your sleeping draughts.  I get up and go\nround to Jake Stewart's on Fourteenth Street and eat a fry or a\nporterhouse steak and then I sleep good---that's me.\"  There is also a\nlively lady from Albany next to me and her husband, who tells anecdotes\nof the war just as though it had happened yesterday.  Indeed, they are\nall so much older than I that all their talk is about things I never\nunderstood the truth about, and it is most interesting.  I really do\nnot know when I have enjoyed my meal time so much.  The food is very\ngood, although queer and German, and we generally take two hours to\neach sitting.  Dr. Field is my especial prey and he makes me laugh\nuntil I cry.  He is just like James Lewis in \"A Night Off,\" and is\nalways rubbing his hands and smacking his lips over his own daring\nexploits.  I twist everything he says into meaning something dreadful,\nand he is instantly explaining he did not really see a bullfight, but\nthat he walked around the outside of the building.  I have promised to\nshow him life with a capital L, and he is afraid as death of me.  But\nhe got back at me grandly last night when he presented a testimonial to\nthe captain, and referred to the captain's wife and boy whom he is\ngoing to see after a two years' absence, at which the captain wept and\neverybody else wept.  And Field, seeing he had made a point, waved his\narms and cried, \"I have never known a man who amounted to anything who\nhad not a good wife to care for--except YOU--\" he shouted, pointing at\nme, \"and no woman will ever save YOU.\"  At which the passengers, who\nfully appreciated how I had been worrying him, applauded loudly, and\nthe Doctor in his delight at having scored on me forgot to give the\ncaptain his testimonial.\n\nThere are two nice girls on board from Chicago and a queer Southern\ngirl who paints pictures and sings and writes poetry, and who is\ntraveling with an odd married woman who is an invalid and who like\neveryone else on board has apparently spent all her life away from\nhome.  I have spent my odd time in writing the story I told Dad the\nnight before I sailed and I think it in some ways the best, quite the\nbest, I have written.  I read it to the queer girl and her queer\nchaperon and they weep whenever they speak of it, which they do every\nhalf hour.  All the passengers apparently laid in a stock of\n\"Gallegher\" and \"The West\" before starting, and young women in yachting\ncaps are constantly holding me up for autographs and favorite\nquotations.  Yesterday we passed the Azores near enough to see the\nwindows in the houses, and we have seen other islands at different\ntimes, which is quite refreshing.  Tomorrow I shall post this and the\ntrip will be over.  It has been a most happy start.  I am not going to\nwrite letters often, but am going head over ears into this new life and\nlet the old one wait awhile.  You cannot handle Africa and keep up your\nfences in New York at the same time.  I am now going out to talk to the\nBoston couple, or to propose a lion hunt to Dr. Field.\n\nSince I wrote that last I have seen Portugal.  It made me seem suddenly\nvery far away from New York. Portugal is a high hill with a white watch\ntower on it flying signal flags.  It is apparently inhabited by one man\nwho lives in a long row of yellow houses with red roofs, and populated\nby sheep who do grand acts of balancing on the side of the hill.  There\nis also a Navy of a brown boat with a leg-of-mutton sail and a crew of\nthree men in the boat--not to speak of the dog.  It is a great thing to\nhave a traveled son.  None of you ever saw Portugal, yah!\n\nI am now in Gibraltar.  It is a large place and there does not seem to\nbe room in this letter, in which to express my feelings about Moors in\nbare legs and six thousand Red-coats and to hear Englishmen speak\nagain.  When I woke up Gibraltar was a black silhouette against the\nsky, but toward the south there was a low line of mountains with a red\nsky behind them, dim and mysterious and old, and that was Africa.  Then\nSpain turned up all amethyst and green, and the Mediterranean as blue\nas they tell you it is.  They wouldn't let me take my gun into\nGibraltar.  They know my reputation for war.\n\nDICK.\n\n\nGIBRALTAR.\n\nFebruary 14th, 1893.\n\nDEAR MOTHER:\n\nThe luck of the British Army which I am modestly fond of comparing with\nmy own took a vacation yesterday as soon as I had set foot on land.  In\nthe first place Egypt had settled down to her sluggish Nile like calm\nand cholera had quarantined the ship I wanted to take to Algiers,\nshutting off Algiers and what was more important Tunis.  The Governor\nwas ill shutting off things I wanted and his adjutant was boorish and\nproud and haughty.  Then I determined to go to Spain but found I had\narrived just one day too late for the last of the three days of the\nMardi Gras and too early for bull fights.  Had I taken Saavedra's\nletters I should have gone to Madrid and met the Queen and other proud\nfolks.  So on the whole I was blue.  But I have now determined to take\na boat for Tangier at once where I have letters to the Duke de Tnas who\nis the Master of the Hounds there and a great sport and they say it is\nvery amusing and exciting.  In a fortnight I shall go to Malta.  I\ncalled on Harry Cust's brother and told him who I was and he took me in\nand put me at the head of the table of young subalterns in grand\nuniforms and we had marmalade and cold beef and beer and I was happy to\nthe verge of tears to hear English as she is spoke.  Then we went to a\npicnic and took tea in a smuggler's cave and all the foxterriers ran\nover the table cloth and the Captain spilt hot water over his white\nflannels and jumped around on one leg.  After which we played a\nhandkerchief game sitting in a row and pelting the girls with a knotted\nhandkerchief and then fighting for it-- During one of these scrimmages\nMulvaney, two others and Learoyd came by and with eyes front and hands\nat their caps marched on with stolid countenances, but their officers\nwere embarrassed.  It is hard to return a salute with your face in the\nsand and a stout American sitting on your neck and pulling your first\nlieutenant's leg.  I am now deeply engaged for dinners and dances and\nteas and rides and am feeling very cheerful again.  I am also very well\nthank you and have no illnesses of any sort.  You told me to be sure\nand put that in-- As you see, I have cut out half of my trip to avoid\nthe cholera, so you need not worry about THAT.  To-day I am going over\nthe ramparts as much as they will allow and to-morrow I go to Tangier\nwhere I expect to have some boar hunting.  I would suggest your getting\nThe Evangelist in a week or two as Dr. Field's letters cover all I have\nseen.  I do not tell you anything about the place because you will read\nthat in the paper to the H. W. but I can assure you the girls are very\npretty and being garrison girls are not as shy as those at home in\nEngland.  I am the first American they ever met they assure me every\nhour and we get on very well notwithstanding.\n\nYou can imagine what it is like when Spaniards, Moors and English\nSoldiers are all crowded into one long street with donkeys and geese\nand priests and smugglers and men in polo clothes and soldiers in\nfootball suits and sailors from the man-of-war.  Of course, the Rock is\nthe best story of it all.  It is a fair green smiling hill not a\nfortress at all.  No more a fortress to look at than Fairmont Park\nwater works, but the joke of it is that under every bush there is a gun\nand every gun is painted green and covered with hanging curtains of\nmoss and every promenade is undermined and the bleakest face of the\nrock is tunnelled with rooms and halls.  Every night we are locked in\nand the soldiers carry the big iron keys clanking through the streets.\nIt is going to make interesting reading.\n\nDICK.\n\n\nGIBRALTAR.\n\nFebruary 23rd, 1893.\n\nDEAR MOTHER:\n\nAeneas who \"ran the round of so many chances\" in this neighborhood was\na stationary stay at home to what I have to do.  If I ever get away\nfrom the Rock I shall be a traveller of the greatest possible\nexperience.\n\nI came here intending to stay a week and to write my letter on Gib. and\non Tangier quietly and peacefully like a gentleman and then to go on to\nMalta.  I love this place and there is something to do and see every\nminute of the time but what happened was this:  All the boats that ever\nleft here stopped running, broke shafts, or went into quarantine or\njust sailed by, and unless I want to spend two weeks on the sea in\norder to have one at Malta, which is only a military station like this,\nI must go off to-morrow with my articles unwritten, my photos\nundeveloped and my dinner calls unpaid.  I am now waiting to hear if I\ncan get to Algiers by changing twice from one steamer to another along\nthe coast of Spain.  It will be a great nuisance but I shall be able to\nsee Algiers and Tunis and Malta in the three weeks which would have\notherwise been given to Malta alone.  And Tunis I am particularly keen\nto see.  While waiting for a telegram from Spain about the boats, I\nshall tell you what I have been doing.  Everybody was glad to see me\nafter my return from Tangier.  I dined with the Governor on Monday, in\na fine large room lined with portraits of all the old commanders and\ntheir coats-of-arms like a little forest of flags and the Governor's\ndaughter danced a Spanish dance for us after it was over.  Miss Buckle,\nCust's fiancee, dances almost as well as Carmencita, all the girls here\nlearn it as other girls do the piano.  On Tuesday Cust and Miss B. and\nanother girl and I went over into Spain to see the meet and we had a\nshort run after a fox who went to earth, much to my relief, in about\nthree minutes and before I had been thrown off.  There are no fences\nbut the ground is one mass of rocks and cactus and ravines down which\nthese English go with an ease that makes me tremble  with admiration.\nWe had not come out to follow, so we, being quite soaked through and\nvery hungry, went to an inn and it was such an inn as Don Quixote used\nto stop at, with the dining-room over the stable and a lot of drunken\nmuleteers in the court and beautiful young women to wait on us.  It is\na beautiful country Spain, with every sort of green you ever dreamed\nof.  We had omelettes and native wine and black bread and got warm\nagain and then trotted home in the rain and got wet again, so we\nstopped at the guard house on the outside of the rock and took tea with\nthe officer in charge and we all got down on our knees around his fire\nand he hobbled around dropping his eyeglasses in his hot water and very\nmuch honored and exceedingly embarrassed.  I amused myself by putting\non all the uniforms he did not happen to have on and the young ladies\ndrank tea and thawed.  This is the most various place I ever came\nacross.  You have mountains and seashore and allamandas like Monte\nCarlo in their tropical beauty and soldiers day and night marching and\ndrilling and banging brass bands and tennis and guns firing so as to\nrattle all the windows, and picnics and teas.  I am engaged way ahead\nnow but I must get off tomorrow.  On Washington's birthday I gave a\nluncheon because it struck me as the most inappropriate place in which\none could celebrate the good man's memory and the Governor would not\nthink of coming at first, but I told him I was not a British subject\nand that if I could go to his dinner he could come to my lunch, so\nthat, or the fact that the beautiful Miss Buckle was coming decided him\nto waive etiquette and he came with his A. D. C. and his daughter and\nofficers and girls came and I had American flags and English flags and\na portrait of Washington and of the Queen and I ransacked the markets\nfor violets and banked them all up in the middle.  It was fine.  I\nturned the hotel upside down and all the servants wore their best\nlivery and everybody stood up in a row and saluted His Excellency and I\nmade a speech and so did his Excellency and the chef did himself proud.\nI got it up in one morning.  Helen Benedict could not have done it\nbetter.\n\nI had a funny adventure the morning I left Tangier-- There was a good\ndeal of talk about Field (confound him) and my getting into the prison\nand The Herald and Times correspondents were rather blue about it and\nsome of the English residents said that I had not been shown the whole\nof the prison, that the worst had been kept from us.  Field who only\ngot into the prison because I had worked at it two days, said there was\nan additional ward I had not seen.  I went back into this while he and\nthe guard were getting the door open to go out and saw nothing, but to\nmake sure that the prison was as I believed an absolute square, I went\nback on the morning of my departure and climbed a wall and crawled over\na house top and photographed the top of the prison.  Then a horrible\ndoubt came to me that this house upon which I was standing and which\nadjoined the prison might be the addition of which the English\nresidents hinted.  There was an old woman in the garden below jumping\nup and down and to whom I had been shying money to keep her quiet.  I\nsent the guide around to ask her what was the nature of the building\nupon which I had trespassed and which seemed to worry her so much-- He\ncame back to tell me that I was on the top of a harem and the old woman\nthought I was getting up a flirtation with the gentleman's wives.  So I\ndropped back again.\n\nIt will be a couple of months at least before my first story comes out\nin The Weekly.  I cannot judge of them but I think they are up to the\naverage of the Western stories, the material is much richer I know, but\nI am so much beset by the new sights that I have not the patience or\nthe leisure I had in the West-- Then there were days in which writing\nwas a relief, now there is so much to see that it seems almost a shame\nto waste it.\n\nBy the grace of Providence I cannot leave here until the 28th, much to\nmy joy and I have found out that I can do better by going direct to\nMalta and then to Tunis, leaving Algiers which I did not want to see\nout of it-Hurrah.  I shall now return to the calm continuation of my\nstory and to writing notes which Chas will enjoy.\n\nDICK.\n\n\nGIBRALTAR--February 1893.\n\nDEAR MOTHER:\n\nMorocco as it is is a very fine place spoiled by civilization.  Not\nnice civilization but the dregs of it, the broken down noblemen of\nSpain and cashiered captains of England and the R---- L----'s of\nAmerica.  They hunt and play cricket and gamble and do nothing to\nmaintain what is best in the place or to help what is worst.  I love\nthe Moors and the way they hate the Christian and the scorn and pride\nthey show.  They seem to carry all the mystery and dignity of Africa\nand of foreign conquests about them, and they are wonderfully well made\nand fine looking and self-respecting.  The color is very beautiful, but\nthe foreign element spoils it at every turn.  One should really go\ninland but I shall not because I mean to do that when I reach Cairo.\nEverybody goes inland from here and Bonsal has covered it already.  He\nis a great man here among all classes.\n\nI have bought two long guns and three pistols three feet long and a\nMoorish costume for afternoon teas.  I shall look fine.  My guide's\nidea of pleasing me is to kick everybody out of the way which always\nbrings down curses on me so I have to go back and give them money and\nam so gradually becoming popular and much sought after by blind\nbeggars.  You can get three pounds of copper for a franc and it lasts\nall day throwing it right and left all the time.  I made a great tear\nin Bonsal's record today by refusing to pay a snake charmer all he\nwanted and then when he protested I took one of the snakes out of his\nhands and swung it around my head to the delight of the people.  I\nwanted to show him he was a fakir to want me to pay for what I would do\nmyself.  It was a large snake about four feet long.  Then my horse and\nanother horse got fighting in the principal street in the city standing\nup on their hind legs and boxing like men and biting and squealing.  It\nwas awful and I got mine out of the way and was trod on and had my arm\nnearly pulled off and the crowd applauded and asked my guide whether I\nwas American or English.  They do not like the English.  So with the\nlower classes I may say that I am having a social success.\n\nDICK.\n\n\nOff Malta--March 1, 1893.\n\nDEAR MOTHER:\n\nI have been having a delightful voyage with moonlight all night and\nsunlight all day.  Africa kept in sight most of the time and before\nthat we saw beautiful mountains in Spain covered with snow and red in\nthe sunset.  There were a lot of nice English people going out to India\nto meet their husbands and we have \"tiffin\" and \"choota\" and \"curry,\"\nso it really seemed oriental.  The third night out we saw Algiers\nsparkling like Coney Island.  I play games with myself and pretend I am\nat my rooms reading a story which is very hard to pretend as I never\nread in my rooms and then I look up and exclaim \"Hello, I'm not in New\nYork, that's Algiers.\"  The thing that has impressed me most is how\nabsolutely small the world is and how childishly easy it is to go\naround it.  You and Nora MUST take this trip; as for me I think Willie\nChanler is the most sensible individual I have yet met.\n\nAll the fascination of King Solomon's Mines seems to be behind those\ngreat mountains and this I may add is a bit of advance work for mother,\nan entering wedge to my disappearing from sight for years and years in\nthe Congo.  Which, seriously, I will not do; only it is disappointing\nto find the earth so small and so easily encompassed that you want to\ngo on where it is older, and new.  The worst of it is that it is hard\nleaving all the nice people you meet and then must say good-bye to.\nThe young ladies and Capt. Buckle and Cust came down to see me off and\nBuckle brought me a photo four feet long of Gib, an official one which\nI had to smuggle out with a great show of secrecy and now I shall be\nsorry to leave these people.  Just as I wrote that one of the officers\ngoing out to join his regiment came to the door and blushing said the\npassengers were getting up a round robin asking me to stop on and go to\nCairo.\n\nSince writing the above lots of things have happened.  I bid farewell\nto everyone at Malta and yet in four hours I was back again bag and\nbaggage and am now on my way to Cairo.  Tunis and the Bey are\nimpossible.  As soon as I landed at Malta I found that though I could\ngo to Tunis I could not go away without being quarantined for ten days\nand if I remained in Malta I must stay a week.  On balancing a week of\nEgypt against a week of Malta I could not do it so I put back to this\nsteamer again and here I am. Tomorrow we reach Brindisi and we have\nalready passed Sicily and had a glimpse of the toe of Italy and it is\nthe coldest sunny Italy that I ever imagined.  I am bitterly\ndisappointed about Tunis.  I have no letters to big people in Cairo\nonly subalterns but I shall probably get along.  I always manage\nsomehow with my \"artful little Ikey ways.\"  It was most gratifying to\nmark my return to this boat.  One young woman danced a Kangaroo dance\nand the Captain wept and all the stewards stood in a line and grinned.\nI sing Chevalier's songs and they all sit in the dining room below and\nforget to lay out the plates and last night some of the Royal Berkshire\nwith whom I dined at Malta came on board and after hearing the Old Kent\nRoad were on the point of Mutiny and refused to return to barracks.\nGreat is the Power of Chevalier and great is his power for taking you\nback to London with three opening bars.  Malta was the queerest place I\never got into.  It was like a city, country and island made of cheese,\nmouldy cheese, and fresh limburger cheese with holes in it.  You sailed\nright up to the front door as it were and people were hanging out of\nthe windows smoking pipes and looking down on the deck as complacently\nas though having an ocean steamer in the yard was as much a matter of\ncourse as a perambulator.  There were also women with black hoods which\nthey wear as a penance because long ago the ladies of Malta got\nthemselves talked about.  I was on shore about five hours and saw some\ninteresting things and with that and Brindisi and the voyage I can make\na third letter but Tunis is writ on my heart like Calais.\n\nToday Cleveland is inaugurated and I took all the passengers down at\nthe proper time and explained to them that at that moment a great man\nwas being made president and gave them each an American cocktail to\nremember it by and in which to toast him I am getting to be a great\nspeech maker and if there are any more anniversaries in America I shall\nbe a second Depew.\n\nIt is late but it is still the season here and it will be gay, but what\nI want to do now is to go off on a little trip inland although Cairo is\nthe worst of all for it is surrounded by deserts and nothing to shoot\nbut antelope and foxes and those I SCORN.  I want Zulus and lions.  I\nshall be greatly disappointed if I do not have something to do outside\nof Cairo for I have had no adventures at all.  It is just as civilized\nas Camden only more exciting and beautiful although Camden is exciting\nwhen you have to get there and back in time for the last edition.  From\nwhat I have already seen I am ready to spend a month in Cairo and then\nconfess to knowing nothing of it.  But we shall see.  There may be a W\nA R or a lion hunt or something yet if there is not I shall come back\nhere again.  I must fire that Winchester off at least once just for all\nthe trouble it has given me at custom houses.  Something exciting must\nhappen or I shall lose faith in the luck of the British army which\nmarches shoulder to shoulder with mine.  If I don't have any adventures\nI shall write essays on art after this like Mrs. Van.  Love and lots of\nit.\n\nDICK.\n\n\nCAIRO, March 11, 1893.\n\nDEAR MOTHER:\n\nIn a famous book this line occurs, \"He determined to go to that hotel\nin Cairo where they were to have spent their honeymoon,\" or words like\nthat.  He is now at that hotel and you can buy the famous book across\nthe street.  It is called \"Gallegher.\"  So--in this way everything\ncomes to him who waits and he comes to it.  \"Gallegher\" is not the only\nthing you buy in Egypt.  You ride to the Pyramids on a brake with a man\nin a white felt hat blowing a horn, and the bugler of the Army of\nOccupation is as much in evidence as the priest who calls them to\nprayer from the minaret.  I left the people I liked on the Sultey last\nThursday in the Suez Canal and came on here in a special train.  It is\nvery cold here, and it is not a place where the cold is in keeping with\nthe surroundings.  You see people in white helmets and astrakan\novercoats.  It is an immense city and intensely interesting, especially\nthe bazaars, but you feel so ignorant about it all that it rather\nangers you.  I wish I was not such a very bad hand at languages.  That\nis ONE THING I cannot do, that and ride.  I need it very much,\ntraveling so much, and I shall study very hard while I am in Paris.\nOur consul-general here is a very young man, and he showed me a Kansas\npaper when I called on him, which said that I was in the East and would\nprobably call on \"Ed\" L.  He is very civil to me and gives me his\ncarriages and outriders with gold clothes and swords whenever I will\ntake them.\n\nIt is so beastly cold here that it spoils a lot of things, and there\nare a lot of Americans who say, \"I had no idea you were so young a\nman,\" and that, after being five years old for a month and playing\nchildren's games with English people who didn't know or care anything\nabout you except that you made them laugh, is rather trying.  I am\ndisappointed so far in the trip because it has developed nothing new\nbeyond the fact that going around the world is of no more importance\nthan going to breakfast, and I am selfish in my sightseeing and want to\nsee things others do not.  And if you even do see more than those who\nare not so fortunate and who have to remain at home, still you are so\nignorant in comparison with those who have lived here for years and to\nwhom the whole of Africa is a speculation in land or railroads, it\nmakes you feel like such a faker and as if it were better to turn\ncorrespondent for the N. Y. Herald, Paris edition, and send back the\nnames of those who are staying at the hotels.  That is really all you\ncan speak with authority about.  When you have Gordon and Stanley\ndishes on the bill-of-fare, you feel ashamed to say you've been in\nEgypt.  Anyway, I am a faker and I don't care, and I proved it today by\nbeing photographed on a camel in front of the Pyramids, and if that\nwasn't impertinence I do not know its name.  I accordingly went and\nbought a lot of gold dresses for Nora as a penance.\n\nAs a matter of fact, unless I get into the interior for a month and see\nsomething new, I shall consider the trip a failure, except as a most\namusing holiday for one, and that was not exactly what I wanted or all\nI wanted.  After this I shall go to big cities only and stay there.\nEverybody travels and everybody sees as much as you do and says nothing\nof it, certainly does not presume to write a book about it.  Anyway, it\nhas been great fun, so I shall put it down to that and do some serious\nwork to make up for it.  I'd rather have written a good story about the\nInauguration than about Cairo.\n\nI am well, as usual, and having a fine loaf, only I don't think much of\nwhat I have written--that's all.\n\nDICK.\n\n\nCAIRO, March 19th, 1893.\n\nDEAR MOTHER:\n\nI went up the Pyramids yesterday and I am very sore today.  It sounds\neasy because so many people do it, but they do it because they don't\nknow.  I have been putting it off, and putting it off, until I felt\nashamed to such a degree that I had to go.  Little had never been\neither, so we went out together and met Stanford White and the Emmetts\nthere, and we all went up.  I would rather go into Central Africa than\ndo it again.  I am getting fat and that's about it--and I had to half\npull a much fatter man than myself who pretended to help me.  I finally\ntold them I'd go alone unless the fat man went away, so the other two\ndrove him off.  Going down is worse.  It's like looking over a\nprecipice all the time.  I was so glad when I got down that I sang with\nglee.  I hate work like that, and to make it worse I took everybody's\npicture on top of the Pyramid, and forgot to have one of them take me,\nso there is no way to prove I ever went up.  Little and I hired two\ndonkeys and called them \"Gallegher\" and \"Van Bibber\" and raced them.\nMy donkey was so little that they couldn't see him--only his ears.\nGallegher won.  The donkey-boys called it Von Bebey, so I don't think\nit will help the sale of the book.\n\nToday we went to call on the Khedive.  It was very informal and too\ndemocratic to suit my tastes.  We went through a line of his bodyguard\nin the hall, and the master of ceremonies took us up several low but\nwide stairways to a hall.  In the hall was a little fat young man in a\nfrock coat and a fez, and he shook hands with us, and walked into\nanother room and we all sat down on chairs covered with white muslin.\nI talked and Little talked about me and the Khedive pretended to be\nvery much honored, and said the American who had come over after our\nrebellion had done more for the officers in his army than had anyone\nelse, meaning the English.  He did not say that because we were\nAmericans, but because he hates the English.  He struck me as being\nstubborn, which is one side of stupidness and yet not stupid, and I\noccasionally woke him to bursts of enthusiasm over the Soudanese.  His\nbursts were chiefly \"Ali.\"  Little seemed to amuse him very much, and\nLittle treated him exactly like a little boy who needed to be cheered\nup.  I think in one way it was the most curious contrast I ever saw.\n\"Ed\" Little of Abilene, Kansas, telling the ruler of Egypt not to\nworry, that he had plenty of years in which to live and that he would\nget ahead of them all yet.  Those were not his words, but that was the\ntone, he was perfectly friendly and sincere about it.\n\nThis place appeals to me as about the best place with which to get\nmixed up with that I know, and I've gone over a great many maps since I\nleft home and know just how small the world is.  So, I sent the Khedive\nmy books after having asked his permission, and received the most\nabject thanks.  And as Cromer called on me, I am going to drop around\non him with a few of them.  Some day there will be fine things going on\nhere, and there is only one God, and Lord Cromer is his Prophet in this\ncountry.  They think that Mohammed is but they are wrong.  He is a very\nbig man.  The day he sent his ultimatum to the Khedive telling him to\ndismiss Facta Pasha and put back Riaz Pasha, he went out in full view\nof the Gezerik drive and played lawn tennis.  Any man who can cable for\nthree thousand more troops to Malta and stop a transport full of two\nthousand more at Aden with one hand, and bang tennis balls about with\nthe other, is going in the long run to get ahead of a stout little boy\nin a red fez.  It is getting awfully hot here, almost hot enough for\nme, and I can lay aside my overcoat by ten o'clock in the morning.\nEveryone else has been in flannels and pith helmets, but as they had to\nwear overcoats at night I could not see the advantage of the costume.\n\nDICK.\n\n\nI open this to say that ALL of your letters have just come, so I have\nintoxicated myself with them for the last hour and can go over them\nagain tomorrow.  I cannot tell you, dearest, what a delight your\nletters are and how I enjoy the clippings.  I think of you all the time\nand how you would love this Bible land and seeing the places where\nPharaoh's daughter found Moses, and hearing people talk of St. Paul and\nthe plagues of Egypt and Joseph and Mary just as though they had lived\nyesterday.  I have seen two St. Johns already, with long hair and\nmelancholy wild eyes and bare breasts and legs, with sheepskin\ncovering, eating figs and preaching their gospel.  Yesterday two men\ncame running into town and told one of the priests that they had seen\nthe new moon in a certain well, and the priest proclaimed a month of\nfasting, and the men who pulled us up the Pyramid had to rest because\nthey had not eaten or drunk all day.  At six a sheik called from the\nvillage and all the donkey--boys and guides around the Sphinx ran to\nget water and coffee and food.  Think of that--of two men running\nthrough the street to say that they had seen the new moon in a well,\nwhen every shop sells Waterbury watches and the people who passed them\nwere driving dogcarts with English coachmen in top-boots behind.  Is\nthere any other place as incongruous as this, as old and as new?\n\nDICK.\n\n\nATHENS, March 30, 1893.\n\nDEAR MOTHER:\n\nI am now in Athens, how I got here is immaterial.  Suffice it to say\nthat never in all my life was I so ill as I was in the two days\ncrossing from Alexandria to Piraeus, which I did with two other men in\nthe same cabin more ill than I and praying and swearing and groaning\nall the time.  \"It was awful.\"\n\n\n     \"I have crossed in many ships upon the seas\n          And some of them were good and some were not;\n          In German, P & O's and Genoese,\n          But the Khedive's was the worst one of the lot.\n          We never got a moment's peace in her\n          For everybody'd howl or pray or bellow;\n          She threw us on our heads or on our knees,\n          And turned us all an unbecoming yellow.\"\n\n\nAthens is a small town but fine.  It is chiefly yellow houses with red\nroofs, and mountains around it, which remind you of pictures you have\nseen when a youth.  Also olive trees and straight black pines and the\nAcropolis.  There is not much of it left as far as I can see from the\ncity, but what there is is enough to make you wish you had brushed up\nyour Greek history.  I have now reached the place where Pan has a cave,\nwhere the man voted against Aristides because he was humanly tired of\nhearing him called the Just and where the Minotaur ate young women.\n\nWhat was in the Isle of Crete but the rock from which the father of\nTheseus threw himself--is still here!  Also the hill upon which Paul\nstood and told the Athenians they were too superstitious.  You can\nimagine my feelings at finding all of these things are true.  After\nthis I am going to the North Pole to find Santa Claus and so renew my\nyouth.\n\nI regret to say that it is raining very hard and Athens is not set for\na rainstorm.  It is also cold but as I have not been warm since I\ncrossed the North River with Chas. amid cakes of ice that is of no\nconsequence.  When I come here again I come in the summer.  The good\nold rule that it is cold in winter and warm in summer is a good enough\nrule to follow.  You have only to travel to find out how universally\ncold winter is.  last night I was in Cairo, I got in a carriage and\ndrove out alone to the Pyramids.  It was beautiful moonlight.  I got a\ndonkey and rode up around them and then walked over to the Sphinx.  I\nhad never understood or seen it before.  It was the creepiest and most\nimpressive thing I ever had happen to me, I do believe.  There was no\none except the two donkey-boys and myself and the Sphinx.  All about\nwas the desert and above it the purple sky and the white stars and the\ngreat negro's head in front of you with its paws stretched out, and the\nmoonlight turning it into shadows and white lines.  I think I stood\nthere so long that I got sort of dizzy.  It was just as if I had been\nthe first man to stumble across it, and I felt that I was way back\nthousands of years and that the ghosts of Caesar and Napoleon and\nCleopatra and the rest were in the air.  That was worth the entire trip\nto me.  This place promises to be most exciting, the New York artists\nare all here, they are the most jauntily dull people I ever met.  Do\nyou know what I mean?  They are very nice but so stupid.  I don't let\nthem bother me.  Who was the chap who wrote about the bottle of\nMalvoisie? because I got a bottle of it for BREAKFAST and it is NO\nGOOD.  It is like sweet port.  But on account of the poem and its being\nvin du pays I got it.\n\nDear Mother, I wish you were here now and enjoying all these beautiful\nthings.  I got you a present in Cairo that will amuse you.  Had I\nstayed on in Cairo I should have had much and many marks of distinction\nfrom the English.  Lady Gower-Browne, who found out from them that I\nhad called and that they had done nothing except to be rude, raised a\ngreat hue and cry and everything changed.  What she said of me I don't\nknow but it made a most amusing difference.  General Walker galloped a\nhalf mile across the desert to give me his own copy of the directions\nfor the sham battle, and I was to have met Cromer at dinner\ntete-a-tete, and General Kitchener sent apologies by two other generals\nand all the subalterns called on me in a body.  That was the day before\nI left.  I don't know what Lady Gower-Browne said, but it made a change\nwhich I am sorry I could not avail myself of as I want politics as well\nas memories.\n\nThe next time I come I shall go to even fewer places and see more\npeople.\n\nIf the Harpers don't look out our interests will clash.  I look at it\nlike this.  I can always see the old historical things and take my\nchildren up the Nile, but I want now to make friends with the Mammon of\nunrighteousness and the men of the hour.  I may want to occupy an hour\nor two myself some day and they can help me.  If America starts in\nannexing islands she will need people to tell her how it is generally\ndone and it is generally done, I find, by the English.  I may give up\nliterature and start annexing things like Alexander and Caesar and\nNapoleon.  They say there will be another crisis in Cairo in a month or\nso.  If that be true I am all right and solid with both parties.  But\nit has got to be worth while of course or I won't go back.  There is a\nking living in a fine palace across the square from my window, one of\nhis officers is now changing the guard in the rain.  I hope to call on\nthe king because I like his guard.  They wear petticoats and toes\nturned up in front.  Don't you mind what I say about liking politics\nand don't think I am not enjoying the show things.  I have a capacity\nfor both that is so far unsatisfied, and I am now going out in the rain\nto try and find the post-office.  Lots of love.\n\n                                             DICK.\n\nI am well and have been well (except sea sick) since February\n\nP. S.--A funeral is just passing the window with the corpse exposed to\nview as is the quaint custom here, to add to its horror they rouge the\nface of the corpse and everybody kisses it.  In the Greek church they\nburn candles for people and the number of candles I have burnt for you\nwould light St. Paul's, and you ought to be good with so much war being\nexpended all over Athens for you.  You buy candles instead of tipping\nthe verger or putting it in the poor box, or because you are\nsuperstitious and think it will do some good, as I do.\n\n\nOrient Express.  Somewhere in Bulgaria on the way to London.\n\nApril 14th, 1893.\n\nDEAR MOTHER:\n\nTuesday I wrote you a letter in the club at Constantinople telling you\nhow glad I would be to get out of that City on April 17th on the Orient\nExpress which only leaves twice a week on Thursdays and Mondays.  So\nany one who travels by the Orient is looked upon first as a millionaire\nand second, if he does not break the journey at Vienna, as a greater\ntraveller than Col. Burnaby on his way to Khiva.  Imagine a Kansas City\nman breaking the journey to New York.  After I wrote you that letter I\nwent in the next room and read of the Nile Expedition in search of\nGordon--this went through three volumes of The Graphic and took some\ntime, so that when I had reached the picture which announced the death\nof Gordon it was half past five and I had nothing more to do for four\ndays-- It was raining and cold and muddy and so I just made up my mind\nI would get up and get out and I jumped about for one hour like a\nkangaroo and by seven I was on the Orient with two Cook men to help me\nand had shaken my fist at the last minaret light of that awful city.\nSo, now it is all over and it is done-- I have learned a great deal in\nan imperfect way of the juxtaposition of certain countries and of the\nease with which one can travel without speaking any known languages and\nof the absolute necessity for speaking one, French.  I am still\ndisappointed about the articles but selfishly I have made a lot out of\nthe trip.  You have no idea how hard it is not to tell about strange\nthings and yet you know people do not care half as much for them as\nthings they know all about-- No matter, it is done and with the\nexception of the last week it was F I N E.\n\n\n\"I'm going back to London, to 'tea' and long frock coats\n     I'm done with Cook and seeing sights\n     I'm done with table d'hotes\n     So clear the track you signal man\n     From Sofia to Pless, I'm going straight for London\n     On the Orient Express.\n\nI'm going straight for London O'er Bulgaria's heavy sands To Rotten Row\nand muffins, soles, Chevalier and Brass Bands Ho' get away you bullock\nman You've heard the whistle blowed a locomotive coming down the Grand\nTrunk Road.\"\n\n\nThis is a great country and I want to ask all the natives if they know\n\"Stenie\" Bonsal.  They are all his friends and so are the \"Balkans,\"\nand all the little Balkans.  Nobody wears European clothes here.  They\nare all as foreign and native and picturesque as they can be, the women\nwith big silver plates over their stomachs and the men in sheepskin and\ntights and the soldiers are grand.  We have been passing all day\nbetween snow covered mountains and between herds of cattle and red\nroofed, mud villages and long lakes of ice and snow-- It is a beautiful\nday and I am very happy. (Second day out) 15th---We are now in Hungary\nand just outside of Buda Pesth \"the wickedest city in the world,\" still\nin spite of that fact I am going on.  I am very glad I came this way--\nThe peasants and soldiers are most amusing and like German\npicture-papers with black letter type-- I shall stop a day in Paris now\nthat I have four extra days.\n\nDICK.\n\n\nIn sight of Paris--April 16, 1893.\n\nDEAREST MOTHER:\n\nhas been the most beautiful day since February 4th.  It is the first\nday in which I have been warm.  All through I have had a varnish of\nwarmth every now and again but no real actual internal warmth--I am now\nin sight of Paris and it is the 16th of April, in the eleven weeks\nwhich have elapsed since the 4th of February I have been in Spain,\nFrance, Italy, Germany, Austria, Hungary, Serbia, Bulgaria, Turkey,\nGreece, Egypt and Morocco.  I have sat on the Rock of Gibraltar, sailed\non the Nile and the Suez Canal and crossed through the Dardanelles,\nover the Balkans, the steppes of Hungary and the Danube and Rhine.  I\nhave seen the sphinx by moonlight, the Parthenon and the Eiffel Tower\nand in two days more I shall have seen St. Paul's.  What do you think I\nshould like to see best now?  YOU.  I have been worrying of late as to\nwhether or not I should not come home now and leave Paris for another\ntime because it seems so rough on you to leave you without either of\nyour younger sons for so long.  But I have thought it over a great deal\nand I think it better that I should do Paris now and leave myself clear\nfor the rest of the year.  I promise you one thing however that I shall\nnot undertake to stay away so long again; it is too long and one grows\nout of things.  But nothing I feel, will be so easy or so amusing as\nParis and I intend to get through with it soon and trot home to you by\nthe middle of August AT THE VERY LATEST.  So, please write me a\ndeceitful letter and say you do not miss me at all and that my being so\nnear as Paris makes a great difference and that I am better out of the\nway and if Chas goes to London I shall be near him in case he forgets\nto put on his overshoes or involves us in a war with G. B.  Now, mother\ndear, do write me a cheerful letter and say that you do not mind\nwaiting until the middle of August for me and when I come back this\ntime I shall make a long stay with you at Marion and tell you lots of\nthings I have not written you and I shall not go away again for ever so\nlong and if I do go I shall only stay a little while.  You have no idea\nhow interesting this rush across the continent has been.  I started in\nsnow and through marshes covered with ice and long horned cattle and\nnow we are in such a beautiful clean green land with green fields and\ngreen trees and flowering bushes which you can smell as the train goes\nby.  I now think that instead of being a cafe-chantant singer I should\nrather be an Austrian baron and own a castle on a hill with a red\nroofed village around it.  I have spent almost all of the trip sitting\non the platform and enjoying the sight of the queer peasants and the\nsoldiers and old villages.  Tonight I shall be in \"Paris, France\" as\nMorton used to say and I shall get clean and put on my dress clothes\nbut whether I shall go see Yvette Guilbert or Rusticana again I do not\nknow.  Perhaps I shall just paddle around the fountain in the Place de\nla Concorde and make myself thoroughly at home.  With a great deal of\nlove to Dad and Nora and Chas and all.\n\nDICK.\n\n\nAt the time that Richard's first travel articles appeared some of his\ncritics took umbrage at the fact that he was evidently under the\ndelusion that he had discovered London, Gibraltar, Athens, Paris, and\nthe other cities he had visited, and that no one else had ever written\nabout them.  As a matter of fact no one could have been more keenly\nconscious of what an oft-told tale were the places that he had chosen\nto describe.  If Richard took it for granted that the reader was\ntotally unacquainted with the peoples of these cities and their ways,\nit was because he believed that that was the best way to write a\ndescriptive article, always had believed it, and believed it so long as\nhe wrote.  And whatever difference of opinion may have existed among\nthe critics and the public as to Richard's fiction, I think it is safe\nto say that as a reporter his work of nearly thirty years stood at\nleast as high as that of any of his contemporaries or perhaps as that\nof the reporters of all time.  As an editor, when he gave out an\nassignment to a reporter to write an article on some well-worn subject\nand the reporter protested, Richard's answer was the same:  \"You must\nalways remember that that story hasn't been written until YOU write\nit.\"  And when he suggested to an editor that he would like to write an\narticle on Broadway, or the Panama Canal, or the ruins of Rome and the\neditor disapproved, Richard's argument was:  \"It hasn't been done until\n_I_ do it.\"  And it was not because he believed for a moment that he\ncould do it better or as well as it had been done.  It was simply\nbecause he knew the old story was always a good story, that is, if it\nwas seen with new eyes and from a new standpoint.  At twenty-eight he\nhad written a book about England and her people, and the book had met\nwith much success both in America and England.  At twenty-nine, equally\nunafraid, he had \"covered\" the ancient cities that border the\nMediterranean, and now Paris lay before him!  This thought--indeed few\nthoughts--troubled Richard very much in those days of his early\nsuccesses.  He had youth, friends, a marvellous spirit of adventure,\nand besides there are many worse fates than being consigned to spending\na few months in Paris, having a thoroughly joyous time, taking a few\nmental notes, and a little later on transferring them to paper in the\nquiet of a peaceful summer home at Marion.\n\nChief among his friends in Paris at this time was Charles Dana Gibson,\nwho was living in a charming old house in the Latin Quarter, and where\nthe artist did some of his best work and made himself extremely popular\nwith both the Parisians and the American colony.  In addition to Gibson\nthere were Kenneth Frazier, the portrait-painter, and Tina, Newton, and\nJames Eustis, the daughter and sons of James B. Eustis, who at that\ntime was our ambassador to France, a most genial and kindly host, who\nmade much of Richard and his young friends.\n\n\nPARIS, May 5, 1893.\n\nDEAR MOTHER:\n\nIt is a narrow street with apartment houses of gray stone and iron\nbalconies along either side of it.  The sun sets at one end of the\nstreet at different times during the day and we all lean out on the\nbalconies to look.  On the house, one below mine, on the other side of\nour street, is a square sign that says:\n\nALFRED DE MUSSET\n\nEST MORT DANS CETTE MAISON\n\n\nA great many beautiful ladies with the fashionable red shade of hair\nstill call there, as they used to do when the proper color was black\nand it was worn in a chignon and the Second Empire had but just begun.\nWhile they wait they stretch out in their carriages and gaze up at the\nbalconies until they see me, and as I wear a gold and pink silk wrapper\nand not much else, they concentrate all their attention on the wrapper\nand forget to drop a sigh for the poet.  There are two young people on\nthe sixth floor opposite, who come out on the balcony after dinner and\nhold on to each other and he tells her all about the work of the day.\nBelow there is a woman who sews nothing but black dresses, and who does\nthat all day and all night by the light of a lamp.  And below the\nconcierge stands all day in a lace cap and black gown and blue, and\nlooks up the street and down the street like the woman in front of\nHockley's.  BUT on the floor opposite mine there is a beautiful lady in\na pink and white wrapper with long black hair and sleepy black eyes.\nShe does not take any interest in my pink wrapper, but contents herself\nwith passing cabs and stray dogs and women with loaves of bread and\nbottles in their hands who occasionally stray into our street.  At six\nshe appears in another gown and little slippers and a butterfly for a\nhat and says \"Good-by\" to the old concierge and trips off to dinner.\nLots of love to all.\n\nDICK.\n\n\nPARIS, May 11th, 1893.\n\nDEAR MOTHER:\n\nI am still somewhat tentative as regards my opinion of the place, what\nit will bring me in the way of material I cannot tell.  So far, \"Paris\nDecadent\" would be a good title for anything I should write of it.  It\nis not that I have seen only the worst side of it but that that seems\nto be so much the most prominent.  They worship the hideous Eiffel\nTower and they are a useless, flippant people who never sleep and yet\ndo nothing while awake.  To-morrow I am going to a pretty inn\nsurrounded by vines and trees to see a prize fight with all the silly\nyoung French men and their young friends in black and white who ape the\nEnglish manners and customs even to \"la box.\"  To night at the\nAmbassadeurs the rejected lover of some actress took a gang of bullies\nfrom Montmartre there and hissed and stoned her.  I turned up most\ninnocently and greatly bored in the midst of it but I was too far away\nto pound anybody-- I collected two Englishmen and we went in front to\nawait her re-appearance but she had hysterics and went off in a cab and\nso we were not given a second opportunity of showing them they should\nplay fair.  It is a typical incident of the Frenchman and has made me\nwrathy.  The women watching the prize fight will make a good story and\nso will the arms of the red mill, \"The Moulin Rouge\" they keep turning\nand turning and grinding out health and virtue and souls.\n\nI dined to night with the C-----s and P----s, the Ex-Minister and\ndisagreed with everybody and found them all very middle class as to\nintellect.  An old English lady next to me said apropos of something\n\"that is because you are not clever like Mr. ---- and do not have to\nwork with your brains.\"  To which I said, I did not mind not being\nclever as my father was a many times millionaire,\" at which she became\nabjectly polite.  Young Rothenstein is going to do a picture of me\nto-morrow morning.  There is nothing much more to tell except that a\nhorse stood on his fore legs in the Bois the other day and chucked me\ninto space.  I was very sore but I went on going about as it was the\nVarnishing day at the new salon and I wished to see it.  I am over my\nstiffness now and if \"anybody wants to buy a blooming bus\" I have one\nfor sale and five pairs of riding breeches and two of ditto boots.  No\nmore riding for me--- The boxing bag is in good order now and I do not\nneed for exercise.  The lady across the street has a new wrapper in\nwhich she is even more cold and haughty than before.  \"I sing Tarrara\nboom deay and she keeps from liking me.\"\n\nDICK.\n\n\nPARIS, May 14th, 1893.\n\nDEAR NORA:\n\nThings are getting more interesting here and I shall probably have\nsomething to write about after all, although I shall not know the place\nas I did London.  Will Rothenstein has drawn a picture of me that I\nlike very much and if mother likes it VERY, VERY much she may have it\nas a loan but she may not like it.  I did not like to take it so I\nbought another picture of him, one of Coquelin cadet and now I have\ntwo.  Coquelin gave him his first commission when he was nineteen, two\nyears ago, and then asked him to do two sketches.  After these were\ndone Coquelin told him by letter that he would give him half what they\nhad agreed upon for the big picture for the two sketches and begged the\nbig picture as a gift.  So Rothenstein cut the head and shoulders out\nof the big one and sent him the arms and legs.  It is the head he cut\nout that I have.  When Rothenstein and I and Coquelin become famous,\nthat will make a good story.  I have also indulged myself in the\npurchase of several of Cherets works of art.  They cost three francs\napiece.  We have had some delightful lunches at the Ambassadeurs with\nCushing and other artists and last night I went out into the Grande\nMonde to a bal masque for charity at the palace of the Comtesse de la\nFerrondeux.  It was very stupid and the men outnumbered the women 30 to\n1, which are interesting odds.  To-day we went to Whistler's and sat\nout in a garden with high walls about it and drank tea and laughed at\nRothenstein.  The last thing he said was at the Ambassadeurs when one\nof the students picking up a fork said, \"These are the same sort of\nforks I have.\"  Rothenstein said \"yes, I did not know you dined here\nthat often.\"  Some one asked him why he wore his hair long, \"To test\nyour manners\" he answered.  He is a disciple of Whistler's and Wilde's\nand said \"yes, I defend them at the risk of their lives.\"  Did I tell\nyou of his saying \"It is much easier to love one's family than to like\nthem.\"  And when some one said \"Did you hear how Mrs. B.  treated Mr.\nC., (a man he dislikes) he said, \"no, but I'm glad she did.\"  It was\nlovely at Whistler's and such a contrast to the other American salon I\nwent to last Sunday.  It was so quiet, and green and pretty and\neverybody was so unobtrusively polite.\n\nRothenstein wore my rosette and made a great sensation and I was\ncongratulated by Whistler and Abbey and Pennell.  Rothenstein said he\nwas going to have a doublebreasted waistcoat made with rosettes of\ndecorations for buttons.  Tomorrow Lord Dufferin has asked me to\nbreakfast at the Embassy.  He was at the masked ball last night and was\nvery nice.  He reminds me exactly of Disraeli in appearance.  It is\nawfully hot here and a Fair for charity has asked me to put my name in\n\"Gallegher\" to have it raffled for.  \"Dear\" Bonsal arrives here next\nSunday, so I am in great anticipation.  I am very well, tell mother,\nand amused.  Lots of love.\n\nDICK.\n\n\nPARIS, June 13, 1893.\n\nDEAR MOTHER:\n\nThere is nothing much to say except that things still go on.  I feel\nlike one of those little India rubber balls in the jet of a fountain\nbeing turned and twisted and not allowed to rest.  Today I have been to\nhear Yvette Guilbert rehearse and thought her all Chas thinks her only\nher songs this season are beneath the morals of a medical student.  It\nis very hot and it is getting hotter.  I had an amusing time at the\nGrand Prix where Tina won a lot of money on a tip I gave her which I\ndid not back myself.  In the evening Newton took me to dinner and to\nthe Jardin de Paris where they had 10 franc admittance and where every\nthing went that wasn't nailed.  The dudes put candles on their high\nhats and the girls snuffed them out with kicks and at one time the\ncrowd mobbed the band stand and then the stage and played on all the\ninstruments.  The men were all swells in evening dress and the women in\nbeautiful ball dresses and it was a wonderful sight.  It only happens\nonce a year like the Yale-Princeton night at Koster and Bials except\nthat the women are all very fine indeed.  They rode pig-a-back races\nand sang all the songs.  I had dinner with John Drew last night.  I\noccasionally sleep and if Nora doesn't come on time I shall be a\nskeleton and have no money left.  As a matter of fact I am fatter than\never and can eat all sorts of impossible things here that I could never\neat at home.  I lunch every day with the Eustises and we dine out\nalmost every night.  I consort entirely with the poorest of art\nstudents or the noblest of princesses and so far have kept out of\nmischief, but you can never tell for this is a wicked city they say, or\nit strikes me as most amusing at present only I cannot see what Harper\nand Bros. are going to get out of it.  I said that of London so I\nsuppose it will all straighten out by the time I get back.\n\nDICK.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VII\n\nFIRST PLAYS\n\nWhen the season in Paris had reached its end, Richard returned to\nLondon and later on to Marion, where he spent the late summer and early\nfall, working on his Mediterranean and Paris articles, and completing\nhis novel \"Soldiers of Fortune.\"  In October he returned to New York\nand once more assumed his editorial duties and took his usual active\ninterest in the winter's gayeties.\n\nThe first of these letters refers to a dinner of welcome given to Sir\nHenry Irving.  The last two to books by my mother and Richard, and\nwhich were published simultaneously.\n\n\nNEW YORK, November 27, 1893.\n\nDEAR MOTHER:\n\nThe dinner was very fine.  I was very glad I went.  Whitelaw Reid sat\non one side of Sir Henry Irving and Horace Porter on the other.\nHowells and Warner came next.  John Russell Young and Mark Twain,\nMillet, Palmer, Hutton, Gilder and a lot more were there.  There were\nno newspaper men, not even critics nor actors there, which struck me as\ninteresting.  The men were very nice to me.  Especially Young, Reid,\nIrving and Howells.  Everybody said when I came in, \"I used to know you\nwhen you were a little boy,\" so that some one said finally, \"What a\ndisagreeable little boy you MUST have been.\" I sat next a chap from\nBrazil who told me lots of amusing things.  One story if it is good\nsaves a whole day for me.  One he told was of a German explorer to whom\nDon Pedro gave an audience.  The Emperor asked him, with some touch of\npatronage, if he had ever met a king before.  \"Yes,\" the German said\nthoughtfully; \"five, three wild and two tame.\"\n\nMark Twain told some very funny stories, and captured me because I\nnever thought him funny before, and Irving told some about Stanley, and\neverybody talked interestingly.  Irving said he was looking forward to\nseeing Dad when he reached Philadelphia.  \"It is nice to have seen\nyou,\" he said, \"but I have still to see your father,\" as though I was\nnot enough.  DICK.\n\n\nNEW YORK, 1893.\n\nDEAREST MOTHER:\n\nI cannot tell you how touched and moved I was by the three initials in\nthe book.  It was a genuine and complete surprise and when I came\nacross it while I was examining the letterpress with critical\napprobation and with no idea of what was to come, it left me quite\nbreathless-- It was so sweet of you-- You understand me and I\nunderstand you and you know how much that counts to me-- I think the\nbook is awfully pretty and in such good taste-- It is quite a delight\nto the eye and I am much more keen about it than over any of my own-- I\nhave sent it to some of my friends but I have not read it yet myself,\nas I am waiting until I get on the boat where I shall not be\ndisturbed-- Then I shall write you again-- It was awfully good of you,\nand I am so pleased to have it to give away.  I never had anything to\nshow people when they asked for one of your other books and this comes\nin such an unquestionable form-- With lots of love.\n\nDICK.\n\n\nNEW YORK, 1893.\n\nDEAR MOTHER:\n\nI got your nice letter and one from Dad.  Both calling me many\nadjectives pleasing to hear although they do not happen to fit.  So you\nare in a third edition are you?  These YOUNG writers are crowding me to\nthe wall.  I feel thrills of pride when I see us sitting cheek by jowl\non the news-stands.  Lots of love.\n\n\n\n\nIn February, 1894, Richard was forced by a severe attack of sciatica to\ngive up temporarily the gayeties of New York and for a cure he\nnaturally chose our home in Philadelphia, where he remained for many\nweeks.  Although unable to leave his bed, he continued to do a\nconsiderable amount of work, including the novelette \"The Princess\nAline,\" in the writing of which I believe my brother took more pleasure\nthan in that of any story or novel he ever wrote.  The future Empress\nof Russia was the heroine of the tale, and that she eventually read the\nstory and was apparently delighted with it caused Richard much human\nhappiness.\n\n\nPHILADELPHIA.\n\nMarch 5th.\n\nDEAR CHAS:\n\nI am getting rapidly better owing to regular hours and light literature\nand home comforts.  I am not blue as I was and my morbidness has gone\nand I only get depressed at times.  I am still however feeling tired\nand I think I will take quite a rest before I venture across the seas.\nBut across them I will come no matter if all the nerves on earth jump\nand pull.  Still, I think it wiser for all concerned that I get\nthoroughly well so that when I do come I won't have to be cutting back\nhome again as I did last time.  We are young yet and the world's wide\nand there's a new farce comedy written every minute and I have a great\nmany things to do myself so I intend to get strong and then do them.  I\nenclose two poems.  I am going to have them printed for my particular\npals later.  I am writing one to all of you folks over there.\n\nDICK.\n\n\nTAKE ME BACK TO BROADWAY, WHERE THE ORCHIDS GROW\n\nWITH APOLOGIES TO THE WESTERN DIALECT POETS\n\n  \"I have wandered up and down somewhat in many different lands\n  I have been to Fort Worth, Texas, and I've tramped\n      through Jersey sands,\n  I have seen Pike's Peak by Moonlight, and I've visited the Fair\n  And to save enumeration I've been nearly everywhere.\n      But no matter where\n  I rested and no matter where I'd go, I have longed to be\n      on Broadway\n\n                    Where\n                         the\n                              Orchids\n                                   Grow.\n\n  Some people love the lilies fair that hide in mossy dells\n  Some folks are fond of new mown hay, before the rainy spells\n  But give to me the orchids rare that hang in Thorley's store,\n  And in Fleischman's at the Hoffman, and in half a dozen more\n  And when I see them far from home they make my heart's blood glow\n    For they take me back to Broadway\n\n                    Where\n                         the\n                              Orchids\n                                   Grow.\n\n  Let Paris boast of boulevards where one can sit and drink\n  There is no such chance on Broadway, at the Brower House,\n       'I don't think.'\n  And where else are there fair soubrettes in pipe clayed tennis shoes,\n  And boys in silken sashes promenading by in twos\n  Oh you can boast of any street of which you're proud to know\n  But give me sleepy Broadway\n\n                    Where\n                         the\n                              Orchids\n                                   Grow.\n\n  Let poets sing of chiming bells and gently lowing kine\n  I like the clanging cable cars like fire engines in line\n  And I never miss the sunset and for moonlight never sigh\n  When 'Swept by Ocean Breezes.' flashes out against the sky.\n  And when the Tenderloin awakes, and open theatres glow\n  I want to be on Broadway\n\n               Where\n                    the\n                         Orchids\n                              Grow.\"\n\n\nA VOUS, JOHN DREW\n\n  \"John Drew, I am your debtor\n  For a very pleasant letter\n  And a lot of cabinet photos\n  Of the 'Butterflies' and you\n  And I think it very kind\n  That you kept me so in mind\n  And pitied me in exile\n  So I do, John Drew.\n\n\n2\n\n\n  John Drew, 'twixt you and me\n  Precious little I can see\n  Of that good there is in Solitude\n  That poets say they view.\n  For _I_ hate to be in bed\n  With a candle at my head\n  Sitting vis a vis with Conscience.\n  So would you, John Drew.\n\n3\n\n\n  John Drew, then promise me\n  That as soon as I am free\n  I may sit in the first entrance\n  As Lamb always lets me do.\n  And watch you fume and fret\n  While the innocent soubrette\n  Takes the centre of the stage a--\n  Way from you, John Drew.\"\n\nR. H. D.\n\n\nIn the summer of 1894 Richard went to London for a purely social visit,\nbut while he was there President Carnot was assassinated, and he went\nto Paris to write the \"story\" of the funeral and of the election of the\nnew President.\n\nVERSAILLES, June 24, 1894.\n\nI am out here to see the election of the new President.  I jumped on\nthe mail coach and came off in a hurry without any breakfast, but I had\na pretty drive out, and the guard and I talked of London.  The palace\nis closed and no one is admitted except by card, so I have seen only\nthe outside of it.  It is most interesting.  There is not a ribbon or a\nbadge; not a banner or a band.  The town is as quiet as always, and\nthere are not 200 people gathered at the gate through which the\ndeputies pass.  Compared to an election convention in Chicago, it is\nmost interesting.  How lively it is inside of the chamber where the\nthing is going on I cannot say.  I shall not wait to hear the result,\nbut will return on the coach.\n\nNothing could be more curious than the apparent indifference of the\npeople of Paris to the assassination of the President.  Two days after\nhe died there was not a single flag at half mast among the private\nresidences.  The Government buildings, the hotels and the stores were\nall that advertised their grief.  I shall have an interesting story to\nwrite of it for the Parisian series.  Dana Gibson and I will wait until\nafter the funeral and then go to Andorra.  If he does not go, I may go\nalone, but perhaps I shall go back to London at once.  This has been an\ninteresting time here, but only because it is so different from what\none would expect.  It reads like a burlesque to note the expressions of\ncondolence from all over the world, and to mark the self-satisfaction\nof the French at attracting so much sympathy, and their absolute\nindifference to the death of Carnot.  It is most curious.  We have an\nideal time.  Never before have I had such jolly dinners, with such good\ntalk and such amusing companions.\n\nDICK.\n\n\nLONDON, July 15, 1894.\n\nDEAR MOTHER:\n\nMr. Irving gave a supper last night to Mme. Bernhardt and Mme.  Rejane.\nThere were about twenty people, and we ate in the Beefsteak Room of the\nLyceum Theater, which is so called after the old Beefsteak Club which\nformerly met there.  I had a most delightful time, and talked to all\nthe French women and to Miss Terry, who sent her love to Dad.  She\nsaid, \"I did not SEE him this last visit; that is, I saw him but I did\nnot see him.\"  Her daughter is a very sweet girl, and the picture Miss\nTerry made on her knees looking up at Bernhardt and Rejane when they\nchattered in French was wonderful.  Neither she nor Irving could speak\na word of French, and whenever any one else tried, the crowd all stood\nin a circle and applauded and guyed them.  After it was over, at about\nthree in the morning, Miss Terry offered me a lift home in her open\ncarriage, so she and her daughter and I rode through the empty streets\nin the gray light for miles and miles, as, of course, I did not get out\nof such company any sooner than I had to do.  They had taken Irving's\nrobe of cardinal red and made it into cloaks, and they looked very odd\nand eerie with their yellow hair and red capes, and talking as fast as\nthey could.\n\nDICK.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VIII\n\nCENTRAL AND SOUTH AMERICA\n\nAbout January 1, 1895, Richard accompanied by his friends Somers\nSomerset and Lloyd C. Griscom, afterward our minister to Tokio and\nambassador to Brazil and Italy, started out on a leisurely trip of\nSouth and Central America.  With no very definite itinerary, they\nsailed from New Orleans, bent on having a good time, and as many\nadventures as possible, which Richard was to describe in a series of\narticles.  These appeared later on in a volume entitled \"Three Gringos\nin Venezuela.\"\n\n\nJanuary, 1895.\n\nDEAR FAM:\n\nOn board Breakwater at anchor.  You will be pleased to hear that I am\nwriting this in a fine state of perspiration in spite of the fact that\nI have light weight flannels, no underclothes and all the windows open.\nIt is going to storm and then it will be cooler.  We have had a bully\ntime so far although the tough time is still to come, that will be\ngoing from Puerto Cortez to Tegucigalpa.  At Belize the Governor\ntreated us charmingly and gave us orderlies and launches and lunches\nand advice and me a fine subject for a short story.  For nothing has\nstruck me as so sad lately as did Sir Anthony Moloney K. C. M. G.\nwatching us go off laughing and joking in his gilded barge to wherever\nwe pleased and leaving him standing alone on his lawn with some papers\nto sign and then a dinner tete-a-tete with his Secretary and so on to\nthe end of his life.  It was pathetic to hear him listen to all the\ngossip from the outside world and to see how we pleased him when we\ntold him we were getting more bald than he was and that he would make a\nfine appearance in the Row at his present weight.  He had not heard of\nTrilby!!\n\nWe struck a beautiful place today called Livingston where we went\nashore and photographed the army in which there was no boy older than\neighteen and most of them under ten.  It was quite like Africa, the\nhomes were all thatched and the children all naked and the women mostly\nso.  We took lots of photographs and got on most excellently with the\nnatives who thought we were as funny as we thought them.  Almost every\nplace we go word has been sent ahead and agents and consuls and custom\nhouse chaps come out to meet me and ask what they can do.  This is very\ngood and keeps Griscom and Somerset in a proper frame of awe.  But\nseriously I could not ask for better companions, they are both\nenormously well informed and polite and full of fun.  The night the\nGovernor asked Somers to dinner and did not ask us we waited up for him\nand then hung him out over the side of the boat above the sharks until\nhe swore he would never go away from us again.  Griscom is more\naggravatingly leisurely but he has a most audacious humor and talks to\nthe natives in a way that fills them with pleasure but which nearly\nmakes Somers and I expose the whole party by laughing.  Today we lie\nhere taking in banannas and tomorrow I will see Conrad, Conrad,\nConrad!!  Send this to the Consul.  Lots of love.\n\nDICK.\n\n\nSAN PEDRO--SULA--February, 1895.\n\nMY DEAR FAMILY:\n\nThe afternoon of the day we were in Puerto Cortez the man of war\nAtlanta steamed into the little harbor and we all cheered and the\nlottery people ran up the American flag.  Then I and the others went\nout to her as fast as we could be rowed and I went over the side and\nthe surprise of the officers was very great.  They called Somers and\nGriscom to come up and we spent the day there.  They were a much\nyounger and more amusing lot of fellows than those on the Minneapolis\nand treated us most kindly.  It was a beautiful boat and each of us\nconfessed to feeling quite tempted to go back again to civilization\nafter one day on her.  Their boat had touched at Tangier and so they\nclaimed that she was the one meant in the Exiles.  They told me that\nthe guide Isaac Cohen whom I mentioned in Harper's Weekly carries it\naround as an advertisement and wanted to ship with them as cabin boy.\nWe left the next day on the railroad and the boys finding that two\nnegroes sat on the cowcatcher to throw sand on the rails in slippery\nplaces bribed them for their places and I sat on the sand box.  I never\ntook a more beautiful drive.  We did not go faster than an ordinary\nhorse car but still it was exciting and the views and vistas wonderful.\nSometimes we went for a half mile under arches of cocoanut palms and a\nstraight broad leafed palm called the manaca that rises in separate\nleaves sixty feet from the ground.  Imagine a palm such as we put in\npots at weddings and teas as high as Holy Trinity Church and hundreds\nand hundreds of them.  The country is very like Cuba but more luxuriant\nin every way.  There are some trees with marble like trunks and great\nbranches covered with oriole nests and a hundred orioles flying in and\nout of them or else plastered with orchids.  If Billy Furness were to\nsee in what abundance they grew he would be quite mad.  It is a great\npity he did not come with us.  This little town is the terminus of the\nrailroad and we have been here four days while Jeffs the American\nColonel in the Hondurean Army is getting our outfit.  It has been very\npleasant and we are in no hurry which is a good thing for us.  It is a\nmost exciting country and as despotic as all uncivilized and unstable\ngovernments must be.  But we have called on the Governor of the\ndistrict with Jeffs and he gave us a very fine letter to all civil and\nunmilitary authorities in the district calling on them to aid and\nprotect us in every way.  I am getting awfully good material for my\nnovel and for half a dozen stories to boot only I am surprised to find\nhow true my novel was to what really exists here.  About ten years ago\n---- disappeared, having as I thought drunk himself to death.  He came\nup to me here on my arrival with a lot of waybills in his hand and I\nlearned that he had been employed in this hole in the ground by a\nrailroad for two years.  I remembered meeting him at Newport when I was\nstill at Lehigh, and last night he asked me to dinner and told me what\nhe had been doing which included everything from acting in South\nAmerica to blacking boots in Australia.  His boss was a Pittsburgh\nengineer who is apparently licking him into shape and who told me to\ntell his father that he had stopped drinking absolutely.  His colored\n\"missus\" sat with us at the table and played with a beetle during the\nthree hours I stayed there during which time he asked me about ---- who\nhe said had ruined him.  He told me of how ---- had done and said this,\nand the contrast to the thatched roof and the mud floor and the Scotch\nAmerican engineer and the mulatto girl was rather striking.  I never\nhad more luck in any trip than I have had on this one and the luck of\nR. H. D. of which I was fond of boasting seems to hold good.  That man\nof war, for instance, was the only American one that had touched at\nPuerto Cortez in TEN years and it came the day we did and left the day\nwe did.  We saw a big lithograph of Eddie Sothern in a palm hut here so\nwe went before a notary and swore to it and had three seals put on the\npaper and sent it him as a joke.  We start tomorrow the 22nd so you see\nwe are behind our schedule and I suppose you people are all worried to\ndeath about us.  We will be much longer than six days on our way to\nTegucigalpa as we are going shooting and also to pay our respects to\nBogran the ex-president and the man who is getting up the next\nrevolution.  But we take care to tell everyone we are travelling for\npleasure and are great admirers of Bonilla the present president.\nSomers and I are getting on famously.  He is a very fine boy with a\ngreat sense of humor and apparently very fond of me. We had five men\ncounting Jeffs who we call our military attache and Charwood and four\ndrivers and eleven mules so it is quite an outfit.  In Ecuador with one\nmore man it would constitute a revolution.\n\nDICK.\n\n\nSANTA BARBARA--January 25, 1895.\n\nDEAR FAM:\n\nWe are not at Tegucigalpa as you observe but travelling in this\ncountry.  \"As you see it on Broadway \" and as you see it here are two\ndifferent things.  We have had five days of it so far and rested here\ntoday in order to pay our respects to General Bogran the ex-president\nof the Republic.  It is still six days to Tegucigalpa.  The trip across\nCentral America will certainly be one of the most interesting\nexperiences of my life.  It is the most beautiful country I have seen\nand the most barbarous.  It is also the hottest and the most\ninsect-ious and the dirtiest.  This latter seems a little view to take\nof it but it means a great deal as the insects prevent your doing\nanything in a natural way; as for instance sitting on the grass or\nsleeping on the ground or hunting through the bushes.  It is pretty\nmuch as you imagine it is from what you have read, that covers it, and\nI have discovered nothing new by coming to see it.  I only verify what\nothers have seen.  The people are most uninteresting chiefly because\nthey are surly to Americans and do not make you feel welcome.  I do not\nmean that I did not do well to come for I am more glad that I did than\nI can say only I have not, as I have been able to do before, found\nsomething that others have not seen.  I never expect to see such a\ncountry again unless in Africa.  If you leave the path for ten yards\nyou would never get back to it except by accident and you could not get\nthat far away unless you cut yourself a trail.  In some places the mail\nroute which we follow and over which the mail is carried on the backs\nof runners is cut in the rock and we go down steps as even as those of\nthe City Hall and for hours we travel over rough rocks and stones and a\npath so narrow that your knees catch in the vines at the side.  The\nmules are wonderfully sure footed and never slip although they are very\nlittle, and I am pretty heavy.  The heat is something awful.  It bakes\nyou and will dry your pith helmet in ten minutes after you have soaked\nit in water.  But the scenery is magnificent, sometimes we ride above\nthe clouds and look down into valleys stretching fifty miles away and\nsee the buzzards half a mile below us.  Then we go through forests of\nmanaca palms that spread out on a single stem sideways and form arches\nover our heads with the leaves hanging in front of us like portiers or\nwe cross great plains of grass and cactus and rock.  The best fun is\nthe baths we take in the mountain streams.  They are almost as cool as\none could wish and we shoot the rapids and lie under the waterfalls and\ncome out with all the soreness rubbed out of us as though we had been\nmassaged.  We went shooting for two days but as they had no dogs we did\nnot do much.  I got the best shot of the trip and missed it. It was a\nlarge wild cat and he turned his side full on but I fired over him.\nSomers and I spent most of the time firing chance shots at alligators,\nbut they never gave us a good chance as the birds warn them when they\nare in danger.  One old fellow fifteen feet long beat us for some time\nand then Somers and I started across the river to catch him asleep.  It\nwas like the taking of Lungtepen.  We had our money belts around our\nnecks and our shoes in one hand and rifles in the other.  The rapids\nran very fast and the last I saw of Somerset he was sitting on the bank\nhe had started from counting out wet bank notes and blowing the water\nout of his gun barrel.  I got across all right by sticking my feet\nbetween rocks and put on my shoes and crawled up on the old Johnnie.\nHe smelt of musk so strong that you could have found him in the dark.\nI had, a beautiful shot at him at fifty yards but I was too greedy and\nran around some rocks to get nearer and he heard me and dived.  I shot\na macaw, one of those overgrown parrots with tail feathers three feet\nfrom tip to tip.  I got him with a rifle and as Griscom had got his\nwith a shotgun I came out all right as a marksman although I was very\nsore at missing the wild cat.  We sleep in hats and we sleep precious\nlittle for the dogs and pigs and insects all help to keep us awake and\nI cannot get used to a hammock.  The native beds are made of matting\nsuch as they put over tea chests, or bull's hide stretched.  Last night\nI slept in a hut with a woman and her three daughters all over fifteen\nand they sat up and watched me prepare for bed with great interest.  I\nwould not have missed this trip for any other I know.  I wanted to\nrough it and we've roughed it and we will have another week of it too.\nWe have some remarkable photographs and the article ought to be most\ninteresting.  Bogran proved to be a very handsome and remarkable man\nand we had a very interesting talk with him.  From Tegucigalpa we will\nprobably go directly to Venezuela across the Isthmus of Panama and not\nvisit another Republic.  We have all travelled too much to care to\nduplicate, and that is what we would be doing by remaining longer in\nCentral America.  A month of it will be enough of it and we will not\nget away from Amapala before the first of February.  We are all well\nand happy and dirty and sing and laugh and tell stories and listen to\nGriscom's anecdotes of the aristocracy as we pick our way along.  So\ngoodbye and God bless you all.\n\nDICK.\n\n\nTEGUCIGALPA,  CENTRAL  AMERICA.\n\nFebruary 1st, 1895.\n\n4th, 1895.\n\nDEAR FAMILY--\n\nHere we are at last, the trip from Santa Barbara where I last wrote you\nwas made in six days.  It was not so interesting as the first part\nbecause it was very high up and the tropical scenery gave way to\nimmensely tall pines and other trees that might have been in\nCalifornia, or the Rockies.  The Corderillas which is the name of the\nmountains we crossed are a continuation, by the way, of the Rockies,\nand the Andes but are not more than 4,000 feet high.  We had two very\nhot days of it in the plains of Comgaqua where there was once a city of\n60,000 founded by Cortez but where there are not now more than 6,000.\nThe heat was awful.  We peeled all over our faces and hands and dodged\nand ducked our heads as though some one were biting at us.  My saddle\nand clothes were so hot that I could not place my hand on them.  At one\nvillage we heard that a bull fight was to be given at the next fifteen\nmiles away, so we rode on there and arrived in time to take part.  They\nhad enclosed the plaza with a barricade of logs seven feet high, bound\ntogether with vines.  They roped a big bull and lassoed him all over\nand then a man got on his back with spurs on his bare feet and held on\nby the ropes around the bull's body and by his toes and threw a cloak\nover the bull's eyes when ever it got too near any one-- They stuck it\nwith spears until it was mad and then let the lassoes slip and the bull\nstarted off to tear out the torreadors.  I thought it would be a great\nsporting act to kodak a bull while it was charging you and so we all\nvolunteered to act as torreadors and it was most exciting and funny.\nIt was rather late to get good results but I got some pretty good\npictures of the bull coming at me with his head down and then I'd skip\ninto a hole in the wall.  The best pictures I got were of Somers and\nGriscom scrambling over the seven foot barriers with the bull in hot\nchase.  We all looked so funny in our high boots and helmets and so\nmuch alike that the savages yelled with delight and thought we had been\nengaged especially for their pleasure.  Our \"mosers,\" or mule drivers\ntreated us most insolently but we could not do anything because Jeffs.\nhad engaged them and we did not want to interfere with his authority\nbut at a place the last day out one of them told Jeffs. he lied and\nthat we all lied.  He had lost or stolen a canteen of Griscom's and\nthey had said we had not given it to him.  Jeffs. went at him right and\nleft and knocked him all over the shop.  There were half a dozen\ndrunken mule drivers at the place and we thought they would take a hand\nbut they did not.  That night Jeffs. thought to try us to see what we\nwould have done and left us bathing in a mountain stream and rode on\nahead and hid himself behind a rock in a canon and lay in ambush for\nus.  We were jogging along in the moonlight and Somerset was reciting\nthe \"Walrus and the Carpenter,\" when suddenly Jeffs. let out a series\nof yells in Spanish and opened fire on us over our heads.  Somerset was\nriding my mule and I had no weapons, so I yelled at him to shoot and he\nfell off his mule and ran to mine and let go at the rock behind which\nJeffs. was with the carbines.  So that in about five seconds Jeffs.'\ncuriosity was perfectly satisfied as to what we would do, and he\nshouted for mercy.  We thought it was a sentry or brigands and were\ngreatly disappointed when it turned out to be Jeffs.  We got here last\nnight and a dirtier or more dismal place you never saw.  We had\ntelegraphed ahead for rooms but nothing was in order and we were lodged\nmuch worse than we had been several times in the interior where there\nwas occasionally a clean floor.  This morning we wrote direct to the\nPresident, asking for an interview or audience and did not ask our\nConsul to help us because Jeffs. had asked him in our presence to come\nmeet us and he said he would after he had done talking to some other\nmen, but he never came.  Before we heard from Bonilla however, we\nlearned that the Vice-president who has the same name was to be sworn\nin so we went to the palace along with the populace in their bare feet.\nWe sat out of sight but the English Consul who was the finest looking\nperson in the chamber--all over gold lace--saw us and asked that we be\ngiven places in front, which the minister of something asked us to take\nbut we objected on account of our clothes.  Somers had on a flannel\nsuit that looked exactly like pajamas and lawn tennis shoes.  But as\nsoon as the ceremony was over they insisted on our going in to the\nbanquet hall and in spite of our objections we were there conveyed and\npresented to Bonilla who behaved very well and after saying he had\nreceived our letters but had not had time to read them left us and\navoided us, which was what we wanted for we looked like the devil.  We\nmet everybody else though and took the English and Guatemalian Consuls\nback to our rooms and gave them drinks and then we went to their rooms,\nso the day went very pleasantly.  The President sent us a funny printed\ncard appointing an audience at eleven to-morrow.  It is exactly what\nyou would imagine it would be, the soldiers are barefooted except about\nfifty and the President leaned out of the window in his shirt sleeves\nafter the review and they have not plastered up the holes in his palace\nthat his cannon made in it just a year ago to-day, when he was fighting\nVasquez, and Vasquez was then on the inside and Bonilla on the hills.\nI forgot to tell you that this morning a boy about sixteen years old,\nwith a policeman's badge and club came to our window and talked\npleasantly with us or at us rather, while we shaved and guyed him in\nEnglish.  Finally we found that he had come to arrest Jeffs. so we told\nhim where Jeffs. was but he preferred to watch us shave and we finished\nit under his custody.  Then we went to the Commandante and found that\nthe mosers had had Jeffs. arrested for not paying them on their arrival\nat Tegucigalpa, as we had distinctly told them we would not do but at\nSan Pedro from where we took them, on their return.  It was only a\nspite case suggested by Jeffs. thrashing their leader.  The Commandante\ngave them a scolding and we went out in triumph.\n\n\nFebruary 4th--\n\nYour cable received all right.  We were very glad to hear.  We have\ndecided to go on by mules to Manaqua, the Capital of Nicaragua, and\nfrom there either to Corinto or to Lemon on the Atlantic side.  We had\nto do this or wait here ten days for the boat going south at Amapala.\nIt is moonlight now so that we can avoid the heat of the day.\nYesterday we went out riding with the President, who put a gold\nrevolver in his hip pocket before he started and made us feel that\nuneasy lies the head that rules in this country.  He had two horses\nthat had never been ridden before, as a compliment to our powers, the\nresult was that the Vice-president's horse almost killed him, which I\nguess the President intended it should and the horse Griscom rode\nbacked all over the town.  He was a stallion and had never been ridden\nbefore that day.  Mine was a gentle old gee-gee and yet I felt good\nwhen we were all on the ground again.  The British consul gave Somers a\nfine reception and raised the flag for him and had the band there to\nplay \"God Save the Queen,\" which he had spent the whole morning in\nteaching them.  Griscom and I called on our Consul and played his\nguitar.  We bought one for ourselves for the rest of the trip.\n\nI want you to do something for me: keep all the unfavorable notices you\nget.  I know Mother won't do it, so I shall expect Nora to make a point\nof saving them from the waste-paper basket.  If there is not a lot of\nthem when I get back, I will raise a row.\n\nDICK.\n\n\nMANAQUA--NICARAGUA--February 13, 1895.\n\nDEAR FAM:\n\nI had a great deal to tell you, but we have just received copies of the\nPanama Star and have read of the trolley riots in Brooklyn, a crisis in\nFrance, War in the Balkans, a revolution in Honolulu and another in\nColombia.  The result is that we feel we are not in it and we are all\nkicking and growling and abusing our luck.  How Claiborne and Russell\nwill delight over us and in telling how the militia fired on the\nstrikers and how Troop A fought nobly.  Never mind our turn will come\nsomeday and we may see something yet.  We have had the deuce of a time\nsince we left Tegucigalpa.  Now we are in a land where there are bull\nhide beds and canvas cots instead of hammocks and ice and railroads and\ndirect communication with steamship lines.  Hereafter all will be\nmerely a matter of waiting until the boat sails or the train starts and\nthe uncertainties of mules and cat boats are at an end.  It is hard to\nexplain about our difficulties after we left Tegucigalpa but they were\nmany.  We gave up our idea of riding here direct because they assured\nus we could get a steam launch from Amapala to Corinto so we rode three\ndays to San Lorenzo on the Pacific side and took an open boat from\nthere to Amapala.  It was rowed by four men who walked up a notched log\nand then fell back dragging the sweeps back, with the weight of their\nbodies.\n\nIt was a moonlight night and they looked very picturesque rising and\nsinking back and outlined against the sky.  They were naked to the\nwaist and rowed all night and I had a good chance to see them as I had\nto lie on the bottom of the boat on three mahogany logs.  By ten the\nnext day we were too cramped to stand it, so we put ashore on a\ndeserted island and played Robinson Crusoe.  We had two biscuits and a\nbox of sardines among five of us but we found oysters on the rocks and\nknocked a lot off with clubs and stones and the butts of our guns.\nThey were very good.  We also had a bath until a fish ran into me about\nthree feet long and cut two gashes in my leg.  We reached Amapala about\nfour in the afternoon.  It was an awful place; dirt and filth and no\nroom to move about, so we chartered an open boat to sail or row to\nCorinto sixty miles distant.  You see, we could not go back to\nTegucigalpa until the steamer arrived which is to take us South of\nPanama and we could not go to Manaqua either and for the same reason\nthat we had sent back our mule train and we would not wait in Amapala\npartly because of fever which had been there and partly because we\nwanted to get to Corinto where they have ice and to see Manaqua.  The\nboat was about as long as the Vagabond and twice as deep and a foot or\ntwo more across her beam.  There were four of us, five of the crew and\ntwo natives who wanted to make the trip and who we took with us.  It\nwas pretty awful.  The old tub rocked like a milk shake and I was never\nso ill in my life, we all lay packed together on the ribs of the boat\nand could not move and the waves splashed over us but we were too ill\nto care.  The next day the sun beat in on us and roasted us like an\nopen furnace.  The boat was a pit of heat and outside the swell of the\nPacific rose and fell and reflected the sun like copper.  We reached\nCorinto in about twenty four hours and I was never so glad to get any\nplace before.  The town turned out to greet us and some Englishmen ran\nto ask from what boat we had been ship wrecked.  They would not believe\nwe had taken the trip for any other reason.  They helped us very kindly\nand would not let us drink all the iced water we wanted and sent us in\nto bathe in a place surrounded by piles to keep out the sharks and by a\nroof to shelter one from the sun.  Corinto proved to be all that\nAmapala was not; clean, cool with very excellent food and broad beds of\nmatting.  I liked it better than any place at which we have been, we\ncame on here the next day to see the President and found the city hot,\ndusty and of no interest.  There is an excellent hotel however and we\nhad a talk with the President who was a much better chap than Bonilla\nbeing older and more civilized.  Of course there is absolutely no\nreason or excuse for us if we do not get control of this canal.  If\nonly that it would allow our ships of war to pass from Ocean to Ocean\ninstead of going around the horn.  The women are really beautiful but\nthat has nothing to do with the canal.  Tomorrow morning we return to\nCorinto as Somers and I like it best.  Griscom would like to go on\nacross by the route of the canal which would be a good thing were we\ncertain of meeting a steamer at Simon or Greytown, but the Minister who\nwent last month that way had to wait there sixteen days.  So, we will\nprobably leave Corinto on the 17th or 20th, there are two steamers, one\nthat stops at ports and one that does not.  They both arrive together.\nI do not know which we will take but--this letter will go with me. Up\nto date I think the trip will make a good story but it will have to be\na personal one about the three of us for the country as it stands is\nuninteresting to the general reader for the reason that it DUPLICATES\nitself in everything.  But with our photographs and a humorous story,\nit ought to be worth reading and I have picked enough curious things to\nmake it of some value.\n\n\nFebruary 15,--Corinto.\n\nWe are back here now and rid of that dusty, dirty city.  You would be\namused if you saw this place and tried to understand why we prefer it\nto any place we have seen.  There is surf bathing at a half mile\ndistant and a good hotel with a great bar where a Frenchman gives us\nice and the sea captains and agents for mines and plantations in the\ninterior gather to play billiards.  Outside there are rows of handsome\nwomen with decollete gowns and shining black hair and colored silk\nscarfs selling fruit and down the one street which faces the bay are a\ndouble row of palms and the store where two American boys have a\nphonograph.  They are the only Americans I have met who have or are\ntaking a dollar out of this country.  They play the guitar and banjo\nvery well.  One of them was on the Princeton glee club and their\nstories of how they have toured Central America are very amusing.  Lots\nof Love.\n\nDICK.\n\n\nS. S. Barracouta--Off San Juan\n\nFebruary 21, 1895.\n\nDEAR MOTHER:\n\nToday I believe is the 21st.  We are out two days from Corinto off San\nJuan on the boundary of Costa Rica and lie here some hours.  Then we go\non without stopping to Panama arriving there about the 25th.  On the\n28th we take the steamer to Caracas.  We will be at Caracas a week and\nthen go straight home.  But in the meanwhile we will have got one mail\nat Colon when we go there to take the boat for Caracas and glad I will\nbe to get it.  We have had a summary of the news in the Panama Star and\na bundle of Worlds telling all about the trolley strike and that is all\nexcept Dad's cable at Tegucigalpa that we have heard in nearly two\nmonths. I am very sorry that the distances have turned out so much\nlonger than we expected and that we had that unfortunate ten days wait\nfor the steamer.  I know you want me home and I would like to be there\nbut I do not think I ought to go without seeing Caracas.  It helps the\nbook so much too if one runs it into South America for no one in the\nStates thinks much of Central and does not want to read about it.  At\nleast I know I never did.  We have had a most amusing time with the two\nphonograph chaps.  One of them has been an advertising agent and a\ndeputy sheriff and chased stage coach robbers and kept a hard-ware\nstore and is only twenty-five and the other has not had quite as much\nexperience but has been to Princeton, he is 23.  The mixture of\nnarratives which change from tricks of the hard-ware trade to dances at\nBuckingham Palace and anecdotes of Cliff House supper parties at San\nFrancisco are very interesting.  I am going to write a book for them\nand call it \"Through Central America with a Phonograph\" or \"Who We Did,\nand How We Done Them.\"  We sing the most beautiful medleys and\ncontribute to the phonograph.  I had to protest against them announcing\n\"Her Golden Hair was Hanging Down her Back\" by Richard Harding Davis\nand Somerset kicked at their introducing \"God Save the Queen\" as sung\nby \"His Grace the Duke of Bedford\" which they insist in thinking his\nreal title and his name; if he would only confess the truth.  You\ncannot have any idea of how glad I am that I took this trip, just this\nparticular trip, not for any interest it will be to the gentle reader\nbut for the benefit it has been to me.  All the things I was nervous\nabout have been done and should I get nerves again as I suppose I\nalways will in one form or another I can get rid of them by remembering\nhow I got rid of them before during this most peculiar excursion.  For\nthough I and we all told the truth about being well, we were in a most\ntrying place at times and the ride we took and the sail to get away\nfrom possible fever was very much of a strain.  I do not see how\nGriscom kept up as he did for he was an invalid and very nervous when\nhe started.  But he showed great sporting blood.  It was much better\nhaving three than two and he furnished us with much amusement at which\nhe never complains.  His artlessness and his bad breaks which keep us\nfilled with terror make the most entertaining narratives and he tells\nthem on himself and then keeps on making new ones.  One night Jeffs\ncame down with fever through bathing in the mountain streams, a\npractice which did not hurt us but which natives of the country cannot\ndo in safety, and I confess I was scared.  Jeffs pulled through in a\nfew days.  It was odd that the man who had lived here eleven years\nshould have been the only one to give up throughout the whole trip and\nhe was a good sport, too.\n\nI will have the Central American stories all done or nearly so by the\ntime we reach New York which is one of the comforts of this over\nabundance of sea voyages.  I have the lottery story nearly written and\nam wondering now if Bissell will let me publish it.  Would it not be a\ngood idea to have Dad, if he knows him, explain about how I went South\nto write it and just what it is and get his official sanction or shall\nI write or get the Harper's to write when I get back.  The lottery\npeople in joke offered  $10,000 if they could write the story\nthemselves.  And sometimes I wish they would for it is the hardest kind\nof work.  I do not want to advertise their old game and yet I cannot\nhelp doing it, in a way.  We put in at Punta Arenas and I found a woman\nlooking at us with an opera glass and shortly after she sent out to say\nshe knew me and that she wanted me to come up.  It seemed I met her in\nElizabeth, New Jersey with Eddie Coward where she was playing in\nprivate theatricals.  Since then as a punishment no doubt she has lived\nhere and her husband is Minister of the Navy with one gun boat.  This\ntrip is very hot and I sleep on deck and look up at the stars and the\nlight on the jib and the smoke spoiling the firmament.  It makes you\nfeel terribly far away from the centre of civilization in front of the\nfire and you all trying to make out where we are at.  I hope you know\nmore about it than we do.\n\nIt is the worst country for getting about that I ever heard of.  It has\nrevived my interest and belief in all such beautiful things as buried\ntreasures and hidden cities and shooting men against stone walls and\nfilibusters.  There are not many of these stories but every man tells\nthem differently so they have all the freshness of a new tale.  There\nis no ice on this boat or lemons or segars.  It is the first time so\nthey say that it has happened in twelve months, but after this it must\nbe better.  At Panama they fine the ice man $1000 every day his machine\nbreaks and so we have hopes.  I feel so very, very selfish off down\nhere and leaving you all alone and it makes me lose my temper more than\nusual when all these delays occur but I promise to be good hereafter\nand we will be together soon now by the end of March sure and I hope\nyou will not miss me too much, as much as I miss all of you.  Sometimes\nI wish you could see some of these islands and the long shadowy sharks\nand the turtles, there are thousands of turtles as big as tubs just\nfloating around like empty bottles, but I have never on the whole taken\na trip when I so seldom wished that the family were around to enjoy it.\nIt used to hurt me during the Mediterranean trip but there is not much\nthat would please you in this outfit.  I like it because I am satisfied\nto go dirty for weeks at a time and to talk to the engineer or the\nqueer passengers and to pick up stories and improve my geography but I\ndo not think the scenery would compensate either Nora or you or Dad for\nthe lack of necessities and CLEANTH.  When we were crossing the\ncontinent I don't believe I had a spot on me as big as a nickel without\nthree bites on it, all sorts of bites, they just swarmed over you all\nsizes, colors and varieties.  They came from dogs, from the sand, from\ntrees, from the grass, from the air.  The worst were little red bugs\nthat lay under the leaves called carrapati's and that came off on you\nin a hundred at a time.  And there were also \"jiggers\" that get under\nyour nails and leave eggs there.  Some times we could not sleep at all\nfor the bites and you had to carry a brush to brush the carripats off\nevery time you passed through bushes.  It's the damnedest country I was\never in now that I have time to think of it.  The other day I was going\nin to bathe and the sand was so hot that I could not get to the\nbreakers and so I went yelling and jumping back to the grass and the\ngrass was just one mass of burrs, so I gave another yell and leaped on\nto a big log and the log was full of thorns.  That's the sort of\ncountry it is.  And then after you do make a dash for the surf a shark\nmakes a dash for you and you don't know what you are here for anyway.\nIt had its humorous side and it was very funny, especially as it never\nturned out otherwise, to see the men scamper when the sharks came in.\nThey never scented us for ten minutes or so and then they would swim up\nand we would give a yell and all make for the shore head over heels and\nsplashing and shrieking and scared and excited.  There would always be\none man who was further out than the rest and he could not hear on\naccount of the waves and we would all line up on the beach and yell and\ndance up and down and try to attract his attention.  But you would see\nhim go on diving and playing along in horrible loneliness until he\nturned to speak to some one and found the man gone and then he would\nlook for the others and when he saw us all on the shore he would give\none wild whoop out of him and go falling over himself with his hair on\nend and his eyes and mouth wide open.  I saw one shark ten feet long\nbut we would have died of the heat if we had not bathed so we thought\nit was worth it.  That's over now because we cannot get any more sea\nbathing.  Just around Panama.  Finest place seen yet.\n\nRICHARD.\n\n\nPANAMA, February 28th, 1895.\n\nDEAR MOTHER:\n\nGriscom has awakened to the fact that he is a Press correspondent and\nis interviewing rebels who come stealthily by night followed by spies\nof the government and sit in Griscom's room with the son of the Consul\nGeneral, as interpreter.  Somerset and I refuse to be implicated and\nsit in the plaza waiting for a file of soldiers to carry Griscom off\nwhich is our cue for action.  There is a man-of-war, the Atlanta, the\none we made friends with at Puerto Cortez, lying at Colon and so we\nfeel safe.  We may now be said to be absorbing local color.  That is\nabout all we have done since we left Amapala.  And if it were not that\nyou are all alone up there, I would not mind it.  I would probably\ncontinue on.  We know it now as we do London or Paris.  We can\ndistinguish sea captains, lawyers in politics, commandantes, oldest\nresidents, gentlemenly good for nothings, shipping agents and\ncommission dealers, coffee planters and men who are \"on the beach\" with\nunerring eye.  We know the story of each before he tells it, or it is\ntold by some one else.  The Commandante shot a lot of men by the side\nof a road during the last revolution, first allowing them to dig their\nown graves and is here now so that he can pay himself by stealing the\ncustom dues, the lawyer politician has been to Cornell and taken a\nmedical degree in Paris and aspires to be a deputy and only remembers\nNew York as the home of Lillian Russell.  The commission merchants are\nall Germans and the coffee planters are all French.  They point with\npride to little bare-foot boys selling sea shells and cocoanuts as\ntheir offspring, although they cannot remember their names.  The sea\ncaptains you can tell by their ready made clothes of a material that\nwould be warm in Alaska and by them wearing Spanish dollars for watch\nguards and by the walk which is rolling easily when sober and pitching\nheavily toward the night.  The oldest resident always sits in front of\nthe hotel and in the same seat, with a tortoise shell cane and\nremembers when Vasquez or Mendoza or Barrios, or Bonilla occupied the\nCathedral and fired hot shot into the Palace and everybody took refuge\nin the English Consulate and he helped guard the bank all night with a\nSpringfield rifle.  The men who are on the beach have just come out of\nthe hospital where they have had yellow fever and they want food.  This\nstory is intended to induce you to get rid of them hurriedly by a small\ntoken.  Sometimes out of this queer combination you will get a good\nstory but generally they want to show you a ruined abbey or a document\nas old as the Spanish occupation or to make you acquainted with a man\nwho has pearls to sell, or a coffee plantation or a collection of\nunused stamps which he stole while a post-office employee.  Our chief\nsport now is to go throw money at the prisoners who are locked up in a\nrow of dungeons underneath the sea wall.  The people walk and flirt and\nenjoy the sea breeze above them and the convicts by holding a mirror\nbetween the bars of the dungeons can see who is leaning over the\nparapet above them.  Then they hold out their hands and you drop\nnickels and they fail to catch them and the sentry comes up and teases\nthem by holding the money a few inches beyond their reach.  They climb\nall over the crossbars in their anxiety to get the money and look like\ngreat monkeys.  At night it is perfectly tremendous for their is only a\nlight over their heads and they crawl all over the bars beneath this,\nstanding on each other's shoulders and pushing and fighting and yelling\nhalf naked and wholey black and covered with sweat.  As a matter of\nfact they are better content to stay in jail than out and when the\nBritish Consul offered to send eight of them back to Jamaica they\nrefused to go and said they would rather serve out their sentence of\neight years.  This is the way the place looks and I am going to\nintroduce it in a melodrama and have some one lower files down to the\nprisoners.  DICK.\n\n\nAfter some not very eventful or pleasant days at Caracas, Richard\nsailed for home and from the steamer wrote the following letter:\n\n\nMarch 26th--On board S. S. Caracas.\n\nDEAR CHAS:\n\nOff the coast of God's country.  Hurrah!  H---- did not come near us\nuntil the morning of our departure when he arrived at the Station\ntrembling all over and in need of a shave.  But in the meanwhile the\nconsul at Caracas picked Griscom and myself up in the street and took\nus in to see Crespo who received us with much dignity and politeness.\nSo we met him after all and helped the story out that much.\n\nThere is not much more to tell except that I was never so glad to set\nmy face home as I am now and even the roughness of this trip cannot\nsquelch my joy.  It seems to me as if years had passed since we left\nand to think we are only three days off from Sandy Hook seems much too\nwonderfully good to be possible.  Some day when we have dined alone\ntogether at Laurent's I will tell you the long story of how Somers and\nGris came to be decorated with the Order of the Bust of Bolivar the\nLiberator of Venezuela of the 4th class but at present I will only say\nthat there is a third class of the order still coming to me in Caracas,\nas there is 20 minutes still coming to Kelly in Brooklyn.  It was a\nmatter of either my getting the third class, which I ought to have had\nanyway having the third class of another order already, and THEIR\nGETTING NOTHING, or our all getting the 4th or 5th class and of course\nI choose that they should get something and so they did and for my\naimable unselfishness in the matter they have frequently drunken my\nhealth.  I was delighted when Somers got his for he was happier over it\nthan I have ever seen him over anything and kept me awake nights\ntalking about it.  I consider it the handsomest order there is after\nthe Legion of Honor and I have become so crazy about Bolivar who was a\nsecond Washington and Napoleon that I am very glad to have it, although\nI still sigh for the third class with its star and collar.\n\nThe boys are especially glad because we have organized a Traveller's\nClub of New York of which we expect great things and they consider that\nit starts off well in having three of the members possessors of a\nforeign order.  We formed the club while crossing Honduras in sight of\nthe Pacific Ocean and its object is to give each other dinners and to\npresent a club medal to people who have been nice to and who have\nhelped members of the club while they were in foreign parts.  It is my\nidea and I think a good one as there are lots of things one wants to do\nfor people who help you and this will be as good as any.  Members of\nthe club are the only persons not eligible to any medal bestowed by the\nclub and the eligibility for membership is determined by certain\ndistances which a man must have travelled.  Although the idea really is\nto keep it right down to our own crowd and make each man justify the\nsmallness of the club's membership by doing something worth while.  I\nam President.  Bonsal is vice president.  Russell treasurer and Griscom\nSecretary.  Somerset is the solitary member.  You and Sam and Helen and\nElizabeth Bisland are at present the only honorary members.  We are\nalso giving gold medals to the two chaps who crossed Asia on bicycles,\nto Willie Chanler and James Creelman, but that does not make them\nmembers.  It only shows we as a club think they have done a sporting\nact.  I hope you like the idea.  We have gone over it for a month and\nconsidered it in every way and I think we are all well enough known to\nmake anybody pleased to have us recognize what they did whether it was\nfor any of us personally or for the public as explorers.  On this trip\nfor instance we would probably send the club medals in silver to\nAdmiral Meade, to Kelly, to Royas the Venezuelan Minister for the\norders to the Governor of Belize, to the consul at La Guayra and to one\nof the phonograph chaps.  In the same way if you would want to send a\nmedal to any man or woman prince or doctor who had been kind,\ncourteous, hospitable or of official service to you you would just send\nin a request to the committee.  Write me soon and with lots of love\nDICK.\n\n\nIn April, 1895, Richard was back in New York, at work on his South and\nCentral American articles, and according to the following letters,\nhaving a good time with his old friends.\n\n\nNEW YORK, April 27, 1895.\n\nDEAR CHAS:\n\nI read in the paper the other morning that John Drew was in Harlem, so\nI sent him a telegram saying that I was organizing a relief expedition,\nand would bring him out of the wilderness in safety.  At twelve I sent\nanother reading, \"Natives from interior of Harlem report having seen\nDavis Relief Expeditionary Force crossing Central Park, all well.\nRobert Howard Russell.\"  At two I got hold of Russell, and we\ntelegraphed \"Relief reached Eighty-fifth street; natives peacefully\ninclined, awaiting rear column, led by Griscom; save your ammunition\nand provisions.\"  Just before the curtain fell we sent another,\nreading:  \"If you can hold the audience at bay for another hour, we\nguarantee to rescue yourself and company and bring you all back to the\ncoast in safety.  Do not become disheartened.\"  Then we started for\nHarlem in a cab with George and another colored man dressed as African\nwarriors, with assegai daggers and robes of gold and high turbans and\nsashes stuck full of swords.  I wore my sombrero and riding breeches,\ngauntlets and riding boots, with cartridge belts full of bum cartridges\nover my shoulder and around the waist.  Russell had my pith helmet and\na suit of khaki and leggins.  Griscom was in one of my coats of many\npockets, a helmet and boots.  We all carried revolvers, canteens and\nrifles.  We sent George in with a note saying we were outside the\nzareba and could not rescue him because the man on watch objected to\nour guns.  As soon as they saw George they rushed out and brought us\nall in.  Drew was on the stage, so we tramped into the first entrance,\nfollowed by all the grips, stage hands and members of the company.  The\nold man heard his cue just as I embraced him, and was so rattled that\nwhen he got on the stage he could not say anything, and the curtain\nwent down without any one knowing what the plot was about.  When John\ncame off, I walked up to him, followed by the other four and the entire\ncompany, and said:  \"Mr. Drew, I presume,\" and he said:  \"Mr. Davis, I\nbelieve.  I am saved!\" Helen Benedict happened to be in Maude Adams'\ndressing-room, and went off into a fit, and the company was delighted\nas John would have been had he been quite sure we were not going on the\nstage or into a box.  We left them after we had had a drink, although\nthe company besought us to stay and protect them, and got a supper\nready in Russell's rooms, at which Helen, Ethel Barrymore, John and\nMrs. Drew, Maude Adams and Griscom were present.\n\nDICK.\n\n\nNEW YORK, November, 1895.\n\nDEAR MOTHER:--\n\nThe china cups have arrived all right and are a beautiful addition to\nmy collection and to my room, in which Daphne still holds first place.\n\nWhat do you think Sir Henry sent me?  The medal and his little black\npipe in a green velvet box about as big as two bricks laid side by side\nwith a heavy glass top with bevelled edges and the medal and pipe lying\non a white satin bed, bound down with silver--and a large gold plate\nwith the inscription \"To Richard Harding Davis with the warmest\ngreetings from Gregory Brewster--1895\"-- You have no idea how pretty it\nis, Bailey, Banks and Biddle made it-- It is just like him to do\nanything so sweet and thoughtful and it has attracted so many people\nthat I have had it locked up-- No Burden jewel robbers here-- My\nfriend, the Russian O---- lady still pursues me and as she has no sense\nof humor and takes everything seriously, she frightens me-- I am afraid\nshe will move in at any moment-- She has asked me to spend the summer\nwith her at Paris and Monte Carlo, and at her country place in Norfolk\nand bombards me with invitations to suppers and things in the meantime.\nShe has just sent me a picture of herself two feet by three, with\nwriting all over it and at any moment, I expect her to ring the bell\nand order her trunks taken up stairs-- I am too attractive-- Last night\nI dined with Helen and Maude Adams, who is staying with her.  I want\nthem to board me too.  Maude sang for us after dinner and then went off\nto see Yvette Guilbert at a \"sacred concert\" to study her methods.  I\nwent to N----'s box to hear Melba and we chatted to the accompaniment\nof Melba, Nordica and Plancon in a trio--the Ogre, wore fur, pearls,\nwhite satin and violets.  It was a pink silk box.  Then I went down to\na reception at Mrs. De Koven's and found it was a play.  Everybody was\nseated already so I squatted down on the floor in front of Mrs. De\nKoven and a tall woman in a brocade gown cut like a Japanese woman's--\nIt was very dark where the audience was, so I could not see her face\nbut when the pantomime was over I looked up and saw it was Yvette\nGuilbert.  So I grabbed Mrs. De Koven and told her to present me and\nGuilbert said in English-- \"It is not comfortable on the floor is it?\"\nand I said, \"I have been at your feet for three years now, so I am\nquite used to it\"--for which I was much applauded-- Afterwards I told\nsome one to tell her in French that I had written a book about Paris\nand about her and that I was going to mark it and send it and before\nthe woman could translate, Guilbert said, \"No, send me the Van Bippere\nbook\"-- So we asked her what she meant and she said, \" M. Bourget told\nme to meet you and to read your Van Bippere Book, you are Mr. Davis,\nare you not?\"-- So after that I owned the place and refused to meet\nMrs. Vanderbilt.\n\nYvette has offered to teach me French, so I guess I won't go to\nSomerset's wedding, unless O---- scares me out of the country.  I got\nmy $2,000 check and have paid all my debts.  They were not a third as\nmuch as I thought they were, so that's all right.\n\nDo come over mother, as soon as you can and we will meet at Jersey\nCity, and have a nice lunch and a good talk.  Give my bestest love to\nDad and Nora.  How would she like Yvette for a sister-in-law?  John\nHare has sent me seats for to night-- He is very nice-- I have begun\nthe story of the \"Servants' Ball\" and got well into it.\n\nand lots of love.\n\nDICK.\n\n\n\nThe following letter was written to me at Florence.  The novel referred\nto was \"Soldiers of Fortune,\" which eventually proved the most\nsuccessful book, commercially, my brother ever wrote.  Mrs. Hicks, to\nwhom Richard frequently refers, is the well-known English actress\nEllaline Terriss, the wife of Seymour Hicks.  Somerset is Somers\nSomerset, the son of Lady Henry Somerset, and the Frohman referred to\nis Daniel Frohman, who was the manager of the old Lyceum Theatre.\n\nEarly in November, William R. Hearst asked my brother to write a\ndescription of the Yale-Princeton football game for The Journal.\nRichard did not want to write the \"story\" and by way of a polite\nrefusal said he could not undertake it for less than $500.00.  Greatly\nto his surprise Hearst promptly accepted the offer.  At the time, I\nimagine this was by far the largest sum ever paid a writer for\nreporting a single event.\n\n\nDecember 31st, 1895.\n  New York.\n    The Players.\n\nNew Year's Eve.\n\nDEAR CHAS:\n\nI am not much of a letter writer these days, but I have finished the\nnovel and that must make up for it.  It goes to the Scribners for\n$5,000 which is not as much as I think I should have got for it.  I am\nnow lying around here until the first of February, when I expect to\nsail to Somerset's wedding, reaching you in little old Firenzi in\nMarch.  We will then paint it.  After that I do not know what I shall\ndo.  The Journal is after me to do almost anything I want at my own\nfigure, as a correspondent.  They have made Ralph London correspondent\nand their paper is the only one now to stick to.  They are trying to\nget all the well known men at big prices.\n\nI have had such a good time helping Mrs. Hicks in Seymour's absence.\nShe had about everything happen to her that is possible and she is just\nthe sort of little person you love to do things for.  She finally\nsailed and I am now able to attend to my own family.\n\nThe Central American and Venezuelan book comes out on February lst.\nSeveral of the papers here jokingly alluded to the fact that my article\non the Venezuelan boundary had inspired the President's message.  Of\ncourse you get garbled ideas of things over there and exaggerated ones,\nas for instance, on the Coxey army.  But you never saw anything like\nthe country after that war message. It was like living with a British\nfleet off Sandy Hook.  Everybody talked of it and of nothing else.  I\nwent to a dinner of 300 men all of different callings and I do not\nbelieve one of them spoke of anything else.  Cabmen, car conductors,\nbarkeepers, beggars and policemen.  All talked war and Venezuela and\nthe Doctrine of Mr. Monroe.  In three days the country lost one\nthousand of millions of dollars in values, which gives you an idea how\nexpensive war is.  It is worse than running a newspaper.  Now, almost\neveryone is for peace, peace at any price.  I do not know of but one\njingo paper, The Sun, and war talk is greeted with jeers.  It was as if\nthe people had suddenly had their eyes opened to what it really meant\nand having seen were wiser and wanted no more of it.  Your brother,\npersonally, looks at it like this.  Salisbury was to blame in the first\nplace for being rude and not offering to arbitrate as he had been asked\nto do.  When he said to Cleveland, \"It's none of your business\" the\nonly answer was \"Well, I'll make it my business\" but instead of\nstopping there, Cleveland uttered a cast iron ultimatum instead of\nleaving a loophole for diplomacy and a chance for either or both to\nback out.  That's where I blame him as does every one else.\n\nSam Sothern is in Chicago and we all wrote him guying letters about the\nwar.  Helen said she was going to engage \"The Heart of Maryland\"\ncompany to protect her front yard, while Russell and I have engaged\n\"The Girl I Left Behind Me\" company with Blanch Walsh and the original\ncast.\n\nWe sent Somerset a picture of himself riddled with bullets.  And Mrs.\nHicks made herself famous by asking if it was that odious Dunraven they\nwere going to war about.\n\nMy article was a very lucky thing and is greatly quoted and in social\ngatherings I am appealed to as a final authority.\n\nThe football story, by the way, did me a heap of good with the\nnewspapers and the price was quoted as the highest ever paid for a\npiece of reporting.  People sent for it so that the edition was\nexhausted.  The Journal people were greatly pleased.\n\nYvette Guilbert is at Hammerstein's and crowds the new music hall\nnightly, at two dollars a seat.  Irving and Miss Terry have been most\nfriendly to me and to the family.  Frohman is going to put \"Zenda\" on\nin New York because he has played a failure, which will of course kill\nit for next year for Eddie, when he comes out as a star.  I have never\nseen such general indignation over a private affair.  Barrymore called\nit a case of Ollaga Zenda.  They even went to Brooklyn when Eddie was\nplaying there and asked him to stage the play for them and how he made\nhis changes and put on his whiskers.  Poor Eddie, he lacks a business\nhead and a business manager--and Sam talks and shakes his head but is\nlittle better.  Lots of love and best wishes for the New Year.\n\nDICK.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER IX\n\nMOSCOW, BUDAPEST, LONDON\n\nThe years 1896--1897 were probably the most active of Richard's very\nactive life.  In the space of twelve months he reported the Coronation\nat Moscow, the Millennial Celebration at Budapest, the Spanish-Cuban\nWar, the McKinley Inauguration, the Greek-Turkish War and the Queen's\nJubilee.  Although this required a great deal of time spent in\ntravelling, Richard still found opportunity to do considerable work on\nhis novel \"Captain Macklin,\" to which he refers in one of his letters\nfrom London.\n\nAs correspondent of the New York American, then The Journal, Richard\nwent from Florence, where he was visiting me, to Moscow.  He was\naccompanied by Augustus Trowbridge, an old friend of my brother's and a\nrarely good linguist.  The latter qualification proved of the greatest\npossible assistance to Richard in his efforts to witness the actual\ncoronation ceremony.  To have finally been admitted to the Kremlin my\nbrother always regarded as one of his greatest successes as a\ncorrespondent.\n\n\nEn route--May 1896.\n\nDEAR CHAS:\n\nThe night is passed and with the day comes \"a hope\" but during the\nblackness I had \"a suffer\"-- I read until two--five hours--and then\nslept until five when the middle man who had slept on my shoulder all\nnight left the train and the second one to whom Bernardi was so polite\nleft me alone and had the porter fit me up a bed so that I slept until\nseven again-- Then the Guardian Angel returned for his traps and I bade\nhim a sleepy adieu and was startled to see two soldiers standing\nshading their eyes in salute in the doorway and two gentlemen bowing to\nmy kind protector with the obsequiousness of servants-- He sort of\nsmiled back at me and walked away with the soldiers and 13 porters\ncarrying his traps.  So I rung up the conductor and he said it was the\nKing's Minister with his eyes sticking out of his head--the conductor's\neyes--not the Minister's.  I don't know what a King's Minister is but\nhe liked your whiskey-- I am now passing through the Austrian Tyrol\nwhich pleases me so much that I am chortling with joy-- None of the\nplaces for which my ticket call are on any map--but don't you care, I\ndon't care-- I wish I could adequately describe last night with nothing\nbut tunnels hours in length so that you had to have all the windows\ndown and the room looked like a safe and full of tobacco smoke and damp\nspongey smoke from the engine, and bad air.  That first compartment I\nwent in was filled later with German women who took off their skirts\nand the men took off their shoes.  Everybody in the rear of the car is\nfilthy dirty but I had a wash at the Custom house and now I am almost\nclean and quite happy.  The day is beautiful and the compartment is all\nmy own-- I am absolutely enchanted with the Tyrol-- I have never seen\nsuch quaint picture book houses and mills with wheels like that in the\nGood for Nothing and crucifixes wonderfully carved and snow mountains\nand dark green forests-- The sky is perfect and the air is filled with\nthe sun and the train moves so smoothly that I can see little blue\nflowers, baby blue, Bavarian blue flowers, in the Spring grass.  Such\ndear old castles like birds nests and such homelike old mills and\nred-faced millers with feathers in their caps you never saw out of a\ncomic opera-- The man in here with me now is a Russian, of course, and\nsaw the last Coronation and knows that my suite is on the principal\nStreet and attends to my changing money and getting an omelette-- I can\nsurvive another night now having had an omelette not so good as Madam\nMasi's but still an omelette-- I have now left Munich and the Russian\nand a conductor whom I mistook for a hereditary prince of Bavaria, with\ntassels down his back, has assured me he is going to Berlin, and that I\nam going to Berlin and much else to which I smile knowingly and say\nmucho gracia, wee wee, ya ya, ich ich limmer and other long speeches\nending with \"an er--\"\n\nDICK.\n\n\nMay 15th, 1896.  Moscow.\n\nDEAR CHAS:\n\nWe left Berlin Monday night at eleven and slept well in a wagon-lit.\nThat was the only night out of the five that I spent in the cars that I\nhad my clothes off, although I was able to stretch out on the seats, so\nI am cramped and tired now.  At seven Monday morning the guard woke us\nand told us to get ready for the Custom House and I looked out and saw\na melancholy country of green hills and black pines and with no sign of\nhuman life.  It was raining and dreary looking and then I saw as we\npassed them a line of posts painted in black and white stripes a half\nmile apart on each side of the train and I knew we had crossed the\nboundary and that the line of posts stretched from the Arctic Ocean to\nthe Black Sea and from the Pacific to the Caucasus Mountains and the\nPamirs.  It gave me a great thrill but I have had so many to-day, that\nI had almost forgotten that one.  For two days we jogged along through\na level country with meanthatched huts and black crows flying\ncontinually and peasants in sheepskin coats, full in the skirt and\ntight at the waist, with boots or thongs of leather around their feet.\nThe women wore boots too and all the men who were not soldiers had\ntheir hair cropped short like mops.  We could not find any one who\nunderstood any language, so as we never knew when we would stop for\nfood, we ate at every station and I am of the opinion that for months I\nhave been living on hot tea and caviar and hash sandwiches.  The snow\nfell an inch deep on Wednesday and dried up again in an hour and the\nsun shone through it all.  So on the whole it was a good trip and most\ninteresting.  But here we are now in a perfect pandemonium and the Czar\nhas not yet come nor one-fifth even of the notables.  It is a great\ncity, immense and overpowering in its extent.  The houses are ugly low\nstoried and in hideous colors except the churches which are like\nmosques and painted every color.  I confess I feel beaten to night by\nthe noise and rush and roar and by so many strange figures and\nmarvellous costumes.  Our rooms are perfect that is one thing and the\nsituation is the very best.  If the main street were Fifth Avenue and\nMadison Square the Governor's Square, his palace would be Delmonico's\nand our rooms would be the corner rooms of the Brunswick, so you can\nsee how well we are placed.  We can sit in our windows and look down\nand up the main street and see every one who leaves or calls upon the\nGovernor.  We are now going out for a dinner and to one of many\ncafe-chantants and I will tell you the rest to-morrow, when I get\nsleep, for after five nights of it I feel done up, but I feel equally\nsure it is going to be a great experience and I cannot tell you how\nglad 1 am that I came.  Love to you all and to dear Florence in which\nTrowbridge, who is a brick, joins me.\n\nDICK.\n\n\nMoscow--May 1896.\n\nDEAR CHAS:\n\nThere was a great deal to tell when I shut down last night, but I\nthought I would have had things settled by this time and waited, but it\nlooks now as though there was to be no rest for the weary until the\nCzar has put his crown on his head.  The situation is this: there are\nninety correspondents, and twelve are to get into the coronation, two\nof these will be Americans.  There are five trying for it.\n\nCount Daschoff, the Minister of the Court, has the say as to who gets\nin of those five.  T. and I called on him with my credentials just as\nhe was going out.  Never have I seen such a swell.  He made us feel\nlike dudes from Paterson, New Jersey.  He had three diamond eagles in\nan astrakan cap, a white cloak, a gray uniform, top boots and three\nrows of medals.  He spoke English perfectly, with the most politely\ninsolent manner that I have ever had to listen to; and eight servants,\neach of whom we had, in turn, mistaken for a prince royal, bowed at him\nall the brief time he talked over our heads.  He sent us to the bureau\nfor correspondents, where they gave me a badge and a pocketbook, with\nmy photo in it.  They are good for nothing, except to get through the\npolice lines.  No one at the bureau gave us the least encouragement as\nto my getting in at the coronation.  We were frantic, and I went back\nto Breckenridge, our Minister, and wrote him a long letter explaining\nwhat had happened, and that what I wrote would \"live,\" that I was\nadvertised and had been advertised to write this story for months.  I\ndropped The Journal altogether, and begged him to represent me as a\nliterary light of the finest color.  This he did in a very strong\nletter to Daschoff, and I presented it this morning, but the Minister,\nlike Edison, said he would let me know when he could see me.  Then I\nwrote Breck a letter of thanks so elegant and complimentary that he\nanswered with another, saying if his first failed he would try again.\nThat means he is for me, and at the bureau they say whichever one he\ninsists on will get in, but they also say he is so good-natured that he\nhelps every one who comes.  I told him this, and he has promised to\ncontinue in my behalf as soon as we hear from Daschoff.\n\nThe second thing of importance is the getting the story, IF WE GET IT,\non the wire.  That, I am happy to say, we are as assured of as I could\nhope to be.  I own the head of the Telegraph Bureau soul, body and\nmind.  He loves the ground T.  and I spurn, and he sent out my first\ncable today, one of interrogation merely, ahead of twelve others; he\nhas also given us the entree to a private door to his office, all the\nother correspondents having to go to the press-rooms and undergo a sort\nof press censorship, which entails on each man the cutting up of his\nstory into three parts, so as to give all a chance.  I gave T. three\ndictums to guide him; the first was that we did not want a fair\nchance--we wanted an unfair advantage over every one else.  Second, to\nnever accept a \"No\" or a \"Yes\" from a subordinate, but to take\neverything from head-quarters.  Third, to use every mouse, and not to\ntrust to the lions.  He had practise on the train.  When he told me we\nwould be in Moscow in ten hours, I would say, \"Who told you that,\" and\nback he would go to the Herr Station Director in a red gown, and return\nto say that we would get there in twenty hours.  By this time I will\nmatch him against any newspaper correspondent on earth.  He flatters,\nlies, threatens and bribes with a skill and assurance that is simply\nbeautiful, and his languages and his manners pull me out of holes from\nwhich I could never have risen.  With it all he is as modest as can be,\nand says I am the greatest diplomat out of office, which I really think\nhe believes, but I am only using old reporters' ways and applying the\nthings other men did first.\n\nMy best stroke was to add to my cable to The Journal, \"Recommend ample\nrecognition of special facilities afforded by telegraph official\"--and\nthen get him to read it himself under the pretext of wishing to learn\nif my writing was legible.  He grinned all over himself, and said it\nwas.  After my first story is gone I will give him 200 roubles for\nhimself in an envelope and say Journal wired me to do it.  That will\nfix him for the coronation story, as it amounts to six months' wages\nabout.  But, my dear brother, in your sweet and lovely home, where the\nsun shines on the Cascine and the workmen sleep on the bridges, and\ndear old ladies knit in the streets, that is only one of the thousand\nthings we have had to do.  It would take years to give you an account\nof what we have done and why we do it.  It is like a game of whist and\npoker combined and we bluff on two flimsy fours, and crawl the next\nminute to a man that holds a measly two-spot.  There is not a wire we\nhave not pulled, or a leg, either, and we go dashing about all day in a\nbath-chair, with a driver in a bell hat and a blue nightgown, leaving\ncards and writing notes and giving drinks and having secretaries to\nlunch and buying flowers for wives and cigar boxes for husbands, and\nthreatening the Minister with Cleveland's name.\n\nJohn A. Logan, Jr., is coming dressed in a Russian Uniform, and he wore\nit on the steamer, and says he is the special guest of the Czar and the\nSecretary of the visiting mission.  Mrs. P. P. is paying $10,000 for a\nhotel for one week.  That is all the gossip there is.  We lunched with\nthe McCooks today and enjoyed hearing American spoken, and they were\napparently very glad to have us, and made much of T. and of me. We only\nhope they can help us; and I am telling the General the only man to\nmeet is Daschoff, and when he does I will tell him to tell Daschoff I\nam the only man to be allowed in the coronation.  I wish I could tell\nyou about the city, but we see it only out of the corner of our eyes as\nwe dash to bureau after bureau and \"excellency\" and \"royal highness\"\npeople, and then dash off to strengthen other bridges and make new\nfriends.  It is great fun, and I am very happy and T. is having the\ntime of his life.  He told me he would rather be with me on this trip\nthan travel with the German Emperor, and you will enjoy to hear that he\nwrote Sarah I was the most \"good-natured\" man he ever met.  God bless\nyou all, and dear, dear Florence.  Lots of love.\n\nDICK.\n\n\nMoscow--May, 1896.\n\nDEAR CHAS:\n\nI have just sent off my coronation story, and the strain of this thing,\nwhich has really been on me for six months, is off.  You can imagine\nwhat a relief it is, or, rather, you cannot, for no one who has not\nbeen with us these last ten days can know what we have had to do.  The\nstory I sent is not a good one.  It was impossible to tell it by cable,\nand the first one on the entry was a much better one.  I do not care\nmuch, though; of course, I do care, as I ought to have made a great hit\nwith it, but there was no time, and there was so much detail and\nminutia that I could not treat it right.  However, after the awful\npossibility, or rather certainty, that we have had to face of not\ngetting any story at all, I am only too thankful.  I would not do it\nagain for ten thousand dollars.  Edwin Arnold, who did it for The\nTelegraph, had  $25,000, and if I told you of the way Hearst acted and\nRalph interfered with impertinent cables, you would wonder I am sane.\nThey never sent me a cent for the cables until it was so late that I\ncould not get it out of the bank, and we have spent and borrowed every\npenny we have.  Imagine having to write a story and to fight to be\nallowed a chance to write it, and at the same time to be pressed for\nmoney for expenses and tolls so that you were worn out by that alone.\nThe brightest side of the whole thing was the way everybody in this\ntown was fighting for me.  The entire town took sides, and even men who\ndisliked me, and who I certainly dislike, like C. W. and R---- of the\nParis Embassy, turned in and fought for my getting in like relations.\nAnd the women--I had grand dukes and ambassadors and princes, whom I do\nnot know by sight, moving every lever, and as Stanhope of The Herald,\ntestified \"every man, woman and child in the visiting and resident\nlegation is crazy on the subject of getting Davis into the coronation.\"\nThey made it a personal matter, and when I got my little blue badge,\nthe women kissed me and each other, and cheered, and the men came to\ncongratulate me, and acted exactly as though they had got it themselves.\n\nIt was a beautiful sight; the Czarina much more beautiful and more\nsad-looking than ever before.  But it was not solemn enough, and the\npriests groaned and wailed and chanted and sang, and every one stood\nstill and listened.  All that the Czar and Czarina did was over ten\nminutes after they entered the chapel, and then for three hours the\npriests took the center of the stage and groaned.  I was there from\nseven until one.  Six solid hours standing and writing on my hat.  It\nwas a fine hat, for we were in court costume, I being a distinguished\nvisitor, as well as a correspondent.  That was another thing that\nannoyed me, because Breckinridge, who has acted like a brick, did not\nthink he could put me on both lists, so I chose the correspondents'\nlist, of course, in hopes of seeing the ceremony, but knowing all the\ntime that that meant no balls or functions, so that had I lost the\nceremony I would have had nothing; but he arranged it so that I am on\nboth lists.  Not that I care now.  For I am tired to death; and\nTrowbridge did not get on either list, thanks to the damned Journal and\nto his using all his friends to help me, so that I guess I will get out\nand go to Buda Pest and meet you in Paris.  Do not consider this too\nseriously, for I am writing it just after finishing my cable and having\nspent the morning on my toes in the chapel.  I will feel better\ntomorrow.  Anyway, it is done and I am glad, as it was the sight of the\ncentury, and I was in it, and now I can spend my good time and money in\ngay Paree.  Love to all.\n\nDICK.\n\n\nFrom Moscow Richard went direct to Buda Pest, where he wrote an article\non the Hungarian Millennial.\n\n\n\nBUDA PEST\n\nMay 8th, 1896.\n\nCHAS:\n\nI have just returned from the procession of the Hungarian Nobles.  It\nwas even more beautiful and more interesting than the Czar's entry than\nwhich I would not have believed anything could have been more\nimpressive-- But the first was military, except for the carriages,\nwhich were like something out of fairyland--to-day, the costumes were\nall different and mediaeval, some nine hundred years old and none\nnearer than the 15th Century.  The mis en scene was also much better.\nBuda is a clean, old burgh, with yellow houses rising on a steep green\nhill, red roofs and towers and domes, showing out of the trees-- It is\nvery high but very steep and the procession wound in and out like a\nfairy picture-- I sat on the top of the hill, looking down it to the\nDanube, which separates Buda from Pest-- The Emperor sat across the\nsquare about 75 yards from our tribune in the balcony of his palace.\nWe sat in the Palace yard and the procession passed and turned in front\nof us-- There were about 1,500 nobles, each dressed to suit himself, in\ncostumes that had descended for generations--of brocade, silk, fur, and\ngold and silver cloth-- Each costume averaged, with the trappings of\nthe horse, 5,000 dollars.  Some cost $1,000, some  $15,000.  Some wore\ncomplete suits of chain armor, with bearskins and great black eagle\nfeathers on their spears just as they were when they invaded Rome--\nOthers wore gold chain armor and leopard or wolf skins and their horses\nwere studded with turquoises and trappings of gold and silver and\nsmothered in silver coins-- It would have been ridiculous if they had\nnot been the real thing in every detail and if you had not known how\nterribly in earnest the men were.  There is no other country in the\nworld where men change from the most blase and correct of beings, to\nfairy princes in tights and feathers and jewelled belts and satin\ncoats-- They were an hour in passing and each one seemed more beautiful\nthan the others-- I am very glad I came although I was disappointed at\nmissing the accident at Moscow.  It must have been more terrible than\nJohnstown.  I found the ----s quite converted into the most awful snobs\nbut the people they worship are as simple and well bred as all gentle\npeople are and I have had the most delightful time with them.  It is so\nsmall and quiet after Moscow, and instead of being lost in an avalanche\nof embassies and suites and missions, I have a distinct personality, as\n\"the American,\" which I share with \"the\" Frenchman and four Englishmen.\nWe are the only six strangers and they give us the run of all that is\ngoing on-- At night we dine at the most remarkable club in the world,\non the border of the Park, where the best of all the Gypsey musicians\nplays for us-- The music is alone worth having come to hear, and the\ndear souls who play it, having been told that I like it follow me all\naround the terrace and sit down three feet away and fix their eyes on\nyou, and then proceed to pull your nerves and heart out of you for an\nhour at a time-- One night a man here dipped a ten thousand franc note\nin his champagne and pasted it on the leader's violin and bowed his\nthanks, and the leader bowed in return and the next morning sent him\nthe note back in an envelope, saying that the compliment was worth more\nthan the money-- The leader's name is Berchey and the Hungarians have\nnever allowed him to leave the country for fear he would not be allowed\nto come back-- He is a fat, half drunken looking man, with his eyes\nfull of tears half the time he plays.  He looks just like a setter dog\nand he is so terribly in earnest that when he fixes me with his eyes\nand plays at me, the court ladies all get up and move their chairs out\nof his way just as though he were a somnambulist--\n\nI leave here Wednesday and reach Paris Friday MORNING the eleventh--\nYou must try to meet me at the Cafe de la Paix at half past nine-- Wait\nin the corner room if you don't wish to sit outside and as soon as I\nget washed I will join you for coffee.  It will be fine to see you\nagain and to be done with jumping about from hotel to hotel and to be\nable to read the signs and to know how to ask for food.  Russian,\nGerman and Hungarian have made French seem like my mother tongue--\n\nDICK.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER X\n\nCAMPAIGNING IN CUBA AND GREECE\n\nIn December, 1896, Richard and Frederic Remington, the artist, were\ncommissioned by the New York Journal to visit Cuba which was then at\nwar with Spain.  It was their intention to go from Key West in the\nVamoose, a very fast but frail steam-launch, and to make a landing at\nsome uninhabited point on the Cuban coast.  After this their plans seem\nto have been to trust to luck and the kindliness of the revolutionists.\nAfter waiting for some time at Key West for favorable weather, they at\nlast started out on a dark night to make the crossing.  A few hours\nafter the Vamoose had left Key West a heavy storm arose--apparently\nmuch too violent for the slightly built launch.  The crew struck and\nthe captain finally refused to go on to Cuba and put back to Key West.\nShortly after this Remington and my brother reached Havana by a more\nsimple and ostentatious route.  This was my brother's first effort as a\nwar correspondent, and I presume it was this fact and the very\nindefiniteness of the original plan that caused his mother and father\nso much uneasiness.  And, indeed, it did prove eventually a hazardous\nexploit.\n\n\nway to Key West.\n\nDecember 19, 1896.\n\nDEAR MOTHER:\n\nI hope you won't be cross with me for going off and not letting you\nknow, but I thought it was better to do it that way as there was such\ndelay in our getting started.  I am going to Cuba by way of Key West\nwith Frederic Remington and Michaelson, a correspondent who has been\nthere for six months.  We are to be taken by the Vamoose the fastest\nsteam yacht made to Santa Clara province where the Cubans will meet us\nand take us to Gomez.  We will stay a month with him, the yacht calling\nfor copy and sketches once a week, and finally for us in a month.  I\nget all my expenses and The Journal pays me  $3,000 for the month's\nwork.  The Harper's Magazine also takes a story at six hundred dollars\nand Russell will reprint Remington's sketches and my story in book\nform, so I shall probably clear $4,000 in the next month or six weeks.\nI was a week in getting information on the subject so I know all about\nit from the men who have just been there and I want you to pay\nattention to what I tell you they told me and not to listen to any\nstray visitor who comes in for tea and talks without any tact or\nknowledge.  There is no danger in the trip except the problem of\ngetting there and getting away again, and that is now removed by The\nJournal's yacht.  I would have gone earlier had any of the periodicals\nthat asked me to go shown me any way to get there-- THERE IS NO FEVER\nTHIS TIME OF YEAR and as you know fever never touches me.  It got all\nthe others in Central America and never worried me at all.  There is no\ndanger of getting shot, as the province into which we go, the Santa\nClara province, is owned and populated and patrolled by the Cubans.  It\nis no more Spanish than New Jersey and the Spaniards cannot get in\nthere.  We have the strongest possible letters from the Junta, and I\nhave from Lamont, Bayard and Olney and credentials in every language.\nWe will sit around the Gomez camp and send messengers back to the\ncoast.  It is a three days trip and as Gomez may be moving from place\nto place you may not hear from us for a month and we may not hear from\nyou but remember it was a much longer time than that before you heard\nfrom me when I went to Honduras.  Also keep in mind that I am going as\na correspondent only and must keep out of the way of fighting and that\nI mean to do so, as Chamberlain says we want descriptive stories not\nbrave deeds-- Major Flint who has arranged the trip for us was down\nthere with Maceo as a correspondent.  He saw six fights and never shot\noff his gun once because as he said it was not his business to kill\npeople and he has persuaded me that he is right, so I won't do anything\nbut look on-- I have bought at The Journal's expense a fifty dollar\nfield glass which is a new invention and the best made.  I have marked\nit so that you can see a man five miles off and as soon as I see him I\nmean to begin to ride or run the other way--no one loves himself more\nthan I do so you leave me to take care of myself.  I wish I could give\nyou any idea of the contempt the four returned correspondents who\ntalked to me, have for the Spaniards.  They have seen them shoot 2,500\nrounds without hitting men at 200 yards and they run away if the enemy\nbegins on them first.  However, you trust to Richard-- We have a fine\nescort arranged for us and Michaelson speaks Spanish perfectly and has\nbeen six months scouting over the country.\n\nDICK.\n\n\nKEY West, December 26, 1896.\n\nDEAR FAMILY:\n\nI got your letters late last night and they made me pretty solemn.  It\nis an awfully solemn thing to have people care for you like that and to\ncare for them as I do.  I can't tell you how much I love you.  You\ndon't know how much the pain of worrying you for a month has meant to\nme, but I have talked it all out with myself, and left it to God and I\nam sure I am doing right.  As Mrs. Crown said, \"There's a whole\nchurchful up here praying for you,\" and I guess that will pull me\nthrough.  Of course, dear, dear Mother thought she was cross with me.\nShe could not be cross with me, and her letter told me how much she\ncared, that was all, and made me be extra careful.  But I need not\npromise you to be careful.  You have an idea I am a wild,\nfilibustering, hot-headed young man.  I am not.  I gave the guides to\nunderstand their duty was to keep us out of danger if we had to walk\nmiles to avoid it.  We are men of peace, going in, as real estate\nagents and coffee-planters and drummers are going in on every steamer,\nto attend to our especial work and get out again quick.  I have just as\nstrong a prejudice against killing a man as I have against his killing\nme.\n\nLots and lots of love.  Don't get scared if you don't hear for a month,\nalthough we will try to get our stories back once a week, but you know\nwe are at the convenience of the Cubans who will pocket our despatches\nand money and not take the long trip back.  Thank dear Dad for his\nletter full of good advice.  It was excellent.  Remington and Michelson\nare good men and I like them immensely.  Already we are firm friends.\n\nLove,\n\n\n\n\nKEY WEST--January 1, 1897.\n\nDEAR MOTHER:\n\nAs you will know by my telegram we are either off on a safe sea going\nboat or waiting for one.  There is no turning back from here and the\nonly reason I thought of doing so was the knowledge of the way you\nwould suffer and worry.  I argued it out that it was selfish in me to\nweigh my getting laughed at and paragraphed as the war correspondent\nthat always Turned Back against a month of uneasiness for you, but\nlater I saw I could not do it much as I love you for the element of\ndanger to me is non-existent; it is merely an exciting adventure and\nyou will have to believe me and not worry but be a Spartan mother.  I\nwould not count being laughed at and the loss of my own self respect if\nI really thought there was great danger, but I do not.  You will not\nlose me and if I go now I can sit still next time and say \"I have done\nbetter things than that.\"  If I had not gone it would have meant that I\nwould have had to have done just that much harder a stunt next time to\nmake people forget that I had failed in this one.  Now do cheer up and\nbelieve in the luck of Richard Harding Davis and the British Army.  We\nhave carte blanche from The Journal to buy or lease any boat on the\ncoast and I rocked them for $1000 in advance payment because of the\ndelay over the Vamoose.\n\nI am so happy at thinking I am going, I could not have faced anyone had\nI not, although we had nothing to do with the failure, we tried to\ncross fairly in the damn tub and it was her captain who put back.  I\nlay out on the deck and cried when he refused to go ahead, we had\nwaited so long.  The Cubans and Remington and Michelson had put on all\ntheir riding things but fortunately I had not and so was spared that\nhumiliation.  What I don't know about the Fine Art of Filibustering now\nis unnecessary.  I find many friends of my Captain Boynton or \"Capt.\nBurke.\"  Tonight the officers of the Raleigh give me a grand dinner at\nwhich I wear a dress suit and make speeches--they are the best chaps I\never met in the Navy.  Lots of love and best wishes to Dad and to Nora\nfor a happy, happy New Year.  You know me and you know my conscience\nbut it would not let me go back in order to save you anxiety so you\nwon't think me selfish.  God bless you.\n\nDICK.\n\n\nKEY WEST, January 2nd, 1897.\n\nDEAR FAMILY:\n\nI have learned here that the first quality needed to make a great\nfilibuster is Patience, it is not courage, or resources or a knowledge\nof the Cuban Coast line, it is patience.  Anybody can run a boat into a\ndark bayou and dump rifles on the beach and scurry away to sea again\nbut only heroes can sit for a month on a hotel porch or at the end of a\nwharf, and wait.  That is all we do and that is my life at Key West.  I\nget up and half dress and take a plunge in the bay and then dress fully\nand have a greasy breakfast and then light a huge Key West cigar, price\nthree cents and sit on the hotel porch with my feet on a rail-- Nothing\nhappens after that except getting one's boots polished as the two\nindustries of this place are blacking boots and driving cabs.  I have\ntwo boys to black mine at the same time every morning and pay the one\nwho does his the better of the two-- It generally ends in a fight so\nthat affords diversion-- Then a man comes along, any man, and says,\n\"Remmington's looking for you\" and I get up and look for Remington.\nThere is only a triangle of streets where one can find him and I call\nat \"Josh\" Curry's first and then at Pendleton's News Store and read all\nthe back numbers of the Police Gazette for the hundredth time and then\ncall here at the Custom House and then look in at the Cable office,\nwhere Michaelson lives sending telegrams about anything or nothing and\nthat brings me back to the hotel porch again, where I have my boots\nshined once more and then go into mid-day dinner.  In the meanwhile\nRemington is looking for me a hundred yards in the rear.  He generally\ngets to \"Josh's\" as I leave the Custom House-- In the afternoon I study\nSpanish out of a text book and at three take a bicycle ride, at five I\ncall at the garrison to take tea with the doctor and his wife, who is\nsweeter than angel's ever get to be with a miniature angel of a baby\ncalled Martha.  I wait until retreat is sounded and the gun is fired at\nsunset and having commented unfavorably on the way the soldiers let the\nflag drop on the grass instead of catching it on the arms as a\nbluejacket does, I ride off to the bay for another bath-- Then I take\nthe launch to the Raleigh and dine with the officers and rejoice in the\nclean fresh paint and brass and decks and the lights and black places\nof a great ship of war, than which nothing is more splendid.  We sit on\nthe quarter-deck and smoke and play the guitar and I go home again, in\ntime for bed.  I vary this programme occasionally by spending the\nmorning on the end of a wharf watching another man fish and reading old\nnovels and the \"Lives of Captain Walker\" and \"Captain Fry of the\nVirginius,\" two great books from each of which I am going to write a\nshort story like the one of the Alamo or of the Jameson Raid-- The life\nof Walker I found on the Raleigh and the life of Captain Fry with all\nthe old wood cuts and the newspaper comments of the time at a book\nstore here.  I don't know when we shall get away but it is no use\nkicking about it, Michaelson is doing all he can and the new tug will\nbe along in a week anyway.  I shall be so glad to get to Cuba that I\nwill dance with glee.\n\nDICK.\n\n\nMATANZAS, January 15th, 1897.\n\nDEAR MOTHER:\n\nI sent you a note by Remington which he will mail in the States-- From\nhere I go to Sagua La Grande.  It is on the northern coast.  I think\nfrom there I shall cross over to Cienfuegos on the Southern coast and\nthen if I can catch a steamer go to Santiago to see my old friends, at\nthe Juraqua mines and MacWilliams' ore road and \"the Palms\"--\nEverywhere I am treated well on account of Weyler's order and I am\nlearning a great deal and talking very little, my Spanish being bad.\nThere is war here and no mistake and all the people in the fields have\nbeen ordered in to the fortified towns where they are starving and\ndying of disease.  Yesterday I saw the houses of these people burning\non both sides of the track-- They gave shelter to the insurgents and so\nvery soon they found their houses gone.  I am so relieved at getting\nold Remington to go as though I had won $5000.  He was a splendid\nfellow but a perfect kid and had to be humored and petted all the time.\nI shall if I have luck be through with this in a few weeks but it has\nhad such a set back at the start that I am afraid it can never make a\nbook and I doubt if I can write a decent article even.  I am so anxious\nnot to keep you worrying any longer than is necessary and so I am\nhurrying along taking only a car window view of things.  Address me\ncare of Consul General Lee, Havana and confine your remarks to what is\ngoing on at home.  I know what is going on here.  I don't believe half\nI hear but I am being slowly converted.  Remington is more excitable\nthan I am, so don't misunderstand if he starts in violently.  I am\ngetting details and verifying things.  He is right on a big scale but\nevery one has lied so about this island that I do not want to say\nanything I do not believe is true.  This is a beautiful little city and\nafter Jaruco, where we slept two days ago, it is Paris.  There we slept\noff the barnyard and cows and chickens walked all over the floor and\nfleas all over us.  It was like Honduras only filthier.  Speaking of\nParis, tell the Kid I expect to go over to him soon after I return to\nNew York.\n\nof love.\n\nDICK.\n\n\nCARDENAS--North Coast of Cuba.\n\nJanuary 16th, 1897.\n\nDEAR MOTHER:\n\nIt is very funny not knowing what sort of a place you are to sleep in\nnext and taking things out of a grab bag, as it were-- In Europe you\ncan always guess what the well known towns will give you for you have a\nguide book, but here it is all luck.  Matanzas was a pretty city but\nthe people were awful, the hotel was Spanish and the proprietor\ninsolent, though I was spending more of Willie Hearst's money than all\nof the officers spend in a week, the Consul could not talk English or\nSpanish, he said he hadn't come there \"to go to school to no Spaniard\"\nand he gloried in the fact he had been there three years without\nknowing a word of the language.  His vice-Consul was worse and\neverything went wrong generally.  Every one I met was an Alarmist and\nthat is polite for liar.  They asked Remington if he was the man who\nmanufactured the rifles and gave us the Iowa Democrat to read.  To\nnight I reached here after a six hours ride through blazing fields of\nsugar cane and stopped on my way to the hotel to ask the Consul when\nthe next boat went to Saqua la Grande-- I had no letter of introduction\nto him as I had to the Matanzas consul, but as soon as he saw my card\nhe got out of his chair and shook hands again and was as hearty and\nwell bred and delightful as Charley himself and unlike Chas he did not\nask me 14 francs for looking on him.  He is out now chasing around to\nget me a train for to-morrow.  But I won't go to-morrow.  My hotel\nlooks on the plaza and the proprietor and the whole suite of attendants\nare my slaves.  It is just as different as can be.  My interpreter does\nit, he calls himself MY VALET, although I point out to him that two\nshirts and twelve collars do not constitute a wardrobe even with a\nrubber coat thrown in.  But he likes to play at my being a\ndistinguished stranger and I can't say I object.  Only when you\nremember the way I was invited to see Cuba and expected to see it, and\nnow the way I am seeing it from car windows with A VALET.  What would\nthe new school of yellow kid journalists say if they knew that.  For\nthe first time on this trip I have wished you were both with me, that\nwas to night.  I never see anything really beautiful but that it\ninstantly makes me feel selfish and wish you could see it too.  It has\nhappened again and again and to night I wish you could be here with me\non this balcony.  The town runs down a slope to the bay and in the\nmiddle of it is the Plaza with me on the balcony which lets out of my\nsleeping room-- \"the room\" so the proprietor tells me, \"reserved only\nfor the Capitain General.\" It is just like the description in that\nremarkable novel of mine where Clay and Alice sit on the balcony of the\nrestaurant.  I have the moonlight and the Cathedral with the open doors\nand the bronze statue in the middle and the royal palms moving in the\nbreeze straight from the sea and the people walking around the plaza\nbelow.  If it was in any way as beautiful as this Clay and Alice would\nhave ended the novel that night.\n\nI got a grand lot of letters to-day which Otto, my interpreter brought\nback from Havana after having conducted Remington there in safety.  I\nmust say you are writing very cheerfully now, but I don't wonder you\nworried at first but now that I am a commercial traveller with an order\nfrom Weyler which does everything when I find it necessary, you really\nmust not worry any more but just let me continue on my uneventful\njourney and then come home.  I shall have been gone so long and my\nfriends, judging from Russell and Dana and Irene's letters, will be so\nglad to see me, that they will have forgotten I went out to do other\nthings than coast around in trains.  As a matter of fact this is a\nterribly big problem and most difficult to get the truth of, I find\nmyself growing to be the opposite of the alarmist, whatever that is,\nalthough you would think the picturesque and dramatic and exciting\nthing would be the one I would rather believe because I want to believe\nit, but I find that that is not so, I see a great deal on both sides\nand I do not believe half I am told.  As we used to say at college, \"it\nis against history,\" and it is against history for men to act as I am\ntold they are acting here-- They show me the pueblo huddled together\naround the fortified towns, living in palm huts but I know that they\nhave always lived in palm huts, the yellow kid reporters don't know\nthat or consider it, but send off word that the condition of the people\nis terrible, that they have only leaves to cover them, and it sounds\nvery badly.  That is an instance of what I mean.  In a big way there is\nno doubt that the process going on here is one of extermination and\nruin.  Two years ago the amount  of sugar shipped from the port of\nMatanzas to the U. S. was valued at 11 millions a year.  This last year\njust over shows that sugar to the amount of  $800,000 was sent out.  In\n'94, 154 vessels touched at Matanzas on their way to America.  In '95\nthere were 80 and in '96 there are 16.  I always imagined that houses\nwere destroyed during a war because they got in the way of cannon balls\nor they were burned because they might offer shelter to the enemy, but\nhere they are destroyed, with the purpose of making the war horrible\nand hurrying up the end.  The insurgents began first by destroying the\nsugar mills, some of which were worth millions of dollars in machinery,\nand now the Spaniards are burning the homes of the people and herding\nthem in around the towns to starve out the insurgents and to leave them\nwithout shelter or places to go for food or to hide the wounded.  So\nall day long where ever you look you see great heavy columns of smoke\nrising into this beautiful sky above the magnificent palms the most\nnoble of all palms, almost of all trees-- It is the most beautiful\ncountry I have ever visited.  I had no recollection of how beautiful it\nwas or else I had not the knowledge of other places with which to\ncompare it.  Nothing out of the imagination can approach it in its\ngreat waterfalls and mossy rocks and grand plains and forests of white\npillars with plumes waving above them.  Only man is vile here and it is\ncruel to see the walls of the houses with blind eyes, with roofs gone\nand gardens burned, every church but one that I have seen was a\nfortress with hammocks swung from the altars and rude barricades thrown\nup around the doorways-- If this is war I am of the opinion that it is\na senseless wicked institution made for soldiers, lovers and\ncorrespondents for different reasons, and for no one else in the world\nand it is too expensive for the others to keep it going to entertain\nthese few gentlemen-- I have seen very little of it yet and I probably\nwon't see much more, but I have seen all I want.  Remington had his\nmind satisfied even sooner--but then he is an alarmist and exaggerates\nthings-- The men who wear the red badge of courage, I don't feel sorry\nfor, they have their reward in their bloody bandages and the little\ncross on their tunic but those you meet coming back sick and dying with\nfever are the ones that make fighting contemptible--poor little\nfarmers, poor little children with no interest in Cuba or Spain's right\nto hold it, who have been sent out to die like ants before they have\nlearned to hold a mauser, and who are going back again with the beards\nthat have grown in the field hospitals on their cheeks and their eyes\nhollow, and too weak to move or speak.  Six of them died while I was in\nJaroco, a town as big as Marion and that had been the average for two\nmonths, think of that, six people dying in Marion every day through\nJuly and August-- I didn't stay in that town any longer than the train\ndid-- Well I have been writing editorials here instead of cheering you\nup but I guess I'm about right and when I see a little more I'll tell\nit over again to The Journal-- It is not as exciting reading as deeds\nof daring by our special correspondent and I haven't changed my name or\nshaved my eyebrows or done anything the other men have done but I\nbelieve I am getting near the truth.  They have shut off provisions\ngoing or coming from the towns, they have huddled hundreds of people\nwho do not know what a bath means around these towns, and this is going\nto happen-- As soon as the rains begin the yellow fever and smallpox\nwill set in and all vessels leaving Cuban ports will be quarantined and\nthe island will be one great plague spot.  The insurgents who are in\nthe open fields will live and the soldiers will die for their officers\nknow nothing of sanitation or care nothing.  The little Consul has just\nbeen here to see me and we have had a long talk and I got back at him.\nHe told me he had seen the Franco-German war as a correspondent of The\nTribune and I asked him if he had ever met another correspondent of The\nTribune at that time a German student named Hans who cabled the story\nof the battle of Gravellote and who Archibald Forbes says was the first\ncorrespondent to use the cable.  The Consul who looks like William D.\nHowells wriggled around in his chair and said \"I guess you mean me but\nI was not a German student, I was born and raised in Philadelphia and\nForbes got my name wrong, it is Hance.\"  So then I got up and shook\nhands with him in my turn and told him I had always wanted to meet that\ncorrespondent and did not expect to do so in Cardenas, on the coast of\nCuba.\n\nThank you all for your letters.  I am glad you liked the Jameson book.\nI thought you knew I was a F. R. G. S.  It was George Curzon proposed\nme and as he is a gold medallist of the Society it was easy getting in.\nLots of love.\n\nDICK.\n\n\nRichard returned to New York from Cuba in February, 1897, but the\nfollowing month started for Florence to pay me a long-promised visit.\nOn his way he stopped for a few days in London and Paris.\n\n\n\nABASSADE DES ETATS-UNIS\n  59 Rue Galilee,\n    Paris, April 1st, 1897.\n\nDEAR FAMILY:\n\nI got over here to-day after the heaviest weather I ever tackled on\nthis channel.  Stephen Crane came with me.  I gave him a lunch on\nWednesday.  Anthony Hope, McCarthy, Harold Frederic and Barrie came.\nSir Evelyn Wood instead of coming was detained at the war office and\nsent instead a lance Sergeant on horseback with a huge envelope marked\n\"On Her Majesty's Service,\" which was to be delivered into my hands--\nThe entire Savoy was upset and it was generally supposed that war had\nbeen declared and that I was being ordered to the front-- The whole\nhotel hung over us until I had receipted for the package and the\nsoldier had saluted and clanked away.  I gave Crane the letter as a\nsouvenir.  I also saw Seymour Hicks' first night and recognized 15\nAmerican songs in it.\n\nThe London Times offered me the position of correspondent on the Greek\nfrontier.  Every one in London thought it an enormous compliment and\nHarold Frederic, Ralph, Ballard Smith and the rest were very envious.\nI told them I could not go, but I was glad to have had the compliment\npaid me.  Barrie has made out a scenario of the \"Soldiers\" for dramatic\npurposes and has asked the Haymarket management to consider it.  So,\nthat I guess that it must be good--\n\nSo, I also guess I had better finish it-- I leave for Florence to\nnight.  I am having a fine, fine time and I am so glad you are all well.\n\nLots of love,\n\nDICK.\n\n\nOf the many happy days we have spent together, I do not believe there\nwere any much more happy than the three weeks Richard remained with me.\nIt was his first long visit to Italy and from the day of his arrival he\nloved the old town and its people who gave him a most friendly welcome.\nHe had come at a time when Florence was at its best, its narrow quaint\nstreets filled with sunshine and thronged with idling natives and the\nscurrying tourists that always came with the first days of spring.  The\nCascine and the pink-walled roads of the environs were ablaze with wild\nroses and here, after his rather strenuous experience in Cuba, Richard\ngave himself up to long days of happy idleness.  Together we took\nvoyages of discovery to many of the little walled and forgotten towns\nwhere the tourists seldom set foot.  Once we even wandered so far as\nMonte Carlo, where my brother tried very hard to break the bank and did\nnot succeed.  But the Richard Harding Davis luck did not fail him\ncompletely and I remember I greatly envied him the huge pile of gold\nand notes that represented his winnings and which we did our very best\nto spend before we left the land of the Prince of Monaco.  However,\nhaving had his first taste of war, Richard felt that he must leave the\npeace and content of Florence to see how the Greeks, with whom he had\nmuch sympathy, were faring with their enemies the Turks.  As it\nhappened, this expedition proved but a short interruption, and in less\nthan a month he was once more back with his new-found friends in\nFlorence.\n\n\nApril 28, 1897\n\nOn the Way to Patras on a Steamer.\n\nDEAR FAMILY:\n\nIt has been a week since I wrote you last, when I sent you the\nInauguration article.  Since then I have been having the best time I\never had any place ALONE.  I have had more fun with a crowd, but never\nhave been so happy by myself.  What I would have been had I taken some\nother chap with me I cannot imagine.  But the people of this part of\nGreece have been so kind that I cannot say I have been alone.  I never\nmet with strangers anywhere who were so hospitable, so confiding and\npolite.  After that slaughter-yard and pest place of Cuba, which is\nmuch more terrible to me now than it was when I was there, or before I\nhad seen that war can be conducted like any other evil of civilization,\nthis opera bouffe warfare is like a duel between two gentlemen in the\nBois.  Cuba is like a slave-holder beating a slave's head in with a\nwhip.  I am a war correspondent only by a great stretch of the\nimagination; I am a peace correspondent really, and all the fighting I\nhave seen was by cannon at long range.  (I was at long range, not the\ncannon.)  I am doing this campaign in a personally conducted sense with\nno regard to the Powers or to the London Times.  I did send them an\narticle called \"The Piping Times of War.\"  If they do not use it I\nshall illustrate it with the photos I have taken and sell it, for five\ntimes the sum they would give, to the Harpers who are ever with us.  As\nI once said in a noted work, \"Greece, Mrs. Morris, restores all your\nlost illusions.\"  For the last week I have been back in the days of\nConrad, the Corsair, and \"Oh, Maid of Athens, ere We Part.\"  I have\nbeen riding over wind-swept hills and mountains topped with snow, and\nwith sheep and goats and wild flowers of every color spreading for\nacres, and in a land where every man dresses by choice like a grand\nopera brigand, and not only for photographic purposes.  I have been on\nthe move all the time, chasing in the rear of armies that turn back as\nsoon as I approach and apologize for disappointing me of a battle, or\nriding to the scene of a battle that never comes off, or hastening to a\nbombardment that turns out to be an attack on an empty fort.\n\nI live on brown bread and cheese and goat's milk and sleep like a log\nin shepherds' huts.  It is so beautiful that I almost grudge the night.\nNora and Mother could take this trip as safely as a regiment and would\nsee things out of fairyland.  And such adventures!  Late in life I am\nat last having adventures and honors heaped upon me.  I was elected a\ncaptain of a band of brigands who had been watching a mountain pass for\na month, and as it showed no signs of running away had taken to dancing\non the green.  I caught them at this innocent pastime and they allowed\nme to photograph them and give them wine at eight cents a quart which\nwe drank out of a tin stovepipe.  They drank about four feet of\nstovepipe or thirty-six cents' worth, then they danced and sang for me\nin a circle, old men and boys, then drilled with their carbines, and I\nshowed them my revolver and field-glasses and themselves in the finder\nof the camera; and when I had to go they took me on their shoulders and\nmarched me around waving their rifles.  Then the old men kissed me on\nthe cheek and we all embraced and they wept, and I felt as badly as\nthough I were parting from fifty friends.  They told my guide that if I\nwould come back they would get fifty more \"as brave as they\" and I\ncould be captain.  I could not begin to tell you all the amusing things\nthat have happened in this one week.  I did not want to come at all,\nonly a stern sense of duty made me.  For I wanted to write the play in\nCharley's gilded halls and get to Paris and London.  But I can never\ncease rejoicing that I took this trip.  And it will make the book, \"A\nYear from a Reporter's Diary,\" as complete as it can be.  That was why\nI came.  Now I have the Coronation of the Czar, the Millennial at\nHungary, the Inauguration at Washington, the Queen's Jubilee, the War\nin Cuba, and the Greco-Turkish War.  That is a good year's work and I\nmean to loaf after it.  You will laugh and say that that is what I\nalways say, but if you knew how I had to kick myself out of Florence\nand the Cascine to come here you would believe me. I want a rest and I\nam cutting this very short.\n\nDon't fail to cut anything Dad and Mother don't like out of the\nInauguration article.  You will have me with you this winter on my\nlittle bicycle and going to dances and not paying board to anyone.\nRemember how I used to threaten to go to Greece when the coffee was not\ngood.  It seems too funny now, for I never was in a better place, or\nhad more fun or saw less of war or the signs of war.\n\nDICK.\n\n\nMay 7, 1897.\n\n10 East Twenty-Eighth Street-NIT\n  Sponitza.\n\nDEAR CHAS.\n\nThis is one of the places out of Phroso, but as you never read Phroso I\nwill cut all that-- I hate to say it so soon again but this is the most\nbeautiful country to travel over I have seen-- It is a fairy theatrical\ngrand opera country where everybody dresses in petticoats and gold\nbraided vests and carry carbines to tend sheep with-- I rode from Santa\nMaura (see map) to a spot opposite Prevesa where they said there was\ngoing to be bombarding-- There was not of course but I had I think the\nmost beautiful ride of my life.  I was absolutely happy--little lambs\nbleated and kids butted each other and peasants in fur cloaks without\nsleeves and in tights like princes sat on rocks and played pipes and\nthe sky was blue, the mountains covered with snow and the fields and\nhills full of purple bushes and yellow and blue flowers and sheep--\nThere was a cable station of yellow adobe.  It was the only building\nand it looked across at Prevesa but nobody bombarded.  The general gave\nme cognac and the cable operator played a guitar for me and the preyor\nsang a fine bass, the corporal not to be out done gave me chocolate and\nthe army stood around in the sun and joined in the conversation\ncorrecting the general and each other and taking off their hats to all\nthe noble sentiments we toasted.  It was just like a comic opera.\nAfter a while when I had finished a fine hunck of cheese and hard eggs\nand brown bread I took a photograph of the General and the cable\noperator and the officer with the bass voice and half of the army-- The\nother half was then sent to escort me to this place.  It walked and I\nrode and there were many halts for drinks and cigarettes.  They all ran\nafter a stray colt and were lost for some time but we re-mobilized and\nadvanced with great effect into this town.  I was here taken in charge\nby at least fifty sailors and as many soldiers and comic opera brigands\nin drawers and white petticoats, who conducted me to a house on the\nhill where the innkeeper brought me a live chicken to approve of for\ndinner.  Then the mayor of the town turned up in gold clothes and\nBarrison Sister skirts and said the General had telegraphed about me\nand that I was his-- The innkeeper wept and said he had seen me first\nand the chorus of soldiers, sailors and brigands all joined in.  I kept\nout of it but I knew the Mayor would win and he did.  Then we went out\nto a man-of-war the size of the Vagabond and were solemnly assured\nthere would be bombarding of Prevesa to-morrow-- I go to sleep in that\nhope.  We leave here at seven crossing the river and ride after the\nGreeks who are approaching Prevesa from the land side while the\nmen-of-war bombard it from the river.  At least that is what they say.\nI think it is the mildest war on both sides I ever heard of and I\ncertainly mean to be a Times correspondent next time I play at going to\nwar-- After being insulted and frightened to death all over Cuba, this\nis the pleasantest picnic I was ever on-- They seriously apologized for\nnot bombarding while I was there and I said not to mention it-- With\nlots of love, old man, and to the family\n\nDICK.\n\n\nFLORENCE\n\nMay 16, 1897.\n\nDEAR FAMILY:\n\nHere I am safe and sound again in the old rooms in Florence.  I was\ngone twenty-three days and was traveling nineteen of them, walking,\nriding; in sailboats, in the cars, and on steamers.  I have had more\nexperiences and adventures than I ever had before in three months and\nquite enough to last me for years.\n\nAfter my happy ride through Turkey and the retreat of the Greek army in\nArta, of which I wrote you last, I have been in Thessaly where I saw\nthe two days' battle of Velestinos from the beginning up to the end.\nIt was the one real battle of the war and the Greeks fought well from\nthe first to the last.  I left Athens on the 29th of April with John\nBass, a Harvard graduate, and a most charming and attractive youth who\nis, or was, in charge of the Journal men; Stephen Crane being among the\nnumber.  He seems a genius with no responsibilities of any sort to\nanyone, and I and Bass left him at Velestinos after traveling with him\nfor four days.  Crane went to Volo, as did every other correspondent,\nleaving Bass and myself in Velestinos.  As the villagers had run away,\nwe burglarized the house of the mayor and made it our habitation while\nthe courier hunted for food.  It was like \"The Swiss Family Robinson,\"\nand we rejoiced over the discovery of soap and tablecloths and stray\nknives and forks, just as though we had been cast on a desert island.\nBass did the cooking and I laid the table and washed up and made the\nbeds, which were full of fleas.  But we had been sleeping on chairs and\non the floor for a week so we did not mind much.\n\nThe second day we were awakened by cannon and you can imagine our joy\nand excitement.  We had it all to ourselves for eight hours, as it took\nthe other correspondents that long to arrive.  It was an artillery and\ninfantry battle and about 20,000 men were engaged on both sides.  The\nGreeks fought from little trenches on the hills back of the town and\nthe Turks advanced across a great green prairie.  It was very long\nrange and only twice did they get to within a quarter of a mile of our\ntrenches.  Bass and I went all over the Greek lines, for you were just\nas safe in one place as in another, which means that it wasn't safe\nanywhere, so we gave up considering that and followed the fight as best\nwe could from the first trench, which was the only one that gave an\nuninterrupted view of the Turkish forces.  It was a brilliantly clear\nday but opened with a hail storm, which enabled the Turks to crawl up\nhalf a mile in the sudden darkness.  It also gave me the worst attack\nof sciatica I ever had.  Fortunately, it did not come on badly until I\nreached Volo, when it suddenly took hold of me so that I could not\nwalk.  The trenches were wet with the rain and we had no clothes to\nchange to, and two more showers kept us more or less wet all day.  We\nhad a fine view of everything and I learned a lot.\n\nWe were under a heavy fire for thirteen hours and certainly had some\nvery close escapes.  At times the firing was so fierce that if you had\nraised your arm above your head, the hand would have been instantly\ntorn off.  We had to lie on our stomachs with our chins in the dirt and\nnot so much as budge.  This was when the Turkish fire happened to be\ndirected on our trench.  At such times all the other trenches would\nfire so as to draw the attack away, and we would have to wait until it\nwas over.  The shells sounded like the jarring sound of telegraph wires\nwhen one hits the pole they hang from with a stone; and when the shells\nwere close they sounded like the noise made by two trains passing in\nopposite directions when the wind is driven between the cars.  The\nbullets were much worse than the shells as you could always hear them\ncoming, and the bullets slipped up and passed you in a sneaking way\nwith a noise like rustling silk, or if some one had torn a silk\nhandkerchief with a sharp pull.  One shell struck three feet from me\nand knocked me over with the dirt and stones and filled my nose and\nmouth with pebbles.  I went back and dug it out of the ground while it\nwas still hot and have it as a souvenir.  I swore terribly at the\nbullets and Bass used to grin in a sickly way.  It made your hair creep\nwhen they came very close.  One man next me got a shot through the\nbreast while he was ramming his cleaner down the barrel, and there were\nthree killed within the limits of our fifty yards.  We could not get\nback because there was a cross fire that swept a place we had to pass\nthrough, just about the way the wind comes around the City Hall in the\ntimes of a blizzard.  We called it Dead Man's Curve, after that at\nFourteenth Street and Union Square, because it was sprinkled with dead\nammunition, mules and soldiers.  We came through it the first time\nwithout knowing what we were getting into and we had no desire to go\nback again.  So we waited until the sun set.  I took some of the finest\nphotographs and probably the only ones ever taken of a battle at such\nclose range.  Whenever the men fired, I would shoot off the camera and\nI expect I have some pretty great pictures.  Bass took some of me so if\nthere is any question as to whether I was at the Coronation, there will\nbe none as to whether I was at Velestinos.\n\nOur house was hit with two shells and bullets fell like the gentle rain\nfrom heaven all over the courtyard, so we would have been no safer\nthere than behind the trenches.  We sent off the first account of the\nbattle written by anybody by midday, and stayed on until the next day\nat four when the place was evacuated in good order because, as usual,\nthe Crown Prince was running away--from Pharsalia this time.\n\nThey say in Greece \"Lewes, the peasant, won the race from Marathon, but\nConstantine the prince, won the race from Larissa.\"\n\nI was all right until I got to Volo when my right leg refused\nabsolutely to do its act and I had to be carried on a donkey.  A Greek\nthought I looked funny sitting groaning on the little donkey; which I\ndid--I looked ridiculous.  So he laughed, and Bass and a French\njournalist batted him over the face and left me clinging to the\ndonkey's neck and howling to them to come back and hold me up.  But\nthey preferred to fight, and a policeman came along and arrested the\nunhappy Greek and beat him over the head, just for luck, and marched\nhim off to jail, just for laughing.\n\nThey took me to the hospital ship which was starting, and I came to\nAthens that way with one hundred and sixteen wounded; the man on my\nright had his ankles gone and the man on the left had a bullet in his\nside.  They groaned all night and so did I.  Then when the sun rose\nthey sang, which was worse.  I never saw anything more beautiful than\nthe red-cross nurses, and I guess that is the most beautiful picture I\nshall ever see--those sweet-faced girls in blue and white bending over\nthe dirty frightened little peasant boys and taking care of their\nwounds.  I made love to all of them and asked three to marry me.  I was\nin bed for two days after I got to Athens but had a fine time, as all\nthe officers from the San Francisco, from the admiral down, came to see\nme, and the minister, consul and the rest did all that could have been\ndone.  I am now all right and was bicycling in the dear old Cascine\nthis morning.  On the whole it was a most successful trip.  Sylvester\nScovel and Phillips of The World arrived just as it was all over, and\nso Bass and I are about the only two Americans who were in it.\n\nThe train from Brindisi stopped at Rome on the way back and I went to\nsee the Pages.  They took me out and showed me Rome by moonlight in one\nhour.  It was like a cinematograph.  They are here now and coming to\ndinner tonight.  Last night the consul had all our friends to dinner to\nwelcome me back, and maybe I was not glad.  I had been living on cheese\nand brown bread and cold lamb for two weeks, with no tobacco, and\nsleeping five hours a night on floors and sofas.  Sometimes the\nofficers and men fought for food, and we never got anything warm to eat\nexcept occasionally tinned things which we cooked in my kit.  It was\nthe most satisfactory trip all round I ever had.  I have been twenty\nyears trying to be in a battle and it will be twenty years more before\nI will want to be in another.\n\nOn the eighteenth I start for London, stopping one day in Paris to see\nthe Clarks and Eustises.  It is going to be bigger than the Coronation\nfor crowds, and Mother need not worry, I shall keep out of it.  The\nMinister to Russia sent me word that the Czar's prime minister has\ngiven him my article and that the Czar said thank him very much.  So\nthat is all right.  Also Hay is to present me to the Prince at the\nlevee on the 31st of May, and I shall send him a copy, too.  I am\nlooking forward to London with such joy.  Tell Mother to send me the\nBookbuyer with her article in it.  I have only read the reviews of it,\nand they are so enthusiastic that I must have the whole thing quick.\nIt was such a fine thing to do about Poe, and to give those other two\nfetishes the coup de grace.  It reads splendidly and I want it all.\nWhat did Dad think of the Inauguration article?  I send you all my\ndearest love and will have lots to tell you when I get back this time.\n\nGod bless you all.\n\nDICK.\n\n\nRichard left Florence the latter part of May, and went to London where\nhe had made arrangements to report the Queen's Jubilee.  He began his\nround of gayeties by being presented at Court.  The Miss Groves and\nMiss Wather to whom he refers in the following letter were the clerks\nat Cox's hotel.\n\n\nLONDON, June 2nd, 1897.\n\nDEAR FAMILY:\n\nI was a beautiful sight at the Levee.  I wore a velvet suit made\nespecially for me but no dearer for that and steel buttons and a\nbeautiful steel sword and a court hat with silver on the side and silk\nstockings that I wore at Moscow and pumps with great buckles.  I was\ntoo magnificent for words and so you would have said.  I waited a long\ntime in a long hall crowded with generals and sea captains and\nhighlanders and volunteers and cavalry men and judges and finally was\nadmitted past a rope and then past another rope and then rushed along\ninto the throne room where I saw beefeaters and life guardsmen and\nchamberlains with white wands and I gave one my card and he read out\n\"R. H. D. of the United States by the American Ambassador\" and then I\nbowed to the Prince and Duke of York, Connaught and Edinburgh and to\nthe American Ambassador and then Henry White and Spencer Eddy, the two\nSecretaries and the naval attache all shook hands with me and I went\naround in a hansom in the bright sunshine in hopes of finding some one\nwho would know me.  But no one did so I went to Cox's Hotel and showed\nmyself to Miss Groves and Miss Wather.  I went on the Terrace yesterday\nwith the Leiters and at O'Connor's invitation brought them to tea.\nLabouchere was there and Dillon just out of jail and it was most\ninteresting.  I am very, very busy doing nothing and having a fine\ntime--\n\nDICK.\n\n\nLONDON, June 21, 1897.\n\nDEAR MOTHER:\n\nWords cannot tell at least not unless I am well paid for it what London\nis like to-day.  In the first place it is so jammed that no one can\nmove and it is hung with decorations so that no one can see.  Royal\ncarriages get stuck just as do the humble drayman or Pickford's Van and\nroyalties are lodging in cheap hotels with nothing but a couple of\nGrenadier's in sentry boxes to show they are any better blooded than\nthe rest of the lodgers.  I also added to the confusion by giving a\nlunch to the Ambassador and Miss Hay in return for the presentation.\nLady Henry and Mrs. Asquith sat on either side of him and Mrs. Clark\nhad Asquith and Lord Basil Blackwood to talk to-- There was also\nAnthony Hope, the beautiful Julia Neilson and her husband Fred Terry\nand Lady Edward Cecil and Lord Lester-- It went off fine and the Savoy\npeople sent in an American Eagle of ice, decorated with American flags\nand dripping icy tears from its beak.  It cost me five shillings a head\nand looked as though it cost that in pounds-- To night I dine with the\nGoulds and then go to a musical where Melba sings, Padewreski plays and\nthen walk the streets if I can until daybreak as I think of making the\nnight before the procession the greater part of the story.  I send you\na plan showing my seat which cost me twenty-five dollars, the\nadvertised price being $125. but there has been a terrible slump in\nseats.  Love to dear Dad and Nora.\n\nDICK.\n\n\n\nLONDON.\n  89 Jermyn Street,\n\nJune 25th, 1897.\n\nDEAR MOTHER:\n\nThe Jubilee turned out to be the easiest spectacle to get at and to get\naway from that I ever witnessed.  Experience in choosing a place and\npolice regulations made it so simple that we went straight to our seats\nand got away again without as much trouble as it would have taken to\nhave gone to a matinee.  The stage management of the thing almost\nimpressed me more than anything else.  For grandeur and show it about\nequalled the procession of the Czar and in many ways it was more\ninteresting because it was concerned with our own people and with our\nown part of the world.  Next to the Queen, Lord Roberts got all of the\napplause.  He rode a little white pony that had been with him in six\ncampaigns and had carried him on his march to Candahar.  It had all the\ncampaign medals presented to it by the War Department and wore them in\na line on its forehead, and walked just as though he knew what a great\noccasion it was.  After Roberts came in popularity a Col. Maurice\nClifford with the Rhodesian Horse in sombrero's and cartridge belts and\nkhaki suits.  He had lost his arm and was easily recognized.  Wilfred\nLaurier the French Premier of Canada and the Lord Mayor were the other\nfavourites.  The scene in front of St. Paul's was absolutely\nmagnificent with the sooty pillars behind the groups of diplomats,\nbishops and choir boys in white, University men in pink silk gowns, and\nsoldiers, beef eaters, gentlemen at arms and the two Archbishops.  The\nbest moment was when the collected troops; negroes, Chinamen, East\nIndians, West Indians, African troopers, Canadian Mounted Police,\nAustralians, Borneo police and English Grenadiers all sang the doxology\ntogether in the beautiful sunshine and under the shadow of that great\nfacade of black and white marble.  Also when the Archbishop of\nCanterbury without any warning suddenly after kissing the Queen's hand\nthrew up his arm and cried out so that you could have heard him a\nhundred yards off \"Three Cheers for Her Majesty\" and the diplomats, and\nforeign rajahs and bishops and Salvation Army captains waved their hats\nand mortar boards and the soldiers ran their bearskins and helmets on\ntheir bayonets and spun them around in the air.  The weather was\nabsolutely perfect and there were no accidents.  Last night the\ncarriages were allowed to parade the streets and for hours the route\nwas blocked with omnibuses hired by private parties, coster carts,\nprivate carriages, court carriages and the hansoms.  The procession\nformed by these was two hours in going one mile.  They passed my\nwindows in Jermyn Street for three hours and a party of us sat inside\nand guyed the life out of them until one in the morning.  We got very\nclever at it finally and very impudent and as the people were only two\nyards from us my windows being on a level with the tops of the buses\nand as we had a flaring illumination that lit up the street completely\nwe had lots of fun with them especially with the busses, as we\npretended to believe that the advertisements referred to the people on\nthe top, and we would ask anxiously which lady was \"Lottie Collins\" and\nwhich gentleman had been brought up on \" Mellin's Food\"-- We had even\nmore fun with the swells coming home from the Gala night at the opera\nand hemmed in between costers and Pickford's vans loaded down with\nwomen and children.\n\nThey called on us for speeches and matches and segars and we kept the\nprocession supplied with food and drink.  Nobody got mad and they\nanswered back but we were prepared with numerous repartees and they\nwere apparently so surprised by finding a party of ladies and gentlemen\nengaged in chaffing court officials that they would forget to reply\nuntil they had moved on.  One bus driver said \"Oh, you can larff, cause\nyour at 'ome.  We are 'unting for Jensen on a North Pole Expedition.\nWe won't be home for three years yet--\" Charley seems very happy and he\ngot a most hearty welcome.  I shall follow him over.  I do not think I\nshall go when he does as that would mean seeing people and getting\nsettled and I must get the Greek war done by the 12th of July and the\nJubilee by the 15th of August.  I know you will not mind, but I have\nbeen terribly interrupted by the Jubilee and by so many visitors.  They\nare running in all the time, so I shall try to get the Greek war\narticle done before I sail and also have a little peaceful view of\nLondon.  I have seen nothing of it really yet.  It has been like living\nin a circus, and moving about on an election night.  I am well as can\nbe except for occasional twinges of sciatica but I have not had to go\nto bed with it and some times it disappears for a week.  A little less\nrain and more sun will stop it.  I hope you do not mind my not\nreturning but we will all be together for many months this Fall and I\nreally feel that I have not had a quiet moment here for pleasure and\nwork.  It has been such a rush.  I do wish to see dear Dad.  I am so\nvery sorry about his being ill, and I hope he is having lots of\nfishing.  Love to all at Marion--and God bless you.\n\nRICHARD.\n\n\nLONDON\n\nJuly 13, 1897.\n\nDEAR MOTHER:\n\nToday Barrie gave a copyright performance of \"The Little Minister\"\nwhich Maude Adams is to play in the States.  It was advertised by a\nsingle bill in front of the Haymarket Theater and the price of\nadmission was five guineas.  We took in fifteen guineas, the audience\nbeing Charley Frohman, Lady Craig and a man.  Cyril Maude played the\nhero and Brandon Thomas and Barrie the two low comedy parts--two\nScotchmen of Thrums.  I started to play one of them, but as I insisted\non making it an aged negro with songs, Barrie and Frohman got\ndiscouraged and let me play the villain, Lord Rintoul, in which\ncharacter I was great.  Maude played his part in five different ways\nand dialects so as to see which he liked best, he said.  It was a bit\nconfusing.  Then one of the actors went up in the gallery and pretended\nto be a journalist critic who had sneaked in, and he abused the play\nand the actors with the exception of the man who played Whamond\n(himself) whom he said he thought showed great promise.  Maude\npretended not to know who he was and it fooled everybody.  Mrs. Barrie\nplayed the gipsy and danced most of the time, which she said was her\nconception of the part as it was in the book.  Her husband explained\nthat this was a play, not a book, but she did not care and danced on\nand off.  She played my daughter, and I had a great scene in which I\ncursed her, which got rounds of applause.  Lady Lewis's daughters in\nbeautiful Paquin dresses played Scotch lassies, and giggled in all the\nsad parts, and one actress who had made a great success as one of the\n\"Two Vagabonds\" made everybody weep by really trying to act.  At one\ntime there were five men on the stage all talking Scotch dialect and\nimitating Irving at the same time.  It was a truly remarkable\nperformance.  Ethel Barrymore goes back on Saturday with Drew to play a\nFrench maid in \"A Marriage of Convenience.\"  She is announced to be\nengaged to Hope, I see by the papers.  They are not engaged, of course,\nbut the papers love to make matches.  Look for me as sailing either on\nthe 31st on the St. Louis or a week later.  With lots and lots of love.\n\nDICK.\n\n\nIn the late summer Richard returned to Marion and from there went to\nNew York.  However, at this time, the lure of England was very strong\nwith my brother, and early December found him back in London.\n\n\nLONDON, December 29th, 1897.\n\nDEAR MOTHER:--\n\nI had a most exciting Christmas, most of which I spent in Whitechapel\nin the London Hospital.  I lunched with the Spenders and then went down\nwith them carrying large packages for distribution to the sick.  I\nexpected to be terribly bored, but thought I would feel so virtuous\nthat I would the better enjoy my dinner which I had promised to take\nwith the McCarthys-- On the contrary, I had the most amusing time and\nmuch more fun than I had later.  The patients seemed only to be playing\nsick, and some of them were very humorous and others very pathetic and\nI played tin soldiers with some, and distributed rich gifts, other\npeople had paid for, with a lavish hand.  I also sat on a little girl's\ncot and played dolls for an hour.  She had something wrong with her\nspine and I wept most of the time, chiefly because she smiled all the\ntime.  She went asleep holding on to my middle finger like the baby in\n\"The Luck of Roaring Camp.\"  There were eighty babies in red flannel\nnightgowns buttoned up the back who had pillow fights in honor of the\nday and took turns in playing on a barrel organ, those that were strong\nand tall enough.  In the next ward another baby in white was dying--\nIts mother was a coster girl, seventeen years old, with a big hat and\nplumes like those the flower girls wear at Piccadilly Circus.  The baby\nwas yellow like old ivory and its teeth and gums were blue and it died\nwhile we were watching it.  The mother girl was drinking tea and crying\ninto it out of red swollen eyes, and twenty feet off one of the red\nnightgowned kids was playing \"Louisiana Lou\" on the barrel organ.  The\nnurse put the baby's arms under the sheets and then pulled one up over\nits face and took the teacup away from the mother who didn't see what\nhad happened and I came away while three young nurses were comforting\nthe girl.  Most of the nurses were very beautiful, and I neglected my\nduties as Santa Claus to talk to them.  They would stop talking to get\ndown on their knees and dust up the floor, which was most embarrassing,\nyou couldn't very well ask to be let to help.  There was one coster who\nhad his broken leg in a cage which moved with the leg no matter how\nmuch he tossed.  He was like the man \"who sat in jail without his\nboots, admiring how the world was made,\" he spent all his waking hours\nin wrapt admiration of the cage-- He said to me \"I've been here a\nfortnight now, come Monday, and I can't break my leg no how.  Yer can't\ndo it, that's all-- Yer can twist, and kick, and toss, and it don't do\nno good.  Yer jest can't do it-- Now you take notice.\"  Then he would\nkick violently and the cage would run around on trolleys and keep the\nbroken limb straight.  \"See!\" he would exclaim, \"Wot did I tell you--\nIts no use of trying, yer just can't do it.  'ere I've been ten days a\ntrying and it can't be done.\"\n\nWe had a very fine Christmas dinner just Ethel, the McCarthy's and I.\nFanny, tell Charles, brought in the plum pudding with a sprig of holly\nin it and blazing, and after dinner I read them the Jackall-- About\neleven I started to take Ethel to Miss Terry's, who lives miles beyond\nKensington.  There was a light fog.  I said that all sorts of things\nought to happen in a fog but that no one ever did have adventures\nnowadays.  At that we rode straight into a bank of fog that makes those\non the fishing banks look like Spring sunshine.  You could not see the\nhouses, nor the street, nor the horse, not even his tail.  All you\ncould see were gas jets, but not the iron that supported them.  The\ncabman discovered the fact that he was lost and turned around in\ncircles and the horse slipped on the asphalt which was thick with\nfrost, and then we backed into lamp-posts and curbs until Ethel got so\nscared she bit her under lip until it bled.  You could not tell whether\nyou were going into a house or over a precipice or into a sea.  The\nhorse finally backed up a flight of steps, and rubbed the cabby against\na front door, and jabbed the wheels into an area railing and fell down.\nThat, I thought, was our cue to get out, so we slipped into a well of\nyellow mist and felt around for each 'other until a square block of\nlight suddenly opened in mid air and four terrified women appeared in\nthe doorway of the house through which the cabman was endeavoring to\nbutt himself.  They begged us to come in, and we did-- Being Christmas\nand because the McCarthy's always call me \"King\" I had put on all my\ndecorations and the tin star and I also wore my beautiful fur coat, to\nwhich I have treated myself, and a grand good thing it is, too-- I took\nthis off because the room was very hot, forgetting about the\ndecorations and remarked in the same time to Ethel that it would be\nfolly to try and get to Barkston Gardens, and that we must go back to\nthe \"Duchess's\" for the night.  At this Ethel answered calmly \"yes,\nDuke,\" and I became conscious of the fact that the eyes of the four\nwomen were riveted on my fur coat and decorations.  At the word \"Duke\"\ndelivered by a very pretty girl in an evening frock and with nothing on\nher hair the four women disappeared and brought back the children, the\nservants, and the men, who were so overcome with awe and excitement and\nChristmas cheer that they all but got down on their knees in a circle.\nSo, we fled out into the night followed by minute directions as to\nwhere \"Your Grace\" and \"Your Ladyship\" should turn.  For years, no\ndoubt, on a Christmas Day the story will be told in that house,\nwherever it may be in the millions of other houses of London, how a\nbeautiful Countess and a wicked Duke were pitched into their front door\nout of a hansom cab, and after having partaken of their Christmas\nsupper, disappeared again into a sea of fog.  The only direction Ethel\nand I could remember was that we were to go to the right when we came\nto a Church, so when by feeling our way by the walls we finally reached\na church we continued going on around it until we had encircled it five\ntimes or it had encircled us, we were not sure which.  After the fifth\nlap we gave up and sat down on the steps.  Ethel had on low slippers\nand was shivering and coughing but intensely amused and only scared for\nfear she would lose her voice for the first night of \"Peter\"-- We could\nhear voices sometimes, like people talking in a dream, and sometimes\nthe sound of dance music, and a man's voice calling \"Perlice\" in a\ndiscouraged way as if he didn't much care whether the police came or\nnot, but regularly like a fog siren-- I don't know how long we sat\nthere or how long we might have sat there had not a man with a bicycle\nlamp loomed up out of the mist and rescued us.  He had his mother with\nhim and she said with great pride that her boy could find his way\nanywhere.  So, we clung to her boy and followed.  A cabman passed\nleading his horse with one of his lamps in his other hand and I turned\nfor an instant to speak to him and Ethel and her friends disappeared\nexactly as though the earth had opened.  So, I yelled after them, and\nEthel said \"Here, I am,\" at my elbow.  It was like the chesire cat that\nkept appearing and disappearing until he made Alice dizzy.  We finally\nfound a link-boy and he finally found the McCarthy's house, and I left\nthem giving Ethel quinine and whiskey.  They wanted me to stay, but I\ncould not face dressing, in the morning.  So I felt my way home and\nonly got lost twice.  The Arch on Constitution Hill gave me much\ntrouble.  I thought it was the Marble Arch, and hence-- In Jermyn\nStreet I saw two lamps burning dimly and a voice said, hearing my\nfootsteps \"where am I?  I don't know where I am no more than nothing--\"\nI told him he was in Jermyn Street with his horse's head about twenty\nfeet from St. James-- There was a long dramatic silence and then the\nvoice said-- \"Well, I be blowed I thought I was in Pimlico!!!\"\n\nThis has been such a long letter that I shall have to skip any more.  I\nhave NO sciatica chiefly because of the fur coat, I think, and I got\ntwo Christmas presents, one from Margaret Fraser and one from the\nDuchess of Sutherland-- Boxing Day I took Margaret to the matinee of\nthe Pantomine and it lasted five hours, until six twenty, then I\ndressed and dined with the Hay's and went with them to the Barnum\ncircus which began at eight and lasted until twelve.  It was a busy day.\n\nLots of love.\n\nDICK.\n\n\n\nLONDON, March 20, 1898.\n\nDEAR MOTHER:\n\nThe Nellie Farren benefit was the finest thing I have seen this year\npast.  It was more remarkable than the Coronation, or the Jubilee.  It\nbegan at twelve o'clock on Thursday, but at ten o'clock Wednesday\nnight, the crowd began to gather around Drury Lane, and spent the night\non the sidewalk playing cards and reading and sleeping.  Ten hours\nlater they were admitted, or a few of them were, as many as the\ngalleries would hold.  Arthur Collins, the manager of the Drury Lane\nand the man who organized the benefit, could not get a stall for his\nmother the day before the benefit.  They were then not to be had, the\nlast having sold for twelve guineas.  I got TWO the morning of the\nbenefit for three pounds each, and now people believe that I did get\ninto the Coronation! The people who had stalls got there at ten\no'clock, and the streets were blocked for \"blocks\" up to Covent Garden\nwith hansoms and royal carriages and holders of tickets at fifty\ndollars apiece.  It lasted six hours and brought in thirty thousand\ndollars.  Kate Vaughan came back and danced after an absence from the\nstage of twelve years.  Irving recited The Dream of Eugene Aram, Terry\nplayed Ophelia, Chevalier sang Mrs. Hawkins, Dan Leno gave Hamlet,\nMarie Tempest sang The Jewel of Asia and Hayden Coffin sang Tommy\nAtkins, the audience of three thousand people joining in the chorus,\nand for an encore singing \"Oh, Nellie, Nellie Farren, may your love be\never faithful, may your pals be ever true, so God bless you Nellie\nFarren, here's the best of luck to you.\"  In Trial by Jury, Gilbert\nplayed an associate judge; the barristers were all playwrights, the\njury the principal comedians, the chorus girls were real chorus girls\nfrom the Gaiety mixed in with leading ladies like Miss Jeffries and\nMiss Hanbury, who could not keep in step.  But the best part of it was\nthe pantomime.  Ellaline came up a trap with a diamond dress and her\nhair down her back and electric lights all over her, and said, \"I am\nthe Fairy Queen,\" and waved her wand, at which the \"First Boy\" in the\npantomime said, \"Go long, now, do, we know your tricks, you're Ellaline\nTerriss\"; and the clown said, \"You're wrong, she's not, she's Mrs.\nSeymour Hicks.\"  Then Letty Lind came on as Columbine in black tulle,\nand Arthur Roberts as the policeman, and Eddy Payne as the clown and\nStorey as Pantaloon.\n\nThe rest of it brought on everybody.  Sam Sothern played a \"swell\" and\nstole a fish.  Louis Freear, a housemaid, and all the leading men\nappeared as policemen.  No one had more than a line to speak which just\ngave the audience time to recognize him or her.  The composers and\norchestra leaders came on as a German band, each playing an instrument,\nand they got half through the Washington Post before the policemen beat\nthem off.  Then Marie Lloyd and all the Music Hall stars appeared as\nstreet girls and danced to the music of a hand-organ.  Hayden Coffin,\nPlunkett Greene and Ben Davies sang as street musicians and the clown\nbeat them with stuffed bricks.  After that there was a revue of all the\nburlesques and comic operas, then the curtain was raised from the\nmiddle of the stage, and Nellie Farren was discovered seated at a table\non a high stage with all the \"legitimates\" in frock-coats and walking\ndresses rising on benches around her.\n\nThe set was a beautiful wood scene well lighted.  Wyndham stood on one\nside of her, and he said the yell that went up when the curtain rose\nwas worse than the rebel yell he had heard in battles.  In front of\nher, below the stage, were all the people who had taken part in the\nrevue, forming a most interesting picture.  There was no one in the\ngroup who had not been known for a year by posters or photographs:\nLetty Lind as the Geisha, Arthur Roberts as Dandy Dan.  The French Girl\nand all the officers from The Geisha, the ballet girls from the\npantomime, the bareback-riders from The Circus Girl; the Empire\ncostumes and the monks from La Poupee, and all the Chinese and Japanese\ncostumes from The Geisha.  Everybody on the stage cried and all the old\nrounders in the boxes cried.\n\nIt was really a wonderfully dramatic spectacle to see the clown and\nofficers and Geisha girls weeping down their grease paint.  Nellie\nFarren's great song was one about a street Arab with the words:  \"Let\nme hold your, nag, sir, carry your little bag, sir, anything you please\nto give--thank'ee, sir!\"  She used to close her hand, then open it and\nlook at the palm, then touch her cap with a very wonderful smile, and\nlaugh when she said, \"Thank'ee, sir!\"  This song was reproduced for\nweeks before the benefit, and played all over London, and when the\ncurtain rose on her, the orchestra struck into it and the people\nshouted as though it was the national anthem.  Wyndham made a very good\naddress and so did Terry, then Wyndham said he would try to get her to\nspeak.  She has lost the use of her hands and legs and can only walk\nwith crutches, so he put his arm around her and her son lifted her from\nthe other side and then brought her to her feet, both crying like\nchildren.  You could hear the people sobbing, it was so still.  She\nsaid, \"Ladies and Gentleman,\" looking at the stalls and boxes, then she\nturned her head to the people on the stage below her and said,\n\"Brothers and Sisters,\" then she stood looking for a long time at the\ngallery gods who had been waiting there twenty hours.  You could hear a\nlong \"Ah\" from the gallery when she looked up there, and then a \"hush\"\nfrom all over it and there was absolute silence.  Then she smiled and\nraised her finger to her bonnet and said, \"Thank'ee, sir,\" and sank\nback in her chair.  It was the most dramatic thing I ever saw on a\nstage.  The orchestra struck up \"Auld Lang Syne\" and they gave three\ncheers on the stage and in the house.  The papers got out special\neditions, and said it was the greatest theatrical event there had ever\nbeen in London.\n\nDICK.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XI\n\nTHE SPANISH-AMERICAN WAR\n\nWhen the news reached Richard that the Spanish-American War seemed\ninevitable he returned at once to New York.  Here he spent a few days\nin arranging to act as correspondent for the New York Herald, the\nLondon Times, and Scribner's Magazine, and then started for Key West.\n\n\nOff Key West--April 24th, 1898.\n  On Board Smith, Herald Yacht.\n\nDEAR MOTHER:\n\nI wrote you such a cross gloomy letter that I must drop you another to\nmake up for it.  Since I wrote that an hour ago we have received word\nthat war is declared and I am now on board the Smith.  She is a really\nfine vessel as big as Benedict's yacht with plenty of deck room and big\nbunks.  I have everything I want on board and The Herald men are two\nold Press men so we are good friends.  If I had had another hour I\nbelieve I could have got a berth on the flag ship for Roosevelt\ntelegraphed me the longest and strongest letter on the subject a man\ncould write instructing the Admiral to take me on as I was writing\nhistory.  Chadwick seemed willing but then the signal to set sail came\nand we had to stampede.  All the ships have their sailing pennants up.\nIt is as calm as a mirror thank goodness but as hot as hell.  We expect\nto be off Havana tomorrow at sunset.  Then what we do no one knows.\nThe crew is on strike above and the mate is wrestling with them but as\nit seems to be only a question of a few dollars it will come out all\nright.  We expect to be back here on Sunday but may stay out later.\nDon't worry if you don't hear.  It is grand to see the line of\nbattleships five miles out like dogs in a leash puffing and straining.\nThank God they'll let them slip any minute now.  I don't know where\n\"Stenie\" is.  I am now going to take a nap while the smooth water lasts.\n\nDICK.\n\n\n--Flagship New York--\n\nOff Havana,\n\nApril 26, 1898.\n\nDEAR FAMILY:\n\nI left Key West on the morning of the 24th in the Dolphin with the idea\nof trying to get on board the flagship on the strength of Roosevelt's\nletter.  Stenie Bonsal got on just before she sailed, not as a\ncorrespondent, but as a magazine-writer for McClure's, who have given\nhim a commission, and because he could act as interpreter.  I left the\nflagship the morning of the day I arrived.  The captain of the Dolphin\napologized to his officers while we were at anchor in the harbor of Key\nWest, because his was a \"cabin\" and not a \"gun\" ship, and because he\nhad to deliver the mails at once on board the flagship and not turn out\nof his course for anything, no matter how tempting a prize it might\nappear to be.  He then proceeded to chase every sail and column of\nsmoke on the horizon, so that the course was like a cat's cradle.  We\nfirst headed for a big steamer and sounded \"general quarters.\"  It was\nfine to see the faces of the apprentices as they ran to get their\ncutlasses and revolvers, their eyes open and their hair on end, with\nthe hope that they were to board a Spanish battleship.  But at the\nfirst gun she ran up an American flag, and on getting nearer we saw she\nwas a Mallory steamer.  An hour later we chased another steamer, but\nshe was already a prize, with a prize crew on board.  Then we had a\nchase for three hours at night; after what we believed was the Panama,\nbut she ran away from us.  We fired three shells after her, and she\nstill ran and got away.  The next morning I went on board the New York\nwith Zogbaum, the artist.  Admiral Sampson is a fine man; he impressed\nme very much.  He was very much bothered at the order forbidding\ncorrespondents on the ship, but I talked like a father to him, and he\nfinally gave in, and was very nice about the way he did it.  Since then\nI have had the most interesting time and the most novel experience of\nmy life.  We have been lying from three to ten miles off shore.  We can\nsee Morro Castle and houses and palms plainly without a glass, and with\none we can distinguish men and women in the villages.  It is, or was,\nfrightfully hot, and you had to keep moving all the time to get out of\nthe sun.  I mess with the officers, but the other correspondents, the\nAssociated Press and Ralph Paine of The World and Press of\nPhiladelphia, with the middies.  Paine got on because Scovel of The\nWorld has done so much secret service work for the admiral, running in\nat night and taking soundings, and by day making photographs of the\ncoast, also carrying messages to the insurgents.\n\nIt is a wonderful ship, like a village, and as big as the Paris.  We\ndrift around in the sun or the moonlight, and when we see a light,\nchase after it.  There is a band on board that plays twice a day.  It\nis like a luxurious yacht, with none of the ennui of a yacht.  The\nother night, when we were heading off a steamer and firing six-pounders\nacross her bows, the band was playing the \"star\" song from the\nMeistersinger.  Wagner and War struck me as the most fin de siecle idea\nof war that I had ever heard of.  The nights have been perfectly\nbeautiful, full of moonlight, when we sit on deck and smoke.  It is\nlike looking down from the roof of a high building.  Yesterday they\nbrought a Spanish officer on board, he had been picked up in a schooner\nwith his orderly.  I was in Captain Chadwick's cabin when he was\nbrought in, and Scovel interpreted for the captain, who was more\ncourteous than any Spanish Don that breathes.  The officer said he had\nbeen on his way to see his wife and newly born baby at Matanzas, and\nhad no knowledge that war had been declared.  I must say it did me good\nto see him.  I remembered the way the Spanish officers used to insult\nme in a language which I, fortunately for me, could not understand, and\nhow I hated the sight of them, and I enjoyed seeing his red and yellow\ncockade on the table before me, while I sat in a big armchair and\nsmoked and was in hearing of the marines drilling on the upper deck.\nHe was invited to go to breakfast with the officers, and I sat next to\nhim, and as it happened to be my turn to treat, I had the satisfaction\nof pouring drinks down his throat.  I told stories about Spanish\nofficers all the time to the rest of the mess, pretending I was telling\nthem something else by making drawings on the tablecloth, so that the\nunhappy officer on his other side, who was talking Spanish to him, had\na hard time not to laugh.  I told Zogbaum he ought to draw a picture of\nhim at the mess to show how we treated prisoners, and a companion one\nof the captain of the Compeliton, who came over with us on the Dolphin,\nand who showed us the marks of the ropes on his wrists and arms the\nSpaniards had bound him with when he was in Cabanas for nine months.\nThe orderly messed with the bluejackets, who treated him in the most\nhospitable manner.  He was a poor little peasant boy, half starved and\nhollow-eyed, and so scared that he could hardly stand, but they took\ngreat pride in the fact that they had made him eat three times of\neverything.  They are, without prejudice, the finest body of men and\nboys you would care to see, and as humorous and polite and keen as any\nclass of men I ever met.\n\nThe war could be ended in a month so far as the island of Cuba is\nconcerned, if the troops were ready and brought over here.  The coast\nto Havana for ten miles is broad enough for them to march along it, and\nthe heights above could be covered the entire time by the fleet, so\nthat it would be absolutely impossible for any force to withstand the\nawful hailstorm they would play on it.  Transports carrying the\nprovisions would be protected by the ships on the gulf side, and the\nguns at Morro could be shut up in twenty-four hours.  This is not a\ndream, but the most obvious and feasible plan, and it is a disgrace if\nthe Washington politicians delay.  As to health, this is the healthiest\npart of the coast.  The trade winds blow every day of the year, and the\nfever talk is all nonsense.  The army certainly has delayed most\nscandalously in mobilizing.  This talk of waiting a month is suicide.\nIt is a terrible expense.  It keeps the people on a strain, destroys\nbusiness, and the health of the troops at Tampa is, to my mind, in much\ngreater danger than it would be on the hills around Havana, where, as\nScovel says, there is as much yellow fever as there is snow.  Tell Dad\nto urge them to act promptly.  In the meanwhile I am having a\nmagnificent time.  I am burned and hungry and losing about a ton of fat\na day, and I sleep finely.  The other night the Porter held us up, but\nit was a story that never got into the papers.  I haven't missed a\ntrick so far except not getting on the flagship from the first, but\nthat does not count now since I am on board.\n\nI haven't written anything yet, but I am going to begin soon.  I expect\nto make myself rich on this campaign.  I get ten cents a word from\nScribner's for everything I send them, if it is only a thousand words,\nand I get four hundred dollars a week salary from The Times, and all my\nexpenses.  I haven't had any yet, but when I go back and join the army,\nI am going to travel en suite with an assistant and the best and\ngentlest ponies; a courier and a servant, a tent and a secretary and a\ntypewriter, so that Miles will look like a second lieutenant.\n\nWhen I came out here on the Dolphin I said I was going to Tampa, lying\njust on the principle that it is no other newspaper-man's business\nwhere you are going.  So, The Herald man at Key West, hearing this, and\nnot knowing I WAS GOING TO THE FLAGSHIP, called Long, making a strong\nkick about the correspondents, Bonsal, Remington and Paine, who are, or\nwere, with the squadron.  Stenie left two days ago, hoping to get a\ncommission on the staff of General Lee.  So yesterday Scovel told me\nLong had cabled in answer to The Herald's protests to the admiral as\nfollows:  \"Complaints have been received that correspondents Paine,\nRemington and Bonsal are with the squadron.  Send them ashore at once.\nThere must be no favoritism.\"\n\nScovel got the admiral at once to cable Long on his behalf because of\nhis services as a spy, but as Roosevelt had done so much for me, I\nwould not appeal over him, and this morning I sent in word to the\nadmiral that I was leaving the ship and would like to pay my respects.\nSampson is a thin man with a gray beard.  He looks like a college\nprofessor and has very fine, gentle eyes.  He asked me why I meant to\nleave the ship, and I said I had heard one of the torpedo boats was\ngoing to Key West, and I thought I would go with her if he would allow\nit.  He asked if I had seen the cable from Long, and I said I had heard\nof it, and that I was really going so as not to embarrass him with my\npresence.  He said, \"I have received three different orders from the\nSecretary, one of them telling me I could have such correspondents on\nboard as were agreeable to me.  He now tells me that they must all go.\nYou can do as you wish.  You are perfectly welcome to remain until the\nconflict of orders is cleared up.\"  I saw he was mad and that he wanted\nme to stay, or at least not to go of my own wish, so that he could have\na grievance out of it--if he had to send me away after having been told\nhe could have those with him who were agreeable to him.  Captain\nChadwick was in the cabin, and said, \"Perhaps Mr. Davis had better\nremain another twenty-four hours.\"  The admiral added, \"Ships are going\nto Key West daily.\"  Then Chadwick repeated that he thought I had\nbetter stay another day, and made a motion to me to do so.  So I said I\nwould, and now I am waiting to see what is going to happen.  Outside,\nChadwick told me that something in the way of an experience would\nprobably come off, so I have hopes.  By this time, of course, you know\nall about it.  I shall finish this later.\n\nWe began bombarding Matanzas twenty minutes after I wrote the above.\nIt was great.  I guess I got a beat, as The Herald tug is the only one\nin sight.\n\nDICK.\n\n\nFlagship--Off Havana\n\nApril 30th, 1898.\n\nDEAR FAMILY:\n\nYou must not mind if I don't write often, but I feel that you see The\nHerald every day and that tells you of what I am seeing and doing, and\nI am writing so much, and what with keeping notes and all, I haven't\nmuch time-- What you probably want to know is that I am well and that\nmy sciatica is not troubling me at all--Mother always wants to know\nthat.  On the other hand I am on the best ship from which to see things\nand on the safest, as she can move quicker and is more heavily armored\nthan any save the battleships-- The fact that the admiral is on board\nand that she is the flagship is also a guarantee that she will not be\nallowed to expose herself.  I was very badly scared when I first came\nto Key West for fear I should be left especially when I didn't make the\nflagship-- But I have not missed a single trick so far-- Bonsal missed\nthe bombardment and so did Stephen Crane-- All the press boats were\naway except The Herald's.  I had to write the story in fifteen minutes,\nso it was no good except that we had it exclusively--\n\nI am sending a short story of the first shot fired to the Scribner's\nand am arranging with them to bring out a book on the Campaign.  I have\nasked them to announce it as it will help me immensely here for it is\nas an historian and not as a correspondent that I get on over those men\nwho are correspondents for papers only.  I have made I think my\nposition here very strong and the admiral is very much my friend as are\nalso his staff.  Crane on the other hand took the place of Paine who\nwas exceedingly popular with every one and it has made it hard for\nCrane to get into things-- I am having a really royal time, it is so\nbeautiful by both night and day and there is always color and movement\nand the most rigid discipline with the most hearty good feeling-- I get\non very well with the crew too, one of them got shot by a revolver's\ngoing off and I asked the surgeon if I might not help at the operation\nso that I might learn to be useful, and to get accustomed to the sight\nof wounds and surgery-- It was a wonderful thing to see, and I was\nconfused as to whether I admired the human body more or the way the\nsurgeon's understood and mastered it-- The sailor would not give way to\nthe ether and I had to hold him for an hour while they took out his\nwhole insides and laid them on the table and felt around inside of him\nas though he were a hollow watermelon.  Then they put his stomach back\nand sewed it in and then sewed up his skin and he was just as good as\nnew.  We carried him over to a cot and he came to, and looked up at us.\nWe were all bare-armed and covered with his blood, and then over at the\noperating table, which was also covered with his blood.  He was gray\nunder his tan and his lips were purple and his eyes were still drunk\nwith the ether-- But he looked at our sanguinary hands and shook his\nhead sideways on the pillow and smiled-- \"You'se can't kill me,\" he\nsaid, \"I'm a New Yorker, by God--you'se can't kill me.\" The Herald\ncabled for a story as to how the crew of the New York behaved in\naction.  I think I shall send them that although there are a few things\nthe people had better take for granted-- Of course, we haven't been \"in\naction\" yet but the first bombardment made me nervous until it got well\nstarted.  I think every one was rather nervous and it was chiefly to\nshow them there was nothing to worry about that we fired off the U. S.\nguns.  They talk like veterans now-- It was much less of a strain than\nI had expected, there was no standing on your toes nor keeping your\nmouth open or putting wadding in your ears.  I took photographs most of\nthe time, and they ought to be excellent--what happened was that you\nwere thrown up off the deck just as you are when an elevator starts\nwith a sharp jerk and there was an awful noise like the worst clap of\nthunder you ever heard close to your ears, then the smoke covered\neverything and you could hear the shot going through the air like a\ngiant rocket-- The shots they fired at us did not cut any ice except a\nshrapnel that broke just over the main mast and which reminded me of\nGreece-- The other shots fell short-- The best thing was to see the\nCaptains of the Puritan and Cincinnati frantically signalling to be\nallowed to fire too-- A little fort had opened on us from the left so\nthey plugged at that, it was a wonderful sight, the Monitor was swept\nwith waves and the guns seemed to come out of the water.  The\nCincinnati did the best of all.  Her guns were as fast as the reports\nof a revolver, a self-cocking revolver, when one holds the trigger for\nthe whole six.  We got some copies of The Lucha on the Panama and their\naccounts of what was going on in Havana were the best reading I ever\nsaw-- They probably reported the Matanzas bombardment as a Spanish\nvictory-- The firing yesterday was very tame.  We all sat about on deck\nand the band played all the time-- We didn't even send the men to\nquarters-- I do not believe the army intends to move for two weeks yet,\nso I shall stay here.  They seem to want me to do so, and I certainly\nwant to-- But that army is too slow for words, and we love the \"Notes\nfrom the Front\" in The Tribune, telling about the troops at\nChickamauga-- I believe what will happen is that a chance shot will\nkill some of our men, and the Admiral won't do a thing but knock hell\nout of whatever fort does it and land a party of marines and\nbluejackets-- Even if they only occupy the place for 24 hours, it will\nbeat that army out and that's what I want.  They'll get second money in\nthe Campaign if they get any, unless they brace up and come over-- I\nhave the very luck of the British Army, I walked into an open hatch\ntoday and didn't stop until I caught by my arms and the back of my\nneck.  It was very dark and they had opened it while I was in a cabin.\nThe Jackie whose business it was to watch it was worse scared than I\nwas, and I looked up at him while still hanging to the edges with my\nneck and arms and said \"why didn't you tell me?\"  He shook his head and\nsaid, \"that's so, Sir, I certainly should have told you, I certainly\nshould\"-- They're exactly like children and the reason is, I think,\nbecause they are so shut off from the contamination of the world.  One\nof these ships is like living in a monastery, and they are as\ndisciplined and gentle as monks, and as reckless as cowboys.  When I go\nforward and speak to one of them they all gather round and sit on the\ndeck in circles and we talk and they listen and make the most\ninteresting comments-- The middy who fired the first gun at Matanzas is\na modest alert boy about 18 years old and crazy about his work-- So,\nthe Captain selected him for the honor and also because there is such\njealousy between the bow and stern guns that he decided not to risk\nfeelings being hurt by giving it to either-- So, Boone who was at\nAnnapolis a month ago was told to fire the shot-- We all took his name\nand he has grown about three inches.  We told him all of the United\nStates and England would be ringing with his name-- When I was alone he\ncame and sat down on a gull beside me and told me he was very glad they\nhad let him fire that first gun because his mother was an invalid and\nhe had gone into the navy against her wish and he hoped now that she\nwould be satisfied when she saw his name in the papers.  He was too\nsweet and boyish about it for words and I am going to take a snapshot\nat him and put his picture in Scribner's--\"he only stands about so\nhigh--\"\n\nDICK.\n\nI enclose a souvenir of the bombardment.  Please keep it carefully for\nme-- It was the first shot \"in anger\" in thirty years.\n\n\nTAMPA, May 3rd, 1898.\n\nDEAR NORA:\n\nWe are still here and probably will be.  It is a merry war, if there\nwere only some girls here the place would be perfect.  I don't know\nwhat's the matter with the American girl--here am I--and Stenie and\nWillie Chanler and Frederick Remington and all the boy officers of the\narmy and not one solitary, ugly, plain, pretty, or beautiful girl.  I\nbought a fine pony to-day, her name was Ellaline but I thought that was\ntoo much glory for Ellaline so I diffused it over the whole company by\nre-christening her Gaiety Girl, because she is so quiet, all the Gaiety\nGirls I know are quiet.\n\nShe never does what I tell her anyway, so it doesn't matter what I call\nher.  But when this cruel war is over ($6 a day with bath room\nadjoining) I am going to have an oil painting of her labelled \"Gaiety\nGirl the Kentucky Mare that carried the news of the fall of Havana to\nMatanzas, fifty miles under fire and Richard Harding Davis.\"  To-morrow\nI am going to buy a saddle and a servant.  War is a cruel thing\nespecially to army officers.  They have to wear uniforms and are not\nallowed to take off their trousers to keep cool-- They take off\neverything else except their hats and sit in the dining room without\ntheir coats or collars-- That's because it is war time.  They are\nterrible brave--you can see it by the way they wear bouquets on their\ntunics and cigarette badges and Cuban flags and by not saluting their\nofficers.  One General counted today and forty enlisted men passed him\nwithout saluting.  The army will have to do a lot of fighting to make\nitself solid with me.  They are mounted police.  We have a sentry here,\nhe sits in a rocking chair.  Imagine one of Sampson's or Dewey's\nbluejackets sitting down even on a gun carriage.  Wait till I write my\nbook.  I wouldn't say a word now but when I write that book I'll give\nthem large space rates.  I am writing it now, the first batch comes out\nin Scribner's in July.\n\nto you all.\n\nDICK.\n\n\nDuring the early days of the war, Richard received the appointment of a\ncaptaincy, but on the advice of his friends that his services were more\nvaluable as a correspondent, he refused the commission.  The following\nletter shows that at least at the time my brother regretted the\ndecision, but as events turned out he succeeded in rendering splendid\nservice not only as a correspondent but in the field.\n\n\nTAMPA--May 14, 1898.\n\nDEAR CHAS.\n\nOn reflection I am greatly troubled that I declined the captaincy.  It\nis unfortunate that I had not time to consider it.  We shall not have\nanother war and I can always be a war correspondent in other countries\nbut never again have a chance to serve in my own.  The people here\nthink it was the right thing to do but the outside people won't.  Not\nthat I care about that, but I think I was weak not to chance it.  I\ndon't know exactly what I ought to do.  When I see all these kid\nmilitia men enlisted it makes me feel like the devil.  I've no doubt\nmany of them look upon it as a sort of a holiday and an outing and like\nit for the excitement, but it would bore me to death.  The whole thing\nwould bore me if I thought I had to keep at it for a year or more.\nThat is the fault of my having had too much excitement and freedom.  It\nspoils me to make sacrifices that other men can make.  Whichever way it\ncomes out I shall be sorry and feel I did not do the right thing.\nLying around this hotel is enough to demoralize anybody.  We are much\nmore out of it than you are, and one gets cynical and loses interest.\nOn the other hand I would be miserable to go back and have done\nnothing.  It is a question of character entirely and I don't feel I've\nplayed the part at all.  It's all very well to say you are doing more\nby writing, but are you?  It's an easy game to look on and pat the\nother chaps on the back with a few paragraphs, that is cheap\npatriotism.  They're taking chances and you're not and when the war's\nover they'll be happy and I won't.  The man that enlists or volunteers\neven if he doesn't get further than Chickamauga or Gretna Green and the\nman who doesn't enlist at all but minds his own business is much better\noff than I will be writing about what other men do and not doing it\nmyself, especially as I had a chance of a life time, and declined it.\nI'll always feel I lost in character by not sticking to it whether I\nhad to go to Arizona or Governor's Island.  I was unfortunate in having\nLee and Remington to advise me.  We talked for two hours in Fred's\nbedroom and they were both dead against it and Lee composed my telegram\nto the president.  Now, I feel sure I did wrong.  Shafter did not care\nand the other officers were delighted and said it was very honorable\nand manly giving me credit for motives I didn't have.  I just didn't\nthink it was good enough although I wanted it too and I missed\nsomething I can never get again.  I am very sad about it.  I know all\nthe arguments for not taking it but as a matter of fact I should have\ndone so.  I would have made a good aide, and had I got a chance I\ncertainly would have won out and been promoted.  That there are fools\nappointed with me is no answer.  I wouldn't have stayed in their class\nlong.\n\nDICK.\n\n\nTAMPA, May 29, 1898.\n\nDEAR CHAS.:\n\nThe cigars came; they are O. K. and a great treat after Tampa products.\nCaptain Lee and I went out to the volunteer camps today:  Florida,\nAlabama, Ohio and Michigan, General Lee's push, and it has depressed me\nvery much.  I have been so right about so many things these last five\nyears, and was laughed at for making much of them.  Now all I urged is\nproved to be correct; nothing our men wear is right.  The shoes, the\nhats, the coats, all are dangerous to health and comfort; one-third of\nthe men cannot wear the regulation shoe because it cuts the instep, and\nbuy their own, and the volunteers are like the Cuban army in\nappearance.  The Greek army, at which I made such sport, is a fine\norganization in comparison as far as outfit goes; of course, there is\nno comparison in the spirit of the men.  One colonel of the Florida\nregiment told us that one-third of his men had never fired a gun.  They\nlive on the ground; there are no rain trenches around the tents, or\ngutters along the company streets; the latrines are dug to windward of\nthe camp, and all the refuse is burned to WINDWARD.\n\nHalf of the men have no uniforms nor shoes.  I pointed out some of the\nunnecessary discomforts the men were undergoing through ignorance, and\none colonel, a Michigan politician, said, \"Oh, well, they'll learn.  It\nwill be a good lesson for them.\"  Instead of telling them, or telling\ntheir captains, he thinks it best that they should find things out by\nsuffering.  I cannot decide whether to write anything about it or not.\nI cannot see where it could do any good, for it is the system that is\nwrong--the whole volunteer system, I mean.  Captain Lee happened to be\nin Washington when the first Manila outfit was starting from San\nFrancisco, and it was on his representations that they gave the men\nhammocks, and took a store of Mexican dollars.  They did not know that\nMexican dollars are the only currency of the East, and were expecting\nto pay the men in drafts on New York.\n\nIsn't that a pitiable situation when a captain of an English company\nhappens to stray into the war office, and happens to have a good heart\nand busies himself to see that our own men are supplied with hammocks\nand spending money.  None of our officers had ever seen khaki until\nthey saw Lee's, nor a cork helmet until they saw mine and his; now,\nnaturally, they won't have anything else, and there is not another one\nin the country.  The helmets our troops wear would be smashed in one\ntropical storm, and they are so light that the sun beats through them.\nThey are also a glaring white, and are cheap and nasty and made of\npasteboard.  The felt hats are just as bad; the brim is not broad\nenough to protect them from the sun or to keep the rain off their\nnecks, and they are made of such cheap cotton stuff that they grow hard\nwhen they are wet and heavy, instead of shedding the rain as good felt\nwould do.  They have always urged that our uniforms, though not smart\nnor \"for show,\" were for use.  The truth is, as they all admit, that\nfor the tropics they are worse than useless, and that in any climate\nthey are cheap and poor.\n\nI could go on for pages, but it has to be written later; now they would\nonly think it was an attack on the army.  But it is sickening to see\nmen being sacrificed as these men will be.  This is the worst season of\nall in the Philippines.  The season of typhoons and rainstorms and\nhurricanes, and they would have sent the men off without anything to\nsleep on but the wet ground and a wet blanket.  It has been a great\nlesson for me, and I have rubber tents, rubber blankets, rubber coats\nand hammocks enough for an army corps.  I have written nothing for the\npaper, because, if I started to tell the truth at all, it would do no\ngood, and it would open up a hell of an outcry from all the families of\nthe boys who have volunteered.  Of course, the only answer is a\nstanding army of a hundred thousand, and no more calling on the\npatriotism of men unfitted and untrained.  It is the sacrifice of the\ninnocents.  The incompetence and, unreadiness of the French in 1870 was\nno worse than our own is now.  It is a terrible and pathetic spectacle,\nand the readiness of the volunteers to be sacrificed is all the more\npathetic.  It seems almost providential that we had this false-alarm\ncall with Spain to show the people how utterly helpless they are.\n\nlove,\n\nDICK.\n\n\nTAMPA, June 9th, 1898.\n\nWell, here we are again.  Talk of the \"Retreat from Ottawa\" I've\nretreated more in this war than the Greeks did.  If they don't brace up\nsoon, I'll go North and refuse to \"recognize\" the war.  I feel I\ndeserve a pension and a medal as it is.  We had everything on board and\nour cabins assigned us and our \"war kits\" in which we set forth taken\noff, and were in yachting flannels ready for the five days cruise.  I\nhad the devil of a time getting out to the flagship, as they call the\nheadquarters boat.  I went out early in the morning of the night when I\nlast wrote you.  I stayed up all that night watching troops arrive and\nlending a helping hand and a word of cheer to dispirited mules and men,\nalso segars and cool drinks, none of them had had food for twenty-four\nhours and the yellow Florida people having robbed them all day had shut\nup and wouldn't open their miserable shops.  They even put sentries\nover the drinking water of the express company which is only making\nabout a million a day out of the soldiers.  So their soldiers slept\nalong the platform and trucks rolled by them all night, shaking the\nboards on which they lay by an inch or two.  About four we heard that\nShafter was coming and an officer arrived to have his luggage placed on\nthe Seguranca.  I left them all on the pier carrying their own baggage\nand sweating and dripping and no one having slept.  Their special train\nhad been three hours in coming nine miles.  I hired a small boat and\nwent off to the flagship alone but the small boat began to leak and I\nbailed and the colored boy pulled and the men on the transports cheered\nus on.  Just at the sinking point I hailed a catboat and we transferred\nthe Admiral's flag to her and also my luggage.  The rest of the day we\nspent on the transport.  We left it this morning.  Some are still on it\nbut as they are unloading all the horses and mules from the other\ntransports fifteen having died from the heat below deck and as they\ncannot put them on again under a day, I am up here to get cool and to\nstretch my legs.  The transport is all right if it were not so awfully\ncrowded.  I am glad I held out to go with the Headquarter staff.  I\nwould have died on the regular press boat, as it is the men are\ninteresting on our boat.  We have all the military attaches and Lee,\nRemington, Whitney and Bonsal.  The reason we did not go was because\nlast night the Eagle and Resolute saw two Spanish cruisers and two\ntorpedo boats laying for us outside, only five miles away.  What they\nneed with fourteen ships of war to guard a bottled up fleet and by\nleaving twenty-six transports some of them with 1,400 men on them\nwithout any protection but a small cruiser and one gun boat is beyond\nme.  The whole thing is beyond me.  It is the most awful picnic that\never happened, you wouldn't credit the mistakes that are made.  It is\nworse than the French at Sedan a million times.  We are just amateurs\nat war and about like the Indians Columbus discovered.  I am\nexceedingly pleased with myself at taking it so good naturedly.  I\nwould have thought I would have gone mad or gone home long ago.  Bonsal\nand Remington threaten to go every minute.  Miles tells me we shall\nhave to wait until those cruisers are located or bottled up.  I'm tired\nof bottling up fleets.  I like the way Dewey bottles them.  What a\nstory that would have made.  Twenty-six transports with as many\nthousand men sunk five miles out and two-thirds of them drowned.\nRemember the Maine indeed! they'd better remember the Main and brace\nup.  If we wait until they catch those boats I may be here for another\nmonth as we cannot dare go away for long or far.  If we decide to go\nwith a convoy which is what we ought to do, we may start in a day or\ntwo.  Nothing you read in the papers is correct.  Did I tell you that\nMiles sent Dorst after me the other night and made me a long speech,\nsaying he thought I had done so well in refusing the commission.  I was\nglad he felt that way about it.  Well, lots of love.  I'm now going to\ntake a bath.  God bless you, this is a \"merry war.\"\n\nRICHARD.\n\n\nIn sight of Santiago--\n\nJune 26th, 1898.\n\nDEAR CHAS.:\n\nWe have come to a halt here in a camp along the trail to Santiago.  You\ncan see it by climbing a hill.  Instead of which I am now sitting by a\nfine stream on a cool rock.  I have discovered that you really enjoy\nthings more when you are not getting many comforts than you do when you\nhave all you want.  That sounds dull but it is most consoling.  I had a\nbath this morning in these rocks that I would not have given up for all\nthe good dinners I ever had at the Waldorf, or the Savoy.  It just went\nup and down my spine and sent thrills all over me.  It is most\ninteresting now and all the troubles of the dull days of waiting at\nTampa and that awful time on the troopship are over.  The army is\nstretched out along the trail from the coast for six miles.  Santiago\nlies about five miles ahead of us.  I am very happy and content and the\nbook for Scribners ought to be an interesting one.  It is really very\nhard that my despatches are limited to 100 words for there are lots of\nchances.  The fault lies with the army people at Washington, who give\ncredentials to any one who asks.  To The Independent and other\nperiodicals--in no sense newspapers, and they give seven to one paper,\nconsequently we as a class are a pest to the officers and to each\nother.  Fortunately, the survival of the fittest is the test and only\nthe best men in every sense get to the front.  There are fifty others\nat the base who keep the wire loaded with rumors, so when after great\ndifficulty we get the correct news back to Daiquire a Siboney there is\nno room for it.  Some of the \"war correspondents\" have absolutely\nnothing but the clothes they stand in, and the others had to take up\nsubscriptions for them.  They gambled all the time on the transports\nand are ensconced now at the base with cards and counters and nothing\nelse.  Whitney has turned out great at the work and I am glad he is not\non a daily paper or he would share everything with me.  John Fox,\nWhitney and I are living on Wood's rough riders.  We are very welcome\nand Roosevelt has us at Headquarters but, of course, we see the men we\nknow all the time.  You get more news with the other regiments but the\nofficers, even the Generals, are such narrow minded slipshod men that\nwe only visit them to pick up information.  Whitney and I were the only\ncorrespondents that saw the fight at Guasimas.  He was with the\nregulars but I had the luck to be with Roosevelt.  He is sore but still\nhe saw more than any one else and is proportionally happy.  Still he\nnaturally would have liked to have been with our push.  We were within\nthirty yards of the Spaniards and his crowd were not nearer than a\nquarter of a mile which was near enough as they had nearly as many\nkilled.  Gen. Chaffee told me to-day that it was Wood's charge that won\nthe day, without it the tenth could not have driven the Spaniards\nback-- Wood is a great young man, he has only one idea or rather all\nhis ideas run in one direction, his regiment, he eats and talks nothing\nelse.  He never sleeps more than four hours and all the rest of the\ntime he is moving about among the tents-- Between you and me and the\npoliceman, it was a very hot time-- Maybe if I drew you a map you would\nunderstand why.\n\nWood and Gen. Young, by agreement the night before and without orders\nfrom anybody decided to advance at daybreak and dislodge the Spaniards\nfrom Las Guasimas.  They went by two narrow trails single file, the two\ntrails were along the crests of a line of hills with a valley between.\nThe dotted line is the trail we should have taken had the Cubans told\nus it existed, if we had done so we would have had the Spaniards in the\nfrontband rear as General Young would have caught them where they\nexpected him to come, and we would have caught them where they were not\nlooking for us.  Of course, the Cubans who are worthless in every way\nnever told us of this trail until we had had the meeting.  No one knew\nwe were near Spaniards until both columns were on the place where the\ntwo trails meet.  Then our scouts came back and reported them and the\ncompanies were scattered out as you see them in the little dots.  The\nSpaniards were absolutely hidden not over 25 per cent of the men saw\none of them for two hours-- I ran out with the company on the right of\nthe dotted line, marked \"our position.\"  I thought it was a false alarm\nand none of us believed there were any Spaniards this side of Santiago.\nThe ground was covered with high grass and cactus and vines so that you\ncould not see twenty feet ahead, the men had to beat the vines with\ntheir carbines to get through them.  We had not run fifty yards through\nthe jungle before they opened on us with a quick firing gun at a\nhundred yards.  I saw the enemy on the hill across the valley and got\nsix sharp shooters and began on them, then the fire got so hot that we\nhad to lie on our faces and crawl back to the rear.  I had a wounded\nman to carry and was in a very bad way because I had sciatica, Two of\nhis men took him off while I stopped to help a worse wounded trooper,\nbut I found he was dead.  When I had come back for him in an hour, the\nvultures had eaten out his eyes and lips.  In the meanwhile a trooper\nstood up on the crest with a guidon and waved it at the opposite trail\nto find out if the firing there was from Spaniards or Len Young's\nnegroes.  He was hit in three places but established the fact that\nYoung was up on the trail on our right across the valley for they\ncheered.  He was a man who had run on the Gold Ticket for Congress in\nArizona, and consequently, as some one said, naturally should have led\na forlorn hope.  A blackguard had just run past telling them that Wood\nwas killed and that he had been ordered to Siboney for reinforcements.\nThat was how the report spread that we were cut to pieces-- A reporter\nwho ran away from Young's column was responsible for the story that I\nwas killed.  He meant Marshall who was on the left of the line and who\nwas shot through the spine-- There was a lot of wounded at the base and\nthe fighting in front was fearful to hear.  It was as fast as a hard\nfootball match and you must remember it lasted two full hours; during\nthat time the men were on their feet all the time or crawling on their\nhands-- Not one of them, with the exception of ----, and a Sergeant who\nthrew away his gun and ran, went a step back.  It was like playing\nblindman's buff and you were it.  I got separated once and was scared\nuntil I saw the line again, as my leg was very bad and I could not get\nabout over the rough ground.  I went down the trail and I found Capron\ndying and the whole place littered with discarded blankets and\nhaversacks.  I also found Fish and pulled him under cover--he was quite\ndead-- Then I borrowed a carbine and joined Capron's troop, a second\nlieutenant and his Sergeant were in command.  The man next me in line\ngot a bullet through his sleeve and one through his shirt and you could\nsee where it went in and came out without touching the skin.  The\nfiring was very high and we were in no danger so I told the lieutenant\nto let us charge across an open place and take a tin shack which was\nheld by the Spaniards' rear guard, for they were open in retreat.\nRoosevelt ordered his men to do the same thing and we ran forward\ncheering across the open and then dropped in the grass and fired.  I\nguess I fired about twenty rounds and then formed into a strategy board\nand went off down the trail to scout.  I got lonely and was coming back\nwhen I met another trooper who sat down and said he was too hot to run\nin any direction Spaniard or no Spaniard.  So we sat down and panted.\nAt last he asked me if I was R. H. D. and I said I was and he said \"I'm\nDean, I met you in Harvard in the racquet court.\" Then we embraced--the\ntenth came up then and it was all over.  My leg, thank goodness, is all\nright again and has been so for three days.  It was only the running\nabout that caused it.  I won't have to run again as I have a horse now\nand there will be no more ambushes and moreover we have 12,000 men\naround us-- Being together that way in a tight place has made us all\nfriends and I guess I'll stick to the regiment.  Send this to dear\nMother and tell her I was not born to be killed.  I ought to tell you\nmore of the charming side of the life--we are all dirty and hungry and\nsleep on the ground and have grand talks on every subject around the\nheadquarters tent.  I was never more happy and content and never so\nwell.  It is hot but at night it is quite cool and there has been no\nrain only a few showers. 'No one is ill and there have been no cases of\nfever.  I have not heard from you or any one since the 14th, which is\nnot really long but so much goes on that it seems so.  Lots of love to\nyou all.\n\nDICK.\n\n\nAfter reading this over I ought perhaps to say that the position of the\nreal correspondents is absolutely the very best.  No one confounds us\nwith the men at the base, and nothing they have they deny us.  We are\ntreated immeasurably better than the poor attaches who are still on the\nship and who if they were spies could not be treated worse.  But for\nWhitney, Remington and myself nothing is too good.  Generals fight to\nhave us on their staffs and all that sort of thing, so I really cannot\ncomplain, except about the fact that our real news is crowded out by\nthe faker in the rear.\n\n\nSANTIAGO.\n\nHeadquarters\n  Cavalry Division, U. S. Army.\n    Headqrs.  Wood's Rough Riders.\n\nJune 29th, 1898.\n\nDEAR DAD:\n\nI suppose you are back from Marion now and I have missed you.  I can't\ntell you how sorry I am.  I wanted to see you coming up the street this\nsummer in your knickerbockers and with no fish, but still happy.  Never\nmind, we shall do the theatres this Fall, and have good walks downtown.\nI hope Mother will come up and visit me this September, at Marion and\nsit on Allen's and on the Clarks' porch and we can have Chas. too.  I\nsuppose he will have had his holiday but he can come up for a Sunday.\nWe expect to move up on Santiago the day after to-morrow, and it's\nabout time, for the trail will not be passable much longer.  It rains\nevery day at three o'clock for an hour and such rain you never guessed.\nIt is three inches high for an hour.  Then we all go out naked and dig\ntrenches to get it out of the way.  It is very rough living.  I have to\nconfess that I never knew how well off I was until I got to smoking\nDurham tobacco and I've only half a bag of that left.  The enlisted men\nare smoking dried horse droppings, grass, roots and tea.  Some of them\ncan't sleep they are so nervous for the want of it, but to-day a lot\ncame up and all will be well for them.  I've had a steady ration of\ncoffee, bacon and hard tack for a week and one mango, to night we had\nbeans.  Of course, what they ought to serve is rice and beans as fried\nbacon is impossible in this heat.  Still, every one is well.  This is\nthe best crowd to be with--they are so well educated and so\ninteresting.  The regular army men are very dull and narrow and would\nbore one to death.  We have Wood, Roosevelt, Lee, the British Attache,\nWhitney and a Doctor Church, a friend of mine from Princeton, who is\nquite the most cheerful soul and the funniest I ever met.  He carried\nfour men from the firing line the other day back half a mile to the\nhospital tent.  He spends most of his time coming around headquarters\nin an undershirt of mine and a gold bracelet fighting tarantulas.  I\nwoke up the other morning with one seven inches long and as hairy as\nyour head reposing on my pillow.  My sciatica bothers me but has not\nprevented me seeing everything and I can dig rain gutters and cut wood\nwith any of them.  It is very funny to see Larned, the tennis champion,\nwhose every movement at Newport was applauded by hundreds of young\nwomen, marching up and down in the wet grass.  Whitney and I guy him.\nTo-day a sentry on post was reading \"As You Like It\" and whenever I go\ndown the line half the men want to know who won the boat race-- To-day\nWood sent me out with a detail on a pretense of scouting but really to\ngive them a chance to see the country.  They were all college boys,\nwith Willie Tiffany as sergeant and we had a fine time and could see\nthe Spanish sentries quite plainly without a glass.  I hope you will\nnot worry over this long separation.  I don't know of any experience I\nhave had which has done me so much good, and being with such a fine lot\nof fellows is a great pleasure.  The scenery is very beautiful when it\nis not raining.  I have a cot raised off the ground in the Colonel's\ntent and am very well off.  If Chaffee or Lawton, who are the finest\ntype of officers I ever saw, were in command, we would have been\nfighting every day and would probably have been in by this time.  This\nweather shows that Havana must be put off after Porto Rico.  They\ncannot campaign in this mud.\n\nDICK.\n\n\nSANTIAGO, July 1898.\n\nDEAR FAMILY:\n\nThis is just to reassure you that I am all right.  I and Marshall were\nthe only correspondents with Roosevelt.  We were caught in a clear case\nof ambush.  Every precaution had been taken, but the natives knew the\nground and our men did not.  It was the hottest, nastiest fight I ever\nimagined.  We never saw the enemy except glimpses.  Our men fell all\nover the place, shouting to the others not to mind them, but to go on.\nI got excited and took a carbine and charged the sugar house, which was\nwhat is called the key to the position.  If the men had been regulars I\nwould have sat in the rear as B---- did, but I knew every other one of\nthem, had played football, and all that sort of thing, with them, so I\nthought as an American I ought to help.  The officers were falling all\nover the shop, and after it was all over Roosevelt made me a long\nspeech before some of the men, and offered me a captaincy in the\nregiment any time I wanted it.  He told the Associated Press man that\nthere was no officer in his regiment who had \"been of more help or\nshown more courage\" than your humble servant, so that's all right.\nAfter this I keep quiet.  I promise I keep quiet.  Love to you all.\n\nRICHARD.\n\n\nFrom Cuba Richard sailed with our forces to Porto Rico, where his\nexperiences in the Spanish-American war came to an end, and he returned\nto Marion.  He spent the fall in New York, and early in 1899 went to\nLondon.\n\nOne of the most interesting, certainly the most widely talked of,\n\"sporting events\" for which Richard was responsible was the sending of\nan English district-messenger boy from London to Chicago.  The idea was\ninspired by my brother's general admiration of the London messenger\nservice and his particular belief in one William Thomas Jaggers, a\nfourteen-year-old lad whom Richard had frequently employed to carry\nnotes and run errands.  One day, during a casual luncheon conversation\nat the Savoy with his friend Somers Somerset, Richard said that he\nbelieved that if Jaggers were asked to carry a message to New York that\nhe could not only do it but would express no surprise at the\ncommission.  This conversation resulted in the bet described in the\nfollowing letters.  The boy slipped quietly away from London, but a few\ndays later the bet became public and the newspapers were filled with\nspeculation as to whether Jaggers could beat the mails.  The messenger\ncarried three letters, one to my sister, one to Miss Cecil Clark of\nChicago, whom Richard married a few months later, and one to myself.\nAs a matter of fact, Jaggers delivered his notes several hours before\nletters travelling by the same boat reached the same destinations.  The\nnewspapers not only printed long accounts of Jaggers's triumphal\nprogress from New York to Chicago and back again, but used the success\nof his undertaking as a text for many editorials against the dilatory\nmethods of our foreign-mail service.  Jaggers left London on March 11,\n1899, and was back again on the 29th, having travelled nearly\neighty-four hundred miles in eighteen days.  On his return he was\nreceived literally by a crowd of thousands, and his feat was given\nofficial recognition by a gold medal pinned on his youthful chest by\nthe Duchess of Rutland.  Also, later on, at a garden fete he was\npresented to the Queen, and incidentally, still later, returned to the\nUnited States as \"buttons\" to my brother's household.\n\n\nBachelors' Club,\n  Piccadilly, W.\n\nMarch 15th, 1899.\n\nDEAR CHAS.\n\nI hope you are not annoyed about Jaggers.  When he started no one knew\nof it but three people and I had no idea anyone else would, but the\ncompany sent it to The Mail without my name but describing me as \"an\nAmerican gentleman\"-- Instantly the foreign correspondents went to them\nto find out who I was and to whom I was sending the letter-- I told the\ncompany it was none of their damned business--that I employed the boy\nby the week and that I could send him where-ever I chose.  Then the\nboy's father got proud and wrote to The Mail about his age and so they\ngot the boy's name.  Mine, however, is still out of it, but in America\nthey are sure to know as the people on the steamer are crazy about him\nand Kinsey the Purser knows he is sent by me.  After he gets back from\nChicago and Philadelphia, you can do with him as you like until the\nsteamer sails.  If the thing is taken up as it is here and the fat is\nin the fire, then you can do as you please-- I mean you can tell the\npapers about it or not-- Somerset holds one end of the bets and I the\nother.  There are two bets: one that he will beat the mail to Chicago,\nSomerset agreeing to consider the letter you give him to Bruce, as\nequivalent to one coming from here.  The other bet is that he will\ndeliver and get receipts from you, Nora and Bruce, and return here by\nthe 5th of April-- You and Bobby ought to be able to do well by him if\nit becomes, as I say, so far public that there is no possibility of\nfurther concealment-- You have my permission to do what you please-- He\nis coming into my employ as soon as he gets back and as soon as the\ncompany give him a medal.\n\nOver here there is the greatest possible interest in the matter-- At\nthe Clubs I go to, the waiters all wait on me in order to have the\nlatest developments and when it was cabled over here that the Customs'\npeople intended stopping him, indignation raged at the Foreign office.\n\nof love,\n\nDICK.\n\n\n89 Jermyn Street, S. W.\n\nMarch--1899\n\nDEAR NORA:\n\nThis is to be handed to you by my special messenger, who is to assure\nyou that I am in the best of health and spirits-- Keep him for a few\nhours and then send him on to Chicago-- As he is doing this on a bet,\ndo not give him any written instructions only verbal ones.  I am very\nwell and happy and send you all my love-- Jaggers has been running\nerrands for me ever since I came here, and a most loyal servitor when I\nwas ill-- On his return I want to keep him on as a buttons.  See that\nhe gets plenty to eat-- If he comes back alive he will have broken the\nmessenger boy service record by three thousand miles.  Personally, it\ndoes not cost me anything to speak of.  The dramatization of the\nSoldiers continues briskly, and Maude is sending Grundy back the\nJackal, to have a second go at it.  Maude insists on its being done--so\nI stand to win a lot.\n\nRICHARD.\n\n\nBeefsteak Club, 9, Green Street,\n  Leicester Square, W. C. Tuesday.\n\nMarch--1899.\n\nDEAR MOTHER:--\n\nThe faithful Jaggers should have arrived to-day, or will do so this\nevening-- I am sure you will make the poor little chap comfortable-- I\ndo regret having sent him on such a journey especially since the papers\nhere made such an infernal row over it-- However, neither of us will\nlose by it in the end--\n\nI dined with Lady Clarke last night and met Lord Castleton there and he\ninvited me up to Dublin for the Punchtown Races-- I have a great mind\nto go and write a story on them-- Castleton is a great sport and very\npopular at home and in England and it would be a pleasant experience.\nKuhne Beveridge is doing a bust of me in khaki outfit for the Academy\nand also for a private exhibition of her own works, which includes the\nPrince of Wales, and the Little Queen of Holland.\n\nHays Hammond has invited me down to South Africa again, with a promise\nof making my fortune, but I am not going as it takes too long.\n\nDICK.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XII\n\nTHE BOER WAR\n\nOn May 4, 1899, at Marion, Massachusetts, Richard was married to Cecil\nClark, the daughter of Mr. and Mrs. John M. Clark of Chicago.  After\nthe marriage Richard and his wife spent a few weeks in Marion and the\nremainder of the summer in London and Aix-les-Bains.\n\n\nMARION, May 28th, 1899.\n\nDEAR MOTHER:\n\nYou sent me such a good letter about the visit of the three selected\nchorus girls.  But what was best, was about your wishing to see me.  Of\ncourse, you know that I feel that too.  I would have it so that we all\nlived here, so that Dad could fish, and Nora and Cecil could discuss\nlife, and you and I could just take walks and chat.  But because that\ncannot be, we are no further away than we ever were and when the pain\nto see you comes, I don't let it hurt and I don't kill it either for it\nis the sweetest pain I can feel.  If sons will go off and marry, or be\nwar-correspondents, or managers, it does not mean that Home is any the\nless Home.  You can't wipe out history by changing the name of a\nboulevard, as somebody said of the French, and if I were able to be in\ntwo places at once, I know in which two places I would be here with\nCecil at Marion, and at Home in the Library with you and Dad and The\nEvening Telegraph, and Nora and Van Bibber.  You will never know how\nmuch I love you all and you must never give up trying to comprehend it.\nGod bless you and keep you, and my love to you every minute and always.\n\nDICK.\n\n\nLate in January, 1900, Richard and his wife started on their first\ngreat adventure together to the Boer War.  Arriving at Cape Town,\nRichard left his wife there and, acting as correspondent with the\nBritish forces for the New York Herald and London Mail, saw the relief\nof Ladysmith.  After this he returned to Cape Town, with the intention\nof joining Lord Roberts in his advance on Pretoria.  But on arriving at\nCape Town he learned that Lord Roberts did not intend to move for three\nweeks, and so decided to say farewell to the British army and to return\nto London in a leisurely and sightseeing fashion along the east coast.\nIt was after they were well started on this return voyage that Richard\nconceived the idea of leaving the ship at Durban, going to Pretoria,\nand, as he expressed it, \"watch the Boers fighting the same men I had\njust seen fighting them.\"\n\n\nR. M. S. Scot\n\nFebruary 4th, 1900.\n\nDEAR MOTHER:\n\nA great change has come since I wrote you from Madeira.  We are now on\nSummer seas and have regulated the days so that they pass very\npleasantly--not that we do not want to be on land-- I never so much\nwanted it-- Somers is with us and is such a comfort.  He is even\nyounger than he used to be and so quick and courteous and good\ntempered.  He is like a boy off on a holiday-- I think he is very much\nin love with his wife, but in spite of himself he is glad to get a\nholiday, and like all of us he will be so much more glad when he is\nhomeward bound.  They threatened to shut us out of our only chance of\nputting foot on land at Madeira-- In the first place, we were so\ndelayed by the storm that we arrived at eight o'clock at night, so that\nwe missed seeing it in its beauty of flowers and palms.  And then it\nwas so rough that they said it was most unsafe for us to attempt to go\nashore.  It was a great disappointment but I urged that every one loved\nhis own life, and if the natives were willing to risk theirs to sell us\nphotographs and wicker baskets it was probably safer than it looked--\nSo we agreed to die together, and with Somers got our rain coats, and\nthe three of us leaped into a row boat pulled by two Portugese pirates\nand started off toward a row of lamps on a quay that seemed much lower\nthan the waves.  The remainder on the ship watched us disappear with\nominus warnings-- We really had a most adventurous passage--towards\nshore the waves tossed us about like a lobster pot and we just missed\nbeing run down by a coal barge and escaped an upset over the bow anchor\nchain of a ship.  It was so close that both Somers and I had our coats\noff and I told Cecil to grab the chain-- But we weathered it and landed\nat a high gangway cut in the solid rock the first three steps of which\nwere swamped by the waves.  A rope and chain hung from the top of the\nwharf and a man swung his weight on this and yanked us out to the steps\nas the boat was on the wave.  The rain beat and the wind roared and\nbeautiful palms lashed the air with their fronds-- It was grand to get\non shore once again-- At the end of the wharf we were hustled into a\nsled on steel runners, like a hearse with curtains around it and drawn\nby bullocks-- The  streets were all of mosaic, thousands of little\nstones being packed together like corn on a cob.  Over this the heavy\nsledge was drawn by the bullocks while a small boy ran ahead through\nthe narrow streets to clear the way-- He had a feather duster made of\nhorse's tail as a badge of authority and he yelled some strange cry at\nthe empty streets and closed houses.  Another little boy in a striped\njersey ran beside and assured us he was a guide.  It was like a page\nout of a fairy story.  The strange cart sliding and slipping over the\nstones which were as smooth as ice, and the colored house fronts and\nthe palms and strange plants.  The darkness made it all the more\nunreal-- There was a governor's palace buttressed and guarded by\nsentinels in a strange uniform and queer little cafe's under vines--and\nterraces of cannon, and at last a funny, pathetic little casino.  It\nwas such a queer imitation of Aix and Monte Carlo-- There were\nchasseurs and footmen in magnificent livery and stucco white walls\nornamented with silk SHAWLS.  Also a very good band and a new roulette\ntable-- Coming in out of the night and the rain it was like a theatre\nafter the \"dark scene\" has just passed-- There were some most dignified\ncroupiers and three English women and a few sad English men and some\nvery wicked looking natives in diamonds and white waistcoats.  We had\nonly fifteen minutes to spare so we began playing briskly with two\nshilling pieces Cecil with indifferent fortune and Somers losing-- But\nI won every time and the croupiers gave me strange notes of the Bonco\nde Portugal which I put back on the board only to get more of a larger\nnumber-- I felt greatly embarrassed as I was not a real member of the\nclub and I hated to blow in out of a hurricane and take their money and\nsail away again-- So I appealed to one of the sad eyed Englishmen and\nhe assured me it was all right, that they welcomed the people from the\npassing steamers who generally left a few pounds each with the bank.\nBut the more I spread the money the more I won until finally the whole\nroom gathered around.  Then I sent out and ordered champagne for\neverybody and spare gold to all the waiters and still cashed in\nseventy-five dollars in English money.  It was pretty good for fifteen\nminutes and we went out leaving the people open-eyed, and hitting the\nchampagne bottles-- It was all a part of the fun especially as with all\nour gold we could get nothing for supper but \"huevos frite\" which was\nall the Spanish I could remember and which meant fried eggs-- But we\nwere very wet and hungry and we got the eggs and some fruit and real\nMadeira wine and then rowed out again rejoicing.  The pirates demanded\ntheir pay half way to the boat while we were on the high seas but they\nhad struck the very wrong men, and I never saw a mutiny quelled so\nabruptly-- Somers and I told them we'd throw them overboard and row\nourselves and they understood remarkably well-- The next day we were\nthe admired and envied of those who had not had the nerve \"to dare to\nattempt.\"  It was one of the best experiences altogether we ever had\nand I shall certainly put Madeira on my silver cup.\n\nRICHARD.\n\n\nAfter their arrival at Cape Town, where Richard arranged for his wife\nto stay during his absence at the British front, he started for\nLadysmith, sailing on the same vessel on which he had left England.\n\n\nFebruary 18th, 1900\n\nboard Scot.\n\nDEAR MOTHER:\n\nI got off yesterday and am hoping to get to Buller before Ladysmith is\nrelieved.  I could not get to go with Roberts because Ralph has been\nhere four months and has borne the heat and burden of the day, so\nalthough I only came in order to be with Roberts and Kitchener I could\nnot ask to have Ralph recalled-- They wanted me with Roberts and I\nwanted it but none of us could make up our minds to turn down Ralph.\nSo I am going up on this side track on the chance of seeing Ladysmith\nrelieved and of joining Roberts with Buller later.  I shall be\nsatisfied if I see Ladysmith fall.  Fortunately I am to do a great deal\nof cabling for The Mail every day and that counts much more with the\nreading public than letters--\n\nCape Town is a dusty, wind ridden western town with a mountain back of\nit which one man said was a badly painted back drop-- The only\nattractive thing about the town is this mountain and a hotel situated\nat its base in perfectly beautiful gardens.  Here Cecil is settled.  I\ngot her a sitting room and a big bedroom and The Mail agent or Pryor\npays her $150 a week and will take good care of her.  It really is a\nbeautiful and comfortable hotel and grounds and she has made many\nfriends, and also I forced a pitch battle with a woman who was rude to\nher when we visited the hospital-- So, as the hospital people were very\nkeen to have me see and praise their hospital they have taken up arms\nagainst the unfortunate little bounder and championed Cecil and me.\nCecil had really nothing to do with it as you can imagine-- She only\nlaughed but I gave the lady lots to remember.\n\nOn the other hand every one is as kind and interested in Cecil as can\nbe.  Mrs. Waldron whose son is Secretary to Milner and his secretary\nwere more than polite to each of us.  Milner spent the whole evening we\nwere there talking to Cecil and not to the lady we had had the row\nwith, which was a pleasing triumph.  He sent me unsolicited a most\nflattering personal letter to the Governor of Natal, saying that I had\ncome to him with my strong letters but that he had so enjoyed meeting\nme that he wished to pass me on on his own account.  Cecil asked me\nwhat it was I had talked so much to him about and I asked her if it\nwere possible she couldn't guess that of course I would be telling him\nhow to run the colony.  My advice was to bombard Cape Town and make\nmartial law, for the Cape Towners are the most rotten, cowardly lot of\nrebels I ever imagined as being possible.  He seemed so glad to find\nany one who appreciated that it was a queen's colony in name only and\nsaid, \"Mr. Davis, it is as bad as this--I can take a stroll with you\nfrom these gardens (we were at the back of the Government House) and at\nthe end of our stroll we will be in hostile territory.\"\n\nWe spent the last day after I had got my orders to join Buller (who\nseemed very pleased to have me) calling on the officials for passes\ntogether and they were in a great state falling into their coats and\ndressing guard for her and were all so friendly and hearty.  The Censor\nseems to think I am a sort of Matthew Arnold and should be wrapped in\ncotton, so does Pryor The Mail agent who apologizes for asking me to\ncable, which is just what I want to do.  They are very generous and are\nspending money like fresh air.  I am to cable letters to Cape Town,\nonly to save three days.  So, now all that is needed is for something\nto happen.  Everything else is arranged.  All I want is to see three or\nfour good fights and a big story like the relief of Ladysmith and I am\nready and anxious to get home.  I shall observe them from behind an ant\nhill--I don't say this to please you but because I mean it.  This is\nnot my war and all I want is to earn the very generous sums I have been\noffered and get home.  We are just off Port Elizabeth.  I will go on\nshore and post this there.  With all love.  DICK.\n\n\nDeal's Central Hotel, East London.\n\nFebruary 20th, 1900.\n\nDEAR MOTHER:\n\nWe are stopping at every port now, as though the Scot were a ferry\nboat.  We came over the side to get here in baskets with a neat door in\nthe side and were bumped to the deck of the tender in all untenderness.\nThis is more like Africa than any place I have seen.  The cactus and\npalms abound and the Kaffirs wear brass anklets and bracelets.  A man\nat lunch at this hotel asked me if I was R. H. D. and said he was an\nAmerican who had got a commission in Brabants horse-- He gave me the\ngrandest sort of a segar and apparently on his representation the hotel\nbrought me two books to sign, marked \"Autographs of Celebrities of the\nBoer War.\"  It seemed in my case at least to be premature and hopeful.\n\nGood luck and God bless you.  This will be the last letter you will get\nfor ten days or two weeks, as I am now going directly away from\nsteamers.  This one reaches you by a spy gentleman who is to give it to\nRene Bull of The Graphic and who will post it in Cape Town-- He and all\nthe other correspondents are abandoning Buller for Roberts.  Let 'em\nall go.  The fewer the better, I say.  My luck will keep I hope.  DICK.\n\n\nImperial Hotel,\n  Maritzburg, Natal.\n\nFeb. 23rd, 1900.\n\nDEAR MOTHER:--\n\nI reached Durban yesterday.  They paraded the band in my honour and\nplayed Yankee Doodle indefinitely-- I had corrupted them by giving them\ndrinks to play the \"Belle of New York\" nightly.  The English officers\nthought Yankee Doodle was our national anthem and stood with their hats\noff in a hurricane balancing on the deck of the tender on one foot--\nThe city of Durban is the best I have seen.  It was as picturesque as\nthe Midway at the Fair-- There were Persians, Malay, Hindoo, Babu's\nKaffirs, Zulu's and soldiers and sailors.  I went on board the Maine to\nsee the American doctors--one of them said he had met me on Walnut\nStreet, when he had nearly run me down with his ambulance from the\nPenna Hospital.  Lady Randolph took me over the ship and was very much\npuzzled when all the hospital stewards called me by name and made\ncomplimentary remarks.  It impressed her so much apparently that she\nand the American nurses I hadn't met on board came to see me off at the\nstation, which was very friendly.  I have had a horrible day here and\ngot up against the British officer in uniform and on duty bent-- The\nchief trouble was that none of them knew what authority he had to do\nanything--and I had to sit down and tell them.  I wonder with\nintelligence like theirs that their Intelligence Department did not\ntell them the Boers fought with war clubs and spears.  I bought a\nripping pony and my plan is to cut away from all my magnificent\nequipment and try to overtake Buller before he reaches Ladysmith and\nsend back for the heavy things later.  It is just a question of minutes\nreally and it seems hard to have come 1500 miles and then to miss it by\nan hour-- I arrive at Chievely tomorrow at five--that is only ten miles\nfrom where Buller is to night, so were it not for their d----d\nregulations I could ride across country and join them by midday but I\nbet they won't let me and I also bet I'll get there in time.  Of course\nyou'll, know before you see this.  Marelsburg is the capital and its\nchief industry is rickshaw's pulled by wild Kaffi's, with beads and\nsnake skins around them and holes in their ears into which they stick\nsegars and horn spoons for dipping snuff.  The women wear less than the\nmen and have their hair done up in red fungus.\n\nWell, love to you all, to Nora and Dad and Chas, and God bless you.\n\nDICK.\n\n\n1900.\n\nDEAR DEAR MOTHER:--\n\nI am here at last and counting the days when I shall get away.  War\ndoes not soothe my savage breast.  I find I want Cecil, and Jaggers,\nand Macklin to write, and plays to rehearse.  Without Cecil bored to\ndeath at Cape Town, I would not mind it at all.  I know how to be\ncomfortable and on my second day I beat all these men who have been\nhere three months in getting my news on the wire.  For I am a news man\nnow, and have to collect horrid facts and hosts of casualties and to\nfind out whether it was the Dubblins or the Durbans that did it and\nwhat it was they did.  I was in terrible fear that I would be too late\nto see the relief of Ladysmith but I was well in time and saw a fight\nthe first few hours I arrived.  It is terribly big and overwhelming\nlike eighty of Barnum circuses all going at once in eighty rings and\nvery hard to understand the geography.  The Tugela is like a snake and\ncrosses itself every three feet so that you never know whether you have\ncrossed it yourself or not.  Every one is most kind and I am as\ncomfortable as can be.  Indeed I like my tent so much that I am going\nto take it to Marion.  It has windows in it and the most amusing trap\ndoors and pockets in the walls and clothes lines and hooks and\nventilators-- It is colored a lovely green-- I have also two chairs\nthat fold up and a table that does nothing else and a bed and two\nlanterns, 3 ponies, one a Boer pony I bought for  $12. from a Tommy who\nhad stolen it.  I had to pay $125 each for the other two and one had a\nsore back and the other gets lost in my saddle.  But war as these\npeople do it bores one to destruction.  They are terribly dull souls.\nThey cannot give an order intelligently.  The real test of a soldier is\nthe way he gives an order.  I heard a Colonel with eight ribbons for\neight campaigns scold a private for five minutes because he could not\nsee a signal flag, and no one else could.  It is not becoming that a\nColonel should scold for five minutes.  Friday they charged a hill with\none of their \"frontal\" attacks and lost three Colonels and 500 men.  In\nthe morning--it was a night attack--when the roll was called only five\nofficers answered.  The proper number is 24.  A Captain now commands\nthe regiment.  It is sheer straight waste of life through dogged\nstupidity.  I haven't seen a Boer yet except some poor devils of\nprisoners but you can see every English who is on a hill.  They walk\nalong the skyline like ships on the horizon.  It must be said for them\nthat it is the most awful country to attack in the world.  It is\nimpossible to give any idea of its difficulties.  However I can tell\nyou that when I get back to the center of civilization.  Do you know I\nhaven't heard from you since I left New York on the St. Louis.  All\nyour letters to London went astray.  What lots you will have to tell me\nbut don't let Charley worry.  I won't talk about the war this time.  I\nnever want to hear of it again.\n\nDICK.\n\n\nLADYSMITH.  March 1st, 1899.\n\nDEAR CHAS:\n\nThis is just a line to say I got in here with the first after a gallop\nof twelve miles.  Keep this for me and the envelope.  With my love and\nbest wishes--\n\nDICK.\n\n\nLADYSMITH, March 3, 1900.\n\nDEAR MOTHER:\n\nThe column came into town today, 2200 men, guns, cavalry, ambulances,\nlancers, navy guns and oxen.  It was a most cruel assault upon one's\nfeelings.  The garrison lined the streets as a saluting guard of honor\nbut only one regiment could stand it and the others all sat down on the\ncurb only rising to cheer the head of each new regiment.  They are\nyellow with fever, their teeth protruding and the skin drawn tight over\ntheir skeletons.  The incoming army had had fourteen days hard fighting\nat the end of three months campaigning but were robust and tanned\nragged and caked  with  mud.  As they came in they cheered and the\ngarrison tried to cheer back but it was like a whisper.\n\nWinston Churchill and I stood in front of Gen. White and cried for an\nhour.  For the time you forgot Boers and the cause, or the lack of\ncause of it all, and saw only the side of it that was before you, the\nstarving garrison relieved by men who had lost almost one out of every\nthree in trying to help them.  I was rather too previous in getting in\nand like every-one else who came from outside gave away everything I\nhad so that now I'm as badly off as the rest of them.  Yesterday my\nrations for the day were four biscuits and an ounce of coffee and of\ntea, with corn which they call mealies which I could not eat but which\nsaved my horse's life.  He is a Boer pony I bought from a Tommy for two\npounds ten and he's worth both of the other two for which I paid $125 a\npiece.  Tomorrow the wagon carrying my supplies will be in and I can\nget millions of things.  It almost apalls me to think how many.\nEspecially clean clothes.  I've slept in these for four days.  I got\noff some stories which I hope will read well.  I can't complain now\nthat I saw the raising of this siege.  But I hope we don't stay still.\nI want to see a lot quickly and get out.  This is very safe warfare.\nYou sit on a hill and the army does the rest.  My sciatica is not\ntroubling me at all.  Love to you all and God bless you.\n\nDICK.\n\n\nLADYSMITH, March 4th, 1900.\n\nDEAR, DEAR MOTHER:\n\nToday I got the first letter I have had from you since we left home.\nIt was such happiness to see your dear sweet handwriting again.  It was\njust like seeing you for a glimpse, or hearing you speak.  I am so\nhungry for news of Nora and Chas and you all.  I know you've written,\nbut the letters have missed somehow.  I sent yours right back to Cecil\nwho is very lonely at present.  Somerset has gone to the front and\nJim--home--Blessed word!  A little middy rode up to me today and began\nby saying \"I'm going home.  I'm ORDERED there.  Home-- To England!\"  He\nseemed to think I would not understand.  He prattled on like a child\nsaying what luck he had had, that he had been besieged in Ladysmith and\nseen lots of fighting and would get a medal and all the while he was\n\"just a middy.\"  \"But isn't it awful to think of our chaps that were\nleft on the ship\" he said quite miserably.  It is a beastly dull war.\nThe whole thing is so \"class\" and full of \"form\" and tradition and\nworrying over \"putties\" and etiquette and rank.  It is the most\nwonderful organization I ever imagined but it is like a beautiful\nlocomotive without an engineer.\n\nThe Boers outplay them in intelligence every day.  The whole army is\nofficered by one class and that the dull one.  It is like the House of\nPeers.  You would not believe the mistakes they make, the awful way in\nwhich they sacrifice the lives of officers and men.  And they let the\nBoers escape.  I watched the Boers for four hours the other day\nescaping after the battle of Pieters and I asked, not because I wanted\nthem captured but just as a military proposition \"Why don't you send\nout your cavalry and light artillery and take those wagons?\"  The staff\nofficer giggled and said \"They might kill us.\"  I don't know what he\nmeant; neither did he.  However, I'm sick of it but there's nothing\nelse to talk of.  I hate all the people about me and this dirty town\nand I wish I was back.  And I'm going too.  I'll have started by the\ntime you get this.\n\nI mean to cut out of this soon but don't imagine I'm in any danger.\nI'm taking d---d good care to keep out of danger.  No one is more\ndetermined on that than I am.  Dear Mother, this is such a dull letter\nbut you must forgive me.  I was never so homesick and bored in my life.\nIt will be better when I go out tomorrow in my green tent and leave\nthis beastly hole.  I like the tent life, and the horses and being\nclean.  I've really starved here for four days and haven't had a clean\nthing on me.  God bless you all and dear Nora God bless her and Chas\nand the Lone Fisherman.\n\nDICK.\n\n\nOutside Ladysmith.\n\n5th March, 1900.\n\nDEAREST MOTHER:\n\nI was a brute to write as I did last night.  But I was so blue in that\nmiserable town!!!  It was so foul and dirty.  The town smelt as bad as\nJohnstown.  My room in the so called hotel stunk, the dirt was all over\nthe floor and the servants had to be paid to do everything even to\nbring you a towel--and then I had no place to write or be alone, and\nnothing to eat-- The poor souls at my table who had been in the siege,\nwhen they got a little bit of sugar or a can of condensed milk would\ncarry it off from the table as though it were a diamond diadem-- I did\nthe same thing myself for I couldn't eat what they gave me and so I\ncorrupted the canteen dealer and bought tin things-- I've really never\nwanted tobacco so much and food as I have here--to give away I mean,\nfor it was something wonderful to see what it meant to them.  Three\ntroopers came into the dining room yesterday and asked if they could\nbuy some tea and were turned out so rudely that it seemed to hurt them\nmuch more than the fact that they were hungry:  I followed them out and\nbegged them to come back to my verandah and have tea with me but they\nat first would not because they knew I had witnessed what had happened\nin the hotel.  They belonged to a very good regiment and they had been\nstarved for four months.  But in spite of their independence I got them\nto my porch.  I had just purchased at awful prices a few delicacies\nlike sugar and tobacco, marmalade and a bottle of whiskey.  So I gave\nthem to them and I never enjoyed anything so much-- The poor yellow\nfaced skeletons ate in absolute silence still fighting with their pride\nuntil I told them I was an American and was a canteen contractor's\nfriend-- Then I gave them segars and it was too pitiful-- In our\ncolumn, if you give a man something extra he says a lot and swears it's\nthe best drink or the best segar or that you're the best chap he ever\nmet-- Just as I say it to them when they give me things.  But these\nstarved bodies tried to be very polite and conversational on every\nsubject except food--when I offered them the segars which could only be\ngot then at a dollar twenty-five a piece (they had not cost me that as\nI had bought them in Cape Town for two cents apiece!) What has Dad to\nsay to that for economy?  They accepted them quite as though it was in\nHavana--and then leaned back and went off into opium dreams-- Imagine\nthe first segar after three months.  I am out here now on a bluff, with\ntwo trees in front and great hills with names historical of the siege\nof Ladysmith--names which I refuse to learn or remember--I am perfectly\ncomfortable and were it not for Cecil perfectly content-- If she were\nonly here it would be perfectly magnificent-- I have a retinue that\nwould do credit to the Warringtons in the Virginians-- Three Kaffir\nboys who refuse to yield to my sense of the picturesque and go naked\nlike their less effete brothers, two oxen and three ponies, a little\npuppy I found starved in Ladysmith and fed on compressed beef tablets.\nI call her Ladysmith and she sleeps beside my cot and in my lap when I\nam reading--I have also a beautiful tent with tape window panes,\nventilators, pockets inside, doors that loop up and red knobs; also, it\nis green so that the ants won't eat it.  Also two tables, two chairs, a\nbath tub, two lanterns, and a cape cart--and a folding bed-- In Cuba I\nhad two saddle bags and was just as clean and just as happy.  One boy\ndoes nothing but polish my boots and gaiters and harness, so that I\nlook as well as the officers who are not much good at anything but\nthat.  I must tell you what I think is the saddest story of the siege--\nThey could not feed the horses, so they kept part of them for scouting,\npart to eat and drove 3,000 of them towards the Boers.  Being, well\ntrained cavalry horses, they did not know how to eat grass, so at bugle\ncall the whole 3,000 came trotting back again and sentries were placed\nat every street to stampede them back into the veldt-- One horse from\none battery met out in the prairie another horse that had been its gun\nmate in an artillery regiment five years before in India and the two\npoor things came galloping back side by side and passed the sentries\nand into the lines and drew up beside their battery.  Another horse\nfound its rider acting as sentry and when the man tried to drive it\naway it thought he was playing with it and kept coming back and finally\nthe man brought it in to the colonel and cried and asked if it might\nhave half of his rations of corn.  Good night and God bless you all\nwith all my love.\n\nDICK.\n\n\nMarch 15th, 1900.\n\nDEAR MOTHER:\n\nI am on my way back to Cape Town.  This seemed better than staying with\nBuller who will not move for two or three weeks.  I shall either go\nstraight up to Roberts, or we will return to London.  I have seen the\nrelief of Ladysmith and got a very good idea of it all, and I do not\nknow but what I shall quit now.  I started in too late to do much with\nit and as it is I have seen a great deal.  It is neither an interesting\ncountry nor an interesting war.  But I don't have to stay here to\noblige anybody.  If I do go up to Roberts it will only be to stay for\nthree weeks at the most and only then if there is fighting.  I won't go\nif he is resting as Buller is.  So this will explain why we start home\nso soon.  I am very glad I came.  I would have been very sorry always\nif I had not, but my heart is not in it as, of course, it was in our\nwar.  Sometimes they fight all day using seven or eight regiments and\nkill a terrible lot of fine soldiers and capture forty Boer farmers and\ntwo women.  It is not the kind of war I care to report.  \"Nor mean to!\"\nI cannot make a book out of what little I've seen but I will come out\nabout even.  It has been very rough on Cecil.  Today I went to the\nMaine and asked Lady Randolph to give me a lift down to Cape Town as\nthe ship gets there two days ahead of the Castle Steamer.  So, they\nwere apparently very glad to have me and I am going on Saturday.  I\nlike it on the ship where I have been spending the day as it is fun\ntaking care of the wounded and listening to their stories.  I am to\nwrite an article for her next Anglo Saxon magazine on the Passing of\nthe War Correspondent.  The idea is that he must either disappear\naltogether like the Vivandiere or be allowed to do his work.  As it is\nnow the Government forces him upon the Generals against their will and\nso they get back by taking it out of him.  Either they should persuade\nthe Government that their objections to him are weighty and suppress\nhim altogether, or recognize him as a part of the outfit.  I don't much\ncare which as I certainly would never again go with an English army.  I\nam sorry the letters home have been so dull but I have had rather hard\nluck straight through, and the distances are so very great and the time\nspent in covering them seems very wasteful.  I shall be glad I saw it\nbecause it is the biggest thing as to scale that I ever saw of the\nsort, and I could not have afforded to have missed being in it.  It is\nthe first big modern war and all the conditions and weapons are new.  I\ndon't think the English have learned anything by it, because the fault\nlies entirely with their officers who are all or nearly all of one\nclass.\n\nDICK.\n\n\nMarch 25th, 1900.\n\nCape Town.\n\nThis is just to explain our plans and as they take a bit of explaining\nthis is meant for the Houses of Clark and of Davis.  So, pass it on--\nAfter Ladysmith was relieved Buller decided he would not move for a\nmonth, so I came back to join Roberts.  I could not do that on first\narriving because there was a Mail man with him.  I meant to do it later\nas a Herald man, and to let The Mail go.  But on arriving here, having\nspent a week in coming and having sold all my outfit at a loss, I found\nthat Roberts did not intend to move for three weeks either.  So I\ndecided I had seen enough to justify my returning.  There were other\nreasons, the chief one being that the English irritated me and I had so\nlittle sympathy with them that I could not write with any pleasure of\ntheir work.  My sporting blood refused to boil at the spectacle of such\na monster Empire getting the worst of it from an untrained band of\nfarmers-- I found I admired the farmers.  So we decided to chuck it and\ngo to London.  I would not have missed it for anything.  I would never\nhave been satisfied, if we had not come.  I have seen much of the\ncountry and the people, and of the army and its wonderful organization\nand discipline.  I enjoyed two battles--and the relief of Ladysmith is\none of the things to have seen, almost the best, if not the best.\nEvery officer and correspondent agrees that I got the pick of the\nfighting and the \"best story.\"  By the way, I beat all the London\npapers in getting out the news by one day.  At least, so Pryor, The\nMail manager tells me.  The paper was very much pleased.  We have now\ndecided to come home by the East Coast.  It was Cecil's idea and wish\nand I was only too glad to do it.  She says we certainly will never\ncome to this country again.  God help us if we do--and that it would be\ncriminal to spend seventeen blank days on the West coast when we could\nfill in the entire trip North on the East Coast at many ports.  It is a\nrather complicated trip as one has to change frequently but it will be\na great thing to have seen.  Cecil has really seen nothing at Cape Town\nand on this trip she will be paid for all the boredom that has gone\nbefore.  I have been over part of it and am sure.  Durban alone is one\nof the most curious cities I ever saw.  It is like the Midway at the\nFair.  I want her to have some fun out of this.  She has been so\nunselfish and fine all through and I hope I can make the rest of the\nadventure to her liking-- It is sure to be for after Delagoa Bay it is\nall real Africa not the shoddy \"colonial\" shopkeepers' paradise that we\nhave here.  And we are going to stop off at Zanzibar for some time\nwhere we have letters to everybody and where Cecil is to draw the\nSultan and I am to play him the \"Typical Tune of Zanzibar.\"  You will\nsee by our route that we spend two days or a day at many places and so\nshall get a good idea of the country.  The Konig is a 5,000 ton ship\nand we have two cabins-- From Port Said we will run up to Cairo to get\na dinner and then over to Constantinople to see Lloyd Griscom and the\ncity which Cecil has never visited.  Then to Paris by way of the Orient\nExpress.  Then London and back with Charley to Aix.  I feel sure that\none more course there will cure my leg for always.  As it is it has not\ntouched me once even during the campaign when I was wet and had to\nclimb hills, and at Ladysmith, where I had no food for a week.  Of\ncourse, if we get tired on the way up we may go straight on from Port\nSaid to Marseilles and so to London.  It seems funny to look upon Port\nSaid as being at home, but from this distance it seems as near New York\nas Boston-- You will get this when we reach Zanzibar or later and we\nwill cable when we can.\n\nDICK.\n\n\nIt was said at the time that Richard left the British forces because\nthe censors would not permit him to send out the truth about Buller's\nadvance, and that the English officials resented his going to report\nthe war from the Boer side.  The first statement my brother flatly\ndenied, and the fact that it was through the direct intervention of Sir\nAlfred Milner, assisted by the efforts of our consul Adelbert S. Hay at\nPretoria, that Richard was enabled to reach the Boer capital seems to\nprove the latter charge equally false.  Although throughout the war my\nbrother's sympathies were with the Boers, and in spite of the fact that\nthe papers he represented wanted him to report the war from the Boer\nside, he persisted in going at first with the British forces.  His\nreasons were that he wished to see a great army, with all modern\nequipment in action, and that practically all of his English friends\nwere with the British army.  \"My only reason for leaving it\", he wrote,\n\"was the fact that I found myself facing a month of idleness.  Had\nGeneral Buller continued his advance immediately after his relief of\nLadysmith I would have gone with his column and would probably have\nnever seen a Boer, except a Boer prisoner.\"\n\n\nRoyal Hotel,\n  Durban, Natal.\n\nApril 5th,  1900.\n\nDEAR MOTHER:\n\nWe arrived here to-day and got off in a special tug together.  We did\nthe basket trick all right, although the next time it came down a swell\nraised the tug and fractured every one in the basket except Sangree and\nRogers, the two New York correspondents who were hanging on by the\nupper edges.  Cecil loved the place which is the Midway Plaisance of\ncities and we had a good lunch and managed to get into the hotel where\nthere are over twenty cots in the reading room, and hall.  The\nCommandant objected to our going to Praetoria and seemed inclined to\nrefuse us passes to leave Durban for Delagoa Bay.  He also was rather\nfresh to Cecil, so I called him down very hard, and told him if he\ncouldn't make up his mind whether we would go or not, I'd wire to some\nothers who would help him to make up his mind quickly.  He said I was\nat liberty to do that, so I went out and burned wires over all of South\nAfrica.  As he reads all the telegrams he naturally read mine and the\nnext morning he was as humble and white as a head waiter.  But by ten\no'clock my wires began to bear fruit and he began to catch it.  Milner\nwired him to send us on at once and apologized to us by another wire so\nall is well and we go vouched for by the High Commissioner.\n\nDICK.\n\n\nPRETORIA, May 18th, 1900.\n\nDEAR DAD--AND OTHERS OF THE CLARK AND DAVIS FAMILIES:\n\nI have not had time to write such a long letter as this one must be, as\nI have been working on my Ledger and Scribner stories.\n\nCecil and I started to the \"front,\" which was then May 4th, at\nBrandfort with Captain Von Loosberg, a German baron who married in New\nOrleans and became an American citizen and who is now in command of\nLoosberg's Artillery in the Free State.  The night we left, the English\ntook Brandfort, so we decided to go only as far as Winburg.  The next\nmorning the train despatcher informed us Winburg was taken, so we\ndecided to go to Smalldeel, but that went during the afternoon, so we\nstopped at Kronstad.  From there, after a day's rest, we went to\nVentersberg station, and rode across to Ventersberg town, about two\nhours away, and put up in Jones's Hotel.  The next day we went down to\nthe Boer laagers on the Sand river and met President Steyn on the way.\nHe got out of his Cape Cart and gave Cecil a rose and Loosberg his\nfield glasses, which Cecil took from Loosberg in exchange for her own\nZeiss glass, and he gave me a drink and an interview.  He also gave us\na letter to St. Reid, who had established an ambulance base on Cronje's\nfarm, telling him to give Cecil something to sleep upon.  The, Boers\nwere very polite to Cecil and as she rode through the different camps\nevery man took off his hat.  We went back to Ventersberg that night and\nabout two o'clock Cecil came to my room and woke me up with the\nintelligence that the British were only two hours away.  She had heard\nthe commandant informing the landlady, a grand low comedy character\nfrom Brooklyn, who had the room next to Cecil's.  I interviewed the\nlandlady who was sitting up in bed in curl papers, and with a Webley\nrevolver.  She was quite hysterical so I aroused Loosberg who was too\nsleepy to understand.  The commandant could be heard in the distance\noffering his kingdom for a horse and a Cape cart.  Cecil and I decided\nour horses were done up and that we were too ignorant of the trail to\nknow where to run.  So we decided to go to sleep.  In the morning we\nconfessed that each had been afraid the other would want to escape, and\neach wanted only to be allowed to go to sleep again.  Loosberg's Cape\nCart and five mules having arrived we packed our things on it and\nstarted again for the Sand River where we spent the night on Cronje's\nfarm.  Mrs. Cronje had taken away all the bedding but Dr. Reid gave\nCecil his field mattress and I made one out of rugs and piano covers.\nIn the morning I found that the iron straps of the mattress had marked\nme for life like a grilled beefsteak.  There were only Reid and his\nassistant surgeon in the farmhouse and they were greatly excited at\nhaving a woman to look after.\n\nWe bade farewell to Loosberg who had found his artillery push, and\nstarted off in his Cape Cart which he wished us to use and take back\nfor him for safety to Del Hay at Pretoria.  Our objective point was the\nrailroad bridge over the sand.  The Boers were on one bank, the British\nabout seven miles back on the other, the trail ran along the British\nside of the river which was sad of it.  However, we drove on, I riding\nand Cecil and Christian, the Kaffir, in the Cart.  We saw no one for\nseveral hours except some Kaffir Kraals and we almost ran into two\nherds of deer.  I counted twenty-six in one herd, they were about a\nquarter of a mile away.  We came to a cross road and I decided to put\nback as we had lost track of the river and were bearing straight into\nthe English lines.  Just as we found the river again and had got across\na drift cannon opened on our right.  We then knew we were in between\nthe Boers and the English but we had no other knowledge of our\ngeographical position.  Such being the case we decided to outspan and\nlunch.  Out-spanning is setting the mules and horses at liberty,\nin-spanning trying to catch them again.  It takes five minutes to\nout-span, and three hours to in-span.  We had Armour's corned beef and\nLibby's canned bacon.  Cecil cooked the bacon on a stick and we ate it\nwith biscuits captured by our Boer friends at Cronje's farm from the\nEnglish Tommies.  About three o'clock we started off again, and were\ncaptured by three Boers.  I was riding behind the cart and threw up my\nhands \"that quick,\" but Cecil could not hear me yelling at her to stop\non account of the noise of the cart.  I knew if I rode after her they\nwould shoot at me, and that if she didn't stop, as they were shouting\nat her to do, they would shoot her.  Under these trying circumstances I\nsat still.  It caused quite a coolness on Cecil's part.  However the\nBoers could see I was trying to get her to halt so they only rode\naround and headed her off.  We were so glad to see them that they could\nnot be suspicious.  Still, as we had come directly from the English\nlines they had doubts.  We told them we had lost ourselves and the more\nthey threatened to take us to the commandant the more satisfied we\nwere.  I insisted on taking photos of them reading Cecil's passport.\nIt annoyed them that we refused to be serious, we assured them we had\nnever met anyone we were so glad to see.  They finally believed us, and\nour passports which describe Cecil as my \"frau,\" and artist of Harper's\nWeekly, an idea of Loosberg's.  We all smoked and then shook hands and\nthey went back to their positions.  We next met Christian De Vet one of\nthe two big generals who is a grand character.  Nothing could match the\nwonderful picturesqueness of his camp spread out over the side of a\nhill with the bearded fine featured old Van Dyck and Hugonot heads\nunder great sombreros.  De Vet made us a long speech saying it was only\nto be expected that the Great Republic would send men to help the\nlittle Republics, but he had not hoped that the women would show their\nsympathy by coming too.  All this with the most simple  earnest\ncourtesy.  He said \"No English woman would dare do what you are doing.\"\nHe showed us a farin house on a kopje about five miles off where he\nsaid we could get shelter and where we would be near the fighting on\nthe morrow.  We rode in the moonlight for some time but when we reached\nthe house it was filthy and the people were in such terror that we\ndecided to camp out in the veldt.  We found a grove of trees near by\nand a stream of water running beside it so we made a fire there.  We\nhad only one biscuit left but several cans of bacon and tea.  It was\ngreat fun and we sat up as late as we could around the fire on account\nof the cold.  We could see the Boer fires in the moonlight on the hills\nand across the Sand, the English flashlights signalling all night.  We\nput a rubber blanket on the grass and wrapped up in steamer rugs but\nboth of us died several times of cold and even sitting on the fire\nfailed to warm me.  We were awakened out of a cold storage sort of\nsleep by pom-poms going off right over our They sounded just as\ndisturbing I found from the rear as when you are in front of them.\nThey are the most effective of all the small guns for causing your\nnerves to riot.  We climbed up the hill and saw the English coming in\ntheir usual solid formation stretching out for three miles.  We went\nback and got the cart and drove to a nearer kopje, but just as we\nreached it the Boers abandoned it.  Roberts's column was now much\nnearer.  We then drove on still further in the direction of the bridge.\nI kept telling Cecil that the firing was all from the Boers as I did\nnot want Christian to bolt and run away with the cart and mules.  But\nCecil remembered the pictures in Harper's Weekly showing the shrapnel\nsmoke making rings in the air and as she saw these floating over our\nhead, she knew the English were firing on us, but said nothing for fear\nof scaring Christian.  I had promised to get her under fire which was\nher one wish so I said that she was now well under fire for the first\nand the last time.  To which she replied \"Pshaw!\"  I never saw any one\nshow such self possession.  We halted the cart behind a deserted farm\nhouse, and saddled her pony.  The shells were now falling all over the\nshop, and I was scared to distraction.  But she took about five minutes\nto see that her saddle was properly tightened and then we rode up to\nthe hill.  Again the Boers were leaving and only a few remained.  They\nwarned her to keep back but we dismounted and walked up to the hill.\nIt was a very hot place but Cecil was quite unmoved.  We showed her the\nshells striking back of her and around her but she refused to be\nimpressed with the danger.  She went among the Boers begging them to\nmake a stand very quietly and like one man to another and they took it\njust in that way and said \"But we are very tired.  We have been driven\nback for three days.  We are only a thousand, they are twenty\nthousand.\"  Some of them only sat still too proud to run, too sick to\nfight!  When the British got within five hundred yards of the artillery\nI told her she must run.  At the same moment Botha's men a mile on our\nright broke away in a mad gallop, as though the lancers were after\nthem.  I finally got her on her pony and we raced for Ventersberg with\nChristian a good first.  He had lost all desire to out-span.\n\nAt Ventersberg we found every one harnessing up in the street and\nabandoning everything.  We again felt this untimely desire for food,\nand had lunch at Jones's hotel on scraps and Cecil went off to see if\nshe could loot the cook, as everyone but her had left the hotel and as\nwe needed one in Pretoria.  A despatch-rider came running to me as I\nwas smoking in the garden and shouted that the \"Roinekes\" were coming\nin force over the hill.  I ran out in the street and saw their shells\nfalling all over the edge of the village.  They were only a quarter of\nan hour behind us.  I yelled for Cecil who was helping the looted cook\npack up her own things and anyone else's she could find in a sheet.  I\ngathered up a dog and a kitten Cecil wanted and left a note for the\nnext English officer who occupied my room with the inscription \"I'd\nleave my happy home for you.\"  We then put the cook, the kitten, the\ndog and Cecil in the cart and I got on the horse and we let out for\nKronstad at a gallop.  We raced the thirty miles in five hours without\none halt.  That was not our cruelty to animals but Christian's who\nwhenever I ordered him to halt and let us rest, yelled that the\nEnglesses were after us and galloped on.  The retreat was a terribly\npathetic spectacle; for hours we passed through group after group of\nthe broken and dispirited Boers.  At Kronstad President Steyn whom I\nwent to see on arriving ordered a special car for me, and sent us off\nat once.  We reached here the next morning, Christian arriving a day\nlater having killed one mule and one pony in his eagerness to escape.\nWe are going back again as soon as Roberts reaches the Vaal.  There\nthere must be a stand.  Love and best wishes to you all----\n\nDICK.\n\n\nJune 8th, 1900.\n\nOn board the Kausler.\n\nDEAR MOTHER:\n\nWe engaged our passage on this ship some weeks ago not thinking we\nwould have the English near Pretoria until August.  But as it happened\nthey came so near that we did not know whether or not to wait over and\nsee them enter the capital.  I decided not, first, because after that\none event, there would be nothing for us to see or do.  We could not\nleave until the 2nd of July and a month under British martial law was\nvery distasteful to me.  Besides I did not care much to see them enter,\nor to be forced to witness their rejoicing.  As soon as we got under\nway and about half the distance to the coast, it is a two days' trip.\nWe heard so many rumors of Roberts's communication having been cut off\nand that the war was not over, that we thought perhaps we ought to go\nback-- As we have no news since except that the British are in Pretoria\nwe still do not know what to think.  Personally I am glad I came away\nas I can do just as much for the Boers at home now as there where the\nBritish censor would have shut me off from cabling and mails are so\nslow.  With the local knowledge I have, I hope to keep at it until it\nis over.  But when I consider the magnitude of the misrepresentation\nabout the burghers I feel appalled at the idea of going up against it.\nOne is really afraid to tell all the truth about the Boer because no\none would believe you-- It is almost better to go mildly and then you\nmay have some chance.  But personally I know no class of men I admire\nas much or who to-day preserve the best and oldest ideas of charity,\nfairness and good-will to men.\n\nDICK.\n\n\nJune 29th, 1900.\n\nDEAR MOTHER:\n\nWe are now just off Crete, and our next sight of the blue land will be\nEurope.  It means so many things; being alone with Cecil again, instead\nof on a raft touching elbows with so many strangers, and it means a\nshop where you can buy collars, and where they put starch in your\nlinen.  Also many beautiful ladies one does not know and men in evening\ndress one does not know and green tables covered with gold and little\ngreen and red bits of ivory where one passes among the tables and\nwonders what they would think if they knew we two had found our\ngreatest friends in the Boer farmers, in Dutch Station Masters who gave\nus a corner under the telegraph table in which to sleep, with Nelson\nwho kept the Transvaal Steam Laundry, Col. Lynch of the steerage who\ncomes to the dividing line to beg French books from Cecil, and that we\nhad cooked our food on sticks, drunk out of the same cups with Kaffir\nservants and slept on the ground when there was frost on it.  It will\nbe so strange to find that there are millions of people who do not know\nKomali poort, who have thought of anything else except burghers and\nroor-i-neks-- It seems almost disloyal to the Boers to be glad to see\nnewspapers only an hour old instead of six weeks old, and to welcome\nall the tyranny of collar buttons, scarf pins, watch chains, walking\nsticks and gloves even.  I love them both and I can hardly believe it\nis true that we are to go to a real hotel with a lift and a chasseur,\nwhere you cannot smoke in the dining-room.  As for Aix, that I cannot\nbelieve will ever happen-- It was just a part of one's honeymoon and I\nrefuse to cheat myself into thinking that within a week I will be\nriding through the lanes of the little villages, drinking red wine at\nBurget, watching Chas spread cheese over great hunks of bread and\nlistening to three bands at one time.  And then the joy to follow of\nHome and America and all that is American.  Even the Custom House holds\nnothing but joy for me--and then \"mine own people!\"  It has been six\nweeks since we have heard from you or longer, nearly two months and how\nI miss you and want you.  It will be a happy day when Dad meets me at\nthe wharf and I can see his blue and white tie again and his dear face\nunder the white hat--where you and Nora will be I cannot tell, but I\nwill seek you out.  We will be happy together--so happy-- It has been\nthe longest separation we have known and such a lot of things have\nhappened.  It will be such peace to see you and hold you once again.\n\nDICK.\n\n\nAIX-LES-BAINS.\n\nJuly 6th, 1900.\n\nDEAR FAMILY:\n\nCecil and I arrived last night tired and about worn out--we had had a\nmonth on board ship and two days in the cars and when we got out at Aix\nand found our rooms ready and Francois waiting, we shouted and cheered.\nIt was never so beautiful as it looked in the moonlight and we walked\nall over it, through the silent streets chortling with glee.  They\ncould not give us our same rooms but we got the suite just above them,\nwhich is just as good.  They were so extremely friendly and glad to see\nus and had flowers in all the rooms.  We have not heard a word about\nChas yet, as our mail has not arrived from Paris, but I will cable in a\nminute and hear.  We cannot wait any longer for news of him.  I got up\nat seven this morning so excited that I could not sleep and have been\nto the baths, where I was received like the President of the Republic.\nIn fact everybody seems to have only the kindest recollections of us\nand to be glad to have us back.\n\nSuch a rest as it is and so clean and bright and good--Only I have\nabsolutely nothing to wear except a two pound flannel suit I bought at\nLorenzo Marquez until I get some built by a French tailor.  I must wear\na bath robe or a bicycle suit until evening.  We have not been to the\nhaunts of evil yet but we are dining there to night and all will be\nwell.  Cecil sends her love to you all-- Goodbye and God bless you.\n\n\n\nRichard and his wife returned to America in the early fall of 1900 and,\nafter a visit to Mr. and Mrs. Clark at Marion, settled for the winter\nin New York.  They took a house in East Fifty-eighth Street where they\ndid much entertaining and lived a very social existence, but I do not\nimagine that either of them regarded the winter as a success.  Richard\nwas unable to do his usual amount of work, and both he and his wife\nwere too fond of the country to enjoy an entire winter in town.  In the\nspring they went back to Marion.\n\n\nMARION,\n  MASSACHUSETTS.  May, 1901.\n\nWe arrived here last night in a glowing sunset which was followed by a\ngrand moon.  The house was warm and clean and bright, with red curtains\nand open fires and everything was just as we had left it, so that it\nseemed as though we had just come out of a tortuous bad dream of\nasphalt and L. roads and bad air.  I was never so glad to get away from\nNew York.\n\nOutside it is brisk and fine and smells of earth and melting snow and\nthere is a grand breeze from the bay.  We took a long walk to-day, with\nthe three dogs, and it was pitiful to see how glad they were to be free\nof the cellar and a back yard and at large among grass and rocks and\nroots of trees.  I wanted to bottle up some of the air and send it to\nall of my friends in New York.  It is so much better to smell than\nhot-house violets.  Seaton came on with us to handle the dogs and to\nunpack and so to-day we are nearly settled already with silver,\npictures, clothes and easels and writing things all in place.  The\ngramophone is whirling madly and all is well-- Lots and lots of love.\n\nDICK.\n\n\nThe following was written by Richard to his mother on her birthday:\n\nMARION, MASSACHUSETTS.\n\nJune 27th, 1901.\n\nDEAR MOTHER:\n\nIn those wonderful years of yours you never thought of the blessing you\nwere to us, only of what good you could find in us.  All that time, you\nwere helping us and others, and making us better, happier, even nobler\npeople.  From the day you struck the first blow for labor, in The Iron\nMills on to the editorials in The Tribune, The Youth's Companion and\nThe Independent, with all the good the novels, the stories brought to\npeople, you were always year after year making the ways straighter,\nlifting up people, making them happier and better.  No woman ever did\nbetter for her time than you and no shrieking suffragette will ever\nunderstand the influence you wielded, greater than hundreds of\nthousands of women's votes.\n\nWe love you dear, dear mother, and we KNOW you and may your coming\nyears be many and as full of happiness for yourself as they are for us.\n\nRICHARD.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XIII\n\nTHE SPANISH AND ENGLISH CORONATIONS\n\nInterrupted by frequent brief visits to New York Philadelphia, and\nBoston, Richard and his wife remained in Marion from May, 1901, until\nthe early spring of 1902.  During this year Richard accomplished a\ngreat deal of work and lived an ideal existence.  In the summer months\nthere were golf and tennis and an army of visitors, and during the\nwinter many of their friends came from New York to enjoy a most\ncharming hospitality and the best of duck shooting and all kinds of\nwinter sports.\n\nLate in April, they sailed for Gibraltar on their way to Madrid, where\nRichard was to report the coronation ceremonies, and from Madrid they\nwent to Paris and then to London to see the coronation of King Edward.\nIt was while on a visit to the Rudyard Kiplings that they heard the\nnews that Edward had been suddenly stricken with a serious illness and\nthat the ceremony had been postponed.\n\n\n11, St. James's Place,\n  St. James's Street, S. W.\n    London.\n\nJune, 1902.\n\nDEAR MOTHER:--\n\nThis is only to say that at the Kipling's we heard the news, and being\ntwo newspaper men, refused to believe it and went to the postoffice of\nthe little village to call up Brighton on the 'phone.  It was very\ndramatic, the real laureate of the British Empire asking if the King\nwere really in such danger that he could not be crowned, while the\nsmall boy in charge of the grocery shop, where the postoffice was, wept\nwith his elbows on the counter.  They sent me my ticket--unasked--for\nthe Abbey, early this morning, and while I was undecided whether to\nkeep it--or send it back, this came.  So, now, I shall frame it as a\nsouvenir of one of the most unhappy occasions I ever witnessed.  You\ncan form no idea of what a change it has made.  It really seems to have\nstunned every one--that is the usual and accepted word, but this time\nit describes it perfectly.\n\nGoodbye,\n  DICK.\n\n\nDuring the summer of 1903 my mother and father occupied a cottage at\nMarion, and every morning Richard started the day by a visit to them.\nMy brother had already bought his Crossroads Farm at Mount Kisco, and\nthe new house was one of the favorite topics of their talk.  The\nfollowing letter was written by my mother to Richard, after her return\nto Philadelphia.\n\n\nSeptember, 1903.\n\nHere we are in the old library and breakfast over.  There seemed an\nawful blank in the world as I sat down just now, and I said to Dad \"Its\nDick--he must come THIS morning.\"\n\nYou don't know how my heart used to give a thump when you and Bob came\nin that old door.  It has been such a good month--everybody was so\nfriendly--and Dad was so well and happy--but your visits were the core\nof it all.  And our good drives!  Well we'll have lots of drives at the\nCrossroads.  You'll call at our cottage every morning and I'm going to\ntrain the peacocks to run before the trap and I'll be just like Juno.\n\nThere isn't a scrap of news.  It is delightfully cool here.\n\nM.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XIV\n\nTHE JAPANESE-RUSSIAN WAR\n\nDuring the fall and early winter of 1903 Richard and his wife lingered\non in Marion, but came to New York after the Christmas holidays.  The\nsuccess of his farce \"The Dictator\" had been a source of the greatest\npleasure to Richard, and he settled down to playwriting with the same\nintense zeal he put into all of his work.  However, for several years\nRobert J.  Collier and my brother had been very close friends, and\nRichard had written many articles and stories for Collier's Weekly, so\nthat when Collier urged my brother to go to the Japanese-Russian War as\ncorrespondent with the Japanese forces, Richard promptly gave up his\nplaywriting and returned to his old love--the role of reporter.\nAccompanied by his wife, Richard left New York for San Francisco in\nFebruary.\n\n\nFebruary, 1904.\n\nDEAR MOTHER:\n\nWe are really off on the \"long trail\" bound for the boundless East.  We\nhave a charming drawing-room, a sympathetic porter and a courtly\nconductor descended from one of the first Spanish conquerors of\nCalifornia.  We arranged the being late for lunch problem by having\ndinner at five and cutting the lunch out.  Bruce and Nan came over for\ndinner and we had a very jolly time.  They all asked after you all, and\ndrank to our re-union at Marion in July.  Later they all tried to come\nwith us on the train.  It looked so attractive with electric lights in\neach seat, and observation car and library.  A reporter interviewed us\nand Mr. Clark gave us a box of segars and a bottle of whiskey.  But\nthey will not last, as will Dad's razors and your housewife.  I've used\nDad's razors twice a day, and they still are perfect.  It's snowing\nagain, but we don't care.  They all came to the station to see us off\nbut no one cried this time as they did when we went to South Africa.\nSomehow we cannot take this trip seriously.  It is such a holiday trip\nall through not grim and human like the Boer war.  Just quaint and\nqueer.  A trip of cherry blossoms and Geisha girls.  I send all my love\nto you.\n\nDICK.\n\n\nSAN FRANCISCO, February 26th.\n\nDEAR MOTHER:\n\nWe got in here last night at midnight just as easily as though we were\ncoming into Jersey City.  Before we knew it we had seen the Golden\nGate, and were snug in this hotel.  Today as soon as we learned we\ncould not sail we started in to see sights and we made a record and\nhung it up high.  We went to the Cliff House and saw the seals on the\nrocks below, to the Park, the military reservation, Chinatown, and the\nPoodle Dog Restaurant.  We also saw the Lotta monument, the Stevenson\nmonument, the Spreckles band stand, the place where the Vigilance\nCommittee hung the unruly, and tonight I went to a dinner the Bohemian\nClub gave to the War correspondents.  I made a darned good speech.\nThink of ME making a speech of any sort, but I did, and I had sense\nenough not to talk about the war but the \"glorious climate of\nCalifornia\" instead and of all the wonders of Frisco.  So, I made a\ngreat hit.  It certainly is one of the few cities that lives up to it's\nreputation in every way.  I should call it the most interesting city,\nwith more character back of it than any city on this continent.  There\nare only four deck rooms and we each have one.  The boat is small, but\nin spite of the crowd that is going on her, will I think be\ncomfortable.  I know it will be that, and it may be luxurious.\n\nDICK.\n\n\nOn way to Japan.\n\nMarch 13th, 1904.\n\nAbout four this afternoon we saw an irregular line of purple mountains\nagainst a yellow sky, and it was Japan.  In spite of the Sunday papers,\nand the interminable talk on board, the guide books and maps which had\nmade Japan nauseous to me, I saw the land of the Rising Sun with just\nas much of a shock and thrill as I first saw the coast of Africa.  We\nforgot entirely we had been twenty days at sea and remembered only that\nwe were ten miles from Japan, only as far as New Bedford is from\nMarion.  We are at anchor now, waiting to go in in the morning.  Were\nit not for war we could go in now but we must wait to be piloted over\nthe sunken mines.  That and the flashlights moving from the cruisers\nten miles away gave us our first idea of war.  To-morrow early we will\nbe off for Tokio, as it is only forty miles from Yokohama.  Of course,\nI may get all sorts of news before we land, but that is what we expect\nto do.  It will be good to feel solid earth, and to see the kimonos and\ntemples and geishas and cherry blossoms.  I am almost hoping the\nGovernment won't let us go to the front and that for a week at least\nCecil and I can sit in tea houses with our shoes off while the nesans\nbring us tea and the geishas rub their knees and make bows to us.  I am\nsending you through Harper's, a book on Hawaii and one of Japan that I\nhave read and like and which I think will help you to keep in touch\nwith the wanderers.  With all my love to all.\n\nDICK.\n\n\nTOKYO, March 22nd, 1904.\n\nDEAR MOTHER:\n\nThe \"situation\" here continues to remain in such doubt that I cannot\ntell of it, as it changes hourly.  There are three \"columns,\" so far\nexisting only in imagination.  That is, so far as they concern the\ncorrespondents.  The first lot have chosen themselves, and so have the\nsecond lot.  But the first lot are no nearer starting than they were\ntwo weeks ago.  I may be kept waiting here for weeks and weeks.  I do\nnot like to turn out Palmer, although I very much want to go with the\nfirst bunch.  On the other hand I am paid pretty well to get to the\nfront, and I am uncertain as to what I ought to do.  If the second\ncolumn were to start immediately after the first, we then would have\ntwo men in the field, but if it does not, then Collier will be paying\n$1000. a week for stories of tea houses and \"festivals.\"  Palmer\nthreatens to resign if I take his place in the first column and that\nwould be a loss to the paper that I do not feel I could make up.  If it\ngets any more complicated I'll wire Collier to decide.\n\nMeanwhile, we are going out to dinners and festivals and we ride.  I\nhave a good pony the paper paid for Cecil has hired another and we find\nit delightful to scamper out into the country.  We have three rooms in\na row.  One we use for a sitting room.  They look very welland as it is\nstill cold we keep them cheerful with open fires.  We have a table in\nthe dining-room to ourselves and to which we can ask our friends.  The\nfood is extremely good.  Griscom and the Secretaries have all called\nand sent pots of flowers, and we are dining out every other night.  In\nthe day we shop and ride.  But all day and all night we the\ncorrespondents plot and slave and intrigue over the places on the\ncolumns.  I got mine on the second column all right but no one knows if\nit ever will move.  So, naturally, I want to be on the first.  The rows\nare so engrossing that I have not enjoyed the country as I expected.\nStill, I am everlastingly glad we came.  It is an entirely new life and\naspect.  It completes so much that we have read and seen.  In spite of\nthe bother over the war passes I learn things daily and we see\nbeautiful and curious things, and are educated as to the East, as no\nbooks could have done it for us.  John Bass who was my comrade in arms\nin Greece and his wife are here.  They are the very best.  Also we see\nLloyd daily, and the hotel is full of amusing men, who are trying to\nget to the front.  Of course, we know less of the war than you do.\nNone of the news from Cheefoo, none of the \"unauthorized\" news reaches\nus.  Were it not for our own squabbles we would not know not only that\nthe country was at war but not even that war existed ANYWHERE in the\nworld.  We are here entirely en tourist and it cannot be helped.  The\nmen who tried to go with the Russians are equally unfortunate.  Think\nof us as wandering around each with a copy of Murray seeing sights.\nThat is all we really do,  All my love.\n\nDICK.\n\n\nYOKOHAMA--April 2, 1904.\n\nDEAR MOTHER:\n\nI just got your letter dated the 28th of February and the days\nfollowing in which you worried over me in the ice coated trenches of\nKorea.  I read it in a rickshaw in a warm sun on my way to buy favors\nfor a dinner to Griscom.  We have had three warm days and no doubt the\nsun will be out soon.  The loss of the sun, though, is no great one.\nWe have lots of pleasures and lots of troubles in spite of the Sun.\nYesterday the first batch of correspondents were sent on their way.  I\ndoubt if they will get any further than Chemulpo but their going\ncheered the atmosphere like a storm in summer.  The diplomats and\nJapanese were glad to get rid of them, they were delighted to be off.\nSome had been here 58 days, and we all looked at it as a good sign as\nit now puts us \"next.\"  But after they had gone it was pretty blue for\nsome of them were as good friends as I want.  I know few men I like as\nwell as I do John Bass.  Many of them were intensely interesting.  It\nwas, by all odds, the crowd one would have wished to go with.  As it\nis, I suspect we all will meet again and that the two columns will be\nmerged on the Yalu.  None of the attaches have been allowed to go, so\nit really is great luck for the correspondents.  Tell Chas I still am\nbuying my Kit.  It's pretty nearly ready now.  I began in New York and\nkept on in Boston, San Francisco, and here.  It always was my boast\nthat I had the most complete kit in the world, and in spite of\nCharley's jeers at my lack of preparedness everybody here voted it the\ngreatest ever seen.  For the last ten days all the Jap saddlers, tent\nmakers and tinsmiths have been copying it.\n\nDICK.\n\n\nTOKIO--May 2, 1904.\n\nDEAR MOTHER:\n\nToday, we walked into our new house and tomorrow we will settle down\nthere.  We rented the furniture for the two unfurnished rooms; knives,\nforks, spoons, china for the table and extras for 35 dollars gold for\ntwo months.  It took six men to bring the things in carts.  They got\nnothing.  Yesterday, I took two rickshaw men from half past twelve to\nhalf past five.  Out of that time they ran and pushed me for two solid\nhours.  Their price for the five hours was eighty cents gold.  What you\nwould pay a cabman to drive you from the Waldorf to Martin's.  I wish\nyou could see our menage.  Such beautiful persons in grey silk kimonos\nwho bow, and bow and slip and slide in spotless torn white stockings\nwith one big toe.  They make you ashamed of yourself for walking on\nyour own carpet in your own shoes.  Today we got the first news of the\nbattle on the Yalu, the battle of April 26-30th.  I suppose Palmer and\nBass saw it; and I try to be glad I did what was right by Collier's\ninstead of for myself.  But I don't want to love another paper.  I\nsuppose there will be other fights but that one was the first, and it\nmust have been wonderful.  On the 4th we expect to be on our way to\nKioto with Lloyd and his wife and John Fox.  By that time we expect to\nbe settled in the new house.\n\nDICK.\n\n\nTOKIO, May 22nd, 1904.\n\nDEAR MOTHER:\n\nYou will be glad to hear that the correspondents at the front are not\nallowed within two and a half miles of the firing line.  This I am sure\nyou will approve.  Their tales of woe have just been received here, and\nthey certainly are having a hard time.  The one thing they all hope for\nis that the Japs will order them home.  My temper is vile to-day, as I\ncannot enjoy the gentle pleasures of this town any longer and with this\nlong trip to Port Arthur before I can turn towards home.  I am as cross\nas a sick bear.  We were at Yokohama when your last letters came and\nthey were a great pleasure.  I got splendid news of The Dictator.\nYesterday we all went to Yokohama.  There are four wild American boys\nhere just out of Harvard who started the cry of \"Ping Yang\" for the\n\"Ping Yannigans\" they being the \"Yannigans.\"  They help to make things\nvery lively and are affectionately regarded by all classes.  Yesterday,\nthey and Fox and Cecil and I went to the races, with five ricksha boys\neach, and everybody lost his money except myself.  But it was great\nfun.  It rained like a seive, and all the gentlemen riders fell off,\nand every time we won money our thirty ricksha men who would tell when\nwe won by watching at which window we had bet, would cheer us and\nsalaam until to save our faces we had to scatter largesses.  Egan\nturned up in the evening and dined with John and Cecil and me in the\nGrand Hotel and told us first of all the story the correspondents had\nbrought back to Kobbe for which every one from the Government down has\nbeen waiting.  It would make lively reading if any of us dared to write\nit.  To-day he made his protests to Fukushima as we mapped them out\nlast night and the second lot will I expect be treated better.  But, as\nthe first lot were the important men representing the important\nsyndicates the harm, for the Japs, has been done.  Of course, much they\ndo is through not knowing our points of view.  To them none of us is of\nany consequence except that he is a nuisance, and while they are\nconversationally perfect in politeness, the regulations they inflict\nare too insulting.  However, you don't care about that, and neither do\nI.  I am going to earn my money if I possibly can, and come home.\n\nDICK.\n\n\nTOKIO, June 13th, 1904.\n\nDEAR MOTHER:\n\nWe gave a farewell dinner last night to the Ping Yannigans two of whom\nleft on the Navy expedition and another one to-morrow for God's\ncountry.  There were eight men and we had new lanterns painted with the\narms of Corea and the motto of the Ping Yannigans.  Also many flags.\nAll but the Japanese flag.  One of them with a side glance at the\nservants said, \"Gentleman and Lady:  I propose a toast, Japan for the\nJapanese and the Japanese for Japan.\"  We all knew what he meant but\nthe servants were greatly pleased.  Jack London turned up to-day on his\nway home.  I liked him very much.  He is very simple and modest and\ngave you a tremendous impression of vitality and power.  He is very\nbitter against the wonderful little people and says he carries away\nwith him only a feeling of irritation.  But I told him that probably\nwould soon wear off and he would remember only the pleasant things.  I\ndid envy him so, going home after having seen a fight and I not yet\nstarted.  Still THIS TIME we may get off.  Yokoyama the contractor\ntakes our stuff on the 16th, and so we feel it is encouraging to have\nour luggage at the front even if we are here.\n\nDICK.\n\n\nYOKOHAMA, July 26th, 1904.\n\nDEAR MOTHER:\n\nWe gave in our passes to-day, and sail to-morrow at five.  They say we\nare not to see Port Arthur fall but are to be taken up to Oku's army.\nThat means we miss the \"popular\" story, and may have to wait around\nseveral weeks before we see the other big fight.  They promised us Port\nArthur but that is reason enough for believing they do not intend we\nshall see it at all.  John and I are here at a Japanese hotel, the one\nLi Hung Chang occupied when he came over to arrange the treaty between\nChina and Japan.  It is a very beautiful house, the best I have seen of\nreal Japanese and the garden and view of the harbor is magnificent.  I\nwish Cecil could see it too, but I know she would not care for a room\nwhich is as free to the public view as the porch at Marion.  It has 48\nmats and as a mat is 3 x 5 you can work it out.  We eat, sleep and\ndress in this room and it is like trying to be at home on top of a\nChickering Grand.  But it is very beautiful and the moonlight is fine\nand saddening.  No one of us has the least interest in the war or in\nwhat we may see or be kept from seeing.  We have been \"over trained\"\nand not even a siege of London could hold our thoughts from home.  I\nhave just missed the mail which would have told me you were at Marion.\nI should so love to have heard from you from there.  I do not think you\nwill find the Church house uncomfortable; and you can always run across\nthe road when the traffic is not too great, and chat with Benjamin.  I\ndo hope that Dad will have got such good health from Marion and such\nlashers of fish.  I got a good letter from Charles and I certainly feel\nguilty at putting extra work on a man as busy as he.  Had I known he\nwas the real judge of those prize stories I would have sent him one\nmyself and given him the name of it.  Well, goodbye for a little time.\nWe go on board in a few hours, and after that everything I write you is\nread by the Censor so I shall not say anything that would gratify their\ncuriosity.  They think it is unmanly to write from the field to one's\nfamily and the young princes forbade their imperial spouses from\nwriting them until the war is over.  However, not being an imperial\nSamaari but a home loving, family loving American, I shall miss not\nhearing very much, and not being able to tell you all how I love you.\n\nDICK.\n\n\n\nDALNY, July 27th, 1904.\n\nDEAR MOTHER:\n\nWe left Shimonoseki three days ago and have had very pleasant going on\nthe Heijo Maru a small but well run ship of 1,500 tons.  Fox and I got\none of the two best rooms and I have been very comfortable.  We are at\nanchor now at a place of no interest except for its sunsets.\n\nWe have just been told as the anchor is being lowered that we can send\nletters back by the Island, so I can just dash this off before leaving.\nWe have reached Dalny and I have just heard the first shot fired which\nwas to send me home.  All the others came and bid John and me a\nfarewell as soon as we were sure it was the sound of cannon.  However,\nas it is 20 miles away I'll have to hang on until I get a little\nnearer.  We have had a very pleasant trip even though we were delayed\ntwo days by fog and a slow convoy.  Now we are here at Dalny.  It looks\nnot at all like its pictures, which, as I remember them were all taken\nin winter.  It is a perfectly new, good brick barracks-like town. I am\nlanding now.  The two servants seem very satisfactory and I am in\nexcellent health.  Today Cecil has been four days at Hong Kong.  Please\nsend the gist of this letter dull as it is to Mrs. Clark.  When I began\nit I thought I would have plenty of time to finish it on shore.  Of\ncourse, after this all I write and this too, I suppose will be\ncensored.  So, there will not be much liveliness.  I have no taste to\nexpose my affections to the Japanese staff.  So, goodbye.\n\nR.\n\n\n\nJuly 31st, 1904.\n\nDEAR MOTHER:\n\nWe have been met here with a bitter disappointment.  We are all to be\nsent north, although only 18 hours away.  We can hear the guns at Port\nArthur the fall of which they promised us we would see.  To night we\nare camping out in one of the Russian barracks.  To-morrow we go,\npartly by horse and partly by train.  A week must elapse before we can\nget near headquarters.  And then we have no guarantee that we will see\nany fighting.  This means for me a long delay.  It is very\ndisappointing and the worst of the many we have suffered in the last\nfour months.  I have written Cecil asking her to seriously think of\ngoing home but I am afraid she will not.  Were it not for that and the\ndisappointment one feels in travelling a week's journey away from the\nsound of guns I would be content.  My horse is well and so am I.  It is\ngood to get back to drawing water, and carrying baggage and skirmishing\nabout for yourself.  The contractor gave us a good meal and the\nservants are efficient but I like doing things myself and skirmishing\nfor them.  We make a short ride this morning of six miles to Kin Chow\nand then 30 miles by rail.  \"Headquarters\" is about a five days ride\ndistant.  Tell Chas my outfit seems nearly complete.  Maybe I can buy a\nfew things I forgot in Boston at Kin Chow.  Fox and I will get out just\nas soon as we see fighting but before you get this you will probably\nhear by cable from me.  If not, it will mean we still are waiting for a\nfight.  The only mistake I made was in not going home the first time\nthey deceived us instead of waiting for this and worst of all.\n\nto you all.\n\nDICK.\n\n\nMANCHURIA, August 14, 1904.\n\nWe have been riding through Manchuria for eleven days.  Nine days we\nrode then two days we rested.  By losing the trail we managed to\naverage about 20 miles a day.  I kept well and enjoyed it very much.\nAs I had to leave my servant behind with a sick horse, I had to take\ncare of my mule and pony myself and hunt fodder for them, so I was\npretty busy.  Saiki did all he could, but he is not a servant and\nsooner than ask him I did things myself.  We passed through a very\nbeautiful country, sleeping at railway stations and saw two battle\nfields of recent fights.  Now we are in a Chinese City and waiting to\nsee what should be the biggest fight since Sedan.  The Russians are\nabout ten miles from us, so we are not allowed outside the gates of the\ncity without a guide.  Of course, we have none of that freedom we have\nenjoyed in other wars, but apart from that they treat us very well\nindeed.  And in a day or two they promise us much fighting, which we\nwill be allowed to witness from a hill.  This is a very queer old city\nbut the towns and country are all very primitive and we depend upon\nourselves for our entertainment.  I expect soon to see you at home.  In\nthree more days I shall have been out here five months and that is too\nlong.  Good luck to you all.\n\nR. H. D.\n\n\nMANCHURIA, August 18th, 1904.\n\nWe still are inside this old Chinese town.  It has rained for five\ndays, and this one is the first in which we could go abroad.  Unless\nyou swim very well it is not safe to cross one of these streets.  We\nhave found an old temple and some of us are in it now.  It is such a\nrelief to escape from that compound and the rain.  This place is full\nof weeds and pine trees, cooing doves and butterflies.  The temples are\nclosed and no one is in charge but an aged Chinaman.  We did not come\nhere to sit in temples, so John and I will leave in a week, battle or\nno battle.  The argument that having waited so long one might as well\nwait a little longer does not touch us.  It was that argument that kept\nus in Tokio when we knew we were being deceived weekly, and the same\nman who deceived us there, is in charge here.  It is impossible to\nbelieve anything he tells his subordinates to tell us, so, we will be\non our way back when you get this.  I am well, and only disappointed.\nHad they not broken faith with us about Port Arthur we would by now\nhave seen fighting.  As it is we will have wasted six months.\n\nLove to Dad, and Chas and Nora and you.\n\nDICK.\n\n\nIn writing of his decision to leave the Japanese army, Richard, after\nhis return to the United States, said:\n\n\"On the receipt of Oku's answer to the Correspondents we left the army.\nOther correspondents would have quit then, as most of them did ten days\nlater, but that their work and Kuroki, so far from being fifty miles\nnorth toward Mukden, as Okabe said he was, was twenty miles to the east\non our right preparing for the, closing-in movement which was just\nabout to begin.  Three days after we had left the army, the greatest\nbattle since Sedan was waged for six days.\n\n\"So, our half-year of time and money, of dreary waiting, of daily\nhumiliations at the hands of officers with minds diseased by suspicion,\nall of which would have been made up to us by the sight of this one\ngreat spectacle, was to the end absolutely lost to us.  Perhaps we made\na mistake in judgment.  As the cards fell we certainly did.\n\n\"The only proposition before us was this:  There was small chance of\nany immediate fighting.  If there were fighting we would not see it.\nConfronted with the same conditions again, I would decide in exactly\nthe same manner.  Our misfortune lay in the fact that our experience\nwith other armies had led us to believe that officers and gentlemen\nspeak the truth, that men with titles of nobility, and with the higher\ntitles of General and Major-General, do not lie.  In that we were\nmistaken.\"\n\nGreatly disappointed at his failure to see really anything of the war,\nmuch embittered at the Japanese over their treatment of the\ncorrespondents, Richard reached Vancouver in October.  As my father was\nseriously ill he came to Philadelphia at once and divided the next two\nmonths between our old home and Marion.\n\nOn December 14, 1904, my father died, and it was the first tragedy that\nhad come into Richard's life, as it was in that of my sister or myself.\nAs an editorial writer, most of my father's work had been anonymous,\nbut his influence had been as far-reaching as it had been ever for all\nthat was just and fine.  All of his life he had worked unremittingly\nfor good causes and, in spite of the heavy burdens which of his own\nwill he had taken upon his none too strong shoulders, I have never met\nwith a nature so calm , so simple, so sympathetic with those who were\nweak--weak in body or soul.  As all newspaper men must, he had been\nbrought in constant contact with the worst elements of machine\npolitics, as indeed he had with the lowest strata of the life common to\nany great city.  But in his own life he was as unsophisticated; his\nideals of high living, his belief in the possibilities of good in all\nmen and in all women, remained as unruffled as if he had never left his\nfather's farm where he had spent his childhood.  When my father died\nRichard lost his \"kindest and severest critic\" as he also lost one of\nhis very closest friends and companions.\n\nDuring the short illness that preceded my brother's death, although\nquite unconscious that the end was so near, his thoughts constantly\nturned back to the days of his home in Philadelphia, and he got out the\nletters which as a boy and as a young man he had written to his family.\nAfter reading a number of them he said:  \"I know now why we were such a\nhappy It was because we were always, all of us, of the same age.\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XV\n\nMOUNT KISCO\n\nDuring my brother's life there were four centres from which he set\nforth on his travels and to which he returned to finish the articles\nfor which he had collected the material, or perhaps to write a novel, a\nfew short stories, or occasionally a play, but unlike most of the\nfollowers of his craft, never to rest.  Indeed during the last\ntwenty-five years of his life I do not recall two consecutive days when\nRichard did not devote a number of hours to literary work.  The centres\nof which I speak were first Philadelphia, then New York, then Marion,\nand lastly Mount Kisco.  Happy as Richard had been at Marion, the\nquaint little village, especially in winter, was rather inaccessible,\nand he realized that to be in touch with the numerous affairs in which\nhe was interested that his headquarters should be in or near New York.\nIn addition to this he had for long wanted a home of his very own, and\nso located that he could have his family and his friends constantly\nabout him.  Some years, however, elapsed between this dream and its\nrealization.  In 1903 he took the first step by purchasing a farm\nsituated in the Westchester Hills, five miles from Mount Kisco, New\nYork.  He began by building a lake at the foot of the hill on which the\nhome was to stand, then a water-tower, and finally the house itself.\nThe plans to the minutest detail had been laid out on the lawn at\nMarion and, as the architect himself said, there was nothing left for\nhim to do but to design the cellar.\n\nRichard and his wife moved into their new home in July, 1905, and\ncalled it Crossroads Farm, keeping the original name of the place.  In\nlater years Richard added various adjoining parcels of land to his\nfirst purchase, and the property eventually included nearly three\nhundred acres.  The house itself was very large, very comfortable, and\nthere were many guest-rooms which every week-end for long were filled\nby the jolliest of house-parties.  In his novel \"The Blind Spot,\"\nJustus Miles Forman gives the following very charming picture of the\nplace:\n\n\"It was a broad terrace paved with red brick that was stained and a\nlittle mossy, so that it looked much older than it had any right to,\nand along its outer border there were bay-trees set in big Italian\nterracotta jars; but the bay-trees were placed far apart so that they\nshould not mask the view, and that was wise, for it was a fine view.\nIt is rugged country in that part of Westchester County--like a choppy\nsea: all broken, twisted ridges, and abrupt little hills, and piled-up\nboulders, and hollow, cup-like depressions among them.  The Grey house\nsat, as it were, upon the lip of a cup, and from the southward terrace\nyou looked across a mile or two of hollow bottom, with a little lake at\nyour feet, to sloping pastures where there were cattle browsing, and to\nthe far, high hills beyond.\n\n\"There was no magnificence about the outlook--nothing to make you catch\nyour breath; but it was a good view with plenty of elbow room and no\nsign of a neighbor--no huddling--only the water of the little lake, the\nbrown November hillsides, and the clean blue sky above.  The distant\ncattle looked like scenic cattle painted on their green-bronze pasture\nto give an aspect of husbandry to the scene.\"\n\nAlthough Richard was now comfortably settled, he had of late years\nacquired a great dread of cold weather.  As soon as winter set in his\nmind turned to the tropics, and whenever it was possible he went to\nCuba or some other land where he was sure of plenty of heat and\nsunshine.  The early part of 1906 found him at Havana, this time on a\nvisit to the Hon. E. V.  Morgan, who was then our minister to Cuba.\nFrom Havana he went to the Isle of Pines.\n\n\nISLE OF PINES, March 26th, 1906.\n\nDEAR MOTHER:--\n\nWe are just returning from the Isle of Pines.  We reached there after a\nday on the water at about six on Wednesday, 22nd.  They dropped us at a\nwoodshed in a mangrove swamp, where a Mr. Mason met us with two mules.\nI must have said I was going to the island because every one was\nexpecting me.  Until the night before we had really no idea when we\nwould go, so, to be welcomed wherever we went, was confusing.  For four\ndays we were cut off from the world, and in that time, five days in\nall, we covered the entire island pretty thoroughly-- It was one of the\nmost interesting trips I ever took and Cecil enjoyed it as much as I\ndid.  The island is a curious mixture of palm and pines, one minute it\nlooks like Venezuela and the next like Florida and Lakewood.  It is\ndivided into two parties of Americans, the \"moderates\" and the\n\"revolutionists.\"  The Cubans are very few and are all employed by the\nAmericans, who own nine-tenths of the Island.  Of course, they all want\nthe U. S. to take it, they differ only as to how to persuade the\nsenators to do it.  I had to change all my opinions about the\nsituation.  I thought it was owned by land speculators who did not live\nthere, nor wish to live there, but instead I found every one I met had\nbuilt a home and was cultivating the land.  We gave each land company a\nturn at me, and we had to admire orange groves and pineapples,\ngrapefruit and coffee until we cried for help.  With all this was the\nmost romantic history of the island before the \"gringos\" came.  It was\na famous place for pirates and buried treasures and slave pens.  It was\na sort of clearing house for slaves where they were fattened.  I do not\nbelieve people take much interest in or know anything about it, but I\nam going to try and make an interesting story of it for Collier.  It\nwas queer to be so completely cut off from the world.  There was a\nwireless but they would not let me use it.  It is not yet opened to the\npublic.  I talked to every one I met and saw much that was pathetic and\nhuman.  It was the first pioneer settlement Cecil had ever seen and the\nAmerican making the ways straight is very curious.  He certainly does\nnot adorn whatever he touches.  But never have I met so many\nenthusiastics and such pride in locality.  To-night we reach the Hotel\nLouvre, thank heaven! where I can get Spanish food again, and not\nAmerican ginger bread, and, \"the pie like mother used to make.\"  We now\nare on a wretched Spanish tug boat with every one, myself included,\nvery seasick and babies howling and roosters crowing.  But soon that\nwill be over, and, after a short ride of thirty miles through a\nbeautiful part of the island, we will be in Havana in time for a fine\ndinner, with ice.  What next we will do I am not sure.  After living in\nthat beautiful palace of Morgan's, it just needed five days of the\n\"Pinero's\" to make us enjoy life at a hotel-- If we can make\nconnections, I think I will go over to Santo Domingo, and study up that\nsubject, too.  But, even if we go no where else the trip to the I. of\nP.  was alone well worth our long journey.  I don't know when I have\nseen anything as curious, and as complicated a political existence.\nLove to all of you dear ones.\n\nDICK.\n\n\nHAVANA--April 9, 1906.\n\nARTHUR BARTLETT MAURICE, ESQ.\n\nMY DEAR MAURICE:\n\nI have just read about myself, in the April Bookman, which I would be\nvery ungrateful if I did not write and tell you how much it pleased me.\nThat sounds as though what pleased me was, obviously, that what you\nsaid was so kind.  But what I really mean, and that for which I thank\nyou, was your picking out things that I myself liked, and that I would\nlike to think others liked.  I know that the men make \"breaks,\" and am\nsorry for it, but, I forget to be sorry when you please me by pointing\nout the good qualities in \"Laquerre,\" and the bull terrier.  Nothing\never hurt me so much as the line used by many reviewers of \"Macklin\"\nthat \"Mr.  Davis' hero is a cad, and Mr. Davis cannot see it.\"  Macklin\nI always thought was the best thing I ever did, and it was the one over\nwhich I took the most time and care.  Its failure was what as Maggie\nCline used to say, \"drove me into this business\" of play writing.  All\nthat ever was said of it was that it was \"A book to read on railroad\ntrains and in a hammock.\"  That was the verdict as delivered to me by\nRomeike from 300 reviewers, and it drove me to farces.  So, I was\nespecially glad when you liked \"Royal Macklin.\"  I tried to make a\n\"hero\" who was vain, theatrical, boasting and selfconscious, but, still\nlikable.  But, I did not succeed in making him of interest, and it\nalways has hurt me.  Also, your liking the \"Derelict\" and the \"Fever\nShip\" gave me much pleasure.  You see what I mean, it was your\nselecting the things upon which I had worked, and with which I had made\nevery effort, that has both encouraged and delighted me.  Being\nentirely unprejudiced, I think it is a fine article, and as soon as I\nstamp this, I will read it over again.  So, thank you very much,\nindeed, for to say what you did seriously, over your own name, took a\nlot of courage, and for that daring, and for liking the same things I\ndo, I thank you many times.\n\nSincerely yours,\n\nRICHARD HARDING DAVIS.\n\n\nIn reading this over, I find all I seem to have done in it is to\ncomplain because no one, but yourself and myself liked \"Macklin.\"  What\nI wanted to say is, that I am very grateful for the article, for the\nappreciation, although I don't deserve it, and for your temerity in\nsaying so many kind things.  Nothing that has been written about what I\nhave written has ever pleased me so much.\n\nR. H. D.\n\n\nIn the spring of 1906 while Richard was on a visit to Providence, R.\nI., Henry W. Savage produced a play by Jesse Lynch Williams and my\nbrother was asked to assist at rehearsals, a pastime in which he found\nan enormous amount of pleasure.  The \"McCloy\" mentioned in the\nfollowing letter was the city editor of The Evening Sun when my brother\nfirst joined the staff of that paper as a reporter.\n\n\nNEW YORK, May 4, 1906.\n\nDEAR NORA:\n\nI left Providence Tuesday night and came on to New York yesterday.\nSavage and Williams and all were very nice about the help they said I\nhad given them, and I had as much fun as though it had been a success I\nhad made myself, and I didn't have to make a speech, either.\n\nYesterday I spent in the newspaper offices gathering material from\ntheir envelopes on Winston Churchill, M. P. who is to be one of my real\nSoldiers of Fortune.  He will make a splendid one, in four wars, twice\nmade a question; before he was 21 years old, in Parliament, and a\nleader in BOTH parties before he was 36.  In the newspaper offices they\nhad a lot of fun with me.  When I came into the city room of The Eve.\nSun, McCloy was at his desk in his shirt spiking copy.  He just raised\nhis eyes and went on with his blue pencil.  I said \"There's nothing in\nthat story, sir, the man will get well, and the woman is his wife.\"\n\n\"Make two sticks of it,\" said McCloy, \"and then go back to the\nJefferson police court.\"\n\nWhen I sat down at my old desk, and began to write the copy boy came\nand stood beside me and when I had finished the first page, snatched\nit.  I had to explain I was only taking notes.\n\nAt The Journal, Sam Chamberlain who used to pay me $500 a story,\ntouched me on the shoulder as I was scribbling down notes, and said\n\"Hearst says to take you back at $17 a week.\" I said \"I'm worth $18 and\nI can't come for less.\" So he brought up the business manager and had a\nlong wrangle with him as to whether I should get $18.  The business\nmanager, a Jew gentleman, didn't know me from Adam, and seriously tried\nto save the paper a dollar a week.  When the reporters and typewriter\ngirls began to laugh, he got very mad.  It was very funny how soothing\nwas the noise of the presses, and the bells and typewriters and men\nyelling \"Copy!\" and \"Damn the boy!\" I could write better than if I had\nbeen in the silence of the farm.  It was like being able to sleep as\nsoon as the screw starts.\n\nDICK.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XVI\n\nTHE CONGO\n\nDuring the winter of 1907 the world rang with the reports of the\natrocities in the Congo, and Robert J. Collier, of Collier's Weekly,\nasked Richard to go to the Congo and make an investigation.  I do not\nbelieve that my brother was ever in much sympathy with the commission,\nas he did not feel that he could afford the time that a thorough\ninvestigation demanded.  However, with his wife he sailed for Liverpool\non January 5, 1907, and three weeks later started for Africa.\nRegarding this trip, in addition to the letters he wrote to his family,\nI also quote from a diary which he had just started and which he\nconscientiously continued until his death.\n\n\nFrom diary of January 24th, 1907.  Last day in London.  Margaret Frazer\noffered me gun from a Captain Jenkins of Nigeria.  Instead bought\nWinchester repeating, hoping, if need it, get one coast.  Lunched\nSavoy-Lynch, Mrs. Lynch, her sister--very beautiful girl.  In afternoon\nSam Sothern and Margaret came in to say \"Good bye.\" Dined at Anthony\nHope's--Barrie and Mrs. Barrie and Jim Whigham.  Mrs. Barrie looking\nvery well, Barrie not so well.  As silent as ever, only talked once\nduring dinner when he told us about the first of his series of cricket\nmatches between authors and artists.  Did not have eleven authors, so\ngoing along road picked up utter strangers one a soldier in front of\nembracing two girls.  Said he would come if girls came too--all put in\nbrake.  Mrs. Barrie said the Llewellen Davis' were the originals for\nthe Darlings and their children in Peter Pan.  They played a strange\ngame of billiards suggested by Barrie who won as no one else knew the\nrules and they claimed he invented them to suit his case.  Sat up until\nthree writing and packing.  The dinner was best have had this trip in\nLondon.\n\n\nCompagnie Belge Maritime Du Congo.\n\nS. S.  February 11th, 1907.\n\n\nTo-morrow, we will be in Banana, which is the first port in the Congo.\nWhen I remember how far away the Congo seemed from New York and London,\nit is impossible to believe we are less than a day from it.  I am so\nvery glad I came.  The people who have lived here for years agree about\nit in no one fact, so, it is a go-as-you-please for any one so far as\naccurate information is concerned, and I am as likely to be right as\nany one else.  It has been a pleasant trip and for us will not be over\nuntil some days, for at Matadi, which is up the river, we will probably\nlive on the steamer as the shore does not sound attractive.  Then I\nshall probably go on up the river and after a month or six weeks come\nback again.  At Boma I am to see the Governor, one of the inspectors on\nboard is to introduce me, and I have an idea they will make me as\ncomfortable as possible, so that I may not see anything.  Not that I\nwould be likely to see anything hidden under a year.  Yesterday was the\ncrossing of the Equator.  The night before Neptune, one of the crew,\nand his wife, the ship's butcher, and a kroo boy, as black as coal for\nthe heir apparent came over the side and proclaimed that those who\nnever before had crossed the Equator must be baptized.  We had crossed\nbut I was perfectly willing to go through it for the fun.  The Belgians\nwent at it as seriously as children, and worked up a grand succession\nof events.  First we had gymkana races among the kroo boys.  The most\nremarkable was their placing franc pieces in tubs of white and red\nflour, for which the boys dived, they then dug for more money into a\nbig basket fitted with feathers and when they came out they were the\nmost awful sights imaginable.  You can picture their naked black bodies\nand faces spotted with white and pink and stuck like chickens with\nfeathers.  Then the next day we were all hauled before a court and\njudged, and having all been found guilty were condemned to be shaved\nand bathed publicly at four.  Meantime the Italians, is it not the\npicture of them, had organized a revolution against the Tribunal, with\nthe object of ducking them.  They went into this as though it were a\nreal conspiracy and had signs and passwords.  At four o'clock, in turn\nthey sat us on the edge of the great tank on the well deck and splashed\nus over with paste and then tilted us in.  I tried to carry the\nFrenchman who was acting as barber, with me but only got him half in.\nBut Milani, one of the Italians, swung him over his head plumb into the\nwater.  The Frenchman is a rich elephant hunter who is not very\npopular.  When the revolution broke loose we all yelled \"A bas le\nTribunal\" \"Vive la Revolution!\" and there was awful rough house.  I\nmade for the Frenchman and went in with him and nearly drowned him, and\neverybody was being thrown into the tank or held in front of a fire\ncross.  After dinner there was a grand ceremony, the fourth, in which\ncertificates were presented by an Inspecteur d'Etat who is on board,\nand is a Deputy Governor of a district.  Then there was much champagne\nand a concert and Cecil and I sat with the Captain, the Bishop, in his\nrobes and berretta and the two inspectors and they were very charming\nto both of us.\n\nDICK.\n\n\n\nCompagnie Belge Maritime Du Congo.\n\nS. S.  February 13th, 1907.\n\nDEAR MOTHER:\n\nWe reached Banana yesterday morning, and the mouth of the Congo, and as\nthe soldier said when he reached the top of San Juan Hill, \"Hell! well\nhere we are!\"  Banana looks like one of the dozen little islands in the\nWest Indies, where we would stop to take on some \"brands of bananas,\"\ninstead of the port to a country as big as Europe.  We went ashore and\nwandered around under the palm trees, and took photos, and watched some\nmen fishing in the lagoons, and we saw a strange fish that leaps on the\ntop of the water just as a frog jumps on land.  It is certainly hot.\nMilani and I went in swimming in the ocean, and got finely cool.  Then\nwe paddled the canoe back to the ship to show the blacks how good we\nwere, and got very hot, and the blacks charged us a franc for the\nvoyage.  To-morrow we will be in Boma, the capital, which is much of a\nplace with shops and a lawn tennis court.\n\n\nBOMA, February 15th.\n\nBoma is more or less laid out and contains the official residences of\nthe Government.  I walked all over it in an hour, and here you walk\nvery slow.  There are three or four big trading stores AND a tennis\ncourt.  It is, however, a dreary place.  We called on the missionary\nand his wife, but she does not speak English and their point of view of\neverything was not cheerful or instructive.  Cecil plans to remain on\nboard while at Matadi and return with this same boat to Boma.  I want\nher to go home in this boat or in some other, as I believe Boma most\nunhealthy and I know it to be most uncomfortable.  She would have to go\nto a hotel which is very hot and rough, although it is clean and well\nrun.  I am undecided whether to go up the river for ten days, to where\nit crosses the equator, or to leave the upper Congo and go up the Kasai\nriver.  This is off the beaten track, and one may see something of\ninterest.  I will know better what I will do in an hour, when I get to\nMatadi.\n\n\nMATADI--Feby. 21.\n\nWe are now at Matadi.  The Captain invited us to stop on board and it\nis well he did.  We dine on deck where the wind blows but the rest of\nthe ship is being cleaned and painted for the trip North.  Four hatches\nare discharging cargo all at once, from four in the morning until\nmidnight.  Officers and kroo boys get four hours sleep out of the\ntwenty-four, but I sleep right through it, so does Cecil.  Sometimes\nthey take out iron rails and then zinc roofs and steel boats, 6000\ncases of gin and 1000 tons of coal.  Still, it is much better than in\nthe Hotel Africa on shore.  Matadi is a hill of red iron and the heat\nis grand.  Everything in this country is grand.  The river is, in\nplaces, seven miles wide, the sunsets are like nothing earthly, and the\nblack people are like brooding shadows of lost souls, that is, if souls\nhave shadows.  Most of the blacks in this town are \"prisoners\" with a\nsteel ring around the neck, and chained in long lines.  I leave on the\n23d to go up the Kasai River, because that is where the atrocities come\nfrom and up there there are many missionaries.  I don't want you to\nthink I say this to \"calm your fears,\" but I say it because it is as\ntrue of this place as of every other one in the world, and that is,\nthat it is as easy to get about here as it is in Rhode Island.  It is\nnot half as dangerous as automobiling.  I have not even felt feverish,\nneither has Cecil.  I never felt better.  Cecil stays on board and goes\nback to Boma.  There she stops a week and then takes another ship back\nto London.  She will not wait at Boma for me, at least, I hope not and\ncannot imagine her doing so.  In any event, after I start, there will\nbe no way for us to communicate, and I will act on the understanding\nthat she has started North.\n\nI have two very good boys and both speak English, and are from Sierra\nLeone.  I take a two-day trip of 200 miles by rail, then four days by\nboat up the Kasai and then I may come back by boat or walk.  It depends\non how I like it, how long I stay, for I can hope to see very little,\nas under a year it would be impossible to write with authority of this\ncountry.  But I'll see more of it than some at home, and I'll hear what\nthose who have lived here for years have to say.  It is awfully\ninteresting, absolutely different and more uncivilized than anything I\never saw.  But all the time you are depressed with how little you know\nand can know of it.  I will be here six weeks or two months and then\nshould get up the coast to London about the middle of May or sooner.\n\nDICK.\n\n\nFrom diary of February 22nd, 1907.\n\nSpent about the worst night of my life.  No mattress, no pillow.  Not\nspace enough for my own cot.  Every insect in the world ate me.  After\na bath and coffee felt better.  It rained heavily until three P. M.\nRead Pendennis, and loved it.  The picture of life at Clavering and\nFairoaks, and Dr. Portman and Foker are wonderful.  I do not know when\nI have enjoyed and admired a work so much.  For some reason it is all\nentirely new again.  I will read them all now in turn.  After rain\ncleared took my slaves and went after \"supplies.\"  Met a King.  I\nthought he was a witch doctor, and the boys said he was a dancing man.\nAll his suite, wives and subjects followed, singing a song that made\nyour flesh creep.  At Hatton and Cookson's bought \"plenty chop\" for\n\"boys\" who were much pleased.  Also a sparklet bottle, some whiskey and\ntwo pints of champagne at 7 francs the pint.  Blush to own it was demi\nSec.  Also bacon, jam, milk, envelopes, a pillow.  Saw some ivory State\nhad seized and returned. 15 Kilo's.  Some taken from Gomez across\nstreet not returned until he gave up half.  No reason given Taylor\nagent H. & C. why returned Apparently when called will come down on the\nivory question.  Cuthbert Malet, coffee planter, came call on me.  Only\nEnglishman still in Service State.  Had much to say which did not want\nprinted until he out of country which will be in month or two.\nAnstrossi has given me side of cabin where there is room for my cot, so\nexpect to sleep.\n\n\nSTANLEY POOL, Feb. 22nd, 1907.\n\nDEAR MOTHER:\n\nWhen you get this, I will be on my way to London.  The rest of my stay\nhere will be on board two boats, touching at the banks of the Kasai\nriver.  One I now am on takes me up and another takes me down.  I will\nsee a great deal that is strange and it is very interesting.\nYesterday, for example, only an hour before our train reached Gongolo\nStation, there were three elephants that wandered across the track.  We\nwere very disappointed not to have seen them.  At the mission house on\nthe way up, I brought the first ice the mission boys had seen and when\nI put a piece in the hand of one, he yelled and danced about as though\nit were a coal.  The higher up you go the tougher it gets.  Back in the\njungle, one can only imagine what it is like.  Here all the white men\nhave black wives, and the way the whip is used on the men is very\ndifferent from the lower congo.  The boat is about as large as a\ntouring car, with all the machinery exposed.  I am very comfortable\nthough, with my bed and camp chair, and, books to read, when one gets\ntired of this great, dirty river.  I, expect to see hippopotamuses and\nmany crocodiles and to learn something of the \"atrocities\" by hearsay.\nTo see for oneself, would take months.  I return from the Kasai\ndistrict by a boat like this one, burning wood and with a stern wheel,\nreaching Leopoldville, this place, about the 12th of March, and sailing\non the Albertville for Southampton on the 19th of March.  So I should\nbe in London and so very near you by the 8th of April.  Of course, if I\ntake a later boat from here, I will be just that much later.  I am\nperfectly well, never better.  No fever, no \"tired feeling\" good\nappetite, in spite of awful tough food.  From this place money cannot\nbe used and I carry a bag of salt and rolls of cloth.  For a bottle of\nsalt you get a fowl or a turkey, for a tablespoonful an egg, or a bunch\nof fruit.  When you write be sure and tell me ALL your plans for the\nsummer; that is, after you have been to see us.  My dearest love to you\nall.\n\nDICK.\n\n\nFrom diary of February 27th, 1907.\n\nSaw two hippos.  Thought Anstrossi said they were buffalo.  So was glad\nwhen I found out what they were.  I did not want to go home without\nhaving seen only two dead ones.  In a few minutes I saw two more.\nAnstrossi fired at them but I did not, as thought it not the game when\none could not recover them.  Before noon saw six in a bunch--and then\nwhat I thought was a spit of rock with a hippo lying on the end of it,\nturned out to be fifteen hippos in a line!  Burnham has told he had\nseen eleven in the Volta in one day.  Before one o'clock, I had seen\ntwenty-six, and, later in the day Anstrossi fired at another, and shot\na hole in the awning.  That made twenty-seven in one day.  Also some\nmonkeys.  The hippos were delightful.  They seemed so aristocratic,\nlike gouty old gentlemen, puffing and blowing and yawning, as though\neverything bored them.\n\n\nFrom diary of February 28th, 1907.\n\nWhen just going up for coffee, saw what was so big, looking at it\nagainst horizon, thought it must be an elephant.  Was a young hippo.\nCaptain Jensen brought boat within eighty yards of him, and both\nAnstrossi and I fired, apparently knocking him off his legs, for he\nrolled on his side as though his back was broken.  I missed him the\nsecond shot, which struck the water just in front of him.  The other\nthree shots caught him in the head, in the mouth and ear.  He lay quite\nstill, and the boys rushed out a gang plank and surrounded him singing\nand shouting and cutting his tail to make him bleed and weaken him.\nThey don't die for an hour but he seemed dead enough, so I went to my\ncabin to re-load my gun and my camera.  In three minutes I came out,\nand found the hippo still quiet.  Then he began to toss his head and I\nshot him again, to put him out of pain.  In return for which he rolled\nover into the water and got away.  I was mad.  Later saw four more.\nJust at sunset while taking bath another was seen on shore.  We got\nwithin sixty yards of him and all of us missed him or at least did not\nhurt him.  He then trotted for the river with his head up and again I\nmust have missed, although at one place he was but fifty yards away,\nwhen he entered the water, a hundred.  I stepped it off later in the\nsand.  I followed him up and hit him or some one of us hit him and he\nstood up on his hind legs.  But he put back to land for the third time.\nCaptain said wait until moon came out.  But though we hunted up to our\nwaists saw none.  One came quite close at dinner.  Seven on the day.\n\n\nCONGO RIVER--March 1, 1907.\n\nDEAR MOTHER:\n\nI have been up the Congo as far as the Kasai river, and up that to a\nplace called Dima.  There I found myself in a sort of cul de sac.  I\nfound that the rubber plantations I had come to see, were nine days\njourney distant.  In this land where time and distance are so\ndifferently regarded than with us, a man tells you to go to Dima to see\nrubber.  He means after getting to Dima, you must catch a steamer that\nleaves every two weeks and travel for five days.  But he forgets that\nthat fact is important to visitors.  As he is under contract to stay\nhere three years, it does not much matter to him how he spends a month,\nor so.  Dima was two hundred yards square, and then the jungle.  In\nhalf an hour, I saw it all, and met every one in it.  They gave me a\ngrand reception, but I could not spend ten days in Dima.  The only\nother thing I could do was to take a canoe to the Jesuit Mission where\nthe Fathers promised me shooting, or, try to catch the boat back to\nEngland that stops at interesting ports.  Sooner than stop in Boma, I\nurged Cecil to take that boat.  So, if I catch it, we will return\ntogether.  It is a five weeks journey, and rather long to spend alone.\nIn any event my letters will go by a faster boat.  I have had a most\nwonderfully interesting visit, at least, to me.  I hope I can make it\nreadable.  But, much of its pleasure was personal.\n\nI have just had to stop writing this, for what when I get back to New\nYork will seem a perfectly good reason for interrupting a letter to\neven you.  A large hippopotamus has just pushed past us with five baby\nhippos in front of her.  She is shoving them up stream, and the papa\nhippo is in the wake puffing and blowing.  They are very plenty here\nand on the way up stream, I saw a great many, and every morning and\nevening went hunting for them on shore.  I wanted the head of a\nhippopotamus awfully keenly for the farm.  But of the only two I saw on\nland, both got away from me.  I did not shoot at any I saw in the\nwater, although the other idiot on board did, because if you kill them,\nyou cannot recover them, and it seems most unsportsmanlike.  Besides, I\nwas so grateful to them for being so proud and pompous, and real\naristocrats dating back from the flood.  But I was terribly\ndisappointed at losing both of those I saw on land.  One I dropped at\nthe first shot, and the other I missed, as he was running, to get back\ninto the water.  The one I shot, and that everyone thought was dead,\nAFTER THE \"BOYS\" BEGAN TO CUT HIM UP, decided he was not going to stand\nfor that, and to our helpless dismay suddenly rolled himself into the\nwater.  If that is not hard luck, I don't know it.  All I got was a bad\nphotograph of him, and I had already decided where I would hang his\nhead, and how much I would tip the crew for cutting him up.  It was a\nreally wonderful journey.  I loved every minute of it and never was I\nin better health.\n\nIf I only could have known that you knew that I was all right, but\ninstead you were worrying.  The nights were bright moonlight, and the\ndays were beautiful; full of strange people and animals, birds and\nviews.  We three sat in the little bridge of the tinpot boat, and\nsmoked pipes and watched the great muddy river rushing between\nwonderful banks.  There was the Danish Captain, an Italian officer and\nthe engineer was from Finland.  The Italian spoke French and the two\nothers English, and I acted as interpreter!!  Can you imagine it?  I am\nnow really a daring French linguist.  People who understand me, get\nquick promotion.  If I only could have been able to tell you all was\nwell and not to be worried.  At Kwarmouth I have just received a wire\nfrom Cecil saying she expects to leave by the slow boat but will stay\nif I wish it.  So, now we can both go by the slow boat if I can catch\nit.  I hope so.  must have found Boma as bad as it looked.  God bless\nyou all.\n\nDICK.\n\n\n\nOn April 13, Richard was back in London and in his diary of that date\nhe writes, \"Never so glad to get anywhere.  Went to sleep to the music\nof motorcars.  Nothing ever made me feel so content and comfortable and\nsecure as their 'honk, honk.'\"\n\n\nFrom diary of April 22nd, 1907.\n\nA blackmailer named H---- called, with photos of atrocities and letters\nand films.  He wanted 30 Pounds for the lot.  I gave him 3 Pounds for\nthree photos.  One letter he showed me signed Bullinger, an Englishman,\nsaid he had put the fear of God in their hearts by sticking up the\nchief's head on a pole, and saying, \"Now, make rubber, or you will look\nlike that.\" Went to lunch with Pearson but it was the wrong day, and so\nmissed getting a free feed.  Thinking he would turn up, I ordered a\nmost expensive lunch.  I paid for it.  Evening went Patience, which\nliked immensely and then Duchess of Sutherland's party to Premiers.\nSaw Churchill and each explained his share of the Real Soldiers row.\n\n\nFrom diary of April 28th, 1907.\n\nWe went down by train to Cliveden going by Taplow to Maidenhead where\nAstor had sent his car to meet us.  It is a wonderful place and the\nview of the Thames is a beautiful one.  They had been making\nalterations, bathrooms, and putting white enamel tiles throughout the\ndungeons.  If Dukes lived no more comfortably than those who owned\nCliveden, I am glad I was not a Duke.  What was most amusing was the\nservant's room which was quite as smart as any library or study, with\nfine paintings, arm chairs and writing material.  Nannie and Astor were\nexceedingly friendly and we walked all over the place.  It was good to\nget one's feet on turf again.  They sent us back by motor, so we\narrived most comfortably.  I gave a dinner to the Hopes, Wyndham, Miss\nMary Moore, Ashmead-Bartlett and Margaret.  Websters could not come.\nLater, came on here, and had a chat, the Websters coming too.  I read\nThaw trial.\n\n\nEarly in May Richard and his wife returned to Mount Kisco and my\nbrother at once started in to change his farce \"The Galloper\" into a\nmusical comedy.  It was produced on August 12, at the Astor Theatre,\nunder the title of the \"Yankee Tourist,\" with Raymond Hitchcock as the\nstar.  The following I quote from Richard's diary of that date:\n\n\nMonday, August 12th, 1907.\n\nWas to have lunched with Ned Stone but he was in court.  Met Whigham in\nstreet.  Impulsively asked him to lunch.  Ethel and Jack turned up at\nMartin's; asked them to lunch.  Ethel and I drove around town doing\nerrands, mine being the purchase of tickets for numerous friends.\nCalled on Miss Trusdale to inquire about Harden-Hickey.  She wants her\nto go to the country.  Cecil arrived at six.  We had a suite of\neighty-nine rooms.  We dined at Sherry's with Ethel and Jack, Ethel\nbeing host.  Taft was there.  Hottest night ever.  I sat with Jack.  In\nspite of weather, play went well.  Bonsals, Ethel, Arthur Brisbane were\nin Cecil's box.  Booth Tarkington in Irwin's.  Surprise of performance\nwas \"Hello, Bill\" which Raymond had learned only that morning.  Helen\nHale helped him greatly with dance.  People came to supper at Waldorf,\nand things went all wrong.  Next time I have a first Night I want no\nfriends during or after.  Missed the executive ability of Charles\nBelmont greatly.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XVII\n\nA LONDON WINTER\n\nFrom the fall of 1907 to that of 1908 Richard divided his time between\nMount Kisco, Marion, and Cuba.  In December of 1908 he sailed for\nLondon where he took Turner the artist's old house in Chelsea for the\nwinter.\n\n\nCheyne Walk, Chelsea.\n\nDecember 25.  Christmas Day.\n\nDEAR MOTHER:\n\nWe are settled here in Darkest Chelsea as though we had been born here.\nI am thinking of putting in my time of exile by running for Mayor.\nMeanwhile, it is a wonderful place in which to write the last chapters\nof \"Once Upon a Time.\"  The house is quite wonderful.  In Spring and\nSummer it must be rarely beautiful.  It has trees in front and a yard\nand a garden and a squash court: a sort of tennis you play against the\nangles of walls covered smooth with cement.  Also a studio as large as\na theatre.  Outside the trees beat on the windows and birds chirp\nthere.  The river flows only forty feet away, with great brown barges\non it, and gulls whimper and cry, and aeroplane all day.  I have a fine\nroom, and about the only one you can keep as warm as toast SHOULD be,\nand in England never is.\n\nCecil has engaged a teacher, and a model and he is coming here to work.\nHe is twenty years old, and called the \"boy Sargent.\"  So, as soon as\nthe British public gets sober, we will begin life in earnest, and both\nwork hard.  I need not tell you how glad I am to be at it.  I was with\nyou all in heart last night and recited as much as I could remember of\n\"Twas the Night Before Christmas,\" which always means Dad to me, as he\nused to read it to us.  How much he made the day mean to us.  I wish I\ncould just slip in for a kiss, and a hug.  But tonight we will all\ndrink to you, and a few hours later you will drink to us.  God bless\nyou all.\n\nDICK.\n\n\nDecember 29th.\n\nDEAR MOTHER:\n\nA blizzard has swept over London.  The last one cost the City\nCorporation  $25,000!!  The last man who contracted to clean New York\nof snow was cleaned out by two days of it, to the tune of  $200,000.\nStill, in spite of our alleged superiority in all things, one inch of\nsnow in Chelsea can do more to drive one to drink and suicide than a\nfoot of it \"on the farm.\"  At the farm we threw a ton of coal against\nit, and lit log fires and oil lamps, and were warm.  Here, they try to\nfight it with two buckets of soft chocolate cake called Welch coal, and\nthe result is you freeze.  Cecil's studio is like one vast summer hotel\nat Portland Maine in January.  You cannot go near it except in rubber\nboots, fur coats and woolen gloves.  My room still is the only one that\nis livable.  It is four feet square, heavily panelled in oak and the\ncoal fire makes it as warm as a stoke hole.  So, I am all right and can\nwork nicely.  Janet Sothern came to lunch today and Cecil and she in\nfurs went picture gazing.  Tomorrow we have Capt. Chule to dinner.  He\ncame up the West coast with us and is accustomed to a temperature of\n120 degrees.\n\nNew Year's eve we spend with Lady Lewis where we dine and keep it up\nuntil four in the morning.  We will easily be able to get back here but\nhow we can get a hansom from here to the great city, I can't imagine.\nI have seen none in five days.  It is fine to be surrounded by busts of\nCarlyle, Whistler, Rosetti and Turner's own, but occasionally you wish\nfor a taxicab.  Tomorrow I am going on a spree to the great city of\nLondon.  The novel goes on smoothly, and all is well.  I am still\nrunning for Mayor of Chelsea.\n\nLove to you all.\n\nDICK.\n\n\nLONDON--January 1, 1909.\n\nDEAR MOTHER:\n\nI drank your health and Noll's and Charley's last night and so we all\ncame into the New Year together.  I hope it will be as good for me as\nthe last.  Certainly Chas. is coming on well with another book.  It is\nsplendid.  I am so very, very glad.  Some of the very best stories\nanybody has written will be in his next book.\n\nWe dined at the Lewis's.  There were 150 at dinner and as we live in\nChelsea now--one might as well be in Brooklyn--we were a half hour\nlate.  Fancy feeling you were keeping 150 people hungry.  I sat at Lady\nLewis's table with some interesting men and one beautiful woman all\ndressed in glass over pink silk, and pearls, and pearls and then,\npearls.  She said \"Who am I\" and I said \"You look like a girl in\nAmerica, who used to stand under a green paper lamp shade up in a farm\nhouse in New Hampshire and play a violin.\"  Whereat there was much\napplause, because it seemed she was that girl, the daughter of a Mrs.\nVan S----, who wrote short stories.  Her daughter was L---- Van S----\nnow the wife of a baronet and worth five million dollars.  The board we\npaid then was eight dollars a week.  Now, we are dining with her next\nMonday and as I insisted on gold plate she said \"Very well, I'll get\nout the gold plate.\"  But wasn't it dramatic of me to remember her\nafter twenty two years?\n\nDICK.\n\n\nLONDON-February 23, 1909.\n\nDEAR MOTHER:\n\nGeorge Washington's health was celebrated by drinking it at dinner.  I\nhad been asked to speak at a banquet but for some strange reason could\nnot see myself in the part.  The great Frohman arrived last night and\nwe are all agitated until he speaks.  If he would only like my plays as\nsome of the actors do, I would be passing rich.  Barrie asked himself\nto lunch yesterday and was very entertaining.  He told us of a letter\nhe received from Guy DuMaurier who wrote \"An Englishman's Home\" which\nhas made a sensation second to nothing in ten years.  He is an officer\nstationed at a small post in South Africa.  He wrote Barrie he was at\nhome, very blue and homesick, and outside it was raining.  Then came\nBarrie's long cable, at 75 cents a word, saying his play was the\nsuccess of the year.  He did not know even it had been ACCEPTED.  He\nshouted to his wife, and they tried to dance but the hut was too small,\nso they ran out into the compound and danced in the rain.  Then he sent\nthe Kaffir boys to the mess to bring all the officers and all the\nchampagne and they did not go to bed at all.  The next day cables,\nstill at three shillings a word came from papers and magazines and\npublishers, managers, syndicates.  And, in his letter he says, still\nnot appreciating what a fuss it has made, \"I suppose all it needs now\nis to be made a question in the House,\" when already it has been the\ntext of half a dozen speeches by Cabinet Ministers, and three companies\nare playing it in the provinces.  What fun to have a success come in\nsuch a way, not even to know it was being rehearsed.  Today Sargent is\nhere to see what is wrong with Cecil's picture of Janet.  He came early\nand said he couldn't tell until he saw Janet, so now he is back again,\nand both Janet and Cecil are shaking with excitement.  He is the most\nsimple, kindly genius I ever met.  He says the head is very fine and I\nguess Cecil suspected that, before she called him in.  He says she must\nsend it to the Royal Academy.  I am now going out to hear more words\nfall from the great man, and so farewell.  Seymour and I began work\nyesterday on the Dictator.  It went very smooth. All my love to Noll\nand to you.\n\nDICK.\n\n\nRead the other letter first and then, let me tell you that when I went\nout to see Sargent, I found Cecil complaining that she could not\nunderstand just how it was he wanted Janet to pose.  Whereat she handed\nhim a piece of chalk and he made a sketch of Janet as exquisite as the\nmorning and rubbed his hands of the charcoal and left it there!  It's\nonly worth a hundred pounds!  Can you imagine the nerve of Cecil.  I\nwas so shocked I could only gasp.  But, he was quite charming and\nbegged her to call him next time she got in a scrape, and gave her his\nprivate telephone number.\n\nFancy having Sargent waiting to be called up to make sketches for you.\nI left Janet and Cecil giggling with happiness.  Janet because she had\nbeen sketched by him and Cecil because she has the sketch.  It's a\nthree fourths length three feet high, and he did it in ten minutes.  I\nam now going to ask her to invite the chef of the Ritz in, to give us a\nsketch of cooking a dinner.\n\nDICK.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XVIII\n\nMILITARY MANOEUVRES\n\nIn August, 1909, Richard and his wife left Mount Kisco for a visit to\nMr. and Mrs. Clark at Marion.  While there my brother attended and\nlater on wrote an article on the war manoeuvres held at Middleboro,\nMassachusetts.\n\n\nMARION, MASSACHUSETTS.\n\nAugust 16th, 1909.\n\nDEAR MOTHER:\n\nWe had a splendid day to day.  I arranged to have Cecil meet me at\neleven at Headquarters in the woods below Middleboro, and I spent the\nmorning locating different regiments.  Then, after I \"met up\" with her,\nI took her in my car.  Both she and Hiller were awfully keen over it,\nso, we got on splendidly.  And, of course, Hiller's knowledge of the\ncountry was wonderfully convenient.  We had great luck in seeing the\nonly fight of the day, the first one of the war.  Indeed, I think we\ncaused it.  There was a troop of cavalry with a Captain who was afraid\nto advance.  I chided him into doing something, the umpire having\nconfided to me, he would mark him, if he did not.  But, he did it\nwrong.  Anyway, he charged a barn with 36 troopers and lost every\nfourth man.  In real warfare he would have lost all his men and all his\nhorses.  Cecil and Hiller pursued in the car at the very heels of the\ncavalry, and I ran ahead with the bicycle scouts.  It was most\nexciting.  I am going out again to-morrow.  Lots of Love to you all.\n\nDICK.\n\n\nMARION, MASSACHUSETTS.\n\nAugust 19th, 1909.\n\nDEAR MOTHER:\n\nI got in last night too late to write and I am sorry.  To-day, the war\ncame to an end with our army, the Red one, with the road to Boston open\nbefore it.  Indeed, when the end came, they were fighting with their\nbacks to that City, and could have entered it to-night.  I begged both\nBliss and Wood to send in the cavalry just for the moral effect, but\nthey were afraid of the feeling, that was quite strong.  I had much\nfun, never more, and saw all that was worth seeing.  I was glad to see\nI am in such good shape physically, but with the tramping I do over the\nfarm, it is no wonder.  I could take all the stone walls at a jump,\nwhile the others were tearing them down.  I also met hundreds of men I\nknew and every one was most friendly, especially the correspondents.\nJust as I liked to be on a story with a \"star\" man when I was a\nreporter, they liked having a real \"war\" correspondent, take it\nseriously.  They were always wanting to know if it were like the Real\nThing, and as I assured them it was, they were satisfied.  Some\nincidents were very funny.  I met a troop of cavalry this morning,\nriding away from the battle, down a crossroad, and thinking it was a\nflanking manoeuvre, started to follow them with the car.  \"Where are\nyou going?\" I asked the Captain.  \"Nowhere,\" he said, \"We are dead.\"\nAn Umpire was charging in advance of two troops of the 10th down a\nstate road, when one trooper of the enemy who were flying, turned back\nand alone charged the two troops.  \"You idiot\"! yelled the Umpire,\n\"don't you know you and your horse are shot to pieces?\" \"Sure, I know\nit,\" yelled the trooper \"but, this ---- horse don't know it.\"\n\nRICHARD.\n\n\nEarly in the fall of 1909 Richard returned from Marion to New York and\nwent to Crossroads, where for the next three years he remained a\ngreater part of the time.  They were years of great and serious changes\nfor him.  An estrangement of long standing between him and his wife had\nended in their separation early in 1910, to be followed later by their\ndivorce.  In September of that year my mother died while on a visit to\nCrossroads.\n\nAfter my father's death life to her became only a period of waiting\nuntil the moment came when she would rejoin him--because her faith was\nimplicit and infinite.  She could not well set about preparing herself\nbecause all of her life she had done that and, so, smiling and with a\nsplendid bravery and patience she lived on, finding her happiness in\nbringing cheer and hope and happiness to all who came into the presence\nof her wonderful personality.  The old home in Philadelphia was just\nthe same as it had been through her long married life--that is with one\ngreat difference, but on account of this difference I knew that she was\nglad to spend her last days with Richard at Crossroads.  And surely\nnothing that could be done for a mother by a son had been left undone\nby him.  Through these last long summer days she sat on the terrace\nsurrounded by the flowers and the sunshine that she so loved.  Little\nchildren came to play at her knee, and old friends travelled from afar\nto pay her court.\n\nIn the winter of 1910-11 my brother visited Aiken, where he spent\nseveral months.  The following June he went to London at the time of\nKing George's coronation, but did not write about it.  Again, in\nNovember, 1911, he visited my sister in London, but returned to New\nYork in January, 1912, and spent a part of the winter in Aiken and\nCuba.  At Aiken he found at least peace and the devotion of loving\nfriends that he so craved, but in London and Cuba, which once had meant\nso much to him, he seemed to have lost interest entirely.  But not once\nduring these years did he cease working, and working hard.  On almost\nevery page of his diary at this period I find such expressions as\n\"wrote 500 words for discipline.\"  And again \"Satisfaction in work of\nlast years when writing for existence, has been up to any I ever wrote.\"\n\nAnd in spite of all of the trouble of these days, he not only wrote\nincessantly but did some of his very finest work.  Personally I have\nnever seen a man make a more courageous fight.  To quote again from his\ndiary of this time:  \"Early going to my room saw red sunrise and gold\nmoon.  I seemed to stop worrying about money.  With such free pleasures\nI found I could not worry.  Every day God gives me greater delight in\ngood things, in beauty, and in every simple exercise and amusement.\"\n\nTwice during these difficult days he went to visit Gouverneur Morris\nand his wife at Aiken, and after Richard's death his old friend wrote\nof the first of these visits:\n\n\"It was in our little house at Aiken, in South Carolina, that he was\nwith us most and we learned to know him best, and that he and I became\ndependent upon each other in many ways.  \"Events, into which I shall\nnot go, had made his life very difficult and complicated.  And he who\nhad given so much friendship to so many people needed a little\nfriendship in return, and perhaps, too, he needed for a time to live in\na house whose master and mistress loved each other, and where there\nwere children.  Before he came that first year our house had no name.\nNow it is called 'Let's Pretend.'\n\n\"Now the chimney in the living-room draws, but in those first days of\nthe built-over house it didn't.  At least, it didn't draw all the time,\nbut we pretended that it did, and with much pretense came faith.  From\nthe fireplace that smoked to the serious things of life we extended our\npretendings, until real troubles went down before them--down and out.\n\n\"It was one of Aiken's very best winters, and the earliest spring I\never lived anywhere.  R. H. D. came shortly after Christmas.  The\nspiraeas were in bloom, and the monthly roses; you could always find a\nsweet violet or two somewhere in the yard; here and there splotches of\ndeep pink against gray cabin walls proved that precocious peach-trees\nwere in bloom.  It never rained.  At night it was cold enough for\nfires.  In the middle of the day it was hot.  The wind never blew, and\nevery morning we had a four for tennis and every afternoon we rode in\nthe woods.  And every night we sat in front of the fire (that didn't\nsmoke because of pretending) and talked until the next morning.\n\n\"He was one of those rarely gifted men who find their chiefest pleasure\nnot in looking backward or forward, but in what is going on at the\nmoment.  Weeks did not have to pass before it was forced upon his\nknowledge that Tuesday, the fourteenth (let us say), had been a good\nTuesday.  He knew it the moment he waked at 7 A. M., and perceived the\nTuesday sunshine making patterns of bright light upon the floor.  The\nsunshine rejoiced him and the knowledge that even before breakfast\nthere was vouchsafed to him a whole hour of life.  That day began with\nattentions to his physical well-being.  There were exercises conducted\nwith great vigor and rejoicing, followed by a tub, artesian cold, and a\nloud and joyous singing of ballads.\n\n\"The singing over, silence reigned.  But if you had listened at his\ndoor you must have heard a pen going, swiftly and boldly.  He was hard\nat work, doing unto others what others had done unto him.  You were a\nstranger to him; some magazine had accepted a story that you had\nwritten and published it.  R. H. D. had found something to like and\nadmire in that story (very little perhaps), and it was his duty and\npleasure to tell you so.  If he had liked the story very much he would\nsend you instead of a note a telegram.  Or it might be that you had\ndrawn a picture, or, as a cub reporter, had shown golden promise in a\nhalf column of unsigned print, R. H. D.  would find you out, and find\ntime to praise you and help you.  So it was that when he emerged from\nhis room at sharp eight o'clock, he was wide-awake and happy and\nhungry, and whistled and double-shuffled with his feet, out of\nexcessive energy, and carried in his hands a whole sheaf of notes and\nletters and telegrams.\n\n\"Breakfast with him was not the usual American breakfast, a sullen,\ndyspeptic gathering of persons who only the night before had rejoiced\nin each other's society.  With him it was the time when the mind is, or\nought to be, at its best, the body at its freshest and hungriest.\nDiscussions of the latest plays and novels, the doings and undoings of\nstatesmen, laughter and sentiment--to him, at breakfast, these things\nwere as important as sausages and thick cream.\n\n\"Breakfast over, there was no dawdling and putting off of the day's\nwork (else how, at eleven sharp, could tennis be played with a free\nconscience?).  Loving, as he did, everything connected with a\nnewspaper, he would now pass by those on the hall-table with never so\nmuch as a wistful glance, and hurry to his workroom.\n\n\"He wrote sitting down.  He wrote standing up.  And, almost you may\nsay, he wrote walking up and down.  Some people, accustomed to the\ndelicious ease and clarity of his style, imagine that he wrote very\neasily.  He did and he didn't.  Letters, easy, clear, to the point, and\ngorgeously human, flowed from him without let or hindrance.  That\nmasterpiece of corresponding, the German March through Brussels, was\nprobably written almost as fast as he could talk (next to Phillips\nBrooks, he was the fastest talker I ever heard), but when it came to\nfiction he had no facility at all.  Perhaps I should say that he held\nin contempt any facility that he may have had.  It was owing to his\nincomparable energy and Joblike patience that he ever gave us any\nfiction at all.  Every phrase in his fiction was, of all the myriad\nphrases he could think of, the fittest in his relentless judgment to\nsurvive.  Phrases, paragraphs, pages, whole stories even, were written\nover and over again.  He worked upon a principle of elimination.  If he\nwished to describe an automobile turning in at a gate, he made first a\nlong and elaborate description from which there was omitted no detail,\nwhich the most observant pair of eyes in Christendom had ever noted\nwith reference to just such a turning.  Thereupon he would begin a\nprocess of omitting one by one those details which he had been at such\npains to recall; and after each omission he would ask himself, 'Does\nthe picture remain?'  If it did not, he restored the detail which he\nhad just omitted, and experimented with the sacrifice of some other,\nand so on, and so on, until after Herculean labor there remained for\nthe reader one of those swiftly flashed ice-clear pictures (complete in\nevery detail) with which his tales and romances are so delightfully and\ncontinuously adorned.\n\n\"But it is quarter to eleven, and this being a time of holiday, R. H.\nD. emerges from his workroom happy to think that he has placed one\nhundred and seven words between himself and the wolf who hangs about\nevery writer's door.  He isn't satisfied with those hundred and seven\nwords.  He never was in the least satisfied with anything that he\nwrote, but he has searched his mind and his conscience and he believes\nthat under the circumstances they are the very best that he can do.\nAnyway, they can stand in their present order until--after lunch.\n\n\"A sign of his youth was the fact that to the day of his death he had\ndenied himself the luxury and slothfulness of habits.  I have never\nseen him smoke automatically as most men do.  He had too much respect\nfor his own powers of enjoyment and for the sensibilities, perhaps, of\nthe best Havana tobacco.  At a time of his own deliberate choosing,\noften after many hours of hankering and renunciation, he smoked his\ncigar.  He smoked it with delight, with a sense of being rewarded, and\nhe used all the smoke there was in it.\n\n\"He dearly loved the best food, the best champagne, and the best Scotch\nwhiskey.  But these things were friends to him, and not enemies.  He\nhad toward food and drink the continental attitude; namely, that\nquality is far more important than quantity; and he got his\nexhilaration from the fact that he was drinking champagne and not from\nthe champagne.  Perhaps I shall do well to say that on questions of\nright and wrong he had a will of iron.  All his life he moved\nresolutely in whichever direction his conscience pointed; and although\nthat ever present and never obtrusive conscience of his made mistakes\nof judgment now and then, as must all consciences, I think it can never\nonce have tricked him into any action that was impure or unclean.  Some\ncritics maintain that the heroes and heroines of his books are\nimpossibly pure and innocent young people.  R. H. D. never called upon\nhis characters for any trait of virtue, or renunciation, or\nself-mastery of which his own life could not furnish examples.\"\n\nIn June of 1912 Richard reported the Republican convention at Chicago.\nShortly after this, on July 8, he married at Greenwich, Connecticut,\nMiss Elizabeth Genevieve McEvoy, known on the stage as Bessie McCoy,\nwith whom he had first become acquainted in 1908 after the estrangement\nfrom his wife.\n\nRichard and his wife made their home at Crossroads, where he devoted\nmost of his working hours to the writing of short stories.  In August\nof that year my brother, accompanied by his wife, returned to Chicago\nto report the Progressive convention.  During the year 1913 he wrote\nand produced the farce \"Who's Who,\" of which William Collier was the\nstar, and in the fall of the same year spent a month in Cuba, with\nAugustus Thomas, where they produced a film version of \"Soldiers of\nFortune.\" In referring to this trip, Thomas wrote at the time of\nRichard's death:\n\n\"In 1914 a motion-picture company arranged to make a feature film of\nthe play, and Dick and I went with their outfit to Santiago de Cuba,\nwhere, twenty years earlier, he had found the inspiration for his story\nand out of which city and its environs he had fashioned his\nsupposititious republic of Olancho.  On that trip he was the idol of\nthe company.  With the men in the smoking-room of the steamer there\nwere the numberless playful stories, in the rough, of the experiences\non all five continents and seven seas that were the backgrounds of his\npublished tales.\n\n\"At Santiago, if an official was to be persuaded to consent to some\nunprecedented seizure of the streets, or a diplomat invoked for the\nassistance of the Army or the Navy, it was the experience and good\njudgment of Dick Davis that controlled the task.  In the field there\nwere his helpful suggestions of work and make up to the actors, and on\nthe boat and train and in hotel and camp the lady members met in him an\neasy courtesy and understanding at once fraternal and impersonal.\n\n\"The element that he could not put into the account and which is\nparticularly pertinent to this page, is the author of 'Soldiers of\nFortune' as he revealed himself to me both with intention and\nunconsciously in the presence of the familiar scenes.\n\n\"For three weeks, with the exception of one or two occasions when some\nlocal dignitary captured the revisiting lion, he and I spent our\nevenings together at a cafe table overlooking 'The Great Square,' which\nhe sketches so deftly in its atmosphere when Clay and the Langhams and\nStuart dine there.  At one end of the plaza the President's band was\nplaying native waltzes that came throbbing through the trees and\nbeating softly above the rustling skirts and clinking spurs of the\nsenoritas and officers sweeping by in two opposite circles around the\nedges of the tessellated pavements.  Above the palms around the square\narose the dim, white facade of the Cathedral, with the bronze statue of\nAnduella the liberator of Olancho, who answered with his upraised arm\nand cocked hat the cheers of an imaginary populace.\n\n\"Twenty years had gone by since Dick had received the impression that\nwrote those lines, and now sometimes after dinner half a long cigar\nwould burn out as he mused over the picture and the dreams that had\ngone between.  From one long silence he said:  'I think I'll come back\nhere this winter and bring Mrs. Davis with me--stay a couple of\nmonths.'  What a fine compliment to a wife to have the thought of her\nand that plan emerge from that deep and romantic background.\n\n\"The picture people began their film with a showing of the 'mountains\nwhich jutted out into the ocean and suggested roughly the five knuckles\nof a giant's hand clenched and lying flat upon the surface of the\nwater.'  That formation of the sea wall is just outside of Santiago.\n'The waves tunnelled their way easily enough until they ran up against\nthose five mountains and then they had to fall back.' How natural for\none of us to be unimpressed by such a feature of the landscape and yet\nhow characteristic of Dick Davis to see the elemental fight that it\nrecorded and get the hint for the whole of the engineering struggle\nthat is so much of his book.\n\n\"We went over those mountains together, where two decades before he had\nplanted his banner of romance.  We visited the mines and the railroads\nand everywhere found some superintendent or foreman or engineer who\nremembered Davis.  He had guessed at nothing.  Everywhere he had\noverlaid the facts with adventure and with beauty, but he had been on\nsure footing all the time.  His prototype of MacWilliams was dead.\nTogether we visited the wooden cross with which the miners had marked\nhis grave.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XIX\n\nVERA CRUZ AND THE GREAT WAR\n\nLate in April, 1914, when war between the United States and Mexico\nseemed inevitable Richard once more left the peace and content of\nCrossroads and started for Vera Cruz, arriving there on April 29.  He\nhad arranged to act as correspondent for a syndicate of newspapers, and\nas he had for long been opposed to the administration's policy of\n\"watchful waiting\" was greatly disappointed on his arrival at the\nborder to learn of the President's plan of mediation.  He wrote to his\nwife:\n\n\nCRUZ, April 24, 1914.\n\nDEAREST ONE:\n\nWe left today at 5.30.  It was a splendid scene, except for the\nchildren crying, and the wives of the officers and enlisted men trying\nnot to cry.  I got a stateroom to myself.  With the electric fan on and\nthe airport open, it is about as cool as a blast furnace.  But I was\ngiven a seat on the left of General Funston, who is commanding this\nbrigade, and the other officers at the table are all good fellows.  As\nlong as I was going, I certainly had luck in getting away as sharply as\nI did.  One day's delay would have made me miss this transport, which\nwill be the first to land troops.\n\n\nApril 25th.\n\nA dreadnaught joined us today, the Louisiana.  I wirelessed the Admiral\nasking permission to send a press despatch via his battleship, and he\nwas polite in reply, but firm.  He said \"No.\" There are four transports\nand three torpedo boats and the battleship.  We go very slowly, because\nwe must keep up with one of the troop ships with broken engines.  At\nnight it is very pretty seeing the ships in line, and the torpedo boats\nwinking their signals at each other.  I am writing all the time or\nreading up things about the army I forget and getting the new dope.\nAlso I am brushing up my Spanish.  Jack London is on board, and three\nother correspondents, two of whom I have met on other trips, and one\n\"cub\" correspondent.  He was sitting beside London and me busily\nturning out copy, and I asked him what he found to write about.  He\nsaid, \"Well, maybe I see things you fellows don't see.\"  What he meant\nwas that what was old to us was new to him, but he got guyed\nunmercifully.\n\n\nApril 27, 1914.\n\nThe censor reads all I write, and so do some half-dozen Mexican cable\nclerks and 60 (sixty) correspondents.  So when I cable \"love,\" it MEANS\ndevotion, adoration, and worship; loyalty, fidelity and truth, wanting\nyou, needing you, unhappy for you.  It means ALL that.\n\nRICHARD.\n\n\nVERA CRUZ, April 30, 1914.\n\nThis heat--humid and moist--would sweat water out of a chilled steel\nsafe; so imagine what it does to me with all the awful winter's\naccumulation of fat.  I hate to say it, but I LIKE these Mexicans--much\nbetter than Cubans, or Central Americans.  They are human, kindly; it\nis only the politicians and bandits like Villa who give them a bad\nname.  But, though they ought to hate us, whenever I stop to ask my way\nthey invite me to come in and have \"coffee\" and say, \"My house is\nyours, senor,\" which certainly is kind after people have taken your\ntown away from you and given you another flag and knocked your head off\nif you did not salute it.  I now have a fine room.  The Navy moved out\ntoday and I got the room of the paymaster.  It faces the plaza and the\ncathedral.  I burned a candle there today for our soon meeting.  The\npriests all had run away, so I had to hunt up the candle, and pay the\nmoney into the box marked for that purpose, but the Lord does not run\naway, and He will see we soon meet.\n\n\nMay 2nd.\n\nYesterday I went out on the train that brings in refugees and saw the\nMexicans.  They had on three thousand cartridges, much hair, hats as\nhigh as church steeples, and lots of dirt.  The Selig Moving Picture\nfolks took many pictures of us and several \"stills,\" in which the war\ncorrespondent was shown giving cigarettes to the brigands.  Also, I had\na wonderful bath in the ocean off the aviation camp.  I borrowed a suit\nfrom one of the aviators, and splashed and swam around for an hour.\nMy! it was good.  It reminded me of my dear Bessie, because the last\ntime I was in the ocean was with her.\n\nMaybe you know what is going on, but we do not.  So I just hustle\naround all day trying to find news as I did when I was a reporter.  It\nis hot enough here even for me, and I have lost about eight pounds of\nthat fat I laid in during our North Pole winter!\n\n\nVERA CRUZ--May 8, 1914.\n\nDEAR CHAS.:\n\nToday, when Wilson ordered Huerta not to blockade Tampico which was an\ninsult to Mediators and the act of a bully and a coward, AND a\ndeclaration of war, we all got on our ponies to \"advance.\"  Then came\nword Huerta would not blockade.  It is like living in a mad house.  We\nall are hoping mediators refuse to continue negotiations.  If they have\nself respect that is what they will do.  Tonight if Wilson and Huerta\nran for President, Huerta would get all our votes.  He may be an\nuneducated Indian, but at least he is a man.  However, that makes no\nnever mind so far as to my getting back.  The reason I cannot return is\nbecause I have \"credentials.\"  It is not that they want ME here, but\nthey want my credentials here.  The administration is using, as I see\nit, the privilege of having a correspondent at the front as a club.  It\nsays until war is declared it won't issue any more.  So those\nsyndicates who have no correspondent and the papers forming them, are\nafraid to attack or to criticise the administration for fear they will\nbe blacklisted.  And those who have a correspondent with his three\nthousand dollar signed and sealed pass in his pocket aren't taking any\nchance on losing him.  So, I see before me an endless existence in Vera\nCruz.\n\nRICHARD.\n\n\nOn May 7 Richard started for Mexico City where, if possible, he\nintended to interview Huerta.  At Pasco de Macho he was arrested, but\nafterward was allowed to proceed to Mexico City.  Here he was again\narrested, and without being allowed to interview Huerta was sent back\nthe day after his arrival to Vera Cruz.\n\nOf this Vera Cruz experience John N. Wheeler, a friend of Richard's and\nthe manager of the syndicate which sent him to Mexico, wrote the\nfollowing after my brother's death:\n\n\"Richard Harding Davis went to Vera Cruz for a newspaper syndicate, and\nafter the first sharp engagement in the Mexican seaport there was\nnothing for the correspondent to do but kill time on that barren, low\nlying strip of Gulf coast, hemmed in on all sides by Mexicans and the\nsea, and time is hard to kill there.  Yet there was a story to be got,\nbut it required nerve to go after it.\n\n\"In Mexico City was Gen. Huerta, the dictator of Mexico.  If a\nnewspaper could get an interview with him it would be a 'scoop,' but\nthe work was inclined to be dangerous for the interviewer, since\nAmericans were being murdered rather profusely in Mexico at the time in\nspite of the astute assurances of Mr. Bryan, and no matter how\nsubstantial his references the correspondent was likely to meet some\ntemperamental and touchy soldier with a loaded rifle who would shoot\nfirst and afterward carry his papers to some one who could read them.\n\n\"One of the newspapers taking the stories by Mr. Davis from the\nsyndicate had a staff man at Vera Cruz as well, and thought to 'scoop'\nthe country by sending this representative to see Huerta, in this way\n'beating' even the other subscribers to the Davis service.  An\ninterview in Mexico City was consequently arranged and the staff man\nwas cabled and asked to make the trip.  He promptly cabled his refusal,\nthis young man preferring to take no such chances.  It was then\nsuggested that Mr. Davis should attempt it.  By pulling some wires at\nWashington it was arranged, through the Brazilian and English\nAmbassadors at the Mexican capital, for Mr. Davis to interview\nPresident Huerta, with safe conduct (this being about as safe as\nnonskid tires) to Mexico City.  Mr. Davis was asked if he would make\nthe trip.  In less than two hours back came this laconic cable:\n\n\"'Leaving Mexico City to-morrow afternoon at 3 o'clock.'\n\n\"That was Richard Harding Davis--no hesitancy, no vacillation.  He was\nalways willing to go, to take any chance, to endure discomfort and all\nif he had a fighting opportunity to get the news.  The public now knows\nthat Davis was arrested on this trip, that Huerta refused to make good\non the interview, and that it was only through the good efforts of the\nBritish Ambassador at the Mexican capital he was released.  But Davis\nwent.\n\n\"There was an echo of this journey to the Mexican capital several\nmonths later after the conflict in Europe had been raging for a few\nweeks.  Lord Kitchener announced at one stage of the proceedings he\nwould permit a single correspondent, selected and indorsed by the\nUnited States Government, to accompany the British army to the front.\nOf course, all the swarm of American correspondents in London at the\ntime were eager for the desirable indorsement.  Mr. Davis cabled back\nthe conditions of his acceptance.  Immediately Secretary of State Bryan\nwas called in Washington on the long-distance telephone.\n\n\"'Lord Kitchener has announced,' the Secretary of State was told, 'that\nhe will accept one correspondent with the British troops in the field,\nif he is indorsed by the United States Government.  Richard Harding\nDavis, who is in London, represents a string of the strongest\nnewspapers in the United States for this syndicate, and we desire the\nindorsement of the State Department so he can obtain this appointment.'\n\n\"'Mr. Davis made us some trouble when he was in Mexico,' answered Mr.\nBryan.  'He proceeded to the Mexican capital without our consent and I\nwill have to consider the matter very carefully before indorsing him.\nHis Mexican escapade caused us some diplomatic efforts and\nembarrassment.'  (What the Secretary of State did to bring about Mr.\nDavis's release on the occasion of his Mexican arrest is still a secret\nof the Department.)\n\n\"Mr. Bryan did not indorse Mr. Davis finally, which was well, since\nLord Kitchener of Khartum kept the selected list of correspondents\nloafing around London on one pretext or another so long they all became\ndisgusted and went without an official pass from 'K. of K.'  As soon as\nMr. Davis was told he would not be appointed he proceeded to Belgium\nand returned some of the most thrilling stories written on this\nconflict at great personal risk.\"\n\n\nMay 13, 1914.\n\nMY DEAREST ONE:\n\nDO NOT BLAME me for this long delay in writing.  God knows I wanted\nevery day to \"talk\" to you.  But we were on the \"suspect\" list, and to\nmake even a note was risky.  The way I did it was to exclaim over the\nbeauty of some flower or tree, and then ask the Mexican nearest me to\nwrite the name of it HIMSELF in MY notebook.  Then I would say, \"In\nEnglish that would be----\" and I would pretend to write beside it the\nEnglish equivalent, but really would write the word that was the key to\nwhat I wished to remember.  So, you see, a letter at that rate of\nprogress was impossible.  It was a case of \"Can't get away to cable you\ntoday; police won't let me!\"  However, we are all safe at home again.\nAs a matter of fact, I had a most exciting time, and am dying to tell\nyou the \"insie\" story.  But the one I sent the papers must serve.  I\npromised myself I would give the FIRST soldier, marine and sailor I met\non returning a cigar, and the first sailor was the CHAPLAIN OF THE\nFLEET, Father Reany.  But he took the cigar and gave me his blessing.\nI am now burning candles to St. Rita.  What worried me the MOST was how\nworried YOU would be; and I begged Palmer not to send the story of our\nfirst arrest.  But other people told of it, and he had to forward it.\nYou certainly made the wires BURN! and had the army guessing.  One\nofficer said to me, \"I'm awfully sorry to see you back.  If you'd only\nhave stayed in jail another day your wife would have had us all on our\nway to Mexico.\"  And the censor said, \"My God! I'm glad you're safe!\nYour wife has MADE OUR LIVES HELL!\"  And quite right, too, bless you!\nNone of us knows anything, but it looks to me that NOTHING will induce\nWilson to go to war.  But the Mexicans think we ARE at war, and act\naccordingly.  They may bring on a conflict.  That is why I am making\nready in case we advance and that is why I cabled today for the rest of\nmy kit.  I have a fine little pony, and a little messenger boy who\nspeaks Spanish, to look after the horse, and me.\n\nAnd now, as to your LETTERS, they came to-day, five of them, COUNT 'EM,\nand the pictures did make me laugh.  I showed those of the soldier\ncommandeering the vegetables to Funston and he laughed.  And, I did\nlove the flowers you sent no matter HOW homesick they made me!  (Oh).\nI do not want a camera.\n\nI have one, and those fancy cameras I don't understand.\n\nThe letters you forwarded were wonderfully well selected.  I mean,\nthose from other people.  One of them was from Senator Root telling me\nBryan is going to reward our three heroic officers who jumped into the\nocean.  I know you will be glad.  There are NO mosquitoes!  Haven't met\nup with but three and THEY are not COMING BACK.\n\nI send you a picture of my room from the outside.  From the inside the\nview is so \"pretty.\"  Across the square is the cathedral and the trees\nare filled with birds that sing all night, and statues, and pretty\nglobes.  The band plays every night and when it plays \"Hello, Winter\nTime,\" I CRY for you.  I paid the band-master $20 to play it, and it is\nWORTH IT.  I sit on the balcony and think of you and know just what you\nare doing, for there is only an hour and a half difference.  That is,\nwhen with you it is ten o'clock with me it is eight-thirty.  So when\nyou and Louise are at dinner you can know I am just coming in from my\nhorseback ride to bathe and \"nap.\"  And when at eight-thirty you are\nplaying the Victor, I am drinking a cocktail to you, and shooing away\nthe Colonels and Admirals who interfere with my ceremony of drinking to\nmy dear wife.\n\n\n\nVERA CRUZ, May 20th, 1914.\n\nDEAREST WIFE:\n\nI got SUCH a bully letter yesterday from you, written long ago from the\nWebster.  It said you missed me, and it said you loved me, and there\nwere funny pictures of you reading the war and peace news each with a\ndifferent expression, and you told me about Padrigh and how he runs\ndown the road.  It made me very sad and homesick, but very glad to feel\nI was so missed.  Also you told me cheerful falsehoods about my Tribune\nstories.  I know they are no good, and as they are no good, the shorter\nthe better, but I like to be told they are good.  Anyway, I sat down at\nonce and wrote a long screed on Vera Cruz and the sleepy people that\nfive here.\n\nWe all live on the sidewalk under the stone porch.  Every night a table\nis reserved and by my orders ALL chairs, except mine, are removed.  So\nno one can sit down and bore me while I am dining.  Another trick I\nhave to be left alone is to carry a big roll of cable blanks, and I\npretend to write out cables if anyone tries to talk.  Then I beckon the\nmessenger (he always sits in the plaza) and say \"File that!\" and he\ngoes once around the block and reports back that it is \"filed.\"  If the\nbore renews the attack I write another cable, and the unhappy messenger\nmakes another tour.  The band plays from seven to eight every night.\nThere are five bands, and I saw no reason why there should not be music\nevery evening.  After a day in this dirty hotel or dirty city a lively\nband helps.  Funston agreed, but forgot, until after three nights with\nno band, I wrote him a letter.  It was signed by fake names, asking if\nhe couldn't get nineteen German musicians into a bandstand how could he\nhope to get ten thousand soldiers into Mexico City.  So now we have a\nband each night.  That is all my day.  After dinner I sit at table and\nthe men bring up chairs, or else I go to some other table.  There are\nsome damn fool women here who are a nuisance, and they now have dancing\nin the hotel adjoining, but I don't know them, except to bow, and I\napprove of the tango parties because it keeps them away from the\nsidewalk.  They ire \"refugees,\" the sort of folks you meet at Ocean\nGrove, or rather DON'T meet!  All love to you, and give Patrigh a pat\nfrom his Uncle Richard for looking after you and looking for me, and\nremember me to Louise and Shu and everything at home.  I love you so.\n\nRICHARD.\n\n\nVERA CRUZ, May 28, 1914.\n\nI want to be home to see the daisy field with you.  That knee you\nnearly busted tobogganing when the daisy field was an iceberg is now\nrecovered.\n\nThe one and all came this morning and as I expected it was all full of\nlove from you.  I DID get happiness out of the thought you put in it.\nAnd all done in an hour.  The underclothes made me weep.  I could get\nnone here.  Not because Mexicans are not as large as I am, but because\nno Mexican of any size would wear 'em.  So I've had to wash the few\nthat the washer-woman didn't destroy myself.  And when I saw the lot\nyou sent!  It was like a white sale!  Also the quinine which I tasted\njust for luck, and the soap in the little violet wrapper made me quite\nhomesick.  Especially was I glad to get socks and pongee suits, and\nshirts.  I really was getting desperate.  God knows what I would have\ndone without them.\n\nI want to see you so much, and I want to see you in the same setting of\nother days, I want to walk with you in the daisy field, and in the\nlaurel blossoms, and clip roses.  But to be with you I'd be willing to\nwalk on broken glass.  Not you, too.  Just me.\n\nRICHARD.\n\n\n\nVERA CRUZ--June 4, 1914.\n\nDEAR OLD MAN:\n\nI am awfully sorry for your sake, you could not get away.  Of course\nfor myself I am glad that I am to see you and Dai.  At least, I hope I\nam.  God alone knows when we will get out of here.  I am sick of it.\nNext time I go to war both armies must fight for two months before I\nwill believe they mean it, and BEFORE I WILL BUDGE.\n\nIt is true I am getting good money, but also there is absolutely\nNOTHING to write about.  Bryan doesn't know that unless he talks by\ncode every radio on sixteen ships can read every message he sends to\nthese waters.  And the State Department saying it could not understand\nthe Hyranga giving up her cargo is a damn silly lie.  No one is so\nfoolish as to think the Chester and Tacomah let her land those arms\nunder their guns unless they had been told to submit to it.  And yet\ntoday, we get papers of the 29th in which Bryan says he has twice\ncabled Badger for information, when for a week Badger has been reading\nBryan's orders to consuls to let the arms be landed.  Can you beat\nthat?  This is an awful place, and if I don't write it is because I\nhate to harrow your feelings.  It is a town of flies, filth and heat.\nJohn McCutcheon is the only friend I have seen, and he sensibly lives\non a warship.  I can't do that, as cables come all the time suggesting\nspecials, and I am not paid to loaf.  John is here on a vacation, and\ncan do as he pleases.  But I ride around like any cub reporter.  And\nthere is no news.  Since I left home I have not talked five minutes to\na woman \"or mean to!\"  The Mexican women are a cross between apes and\nsquaws.  Of all I have seen here nothing has impressed me so as the\nhideousness of the women, girls, children, widows, grandmothers.  And\nthe refugees, as Collier would say it, are \"terrible!\"  I live a very\nlonely existence.  I find it works out that way best.  And at the same\ntime all the correspondents are good friends, and I don't find that\nthere is one of them who does not go out of his way to SHOW he is\nfriendly.  What I CAN'T understand is why no one at home never guesses\nI might like to read some of my own stories. . . .\n\nDICK.\n\n\nOf these days in Vera Cruz John T. McCutcheon wrote the following\nshortly after Richard's death:\n\n\"Davis was a conspicuous figure in Vera Cruz, as he inevitably had been\nin all such situations.  Wherever he went, he was pointed out.  His\ndistinction of appearance, together with a distinction in dress, which,\nwhether from habit or policy, was a valuable asset in his work, made\nhim a marked man.  He dressed and looked the 'war correspondent,' such\na one as he would describe in one of his stories.  He fulfilled the\npopular ideal of what a member of that fascinating profession should\nlook like.  His code of life and habits was as fixed as that of the\nBriton who takes his habits and customs and games and tea wherever he\ngoes, no matter how benighted or remote the spot may be.\n\n\"He was just as loyal to his code as is the Briton.  He carried his\nbath-tub, his immaculate linen, his evening clothes, his war\nequipment--in which he had the pride of a connoisseur--wherever he\nwent, and, what is more, he had the courage to use the evening clothes\nat times when their use was conspicuous.  He was the only man who wore\na dinner coat in Vera Cruz, and each night, at his particular table in\nthe crowded 'Portales,' at the Hotel Diligencia, he was to be seen, as\nfresh and clean as though he were in a New York or London restaurant.\n\nEach day he was up early to take the train out to the 'gap,' across\nwhich came arrivals from Mexico City.  Sometimes a good 'story' would\ncome down, as when the long-heralded and long-expected arrival of\nConsul Silliman gave a first-page 'feature' to all the American papers.\n\n\"In the afternoon he would play water polo over at the navy aviation\ncamp, and always at a certain time of the day his 'striker' would bring\nhim his horse and for an hour or more he would ride out along the beach\nroads within the American lines.\"\n\n    .     .     .     .     .     .     .     .     .\n\nOn June 15 Richard sailed on the Utah for New York, arriving there on\nthe 22d.  For a few weeks after his return he remained at Mount Kisco\ncompleting his articles on the Mexican situation but at the outbreak of\nthe Great War he at once started for Europe, sailing with his wife on\nAugust 4, the day war was declared between England and Germany.\n\n\n\nOn Lusitania--August 8, 1914.\n\nDEAR CHAS:\n\nWe got off in a great rush, as the Cunard people received orders to\nsail so soon after the Government had told them to cancel all\npassengers, that no one expected to leave by her, and had secured\npassage on the Lorraine and St. Paul.\n\nThey gave me a \"regal\" suite which at other times costs $1,000 and it\nis so darned regal that I hate to leave it.  I get sleepy walking from\none end of it to the other; and we have open fires in each of the three\nrooms.  Generally when one goes to war it is in a transport or a troop\ntrain and the person of the least importance is the correspondent.  So,\nthis way of going to war I like.  We now are a cruiser and are slowly\nbeing painted grey, and as soon as they got word England was at war all\nlights were put out and to find your way you light matches.  You can\nimagine the effect of this Ritz Carlton idea of a ship wrapped in\ndarkness.  Gerald Morgan is on board, he is also accredited to The\nTribune, and Frederick Palmer.  I do not expect to be allowed to see\nanything but will try to join a French army.  I will leave Bessie near\nLondon with Louise at some quiet place like Oxford or a village on the\nThames.  We can \"take\" wireless, but not send it, so as no one is\nsending and as we don't care to expose our position, we get no news.\nWe are running far North and it is bitterly cold.  I think Peary will\nsue us for infringing his copyrights.\n\nI will try to get in touch with Nora.  I am worried lest she cannot get\nat her money.  As British subjects no other thing should upset them.\nAddress me American Embassy, London.  I send such love to you both.\nGod bless you.\n\nDICK.\n\n\nRichard arrived in Liverpool August 13, and made arrangements for his\nwife to remain in London.  Unable to obtain credentials from the\nEnglish authorities, he started for Brussels and arrived there in time\nto see the entry of the German troops, which he afterward described so\ngraphically.  Indeed this article is considered by many to be one of\nthe finest pieces of descriptive writing the Great War has produced.\n\nFor several days after Brussels had come under the control of the\nGermans Richard remained there and then decided to go to Paris as the\nsiege of the French capital at the time seemed imminent.  He and his\nfriend Gerald Morgan, who was acting as the correspondent of the London\nDaily Telegraph, decided to drive to Hal and from there to continue on\nfoot until they had reached the English or French armies where they\nknew they would be among friends.  At Hal they were stopped by the\nGerman officials and Morgan wisely returned to Brussels.  However,\nRichard having decided to continue on his way, was promptly seized by\nthe Germans and held as an English spy.  For a few days he had a most\nexciting series of adventures with the German military authorities and\nhis life was frequently in danger.  It was finally due to my brother's\nown strategy and the prompt action of our Ambassador to Belgium, Brand\nWhitlock, that he was returned to Brussels and received his official\nrelease.\n\nOn August 27, Richard left Brussels for Paris on a train carrying\nEnglish prisoners and German wounded, and en route saw much of the\nburning and destruction of Louvain.\n\n\n\nBRUSSELS, August 17, 1914.\n\nDEAREST:\n\nWrite me soon and often!  All is well here so long as I know you are\nall right, so do not fail to tell me all, and keep me in touch.  If _I_\ndo not write much it is because letters do not get through always, and\nare read.  But you know I love you, and you know twice each day I pray\nfor you and wish for you all the time.  I feel as though I had been\ngone a month.  Gerald Morgan and I got in last night; this is a\nsplendid new hotel; for $2.50 I get a room and bath like yours on the\n\"royal suite,\" only bigger.  This morning the minister did everything\nhe could for us.  There are about twenty Americans who want\ncredentials.  They say they will take no Americans, but to our minister\nthey said they would make exception in favor of three, so I guess the\nthree will be John McCutcheon, Palmer and myself.  John and I, if\nanyone gets a pass, are sure.  With the passes we had, Gerald and I\nstarted out in a yellow motor, covered with flags of the Allies, and\nsaw a great deal.  How I wished you were with me, you would so have\nloved it.  The country is absolutely beautiful.  We were stopped every\nquarter mile to show our passes and we got a working idea of how it\nwill be.  Tonight I dined with Mr. Whitlock, the minister, and John\nMcCutcheon came in and Irving Cobb.  John and I will get together and\ngo out.  All you need is a motor car and you can go pretty much\neverywhere, EXCEPT near where there is fighting.  So what I am to do to\nearn my wages I don't know.  I am now going to bed and I send my\ndarlin' all love.  Today I sent you a wire.  If it got to you let me\nknow.  Take such good care of yourself.  Remember me to Louise, and,\nWRITE ME.  All love, DEAR, DEAR one.  My wife and my sweetheart.\n\nYour husband,\n\nRICHARD.\n\n\nThe following is the last letter that got through.\n\n\n\nBRUSSELS, August 21, 1914.\n\nDEAREST ONE:\n\nI cannot say much, as I doubt if this will be opened by you.  The\nGerman army came in and there was no fighting and I am very well.  I am\nonly distressed at not being able to get letters from you, and not\nbeing able to send them.  I will write a long one, and hold it until I\nam sure of some way by which it can reach you.\n\nYOU KNOW WHAT I WOULD SAY.\n\n\n\nMrs. Davis had waited in London to meet Richard on his return from the\nwar, but a misunderstanding as to the date of his return, coupled with\nher strong sense of duty to his interests at home, gave occasion for\nthe letter which follows:\n\n\nLONDON, August 31, 1914.\n\nDEAREST ONE:\n\nNot since the Herald Square days have I had such a blow as when I drove\nup to 10 Clarges, and found you gone! IT WAS NOBODY'S FAULT!  YOU WERE\nSO RIGHT to go; and I COULD NOT COME.  I am so distressed lest it was\nmy cable saying I could not get back that decided you to go before the\nfifth.  But Ashford says it was not.  He tells me the cable came at\nTHREE in the morning and that you had arranged to be called at\nsix-thirty in order to leave for Scotland.  So, for sending that cable\nI need not blame myself too much.  I sent you so many messages I do not\nknow which got through.  But I think it must have been one saying I\ncould not return in time to see you before the fifth.  THEN, no trains\nwere running.  The very NEXT DAY the Germans started a troop train, and\nI took it.  The reason I could not come by automobile was because I had\na falling out with the \"mad dogs\" and they would not give me a pass.\nSo Evans, with whom I was to motor to Holland, got through Friday\nafternoon and sent the cable.  As soon as I reached Holland, I cabled I\nwas coming and kept on telegraphing every step of the journey, which\nlasted three days.\n\nI telegraphed last from Folkestone; even telling you what to have for\nmy supper.  As you directed, Ashford opened the cables, and when I\ndrove up, he was at the door in tears.  He had made a light in your\nrooms and, of course, as I looked up I thought you still were in them.\nWhen they told me I was a day late, I cried, too.  It was the bitterest\ndisappointment I ever knew.  I had taken the very first train out of\nBrussels, the one with the wounded, and for three days had been having\none hell of a time.  But I kept thinking of seeing you, and hearing\nyour dear voice.  So the trip did not matter.  I was only thinking of\nSEEING YOU, and thanking God I was shut of the dirty Germans.  We had\nnothing to eat, and we slept on the floor of the train, the Germans\nkept us locked in, and, all through even Holland, we were under arrest.\nBut nothing mattered, because I was so happy at thought of meeting you.\nAs I said neither of us was at fault.  You just HAD to go, and I could\nNOT COME.  But, you can feel how I felt to learn you were at sea.\n\nI was so glad I could use your old rooms.  I went to the table where\nyou used to write and was so glad I could at least be as near to you as\nthat.  No other place in London could have held me that night.  Not\nBuckingham Palace.  I found little things you had left.  I loved even\nthe funny pictures on the wall because we had talked of them together.\nIt was ROTTEN, ROTTEN luck.  But only the Germans and their hellish war\nwere to blame.  I drove straight to the cable office, and tried to\nwireless you, knowing you would feel glad to know I was well, and safe\nand sound.  But the cable people could not send my message.  You were\nthen out of reach of wireless, on the Irish coast.  And for nine days\nthere was no way to tell you I had come back as fast as trains and\nboats and the dirty Germans would let me.  Oh, my dear, dear one, HOW I\nLOVE you.  If only I could have seen you for just five minutes.  As it\nwas, I thought for five days more we would be together.  What I shall\ndo now, I don't know.  I must go back with either the French or the\nEnglish until my contract expires, and then, I can join you.  Tomorrow\nI am trying to see Asquith and Churchill to get with the army.  And I\nwill at once return across the channel.  But, do not worry!  I will\nnever again let a German come within ONE MILE of me!  After this,\nbetween me and the Germans, there will be some hundreds of thousands of\nEnglish or French.  So after this reaches you I will soon be on my way\nHOME.  Don't worry.  Get James back and Amelia and everyone else who\ncan make you comfortable, and trust in the good Lord.  I have your\ncross and St. Rita around my neck, and in spite of what the Kaiser\nsays, God is looking after other people than Germans.  Certainly he has\ntaken good care of me.  And he will guard you, and our \"blessed\" one.\nAnd in a little time, dear, DEAR heart, I will be back, and I will\nbecome a grocer.  God love you and keep you, as he does.  And you will\nnever know HOW I LOVE YOU!  Good night, dearest, sweetheart and wife!\nI am writing this at your table, and, thanking God you are going to the\nfarm, and to peace and happiness.  I SEND YOU ALL THE LOVE IN ALL THE\nWORLD.\n\nRICHARD.\n\n\nLONDON, September 3rd.\n\nMY DEAREST ONE:\n\nIt was a full moon again tonight and I think you were on deck and saw\nit, because by now, you have passed the four days at sea and should be\nin the St. Lawrence.  So I knew you saw the moon, too, and I sent you a\nkiss, via it.  It was just over St. James Palace but also it was just\nover you.\n\nToday has been a day of worries.  Wheeler cabled that the papers wanted\nme to be \"neutral\" and not write against the Germans.  As I am not\ninterested in the German vote, or in advertising of German breweries\n(such a hard word to SAY) I thought, considering the EXCLUSIVE stories\nI had sent them, instead of kicking, they ought to be sending me a few\nbouquets.  Especially, as I got cables from Gouvey, Whigham, Scribner's\nand others congratulating me on the anti-German stories.  So I cabled\nWheeler to tell papers of his syndicate, dictation from them as to what\nI should write was \"unexpected,\" that they could go to name-of-place\ncensored and that if he wished I would release him from his contract\ntonight.  Considering that without credentials I was with French,\nBelgian and German armies and saw entry of Germans into Brussels and\nsacking of Louvain and got arrested as a spy, they were a bit\nungrateful.  I am now wondering WHAT I would have seen HAD I HAD\ncredentials.\n\nI saw Anthony Hope at the club last night.  He had to go back to the\ncountry, so I dined alone on English oysters.  Fancy anyone being\nNEUTRAL in this war!  Germany dropping bombs in Paris and Antwerp on\nwomen and churches and scattering mines in the channel where they blow\nup fishermen and burning the cathedrals!  A man who now would be\nneutral would be a coward.  Good night, NEAR, DEAR, DEAR one.  It has\nbeen several weeks since I had sleep, so if I rave and wander in my\nletters forgive me.  You know how I am thinking of you.  God bless you.\nGod keep you for me.\n\nYour husband who loves you SO!\n\n\nLONDON, September 7th.\n\nDEAREST:\n\nI just got your cable saying you were at the farm, and well!  HOW HAPPY\nIT MADE ME!  I cabled you to Quebec, and to Mt.  Kisco, and when two\ndays passed and I heard nothing, today I was scared, so I cabled Gouvey\nto look after you, and also to Wheeler.  I went to the Brompton Oratory\ntoday, which is the second most important church here (the cardinal\nlives at Westminster) and burned the BIGGEST CANDLE they had for you\nand the \"blessing.\"  A big woman all in black was kneeling in the\nlittle chapel and when I could not get the candle to stand up, she\nbeckoned to one of the priests, and he ran and fixed it.  Then she went\non praying.  And WHO do you think she was?  Queen Amelie of Portugal,\nyou see her pictures in the Tattler and Sphere opening bazaars.  So she\nmust be very good or she would not be saying her prayers all alone with\nthe poor people and seeing that my Bessie's candle was burning.  I have\nbeen waiting here hoping to get some sort of credentials from\nKitchener.  But though Winston Churchill has urged him, and tomorrow is\ngoing to urge him again, they give me no hope.  So I'll just go over\n\"on my own\" and I bet I'll see more than anyone else.  I have fine\npapers, anyhow.  I am now writing Scribner article, so THAT is off my\nmind.  And now that you are home, I have no \"worries.\" I wish I had got\nyour cable earlier.  I would have had oysters and champagne in BATH\nTUBS.  Give my love to all the flowers, and to Shea and Paedrig, and\nTom, and Louise, and Gouvey and the lake.  And take SUCH good care of\nyourself, and love me, and be happy for I do so love you dear one.  I\nDO SO LOVE YOU.\n\nYOUR HUSBAND.\n\n\nSeptember 15th.\n\nDEAREST:\n\nTonight I got your cable in answer to mine asking if you were well.\nAll things considered twenty-four hours was not so long for them to get\nthe answer to me.  You BET I will be careful.  I don't want to get\nnearer to a German than twenty miles.  At the battlefield I collected\nfive German spiked helmets but at the Paris gate they took ALL of them\nfrom me.  I WAS mad!  I wanted to keep them in my \"gym,\" and pound them\nwith Indian clubs.  I wrote all day yesterday, so today I did not work.\nThere is nothing more here to do.  And as soon as my contract is up\nOctober 1st, I will make towards YOU!  Seeing the big battle was great\nluck.  So far I have seen more than anyone.  I have had no credentials;\nand yet have been with ALL the armies.  Now I am just beating time,\nuntil I can get home.  The fighting is too far away even if I could go\nto it.  But I can't without being arrested.  And I am fed up on being\narrested.  Today all the little children came out of doors.  They have\nbeen locked up for fear of airships.  It was fine to see them playing\nin the Champs Elysees and making forts out of pebbles, and rolling\nhoops.\n\nGod loves you, dear one, and I trust in Him.  But I am awful sick for a\nsight of you.  What a lot we will have to tell each other.  One thing I\nnever have to tell you, but it makes me happy when I can.  It is this:\nI LOVE YOU!  And every minute I think of you.\n\nWith all my love.\n\nYour\n\nRICHARD.\n\n\n\nPARIS, September 15th, 1914.\n\nDEAR CHAS.:\n\nI got this morning your letter of August 25th.  In it you say kind\nthings about my account of the Germans entering Brussels.  Nothing so\nmuch pleases me as to get praise from you or to know my work pleases\nyou.  Since the Germans were pushed in every one here is breathing\nagain.  But for me it was bad as now the armies are too far to reach by\ntaxicab, and if you are caught anywhere outside the city you are\narrested and as a punishment sent to Tours.  Eight correspondents,\namong them two Times men and John Reed and Bobby Dunn, were sent to\nTours Sunday.  I had another piece of luck that day with Gerald Morgan.\nI taxicabed out to Soissons and saw a wonderful battle.  So, now I can\ngo home in peace.  Had I been forced to return without seeing any\nfighting I never would have lived it down.  I am in my old rooms of\nyears ago.  I got the whole imperial suite for eight francs a day.  It\nused to be 49 francs a day.  Of course, Paris that closes tight at nine\nis hardly Paris, but the beauty of the city never so much impressed me.\nThere is no fool running about to take your mind off the gardens and\nbuildings.  What MOST makes me know I am in Paris, though, are the\npackages of segars lying on the dressing table.  Give my love to Dai,\nand tell her I hope soon to see you.  The war correspondent is dead.\nMy only chance was to get with the English who will take one American\nand asked Bryan to choose, he passed it to the Press Association and\nthey chose Palmer.  But I don't believe the official correspondents\nwill be allowed to see much.  I saw the Germans enter Brussels, the\nburning of Louvain and the Battle of Soissons and had a very serious\nrun in with the Germans and nearly got shot.  But now if you go out,\nevery man is after you, and even the gendarmes try to arrest you.  It\nis sickening.  For never, of course, was there such a chance to\ndescribe things that everyone wants to read about.  Again my love to\nDai and you.  I will see you soon.\n\nRICHARD.\n\n\nIn October Richard returned to the United States and settled down to\ncomplete his first book on the war.  During this period and indeed\nuntil the hour of his death my brother devoted the greater part of his\ntime to the cause of the Allies.  He had always believed that the\nUnited States should have entered the war when the Germans first\noutraged Belgium, and to this effect he wrote many letters to the\nnewspapers.  In addition to this he was most active in various of the\ncharities devoted to the causes of the Allies, wrote a number of\nappeals, and contributed money out of all proportion to his means.  The\nfollowing appeal he wrote for the Secours National:\n\n\"You are invited to help women, children and old people in Paris and in\nFrance, wherever the war has brought desolation and distress.  To\nFrance you owe a debt.  It is not alone the debt you incurred when your\ngreat grandfathers fought for liberty, and to help them, France sent\nsoldiers, ships and two great generals, Rochambeau and La Fayette.  You\nowe France for that, but since then you have incurred other debts.\n\n\"Though you may never have visited France, her art, literature, her\ndiscoveries in Science, her sense of what is beautiful, whether in a\nbonnet, a boulevard or a triumphal arch, have visited you.  For them\nyou are the happier; and for them also, to France you are in debt.\n\n\"If you have visited Paris, then your debt is increased a hundred fold.\nFor to whatever part of France you journeyed, there you found courtesy,\nkindness, your visit became a holiday, you departed with a sense of\nrenunciation; you were determined to return.  And when after the war,\nyou do revisit France, if your debt is unpaid, can you without\nembarrassment sink into debt still deeper?  What you sought Paris gave\nyou freely.  Was it to study art or to learn history, for the history\nof France is the history of the world; was it to dine under the trees\nor to rob the Rue de la Paix of a new model; was it for weeks to motor\non the white roads or at a cafe table watch the world pass?  Whatever\nyou sought, you found.  Now, as in 1776 we fought, to-day France fights\nfor freedom, and in behalf of all the world, against militarism that is\n'made in Germany.'\n\n\"Her men are in the trenches; her women are working in the fields,\nsweeping the Paris boulevards, lighting the street lamps.  They are\nundaunted, independent, magnificently capable.  They ask no charity.\nBut from those districts the war has wrecked, there are hundreds of\nthousands of women and little children without work, shelter or food.\nTo them throughout the war zone the Secours National gives instant\nrelief.  In one day in Paris alone it provides 80,000 free meals.  Six\ncents pays for one of these meals.  One dollar from you will for a week\nkeep a woman or child alive.\n\n\"The story is that one man said, 'In this war the women and children\nsuffer most.  I'm awfully sorry for them!' and the other man said, 'Yes\nI'm five dollars sorry.  How sorry are you?'\n\n\"If ever you intend paying that debt you owe to France do not wait\nuntil the war is ended.  Now, while you still owe it, do not again\nimpose yourself upon her hospitality, her courtesy, her friendship.\n\n\"But, pay the debt now.\n\n\"And then, when next in Paris you sit at your favorite table and your\nfavorite waiter hands you the menu, will you not the more enjoy your\ndinner if you know that while he was fighting on the Aisne, it was your\nprivilege to help a little in keeping his wife and child alive.\"\n\nThe winter of 1914-15 Richard and his wife spent in New York, and on\nJanuary 4, 1915, their baby, Hope, was born.  No event in my brother's\nlife had ever brought him such infinite happiness, and during the short\nfifteen months that remained to him she was seldom, if ever, from his\nthoughts, and no father ever planned more carefully for a child's\nfuture than Richard did for his little daughter.\n\nOn April 11 my brother and his wife took Hope to Crossroads for the\nfirst time.  In his diary of this time he writes, \"Only home in the\nworld is the one I own.  Everything belongs.  It is so comfortable and\nthe lake and the streams in the woods where you can get your feet wet.\nThe thrill of thinking a stump is a trespasser!  You can't do that on\nten acres.\"\n\nA cause in  which  Richard was  enormously  interested at this time was\nthat of the preparedness of his own country, and for it he worked\nunremittingly.  In August, 1915, he went to Plattsburg, where he took a\nmonth of military training.\n\n\nPLATTSBTTRG, N.  Y.\n\nAugust, 1915.\n\nDEAR OLD MAN:\n\nThis is a very real thing, and STRENUOUS.  I know now why God invented\nSunday.  The first two days were mighty hard, and I had to work extra\nto catch up.  I don't know a darned thing, and after watching soldiers\nfor years, find that I have picked up nothing that they have to learn.\nThe only things I have learned don't count here, as they might under\nmarching conditions.  My riding I find is quite good, and so is my\nrifle shooting.  As you could always beat me at that you can see the\nconditions are not high.  But being used to the army saddle helps me a\nlot.  I have a steeple chaser on one side and a M. F. H. on the other,\nand they can't keep in the saddle, and hate it with bitter oaths.  The\ncamp commander told me that was a curious development; that the best\ngentlemen jockeys and polo players on account of the saddle, were sore,\nin every sense.  Yesterday I rose at 5-30, assembled for breakfast at\nsix, took down tent to ventilate it, when a cloud meanly appeared, and\nI had to put it up again.  Then in heavy marching order we drilled two\nhours as skirmishers, running and hurling ourselves at the earth, like\nfalling on the ball, and I always seemed to fall where the cinder path\ncrossed the parade ground.  We got back in time to clean ourselves for\ndinner at noon.  And then practised firing at targets.  At two we were\ndrilled as cavalry in extended order.  We galloped to a point, advanced\non foot, were driven back by an imaginary enemy, and remounted.  We\ngalloped as a squadron, and the sight was really remarkable when you\nthink the men had been together only four days.  But the horses had\nbeen doing it for years.  All I had to do to mine was to keep on.  He\nknew what was wanted as well as did the Captain.  After that we put on\nour packs and paraded at retreat to the band.  Then had supper and\nlistened to a lecture.  I ache in every bone, muscle, and joint.  But\nthe riding has not bothered me.  It is only hurling the damned rifle at\nmyself.  At nine I am sound asleep.  It certainly is a great\nexperience, and, all the men are helping each other and the spirit is\nsplendid.  The most curious meetings come off and all kinds of men are\nat it from college kids to several who are great grand fathers.\nRussell Colt turned up and was very funny over his experiences.  He\nsaid he saluted everybody and one man he thought was a general and\nstood at attention to salute was a Pullman car conductor.  The food is\nall you want, and very good.  I've had nothing to drink, but\nsarsaparilla, but with the thirst we get it is the best drink I know.\nI have asked to have no letters forwarded and if I don't write I hope\nyou will understand as during the day there is not a minute you are\nyour own boss and at night I am too stiff and sleepy to write.\n\nAll love to you.\n\nDICK.\n\n\n\nDEAREST:\n\nIt is now seven-thirty, and I have had twelve busy hours.  They made me\npass an examination as though for Sing Sing, then a man gave me a gun\nthat at first weighed eight pounds and then twenty.  He made me do all\nsorts of things with it, such as sentries used to do to me.  Then I was\ngiven the gun to keep, and packs, beds, blankets, and I made myself at\nhome in a tent; then I was moved to another tent with five other men.\nThen I got a horse and they galloped us up and down a field for two\nhours.  I lost ten pounds.  Then we were marched around to a band.  I\nhad a sergeant on either side of me, so I did not go wrong, OFTEN.\nThen, aching in every bone and with my head filled with orders and\ncommands, I got into the lake and escaped.  You can believe I enjoyed\nthat bath.  It certainly is a fine thing, and I am glad I enrolled (for\nevery one has been as nice as could be), but I miss you and Hope\nterribly.  It seems years since I saw you.  I am going to my cot quick.\nIt is now eight o'clock, and I feel like I had been beaten in a stone\ncrusher.  Kiss Hope's foot for me.\n\nYour loving husband,\n\nDICK.\n\n\nMonday.\n\nDEAREST ONE:\n\nI got such a beautiful letter from you!  With pictures of Hope\nplaying with the Bunny.  It is the best picture yet.  I carry it next\nto my heart because you made it, because it is of her.  And she sits up\nnow?  Well, I will miss the big clothes-basket.  I loved to see her in\nit.  Years ago, when I left home, she was trying to crawl out of it.\nWhat you tell me of her--knowing what you mean when you say \"Kitty\" and\n\"Bunny\"--is wonderful.  How good it will be!  You must come close under\nmy arm, and tell me every little thing.  I feel so much better now that\nwe have broken into the last week, and are on the home stretch.  We\nhave broken the backbone of the long absence, and, the first thing you\nknow, I'll be telephoning to have you meet me at White Plains.\n\nThis is me sewing up a hole in my breeches.  The socks are drying on\nthe line, my rubber bath is on the right.  I am now going to Canada.\nBut I'll be back in half an hour; it's only 200 yards distant.  All the\nfolks here are French, and the signs are in French.  Last place we\nhalted I bought lumberman's socks to wear at night.  I sleep very well,\nfor I buy my raincoat full of hay from the nearest farmer, and sleep on\nthat.  Today we had another \"battle.\"  It began at 7.30 and ended at\none o'clock.  We were kept going all that time, taking \"cover\" behind\nrailroad embankments and stone walls and in plowed fields, finally\nending with a bayonet charge.  I killed so many I stopped counting.\n\nDon't let Hope forget her father.  Better put on a wrist-watch and my\nhorn spectacles, and hold her the wrong way, so she will be reminded of\nher Dad.\n\nGood-night, my dearest one.  You will never know how terribly I miss\nyou and love you, and want you in my arms, and you holding Hope so that\nI can have all my happiness in one big armful of all that is good.\n\nYOUR LOVING HUSBAND.\n\n\n\nWednesday.\n\nDEAREST ONE:\n\nThe Vitagraph people came today.  They have a great film to stir people\nto preparedness called \"The Battle Cry of Peace.\" It shows New York\ndestroyed by Germans.  They took pictures of several of the\nbetter-known men showing \"them\" preparing.  I was taken cleaning my\nrifle, and, as the captain was passing, I asked him to get in the\npicture with me and be shown instructing me.  He was delighted, but\nright in the middle of the picture he \"inspected\" my barrel.  I had not\ncleaned it, and he forgot the camera, and gave me the devil.  You can\nimagine how the crowd roared, and the camera director man was\ndelighted.  I wanted it retaken showing the captain patting me on the\nback.\n\nRoosevelt turned up today, and was very nice.  Martin Egan came with\nhim and the British Naval Attache, and they have asked me to dine at a\nreal table at Hotel Champlain with two other men.  It will be fine to\neat off china.  The \"hike\" begins Friday, and we sleep each night on\nthe ground, but the country we march through is beautiful.  All that\ncounts is getting the days behind me and getting you in my arms.  Doing\none's \"bit\" for one's country is right, but as the man said, \"God knows\nI love my country and want to fight for her, but I hope to God I never\nlove another country.\"  Good-night, dear, dear one!  How wonderful it\nwill be to see and hear you again.  Kiss Hope for her Dad.\n\nRICHARD.\n\n\nSaturday.\n\nDEAREST:\n\nThis is writing with all the love, but with difficulties.  I am sitting\non a log and the light is a candle.  Today we had our first fight.  It\nhappened the squad of eight men I am in was sent in advance, and I was\n100 yards in front, so I was the first to come in touch with the scouts\nof the Red Army, and I killed a lot.  My squad was so brave that we all\ngot killed THREE TIMES.  But as soon as the umpire rode away we would\ncome to life, and go on fighting.  Finally, he took us prisoners, and\nmade us sit down and look on at the battle.  As we had been running\naround and each carrying a forty-pound pack, we were glad to remain\ndead.  But we have declared that nothing can kill us tomorrow but\nasphyxiating gas.  I have terrible nightmares for fear something has\nhappened to one of you, and then I trust in the good Lord, and pray him\nto make the time pass swiftly.\n\nGood-night, and all the love and kisses for you both.\n\nRICHARD.\n\n\nOn October 19, 1915, Richard sailed on the Chicago for France and his\nsecond visit to the Great War.  He arrived at Paris on October 30, and\nshortly afterward visited the Western front at Amiens and Artois.  He\nalso interviewed Poincare, and through him the French President sent a\nmessage to the American people.  At this time my brother had received\npermission from the authorities to visit all of the twelve sectors of\nthe French front under particularly advantageous conditions, and was\nnaturally most anxious to do so.  However, through a misunderstanding\nbetween the syndicate he represented and certain of the newspapers\nusing its service, he found it advisable, even although against his own\njudgment, to go to Greece, and to postpone his visit to the sectors of\nthe French front he had not already seen.  On November 13 he left Paris\nbound for Salonica.\n\n\nOn Way to France, Oct. 18, 1915.\n\nDEAREST ONE:\n\nYou are much more brave than I am.  Anyway, you are much better\nbehaved.  For all the time you were talking I was crying, not with my\neyes only, but with ALL of me.  I am so sad.  I love you so, and I will\nmiss you so.  I want you to keep saying to yourself all the time, \"This\nis the most serious effort he ever made, because the chances of seeing\nanything are so SMALL, and because never had he such a chance to HELP.\nBut, all the time, every minute he thinks of me.  He wants me.  He\nmisses my voice, my eyes, my presence at his side when he walks or\nsleeps.  He never loved me so greatly, or at leaving me was so unhappy\nas he is now.\"\n\nGoodby, dear heart.  My God-given one!  Would it not be wonderful, if\ntonight when I am up among the boats on the top deck that girl in the\nPierrot suit, and in her arms Hope, came, and I took them and held them\nboth?  You will walk with her at five, and I will walk and think of you\nand love you and long for you.\n\nGod keep you, dearest of wives, and mothers.\n\nRICHARD.\n\n\nOctober 24.\n\nMY DEAR DAUGHTER:\n\nSo many weeks have passed since I saw you that by now you are able to\nread this without your mother looking over your shoulder and helping\nyou with the big words.  I have six sets of pictures of you.  Every day\nI take them down and change them.  Those your dear mother put in glass\nframes I do not change.  Also, I have all the sweet fruits and\nchocolates and red bananas.  How good of you to think of just the\nthings your father likes.  Some of them I gave to a little boy and\ngirl.  I play with them because soon my daughter will be as big.  They\nhave no mother like you, OF COURSE; they have no mother like YOURS--for\nexcept my mother there never was a mother like yours; so loving, so\ntender, so unselfish and thoughtful.  If she is reading this, kiss her\nfor me.  These little children have a little father.  He dresses them\nand bathes them himself.  He is afraid of the cold; and sits in the\nsun; and coughs and shivers.  His children and I play hide-and-seek,\nand, as you will know some day, for that game there is no such place as\na steamer, with boats and ventilators and masts and alleyways.  Some\nday we will play that game hiding behind the rocks and trees and rose\nbushes.  Every day I watch the sun set, and know that you and your\npretty mother are watching it, too.  And all day I think of you both.\n\nBe very good.  Do not bump yourself.  Do not eat matches.  Do not play\nwith scissors or cats.  Do not forget your dad.  Sleep when your mother\nwishes it.  Love us both.  Try to know how we love you.  THAT you will\nnever learn.  Good-night and God keep you, and bless you.\n\nYOUR DAD.\n\n\nPARIS, November 1.\n\nDEAREST ONE:\n\nToday is \"moving\" day, and I feel like ---- censored word, at the\nthought of your having the moving to direct and manage by yourself.  I\ncan picture Barney and Burke loading, and unloading, and coal and wood\nbeing stored, and provisions and ice, and finally Hope brought down to\ntake her third--no--fourth motor ride.  And God will see she makes it\nall safely, and that in her new house you are comfortable.\n\nLast night I dreamed about Hope and you, a long dream, and it made me\nso happy.  Something happened today that you will like to hear.  When\nthe war came the French students at the Beaux Arts had to go to fight.\nThe wives and children had nothing to live on.  So, the American\nstudents, about a dozen of them, organized a relief league.  The Beaux\nArts is in a most wonderful palace built by Cardinal Richelieu and\ndecorated later by Napoleon.  In this they were gathering socks,\nasphyxiating masks, warm clothes.  They were hand painting postcards\nfor fifty cents apiece.  The \"masters\" as they call their teachers,\nalso were painting them.  I gave them some money which was received\npolitely, but, as it would not go far, without much enthusiasm.  As I\nwas going, I said, \"I'll be back tomorrow to get some facts and I'll\nwrite a story about what you're doing.\" This is the part that is\nembarrassing to write, but you will understand.  They gave a cheer and\na yell just as though I had said, \"Peace is declared\" or \"I will give\nyou Carnegie's fortune.\"  And they danced around, and shook hands, and\nWhitney Warren, who is at the head of it, all but cried.  Later, he\ntold me the letter I had written for his wife's fund for orphans by the\nwar had brought in $5000, that was why they were so pleased.  So we,\nyou and I, will try to look at it that way, and try to believe that\nfrom this separation, which is cruel for us, others may get some\nbenefit.  Tomorrow, I am to be received at the Elysee by the President,\nand I am going to try to make him say something that will draw money\nfrom America for the French hospitals.  If he will only ask, I know our\npeople will give.  In a day or two, I think I will be allowed to see\nsomething, but, that you will know best by reading The Times.\n\nYour loving husband is lonely for you, and so it will be always.\n\nRICHARD.\n\n\nNovember 17th.\n\nDEAR SWEETHEART:\n\nMy last letter was such a complaining one that I am ashamed.  But, not\nleaving me to decide what was best for the papers, made me mad.  Since\nI wrote, I ought to be madder, for I have been to the trenches outside\nof Rheims in Champagne; and, had they not deviled the spirit out of me\nwith cables, I believe I could have written such a lot of stories of\nFrance that no one else has had the opportunity to write.  Believe me\nno one has yet told the story of the trench war.  Anyway, in spite of\nall the photographs and articles, to me it was all new.  I was allowed\nto go alone, and given carte blanche to see whatever I wished.  I saw\neverything, but it would not be possible to write of it yet.  It was\nwonderful.  I was in the three lines, reaching the FIRST line by\nmoonlight.  No one spoke above a whisper.  The Germans were only 300 to\n400 yards distant.  But worst of all were the rats.  They ran over my\nfeet and I was a darned sight more afraid of them than the Germans.  I\nsaw the Cathedral, and the only hotel open (from which I sent you and\nHope a postal) was the same one in which we stopped a year ago.  I had\nsent the hotel my book in which I said complimentary things, and I got\na great welcome.  They even gave me a room with a fire in it, and so I\nwas warm for the first time since I left the Crossroads.  And this\nmorning it SNOWED.  On my way back to Paris, I stopped to tell the\nGeneral what I had seen and to thank him.  He said, \"Oh, that is\nnothing.  When you return, I will take you out myself, and I will show\nyou something worth while.\"  I am going to carry a rat-trap, and two\nterriers on a leash.  Tonight, when I got back, there was a letter from\nyou, but no writing, but there was a photo of Her, and me holding her.\nHow is it possible that any living thing is so beautiful as my child?\nHow fat, and wonderful, and dear, and lovable, and how terribly I want\nto hold her as I am holding her in the picture, and how much better as\nI really don't need my left arm to hold such a mite), if I had you\nclose to me in it.  I miss you so, and love you so!  I told Wheeler\nbefore I left as I was not going to waste time traveling I would not go\nto Servia.  So, as soon as I arrived, I was fretted with cables to go.\nI cabled to stop giving me advice, that I had a much better chance in\nFrance than anyone could have anywhere else.  Maybe, before I arrive,\nthe Greeks will have joined the Germans, in which case, I WON'T LEAVE\nTHE SHIP.  I'll come straight back on her to the Allies.\n\nRICHARD.\n\n\nNovember 20th.\n\nThis is the way Hope's cat looks, \"My whiskers!\" she says, \"I never\nknew I was to be let in for anything like this!\"  When I told her about\nthe big rats in the trenches she wanted to go with me next time, but,\ntoday when I told her that the Crown Prince of Servia made his servants\neat live mice (he is no longer Crown Prince), she looked just as she\ndoes in the picture.  \"Then, what do _I_ eat in Servia?\" she said, and\nI told her both of us would live on goat's milk.\n\nYou will be glad when I tell you I have been, warm.  We came pretty far\nsouth in two days, and, the damp chill of Paris is gone.  On the train\na funny thing happened.  An English officer and I got talking and he\nwas press censor at Salonica where I am going after Athens.  I asked\nhim to look over the many letters I had and tell me if any of them\nwould be likely to get me in bad, being addressed to pro-Germans, for\nexample.  He said, \"Well, THIS chap is all right anyway.  I'll  vouch\nfor him, because this letter is addressed to me.\"\n\n  SEE THE CAT!\n  HOPE GAVE THE CAT TO HER DAD.\n  IS THE CAT SAD?\n  YES\n  IS THE DAD SAD?\n  VERY!!\n  WHY IS THE CAT AND THE DAD SAD?\n  THEY WANT HOME AND HOPE.\n  DO THEY LOVE HOPE?\n  DON'T MAKE THEM LAUGH!\n\n\nWe leave, the Basses, the English officer and I, in a small tub of a\nboat for Patras, and train to Athens.  I will try to go at once to\nServia.  Harjes, who are the Paris house of J. P. Morgan, gave me a\n\"mission\" to try and organize for the Servians the same form of relief\nas has been arranged for the Belgians.  He gave me permission if I saw\nthe need for help was imminent (and it will be) to cable him for\nwhatever I thought the Serbs most needed.  So, it is a chance to do\nmuch.  To get out news will be impossible.  However, here I am and\ntomorrow I'll be good and seasick.\n\nI have your charm around my neck, and all the pictures, and the\nluck-bringing cat, and the scapular, and the love you give me to keep\nme well and bring us soon together.  That is the one thing I want.  God\nbless you both, Hope's dad and your husband.\n\n\n\nATHENS,\n\nNovember 26th.\n\nDEAR HEART:\n\nI am off tonight for Salonica.  I am not very cheerful for I miss you\nvery, very terribly, and the further I go, the worse I feel.  But now I\nam nearly as far as I can get, and when you receive this I will--thank\nGod--be turned back to Paris, and London, and HOME!  I thought so often\nof you this morning when I took a holiday and climbed the Acropolis.\nOn the top of it I picked a dandelion for you.  It was growing between\nthe blocks of marble that have been there since 400 years before our\nLord: before St. Paul preached to the Athenians.  I was all alone on\nthe rock, and could see over the AEgean Sea, Corinth, Mount Olympus,\nwhere the Gods used to sit, and the Sphinx lay in wait for travelers\nwith her famous riddle.  It takes two days and one night to go to\nSalonica, and the boats are so awful no one undresses but sleeps in his\nclothes on top of the bed.\n\nGoodby, sweetheart, and give SUCH a kiss to my precious daughter.  How\nbeautiful she is.  Even the waiter who brought me a card stopped to\nexclaim about her picture.  So, of course, being not at all proud I\nshowed him her in my arms.  I want you both so and I love you both SO.\nAnd, I wanted you so this morning as I always do when there is a\nbeautiful landscape, or flowers, or palms.  I know how you love them.\nThe dandelion is very modest and I hope the censor won't lose it out,\nfor she has a long way to go and carries a burden of love.  I wish I\nwas bringing them in the door of the Scribner cottage at this very\nminute.\n\nRICHARD.\n\n\nVOLO, November 27.\n\nI got here today, after the darnedest voyage of two days in a small\nsteamer.  We ran through a snow storm and there was no way to warm the\nboat.  So, I DIED.  You know how cold affects me--well--this was the\ncoldest cold I ever died of.  I poured alcohol in me, and it was like\ndrinking iced tea.  Now, I am on shore in a cafe near a stove.  We\ncontinue on to Salonica at midnight.  There are 24 men and one woman,\nMrs. Bass, on board.  I am much too homesick to write more than to say\nI love you, and I miss you and Hope so, that I don't look at the\nphotos.  Did you get the cable I sent Thanksgiving--from Athens, it\nread:  \"Am giving thanks for Hope and you.\"  I hope the censor let that\nget by him.  The boat I was on was a refrigerator ship; it was also\npeculiar in that the captain dealt baccarat all day with the\npassengers.  It was a sort of floating gambling house.  This is\ncertainly a strange land.  Snow and roses and oranges, all at once.  I\nmust stop.  I'm froze.  Give the kiss I want to give to Her, and know,\noh! how I love and love and love her mother--NEVER SO MUCH AS NOW.\n\n\nSALONICA November 30th, 1915.\n\nDEAR OLD MAN:\n\nI got here to night and found it the most picturesque spot I ever\nvisited.  I am glad I came.  It was impossible to get a room but I\nfound John McCutcheon and two other men occupying a grand suite and\nthey have had a cot put in for me.  To-morrow I hope to get a room.\nThe place is filled with every nation except Germans and even they are\nhere out of uniforms.  We had a strange time coming.  The trip from\nAthens should have taken two nights and a day but we took four.  The\nCaptain of the boat anchored and played baccarat whenever he thought\nthere were enough passengers not seasick to make it worth his while.\nHe played from eleven in the morning until four in the morning.  I\ndon't know now who ran the ship.  It is so cold when you bathe, the\nsteam runs off you.  I never have suffered so.  But, it looked as\nthough every one else was singing \"Its going to be a hard, hard winter\"\nfrom the way they, dress.  Tomorrow I am going to buy fur pants.  You\ncan't believe what a picture it is.  Servians, French, Greeks, Scots in\nkilts, London motor cars, Turks, wounded and bandaged Tommies and\nmillions of them fighting for food, for drink, for a place at the\n\"movies,\" and more \"rumors\" than there are words in the directory.\nTo-morrow, I present my letters and hope to get to the \"front.\"  I only\nhope the front doesn't come to us. But, it ought to be a place for\ngreat stories.  All love to you old man, and bless you both.  How I\nlook forward to our first lunch in your wonderful home!  And to sit in\nfront of your fire, and hear all the news.  All love to you both.\n\nRICHARD.\n\n\nDecember 6, 1915.\n\nDEAREST ONE:\n\nI have been away so could not write.  They took us to the French and\nEnglish \"front\" and away from Greece; we were in Bulgaria and Servia.\nIt was at a place where the three boundaries met.  We saw remarkable\nmountain ranges and deep snow, and some fine artillery.  But throwing\nshells into that bleak, white jumble of snow and rocks--there was fifty\nmiles of it--was like throwing a baseball at the Rocky Mountains.\nStill, it was seeing something.  Now, I have a room, and a very\nwonderful one.  I had to bribe everyone in the hotel to get it; and I\nhave something to write and, no more moving about I hope, for at least\na week.  I am able to see the ships at anchor for miles, and the\nlanding stage for all the warships is just under my window.  As near as\nMcCoy Rock from the terrace.  It is like a moving picture all the time.\nI bought myself an oil stove and a can of Standard oil, and, instead of\ntrying to warm the hotel with my body, I let George do it.  But it is a\nvery small stove, and to really get the good of it, I have to sit with\nit between my legs.  Still, it is such a relief to be alone, and not to\npack all the time.  McCutcheon and Bass, Hare and Shepherd are fine,\nbut I felt like the devil, imposing on them, and working four in a room\nis no joke.  We dine together each night.  Except them, I see no one,\nbut have been writing.  Also, I have been collecting facts about\nServian relief.  Harjes, Morgan's representative in Paris, gave me\ncarte blanche to call on him for money or supplies; but I waited until\ntoday to cable, so as to be sure where help was most needed.  It is\nstill cold, but that AWFUL cold spell was quite unprecedented and is\nnot likely to come again.  I NEVER suffered so from cold, and, as you\nknow, I suffer considerable.  All the English officers who had hunted\nin cold places, said neither had they ever felt such cold.  Seven\nhundred Tommies were frost bitten and toes and fingers fell off.  I do\nnot say anything about how awful it is not to hear.  But, if I had had\nyour letters forwarded to this dump of the Levant, I never would have\ngot them.  Now, I have to wait for them until I get to Paris, but there\nI will surely get them.  Cables, of course, can reach me, but no cables\nmean to me that you are all right.  Nor do I want to \"talk\" about\nChristmas.\n\nYou know how I feel about that, and about missing the first one SHE has\nhad.  But it will be the LAST one we will know apart.  Never again!\n\nI want you in my arms and to hear you laugh and see your eyes.  I am in\nneed of you to make a fuss over me.  McCutcheon and Co. don't care\nwhether I have cold hands or not.  You do.  Your ointment and gloves\nsaved my fingers from falling off like the soldiers' did.  And your\n\"housewife\" I use to put on buttons, and, your scapular and medal keep\nme well.  But your love is what really lifts me up and consoles me.\nWhen I think how you and I care for each other, then, I am scared, for\nit is very beautiful.  And we must not ever be away from each other\nagain.  God keep you my beloved, and both my blessings.  I cannot bear\nit--when I think of all I am missing of her, and, all that she is\ndoing.  God guard you both.  My darling and dear wife and mother of\nHope.\n\nYour husband,\n\nRICHARD.\n\n\nSALONICA, December 18th.\n\nDEAREST WIFE AND SWEETHEART:\n\nI am very blue tonight, and NEVER was so homesick.  Yesterday just to\nfeel I was in touch with you I sent a cable through the fog, it said,\n\"Well, homesick, all love to you both.\"  I did not ask if you and Hope\nwere well, because I KNOW the good Lord will not let any harm come to\nyou.  I am certainly caught by the heels this time.  And it will be the\nlast time.  As you know, I meant only to go to France where no time\nwould be wasted in travel, and I would be able to get back soon.  But\nthe blockade held up the ship and on the other one the captain stayed\nat anchor, and, then when I got here, the Allies retreated, and I had\nto stay on to cover what is to come next.  What that is, or whether\nnothing happens, you will know by the time this reaches you.  So, here\nI am.  For TEN days until this morning we have never seen the sun.  In\nsixty years nothing like it has happened.  The Salonicans said the\nEnglish transports brought the fog with them.  Anyway, I got it.  My\nroom is right on the harbor.  I never thought I would LOVE an oil\nstove.  I always thought they were ill-smelling, air-destroying.  But\nthis one saved my life.  I wrote with it between my knees, I dry my\nlaundry on it, and use the tin pan on top of it to take the dampness\nout of the bed.  The fog kept everything like a sponge.  Coal is thirty\ndollars a ton.  To get wood for firewood the boatmen row miles out, and\nwait below the transports to get the boxes they throw overboard.  I go\naround asking EVERYBODY if this place is not now a dead duck for news.\nBut they all give me no encouragement.  They say it is the news center\nof the world.  I hope it chokes.  I try to comfort myself by thinking\nyou are happy, because you have Hope, and I have nobody, except John\nMcCutcheon and Bass and Jimmie Hare, and they are as blue as I am, and\nno one can get any money.  I cabled today to Wheeler for some via the\nState Department.  I went to the Servian camp for the little orphans\nwhose fathers have been killed, and they all knelt and kissed my hands.\nIt was awful.  I thought of Hope, and hugged a few and carried them\naround in my arms and felt much better.  Today for the first time, I\nquit work and went to see an American film at the cinema to cheer me.\nBut when I saw the streetcars, and \"ready to wear\" clothes, and the\npolicemen I got suicidal.  I went back and told the others and they all\nrushed off to see \"home\" things, and are there now.  This is a yell of\na letter, but it's the only kind I can write.   My stories and cables\nare rotten, too.  I have seen nothing--just traveled and waited for\nsomething to happen.  Goodnight, dearest one.  I love you so.  You will\nnever know how much I love you.  Kiss my darling for me, and, think\nonly of the good days when we will be together again.  Such good days.\nGoodnight again--all love.\n\nRICHARD.\n\n\nHARBOR SALONICA, December 19th.\n\nI am a happy man tonight!  And that is the first time I have been able\nto say so since I left you.  The backbone of the trip is broken! and my\nface is turned West--toward you and Hope.  John McCutcheon gave me a\nfarewell dinner tonight of which I got one half, as the police made me\ngo on board at nine, although we do not sail until five in the morning.\nSo there was time for only one toast, as I was making for the door.\nWas it to your husband?  It was not.  It was to Hope Davis, two weeks\nyet of being one year old, and being toasted by the war correspondents\nin Salonica.  They knew it would please me.  And I went away very\nchoken and happy.  SUCH a boat as this is! I have a sofa in the\ndining-room, and at present it is jammed with refugees and all smoking\nand not an air port open.  What a relief it will be to once more get\namong clean people.  We must help the Servians, and God knows they need\nhelp.  But, if they would help each other, or themselves, I would like\nthem better.  I am now on deck under the cargo light and, on the top\nfloor of the Olympus Hotel, can see John's dinner growing gayer and\ngayer.  It is like the man who went on a honeymoon alone.  I am so\nhappy tonight.  You seem so near now that I am coming West.\n\nHow terribly I have missed you, and wanted you, and longed for your\nvoice and LAUGH, and to have you open the door of my writing room, and\nsay, \"A lady is coming to call on you,\" and then enter the dearest wife\nand dearest baby in the world!\n\nGod bless you, and all my love.\n\nRICHARD.\n\n\nROME,\n\nChristmas Eve, 1915.\n\nMY DEAREST, DEAREST, DEAREST:\n\nI planned to get to Paris late Christmas night. I cabled Frazier at the\nEmbassy, to have all my letters at the Hotel de l'Empire.  I MEANT to\nspend the night reading of you and Hope.  I made a record trip from\nSalonica.  By leaving the second steamer at Messina and taking an\neighteen-hour trip across Italy I saved ten hours.  But when I got here\nI found the French Consul had taken a holiday, AND WAS OUT BUYING\nCHRISTMAS PRESENTS!  So, I could not get permission to enter France.\nWith some Red Cross Americans, I raged around the French Consulate, but\nit was no use.  So I am here, and cannot leave UNTIL MIDNIGHT\nCHRISTMAS.  When I found I could not get away, I told Cook's to give me\ntheir rapid-fire guide, and I set out to SEE ROME.  The Manager of\nCook's was the same man who, 19 years ago, sold me tickets to the Greek\nwar in Florence, when the American Consulate was in the same building\nwith Cook's, and Charley was Consul.  So he gave me a great guide.  We\nbegan at ten this morning and we stopped at six.  They say it takes\nfive years to see Rome, but when I let the rapid-fire guide escape, he\nsaid he had to compliment me; we climbed more stairways and hills than\nthere are in all New York and Westchester County; and there is just one\nidea in my mind, and that is that you and I must see this sacred place\ntogether.  On all this trip I have wanted YOU, but NEVER so as today.\nAnd I particularly inquired about the milk.  It is said to be\nexcellent.  So we will come here, and you, with all your love of what\nis fine and beautiful, will be very happy, and Hope will learn Italian,\nand to know what is best in art, and statues and churches.  I have seen\n2900 churches, and all of them built by Michael Angelo and decorated by\nRaphael; and it was so wonderful I cried.  I bought candles and\nprayers, and I am afraid Christian Science had a dull day.  Tomorrow we\nstart at nine, and go to high mass at St. Peter's, and then into the\ncountry to the catacombs, where the early Christians hid from the\nRomans.  It is not what you would call an English Christmas, but it is\nso beautiful and wonderful that you BOTH ARE VERY NEAR.\n\nI sent you a cable, the second one, because it is not sure they are\nforwarded, and I hung up a stocking for Hope.  One of the peasant women\nmade in Salonica.  I am bringing it with me.  And the cat is on my\nwindow--still looking out on the Romans.  The green leaf I got in the\nforum, where Mark Antony made his speech over Caesar's body.  It is the\nplant that gave Pericles the idea of the Corinthian column.  You\nremember.  It was growing under a tile some one had laid over it--and\nthe yellow flower was on my table at dinner, so I send it, that we may\nknow on Christmas Eve we dined together.\n\nGood-night, now, and God bless you.  I am off to bed now, in a bed with\nsheets.  The first in six days.  How I LOVE you, and LOVE you.  Such\ngood wishes I send you, and such love to you both.  May the good Lord\nbless you as he has blessed me--with the best of women, with the best\nof daughters.  I am a proud husband and a proud father; and soon I will\nbe a HAPPY husband and a HAPPY father.\n\nGood-night, dear heart.\n\nRICHARD.\n\n\nPARIS, December 28th, 1915.\n\nDEAR OLD MAN:\n\nHurrah for the Dictator!  He has been a great good friend to me.  I\nwill know to-day about whether I can go back to the French front.  If\nnot I will try the Belgians and then London, and home.  I spent\nChristmas day in Rome in the catacombs.  I could not wear my heart upon\nmy sleeve for duchesses to peck at.  It is just as you say, Dad and\nMother made the day so dear and beautiful.  I did not know how glad I\nwould be to be back here for while the trip East led to no news value,\nto me personally it was interesting.  But I am terribly tired after the\nlast nine days, sleeping on sofas, decks, a different deck each night\nand writing all the time and such poor stuff.  But, oh! when I saw\nParis I knew how glad I was!  WHAT a beautiful place, what a kind\ncourteous people.  We will all be here some day.  Tell Dai she must be\nmy interpreter.  All love to her, and you, and good luck to the\nsyndicate.  YOUR syndicate.  I have not heard from mine for six weeks.\nThey have not sent me a single clipping of anything, so I don't know\nwhether anything got through or not, and I have nothing to show these\npeople here that might encourage them to send me out again.  They\ncertainly have made it hard hoeing.  Tell Guvey his letter about the\ntoys was a great success here, and copied into several papers.\n\nGoodbye, and God bless you, and good luck to you.\n\nDICK.\n\n\nPARIS, December 31st, 1915.\n\nDEAR OLD MAN:\n\nTo wish you and Dai a Happy New Year.  It will mean a lot to us when we\ncan get together, and take it together, good and bad.  I am awfully\npleased over the novel coming out by the Harper's and, in landing so\nmuch for me out of The Dictator.  You have started the New Year for me\nsplendidly.  I expect I will be back around the first of February.  I\nam now trying to \"get back,\" but, I need more time.  I can only put the\ntrip down to the wrong side of the ledger.  Personally, I got a lot out\nof it, but I am not sent over here to improve my knowledge of Europe,\nbut to furnish news and stories and that has not happened.\n\nI am constantly running against folks who knew you in Florence, and I\nregret to say most of them are in business at the Chatham bar.  What a\nstory they make; the M----'s and the like, who know Paris only from the\ncocktail side.  One of our attaches told me to-day he had been lunching\nfor the last 18 months at the grill room of the Chatham, where the\n\"mixed grill\" was as good as in New York.  He had no knowledge of any\nother place to eat.  The Hotel de l'Empire is a terrible tragedy.  They\nare so poor, that I believe it is my eight francs a day keeps them\ngoing; nothing else is in sight.  But, it is the exception.  Never did\na people take a war as the French take this worst of all wars.  They\nreally are the most splendid of people.  I only wish I could have had\none of them for a grandfather or grandmother.  Bessie writes that Hope\nis growing wonderfully and beautifully, and I am sick for a sight of\nher, and for you.  Good night and God bless you and the happiest of New\nYears to you both.\n\nYour loving brother,\n\nDICK.\n\n\nThese postcards are \"originals\" painted by students of the Beaux-Arts\nto keep alive, and to keep those students in the trenches.  They are\nfor Dai.\n\n\nPARIS, December 31, 1915.\n\nDEAREST ONE:\n\nThe old year, the dear, old year that brought us Hope, is very near the\nend.  I am not going to watch him go.  I have drunk to the New Year and\nto my wife and daughter, and before there is \"a new step on the floor,\nand a new face at the door,\" I will be asleep.  Of all my many years,\nthe old year, that is so soon to pass away, has been the best, for it\nhas brought you to me with a closer tie, has added to the love I have\nfor every breath you breathe, for your laugh and your smile, and deep\nconcern, that comes if you think your worthless husband is worried, or\ncross, or dismayed.  Each year I love you more; for I know you more,\nand to know more of the lovely soul you are, is to love more.  Just now\nwe are in a hard place.  I am sure you cannot comprehend how her\nfather, her \"Dad\" and your husband can keep away.  Neither do I\nunderstand.\n\nBut, for both your sakes, I want, before I own up that this adventure\nhas been a failure, to try and pull something out of the wreck.  If the\ngovernment says I CAN, then I still may be able to do something.  If it\nsays, \"NO,\" then it's Home, boys, Home, and that's where I want to be.\nIt's home, boys, home, in the old countree.  'Neath the ash, and the\noak, and the spreading maple tree, it's home, boys, home, to mine own\ncountree!  This is Hope and you.  So know, that in getting to you I\nhave not thrown away a minute.  I have been a slave-driver, to others\nas well as to myself.  But you cannot get favors with a whip; and, the\nFrench war office has other matters to occupy it, that it considers of\nmore importance than an impatient war correspondent.  So long as you\nunderstand, it will not matter.  Nothing hurts, except that you may not\nunderstand.  The moment I see you, and you see me, you will understand.\nSo, goodnight, and God bless you, you, my two blessings.  Here is to\nour own year of 1915, your year and Hope's year, and, because I have\nyou both, my year.  I send you all the love in all the world.\n\nRICHARD.\n\n\nJanuary 5, 1916.\n\nMY DEAREST ONE:\n\nWHAT PICTURES!  WHAT HAPPINESS!  What a proud Richard!  On top of my\nwriting yesterday that I had had no sketches of yours, and no kodaks of\nHope, eight came to-night, and oh!  I am so proud, so homesick.  What a\nwonderful nurse and mother you are!  Was ever there anything so\nlovable?  And that she should be ours, to hold and to love, and to make\nhappy.  These last eight days in Paris, in and out, have made me so\nhomesick for those I love, that you will never know what the delays\nmeant.  I felt just the way poor women feel who kidnap babies.  In the\nparks I know the nurse-maids are afraid of me.  I stick my head under\nthe hoods of the baby carriages, and stop and stand watching them at\nplay.  And tonight when all these beautiful pictures came, I was the\nhappiest father anywhere.\n\nThe delay was no one's fault, not mine anyway, nor can I blame anyone.\nThese people are splendid.  They are willing to do anything for one,\nbut it takes time.  When they are fighting for their lives and have not\nseen their own babies in a year, that you want to see yours is only\nnatural and to oblige you they can't see why they should upset the\nwhole war.  But now it looks less as though I would have to call it a\nfailure.  And Hope may be proud of me, and you may be proud of me, and\nI will have enough ammunition to draw on for many articles and letters,\nand another book.\n\nIt has been a cruel time; and when I tell you how I worked to get it\nover, and to be back with you, you will understand many things.  The\nmost important of all will be how I love you.  Only wait until I can\nlay eyes on you, you will just take one look and know that it couldn't\nbe helped, that the delay was the work of others, that, all I wanted\nwas my Bessie and my Hope.\n\nHow heavy she will be, if she is anything like the picture of her on\nthe coverlet, she is a prize baby.  And if she is anything like as\nbeautiful as in the baby carriage she is an angel straight from God.  I\nwant to sit in the green chair and have you on one knee and her majesty\non the other, and have her climb over me, and pull my hair and bang my\nnose, and in time to know how I love you both.\n\nGoodnight, dear heart, I wish you had had yourself in the picture.  I\nhave three in the summer time with you holding her and that is the way\nI like to see you, that is the way I think of you.  I love you, and I\nlove her for making you so happy, and I love her for her sake, and\nbecause she is OURS: and has tied us tighter and closer even than it\nhas ever been.  I love you so that I can't write about it, and I am\ngoing to do nothing all spring but just sit around, and be in\neverybody's way, watching you together.\n\nHow jealous I am of you, and homesick for you.  Of course, she knows\n\"mamma\" is YOU; and to look at you when they ask, \"Where's mother?\"\nWho else could be her mother BUT THE DEAREST WOMAN IN THE WORLD, and\nthe one who loves her so, and in so wonderful a way.  She is beautiful\nbeyond all things human I know.  If ever a woman deserved a beautiful\ndaughter, YOU DO, for you are the best of mothers, and you know how \"to\ncare greatly.\"\n\nGood-night, my precious, dear one, and God keep you, as He will, and\nhelp me to keep you both happy.  What you give me you never will know.\n\nRICHARD.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XX\n\nTHE LAST DAYS\n\nAfter a short visit to London, Richard returned to New York in\nFebruary, 1916.  During his absence his wife and Hope had occupied the\nScribner cottage at Mount Kisco, about two miles from Crossroads.  Here\nmy brother finished his second book on the war, and wrote numerous\narticles and letters urging the immediate necessity for preparedness in\nthis country.  As to Richard's usefulness to his country at this time,\nI quote in part from two appreciations written after my brother's death\nby the two most prominent exponents of preparedness.\n\nTheodore Roosevelt said:\n\n\"He was as good an American as ever lived, and his heart flamed against\ncruelty and injustice.  His writings form a text-book of Americanism\nwhich all our people would do well to read at the present time.\"\n\nMajor-General Leonard Wood said:\n\n\"The death of Richard Harding Davis was a real loss to the movement for\npreparedness.  Mr. Davis had an extensive experience as a military\nobserver, and thoroughly appreciated the need of a general training\nsystem like that of Australia or Switzerland and of thorough\norganization of our industrial resources in, order to establish a\ncondition of reasonable preparedness in this country.  A few days\nbefore his death he came to Governors Island for the purpose of\nascertaining in what line of work he could be most useful in building\nup sound public opinion in favor of such preparedness as would give us\na real peace insurance.  His mind was bent on devoting his energies and\nabilities to the work of public education on this vitally important\nsubject, and few men were better qualified to do so, for he had served\nas a military observer in many campaigns.\n\n\"Throughout the Cuban campaign he was attached to the headquarters of\nmy regiment in Cuba as a military observer.  He was with the advanced\nparty at the opening of the fight at Las Guasiinas, and was\ndistinguished throughout the fight by coolness and good conduct.  He\nalso participated in the battle of San Juan and the siege of Santiago,\nand as an observer was always where duty called him.  He was a\ndelightful companion, cheerful, resourceful, and thoughtful of the\ninterests and wishes of others.  His reports of the game were valuable\nand among the best and most accurate.\n\n\"The Plattsburg movement took a very strong hold of him.  He saw in\nthis a great instrument for building up a sound knowledge concerning\nour military history and policy, also a very practical way of training\nmen for the duties of junior officers.  He realized fully that we\nshould need in case of war tens of thousands of officers with our newly\nraised troops, and that it would be utterly impossible to prepare them\nin the hurry and confusion of the onrush of modern war.  His heart was\nfilled with a desire to serve his country to the best of his ability.\nHis recent experience in Europe pointed out to him the absolute madness\nof longer disregarding the need of doing those things which reasonable\npreparedness dictates, the things which cannot be accomplished after\ntrouble is upon us.  He had in mind at the time of his death a series\nof articles to be written especially to build up interest in universal\nmilitary training through conveying to our people an understanding of\nwhat organization as it exists to-day means, and how vitally important\nit is for our people to do in time of peace those things which modern\nwar does not permit done once it is under way.\n\n\"Davis was a loyal friend, a thoroughgoing American devoted to the best\ninterests of his country, courageous, sympathetic, and true.  His loss\nhas been a very real one to all of us who knew and appreciated him, and\nin his death the cause of preparedness has lost an able worker and the\ncountry a devoted and loyal citizen.\"\n\nAlthough suffering from his strenuous experiences in France, and more\nparticularly from those in Greece, Richard continued to accomplish his\nusual enormous amount of work, and during these weeks wrote his last\nshort story, \"The Deserter.\"\n\nThe following letter was written to me while I was in the Bahamas and\nwas in reference to a novel which I had dedicated to Hope:\n\n\nMOUNT KISCO--February 28, 1916.\n\nDEAR OLD MAN:\n\nNo word yet of the book, except the advts. I enclose.  I will send you\nthe notices as soon as they begin to appear.  I am so happy over the\ndedication, and, very proud.  So, Hope will be when she knows.  As I\nhave not read the novel it all will come as a splendid and pleasant\nsurprise.  I am looking forward to sitting down to it with all the\npleasure in the world.\n\nYou chose the right moment to elope.  Never was weather so cold, cruel\nand bitter.  Hope is the only one who goes out of doors.\n\nI start the fires in the Big House tomorrow and the plumbers and paper\nhangers, painters enter the day after.\n\nThe attack on Verdun makes me sick.  I was there six weeks ago in one\nof the forts but of course could not then nor can I now write of it.  I\ndon't believe the drive ever can get through.  For two reasons, and the\nunmilitary one is that I believe in a just God.  Give my love to Dai,\nand for you always\n\nDICK.\n\nP. S. I am happy you are both so happy, but those post cards with the\npalms were cruelty to animals.\n\n\nOn the 21st of March, 1916, Richard and his wife and daughter moved\nfrom the Scribner cottage to Crossroads, and a few days later he was\nattacked by the illness that ended in his death on April 11.  He had\ndined with his wife and afterward had worked on an article on\npreparedness, written some letters and telegrams concerning the same\nsubject and, while repeating one of the latter over the telephone, was\nstricken.  Within a week of his fifty-third year, just one year from\nthe day he had first brought his baby daughter to her real home, doing\nthe best and finest work of his career in the cause of the Allies and\npreparedness, quite unconscious that the end was near, he left us.  In\nthose fifty-two years he had crowded the work, the pleasures, the kind,\nchivalrous deeds of many men, and he died just as I am sure he would\nhave wished to die, working into the night for a great cause, and\nalthough ill and tired, still fretful for the morning that he might\nagain take up the fight.",
