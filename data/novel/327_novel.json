 "text": "THE PRINCESS ALINE\n\n\nBY\n\nRICHARD HARDING DAVIS\n\n\n\n\n\nTHE PRINCESS ALINE\n\n\nI\n\n\nH. R. H. the Princess Aline of Hohenwald came into the life of Morton\nCarlton--or \"Morney\" Carlton, as men called him--of New York city, when\nthat young gentleman's affairs and affections were best suited to\nreceive her.  Had she made her appearance three years sooner or three\nyears later, it is quite probable that she would have passed on out of\nhis life with no more recognition from him than would have been\nexpressed in a look of admiring curiosity.\n\nBut coming when she did, when his time and heart were both unoccupied,\nshe had an influence upon young Mr. Carlton which led him into doing\nseveral wise and many foolish things, and which remained with him\nalways.  Carlton had reached a point in his life, and very early in his\nlife, when he could afford to sit at ease and look back with modest\nsatisfaction to what he had forced himself to do, and forward with\npleasurable anticipations to whatsoever he might choose to do in the\nfuture.  The world had appreciated what he had done, and had put much\nto his credit, and he was prepared to draw upon this grandly.\n\nAt the age of twenty he had found himself his own master, with\nexcellent family connections, but with no family, his only relative\nbeing a bachelor uncle, who looked at life from the point of view of\nthe Union Club's windows, and who objected to his nephew's leaving\nHarvard to take up the study of art in Paris.  In that city (where at\nJulian's he was nicknamed the junior Carlton, for the obvious reason\nthat he was the older of the two Carltons in the class, and because he\nwas well dressed) he had shown himself a harder worker than others who\nwere less careful of their appearance and of their manners.  His work,\nof which he did not talk, and his ambitions, of which he also did not\ntalk, bore fruit early, and at twenty-six he had become a\nportrait-painter of international reputation.  Then the French\ngovernment purchased one of his paintings at an absurdly small figure,\nand placed it in the Luxembourg, from whence it would in time depart to\nbe buried in the hall of some provincial city; and American\nmillionaires, and English Lord Mayors, members of Parliament, and\nmembers of the Institute, masters of hounds in pink coats, and\nambassadors in gold lace, and beautiful women of all nationalities and\nconditions sat before his easel.  And so when he returned to New York\nhe was welcomed with an enthusiasm which showed that his countrymen had\nfeared that the artistic atmosphere of the Old World had stolen him\nfrom them forever.  He was particularly silent, even at this date,\nabout his work, and listened to what others had to say of it with much\nawe, not unmixed with some amusement, that it should be he who was\ncapable of producing anything worthy of such praise.  We have been told\nwhat the mother duck felt when her ugly duckling turned into a swan,\nbut we have never considered how much the ugly duckling must have\nmarvelled also.\n\n\"Carlton is probably the only living artist,\" a brother artist had said\nof him, \"who fails to appreciate how great his work is.\"  And on this\nbeing repeated to Carlton by a good-natured friend, he had replied\ncheerfully, \"Well, I'm sorry, but it is certainly better to be the only\none who doesn't appreciate it than to be the only one who does.\"\n\nHe had never understood why such a responsibility had been intrusted to\nhim.  It was, as he expressed it, not at all in his line, and young\ngirls who sought to sit at the feet of the master found him making love\nto them in the most charming manner in the world, as though he were not\nentitled to all the rapturous admiration of their very young hearts,\nbut had to sue for it like any ordinary mortal.  Carlton always felt as\nthough some day some one would surely come along and say: \"Look here,\nyoung man, this talent doesn't belong to you; it's mine.  What do you\nmean by pretending that such an idle good-natured youth as yourself is\nentitled to such a gift of genius?\"  He felt that he was keeping it in\ntrust, as it were; that it had been changed at birth, and that the\nproper guardian would eventually relieve him of his treasure.\n\nPersonally Carlton was of the opinion that he should have been born in\nthe active days of knights-errant--to have had nothing more serious to\ndo than to ride abroad with a blue ribbon fastened to the point of his\nlance, and with the spirit to unhorse any one who objected to its\ncolor, or to the claims of superiority of the noble lady who had tied\nit there.  There was not, in his opinion, at the present day any\nsufficiently pronounced method of declaring admiration for the many\nlovely women this world contained.  A proposal of marriage he\nconsidered to be a mean and clumsy substitute for the older way, and\nwas uncomplimentary to the many other women left unasked, and marriage\nitself required much more constancy than he could give.  He had a most\nromantic and old-fashioned ideal of women as a class, and from the age\nof fourteen had been a devotee of hundreds of them as individuals; and\nthough in that time his ideal had received several severe shocks, he\nstill believed that the \"not impossible she\" existed somewhere, and his\nconscientious efforts to find out whether every women he met might not\nbe that one had led him not unnaturally into many difficulties.\n\n\"The trouble with me is,\" he said, \"that I care too much to make\nPlatonic friendship possible, and don't care enough to marry any\nparticular woman--that is, of course, supposing that any particular one\nwould be so little particular as to be willing to marry me.  How\nembarrassing it would be, now,\" he argued, \"if, when you were turning\naway from the chancel after the ceremony, you should look at one of the\nbridesmaids and see the woman whom you really should have married!  How\ndistressing that would be!  You couldn't very well stop and say: 'I am\nvery sorry, my dear, but it seems I have made a mistake.  That young\nwoman on the right has a most interesting and beautiful face.  I am\nvery much afraid that she is the one.'  It would be too late then;\nwhile now, in my free state, I can continue my search without any\nsense of responsibility.\"\n\n\"Why\"--he would exclaim--\"I have walked miles to get a glimpse of a\nbeautiful woman in a suburban window, and time and time again when I\nhave seen a face in a passing brougham I have pursued it in a hansom,\nand learned where the owner of the face lived, and spent weeks in\nfinding some one to present me, only to discover that she was\nself-conscious or uninteresting or engaged.  Still I had assured myself\nthat she was not the one.  I am very conscientious, and I consider that\nit is my duty to go so far with every woman I meet as to be able to\nlearn whether she is or is not the one, and the sad result is that I am\nlike a man who follows the hounds but is never in at the death.\"\n\n\"Well,\" some married woman would say, grimly, \"I hope you will get your\ndeserts some day; and you WILL, too.  Some day some girl will make you\nsuffer for this.\"\n\n\"Oh, that's all right,\" Carlton would answer, meekly.  \"Lots of women\nhave made me suffer, if that's what you think I need.\"\n\n\"Some day,\" the married woman would prophesy, \"you will care for a\nwoman so much that you will have no eyes for any one else.  That's the\nway it is when one is married.\"\n\n\"Well, when that's the way it is with ME,\" Carlton would reply, \"I\ncertainly hope to get married; but until it is, I think it is safer for\nall concerned that I should not.\"\n\nThen Carlton would go to the club and complain bitterly to one of his\nfriends.\n\n\"How unfair married women are!\" he would say.  \"The idea of thinking a\nman could have no eyes but for one woman!  Suppose I had never heard a\nnote of music until I was twenty-five years of age, and was then given\nmy hearing.  Do you suppose my pleasure in music would make me lose my\npleasure in everything else?  Suppose I met and married a girl at\ntwenty-five.  Is that going to make me forget all the women I knew\nbefore I met her?  I think not.  As a matter of fact, I really deserve\na great deal of credit for remaining single, for I am naturally very\naffectionate; but when I see what poor husbands my friends make, I\nprefer to stay as I am until I am sure that I will make a better one.\nIt is only fair to the woman.\"\n\nCarlton was sitting in the club alone.  He had that sense of\nsuperiority over his fellows and of irresponsibility to the world about\nhim that comes to a man when he knows that his trunks are being packed\nand that his state-room is engaged.  He was leaving New York long\nbefore most of his friends could get away.  He did not know just where\nhe was going, and preferred not to know.  He wished to have a complete\nholiday, and to see Europe as an idle tourist, and not as an artist\nwith an eye to his own improvement.  He had plenty of time and money;\nhe was sure to run across friends in the big cities, and acquaintances\nhe could make or not, as he pleased, en route.  He was not sorry to go.\nHis going would serve to put an end to what gossip there might be of\nhis engagement to numerous young women whose admiration for him as an\nartist, he was beginning to fear, had taken on a more personal tinge.\n\"I wish,\" he said, gloomily, \"I didn't like people so well.  It seems\nto cause them and me such a lot of trouble.\"\n\nHe sighed, and stretched out his hand for a copy of one of the English\nillustrated papers.  It had a fresher interest to him because the next\nnumber of it that he would see would be in the city in which it was\nprinted.  The paper in his hands was the St. James Budget, and it\ncontained much fashionable intelligence concerning the preparations for\na royal wedding which was soon to take place between members of two of\nthe reigning families of Europe.  There was on one page a half-tone\nreproduction of a photograph, which showed a group of young people\nbelonging to several of these reigning families, with their names and\ntitles printed above and below the picture.  They were princesses,\narchdukes, or grand-dukes, and they were dressed like young English men\nand women, and with no sign about them of their possible military or\nsocial rank.\n\nOne of the young princesses in the photograph was looking out of it and\nsmiling in a tolerant, amused way, as though she had thought of\nsomething which she could not wait to enjoy until after the picture was\ntaken.  She was not posing consciously, as were some of the others, but\nwas sitting in a natural attitude, with one arm over the back of her\nchair, and with her hands clasped before her.  Her face was full of a\nfine intelligence and humor, and though one of the other princesses in\nthe group was far more beautiful, this particular one had a much more\nhigh-bred air, and there was something of a challenge in her smile that\nmade any one who looked at the picture smile also.  Carlton studied the\nface for some time, and mentally approved of its beauty; the others\nseemed in comparison wooden and unindividual, but this one looked like\na person he might have known, and whom he would certainly have liked.\nHe turned the page and surveyed the features of the Oxford crew with\nlesser interest, and then turned the page again and gazed critically\nand severely at the face of the princess with the high-bred smile.  He\nhad hoped that he would find it less interesting at a second glance,\nbut it did not prove to be so.\n\n\"'The Princess Aline of Hohenwald,'\" he read.  \"She's probably engaged\nto one of those Johnnies beside her, and the Grand-Duke of Hohenwald\nbehind her must be her brother.\"  He put the paper down and went into\nluncheon, and diverted himself by mixing a salad dressing; but after a\nfew moments he stopped in the midst of this employment, and told the\nwaiter, with some unnecessary sharpness, to bring him the last copy of\nthe St. James Budget.\n\n\"Confound it!\" he added, to himself.\n\nHe opened the paper with a touch of impatience and gazed long and\nearnestly at the face of the Princess Aline, who continued to return\nhis look with the same smile of amused tolerance.  Carlton noted every\ndetail of her tailor-made gown, of her high mannish collar, of her tie,\nand even the rings on her hand.  There was nothing about her of which\nhe could fairly disapprove.  He wondered why it was that she could not\nhave been born an approachable New York girl instead of a princess of a\nlittle German duchy, hedged in throughout her single life, and to be\ntraded off eventually in marriage with as much consideration as though\nshe were a princess of a real kingdom.\n\n\"She looks jolly too,\" he mused, in an injured tone; \"and so very\nclever; and of course she has a beautiful complexion.  All those German\ngirls have.  Your Royal Highness is more than pretty,\" he said, bowing\nhis head gravely.  \"You look as a princess should look.  I am sure it\nwas one of your ancestors who discovered the dried pea under a dozen\nmattresses.\"  He closed the paper, and sat for a moment with a\nperplexed smile of consideration.  \"Waiter,\" he exclaimed, suddenly,\n\"send a messenger-boy to Brentano's for a copy of the St. James Budget,\nand bring me the Almanach de Gotha from the library.  It is a little\nfat red book on the table near the window.\" Then Carlton opened the\npaper again and propped it up against a carafe, and continued his\ncritical survey of the Princess Aline.  He seized the Almanach, when it\ncame, with some eagerness.\n\n\"Hohenwald (Maison de Grasse),\" he read, and in small type below it:\n\n\n\"1. Ligne cadette (regnante) grand-ducale: Hohenwald et de Grasse.\n\n\"Guillaume-Albert-Frederick-Charles-Louis, Grand-Duc de Hohenwald et de\nGrasse, etc., etc., etc.\"\n\n\n\"That's the brother, right enough,\" muttered Carlton.\n\nAnd under the heading \"Soeurs\" he read:\n\n\n\"4. Psse Aline.--Victoria-Beatrix-Louise-Helene, Alt.  Gr.-Duc. Nee a\nGrasse, Juin, 1872.\"\n\n\n\"Twenty-two years old,\" exclaimed Carlton.  \"What a perfect age! I\ncould not have invented a better one.\"  He looked from the book to the\nface before him.  \"Now, my dear young lady,\" he said, \"I know all about\nYOU.  You live at Grasse, and you are connected, to judge by your\nnames, with all the English royalties; and very pretty names they are,\ntoo--Aline, Helene, Victoria, Beatrix.  You must be much more English\nthan you are German; and I suppose you live in a little old castle, and\nyour brother has a standing army of twelve men, and some day you are to\nmarry a Russian Grand-Duke, or whoever your brother's Prime Minister--if\nhe has a Prime Minister--decides is best for the politics of your little\ntoy kingdom.  Ah! to think,\" exclaimed Carlton, softly, \"that such a\nlovely and glorious creature as that should be sacrificed for so\ninsignificant a thing as the peace of Europe when she might make some\nyoung man happy?\"\n\nHe carried a copy of the paper to his room, and cut the picture of the\ngroup out of the page and pasted it carefully on a stiff piece of\ncard-board.  Then he placed it on his dressing-table, in front of a\nphotograph of a young woman in a large silver frame--which was a sign,\nhad the young woman but known it, that her reign for the time being was\nover.\n\nNolan, the young Irishman who \"did for\" Carlton, knew better than to\nmove it when he found it there.  He had learned to study his master\nsince he had joined him in London, and understood that one photograph\nin the silver frame was entitled to more consideration than three\nothers on the writing-desk or half a dozen on the mantel-piece.  Nolan\nhad seen them come and go; he had watched them rise and fall; he had\ncarried notes to them, and books and flowers; and had helped to dispose\nthem from the silver frame and move them on by degrees down the line,\nuntil they went ingloriously into the big brass bowl on the side table.\nNolan approved highly of this last choice.  He did not know which one\nof the three in the group it might be; but they were all pretty, and\ntheir social standing was certainly distinguished.\n\nGuido, the Italian model who ruled over the studio, and Nolan were\nbusily packing when Carlton entered.  He always said that Guido\nrepresented him in his professional and Nolan in his social capacity.\nGuido cleaned the brushes and purchased the artists' materials; Nolan\ncleaned his riding-boots and bought his theatre and railroad tickets.\n\n\"Guido,\" said Carlton, \"there are two sketches I made in Germany last\nyear, one of the Prime Minister, and one of Ludwig the actor; get them\nout for me, will you, and pack them for shipping.  Nolan,\" he went on,\n\"here is a telegram to send.\"\n\nNolan would not have read a letter, but he looked upon telegrams as\npublic documents, the reading of them as part of his perquisites.  This\none was addressed to Oscar Von Holtz, First Secretary, German Embassy,\nWashington, D.C., and the message read:\n\n\n\"Please telegraph me full title and address Princess Aline of\nHohenwald.  Where would a letter reach her?\n\n\"MORTON CARLTON.\"\n\n\nThe next morning Nolan carried to the express office a box containing\ntwo oil-paintings on small canvases.  They were addressed to the man in\nLondon who attended to the shipping and forwarding of Carlton's\npictures in that town.\n\n\nThere was a tremendous crowd on the New York.  She sailed at the\nobliging hour of eleven in the morning, and many people, in\nconsequence, whose affection would not have stood in the way of their\nbreakfast, made it a point to appear and to say goodbye.  Carlton, for\nhis part, did not notice them; he knew by experience that the\nattractive-looking people always leave a steamer when the whistle\nblows, and that the next most attractive-looking, who remain on board,\nare ill all the way over.  A man that he knew seized him by the arm as\nhe was entering his cabin, and asked if he were crossing or just seeing\npeople off.\n\n\"Well, then, I want to introduce you to Miss Morris and her aunt, Mrs.\nDowns; they are going over, and I should be glad if you would be nice\nto them.  But you know her, I guess?\" he asked, over his shoulder, as\nCarlton pushed his way after him down the deck.\n\n\"I know who she is,\" he said.\n\nMiss Edith Morris was surrounded by a treble circle of admiring\nfriends, and seemed to be holding her own.  They all stopped when\nCarlton came up, and looked at him rather closely, and those whom he\nknew seemed to mark the fact by a particularly hearty greeting.  The\nman who had brought him up acted as though he had successfully\naccomplished a somewhat difficult and creditable feat.  Carlton bowed\nhimself away, leaving Miss Morris to her friends, and saying that she\nwould probably have to see him later, whether she wished it or not.  He\nthen went to meet the aunt, who received him kindly, for there were\nvery few people on the passenger list, and she was glad they were to\nhave his company.  Before he left she introduced him to a young man\nnamed Abbey, who was hovering around her most anxiously, and whose\ninterest, she seemed to think it necessary to explain, was due to the\nfact that he was engaged to Miss Morris.  Mr. Abbey left the steamer\nwhen the whistle blew, and Carlton looked after him gratefully.  He\nalways enjoyed meeting attractive girls who were engaged, as it left\nhim no choice in the matter, and excused him from finding out whether\nor not that particular young woman was the one.\n\nMrs. Downs and her niece proved to be experienced sailors, and faced\nthe heavy sea that met the New York outside of Sandy Hook with\nunconcern.  Carlton joined them, and they stood together leaning with\ntheir backs to the rail, and trying to fit the people who flitted past\nthem to the names on the passenger list.\n\n\"The young lady in the sailor suit,\" said Miss Morris, gazing at the\ntop of the smoke-stack, \"is Miss Kitty Flood, of Grand Rapids.  This is\nher first voyage, and she thinks a steamer is something like a yacht,\nand dresses for the part accordingly.  She does not know that it is\nmerely a moving hotel.\"\n\n\"I am afraid,\" said Carlton, \"to judge from her agitation, that hers is\ngoing to be what the professionals call a 'dressing-room' part.  Why is\nit,\" he asked, \"that the girls on a steamer who wear gold anchors and\nthe men in yachting-caps are always the first to disappear?  That man\nwith the sombrero,\" he went on, \"is James M. Pollock, United States\nConsul to Mauritius; he is going out to his post.  I know he is the\nconsul, because he comes from Fort Worth, Texas, and is therefore\nadmirably fitted to speak either French or the native language of the\nisland.\"\n\n\"Oh, we don't send consuls to Mauritius,\" laughed Miss Morris.\n\"Mauritius is one of those places from which you buy stamps, but no one\nreally lives or goes there.\"\n\n\"Where are you going, may I ask?\" inquired Carlton.\n\nMiss Morris said that they were making their way to Constantinople and\nAthens, and then to Rome; that as they had not had the time to take the\nsouthern route, they purposed to journey across the Continent direct\nfrom Paris to the Turkish capital by the Orient Express.\n\n\"We shall be a few days in London, and in Paris only long enough for\nsome clothes,\" she replied.\n\n\"The trousseau,\" thought Carlton.  \"Weeks is what she should have said.\"\n\nThe three sat together at the captain's table, and as the sea continued\nrough, saw little of either the captain or his other guests, and were\nthrown much upon the society of each other.  They had innumerable\nfriends and interests in common; and Mrs. Downs, who had been\neverywhere, and for long seasons at a time, proved as alive as her\nniece, and Carlton conceived a great liking for her.  She seemed to be\njust and kindly minded, and, owing to her age, to combine the wider\njudgment of a man with the sympathetic interest of a woman.  Sometimes\nthey sat together in a row and read, and gossiped over what they read,\nor struggled up the deck as it rose and fell and buffeted with the\nwind; and later they gathered in a corner of the saloon and ate late\nsuppers of Carlton's devising, or drank tea in the captain's cabin,\nwhich he had thrown open to them.  They had started knowing much about\none another, and this and the necessary proximity of the ship hastened\ntheir acquaintance.\n\nThe sea grew calmer the third day out, and the sun came forth and\nshowed the decks as clean as bread-boards.  Miss Morris and Carlton\nseated themselves on the huge iron riding-bits in the bow, and with\ntheir elbows on the rail looked down at the whirling blue water, and\nrejoiced silently in the steady rush of the great vessel, and in the\nuncertain warmth of the March sun.  Carlton was sitting to leeward of\nMiss Morris, with a pipe between his teeth.  He was warm, and at peace\nwith the world.  He had found his new acquaintance more than\nentertaining.  She was even friendly, and treated him as though he were\nmuch her junior, as is the habit of young women lately married or who\nare about to be married.  Carlton did not resent it; on the contrary,\nit made him more at his ease with her, and as she herself chose to\ntreat him as a youth, he permitted himself to be as foolish as he\npleased.\n\n\"I don't know why it is,\" he complained, peering over the rail, \"but\nwhenever I look over the side to watch the waves a man in a greasy cap\nalways sticks his head out of a hole below me and scatters a barrelful\nof ashes or potato peelings all over the ocean.  It spoils the effect\nfor one.  Next time he does it I am going to knock out the ashes of my\npipe on the back of his neck.\"  Miss Morris did not consider this\nworthy of comment, and there was a long lazy pause.\n\n\"You haven't told us where you go after London,\" she said; and then,\nwithout waiting for him to reply, she asked, \"Is it your professional\nor your social side that you are treating to a trip this time?\"\n\n\"Who told you that?\" asked Carlton, smiling.\n\n\"Oh, I don't know.  Some man.  He said you were a Jekyll and Hyde.\nWhich is Jekyll?  You see, I only know your professional side.\"\n\n\"You must try to find out for yourself by deduction,\" he said, \"as you\npicked out the other passengers.  I am going to Grasse,\" he continued.\n\"It's the capital of Hohenwald.  Do you know it?\"\n\n\"Yes,\" she said; \"we were there once for a few days.  We went to see\nthe pictures.  I suppose you know that the old Duke, the father of the\npresent one, ruined himself almost by buying pictures for the Grasse\ngallery.  We were there at a bad time, though, when the palace was\nclosed to visitors, and the gallery too.  I suppose that is what is\ntaking you there?\"\n\n\"No,\" Carlton said, shaking his head.  \"No, it is not the pictures.  I\nam going to Grasse,\" he said, gravely, \"to see the young woman with\nwhom I am in love.\"\n\nMiss Morris looked up in some surprise, and smiled consciously, with a\nnatural feminine interest in an affair of love, and one which was a\nsecret as well.\n\n\"Oh,\" she said, \"I beg your pardon; we--I had not heard of it.\"\n\n\"No, it is not a thing one could announce exactly,\" said Carlton; \"it\nis rather in an embryo state as yet--in fact, I have not met the young\nlady so far, but I mean to meet her.  That's why I am going abroad.\"\n\nMiss Morris looked at him sharply to see if he were smiling, but he\nwas, on the contrary, gazing sentimentally at the horizon-line, and\npuffing meditatively on his pipe.  He was apparently in earnest, and\nwaiting for her to make some comment.\n\n\"How very interesting!\" was all she could think to say.\n\n\"Yes, when you know the details, it is,----VERY interesting,\" he\nanswered.  \"She is the Princess Aline of Hohenwald,\" he explained,\nbowing his head as though he were making the two young ladies known to\none another.  \"She has several other names, six in all, and her age is\ntwenty-two.  That is all I know about her.  I saw her picture in an\nillustrated paper just before I sailed, and I made up my mind I would\nmeet her, and here I am.  If she is not in Grasse, I intend to follow\nher to wherever she may be.\"  He waved his pipe at the ocean before him,\nand recited, with mock seriousness:\n\n    \"'Across the hills and far away,\n               Beyond their utmost purple rim,\n     And deep into the dying day,\n               The happy Princess followed him.'\n\n\n\"Only in this case, you see,\" said Carlton, \"I am following the happy\nPrincess.\"\n\n\"No; but seriously, though,\" said Miss Morris, \"what is it you mean?\nAre you going to paint her portrait?\"\n\n\"I never thought of that,\" exclaimed Carlton.  \"I don't know but what\nyour idea is a good one.  Miss Morris, that's a great idea.\"  He shook\nhis head approvingly.  \"I did not do wrong to confide in you,\" he said.\n\"It was perhaps taking a liberty; but as you have not considered it as\nsuch, I am glad I spoke.\"\n\n\"But you don't really mean to tell me,\" exclaimed the girl, facing\nabout, and nodding her head at him, \"that you are going abroad after a\nwoman whom you have never seen, and because you like a picture of her\nin a paper?\"\n\n\"I do,\" said Carlton.  \"Because I like her picture, and because she is\na Princess.\"\n\n\"Well, upon my word,\" said Miss Morris, gazing at him with evident\nadmiration, \"that's what my younger brother would call a distinctly\nsporting proposition.  Only I don't see,\" she added, \"what her being a\nPrincess has to do with it.\"\n\n\"You don't?\" laughed Carlton, easily.  \"That's the best part of\nit--that's the plot.  The beauty of being in love with a Princess, Miss\nMorris,\" he said, \"lies in the fact that you can't marry her; that you\ncan love her deeply and forever, and nobody will ever come to you and\nask your intentions, or hint that after such a display of affection you\nought to do something.  Now, with a girl who is not a Princess, even if\nshe understands the situation herself, and wouldn't marry you to save\nher life, still there is always some one--a father, or a mother, or one\nof your friends--who makes it his business to interfere, and talks\nabout it, and bothers you both.  But with a Princess, you see, that is\nall eliminated.  You can't marry a Princess, because they won't let\nyou.  A Princess has got to marry a real royal chap, and so you are\nperfectly ineligible and free to sigh for her, and make pretty speeches\nto her, and see her as often as you can, and revel in your devotion and\nunrequited affection.\"\n\nMiss Morris regarded him doubtfully.  She did not wish to prove herself\ntoo credulous.  \"And you honestly want me, Mr. Carlton, to believe that\nyou are going abroad just for this?\"\n\n\"You see,\" Carlton answered her, \"if you only knew me better you would\nhave no doubt on the subject at all.  It isn't the thing some men would\ndo, I admit, but it is exactly what any one who knows me would expect\nof me.  I should describe it, having had acquaintance with the young\nman for some time, as being eminently characteristic.  And besides,\nthink what a good story it makes!  Every other man who goes abroad this\nsummer will try to tell about his travels when he gets back to New\nYork, and, as usual, no one will listen to him.  But they will HAVE to\nlisten to me.  'You've been across since I saw you last.  What did you\ndo?' they'll ask, politely.  And then, instead of simply telling them\nthat I have been in Paris or London, I can say, 'Oh, I've been chasing\naround the globe after the Princess Aline of Hohenwald.'  That sounds\ninteresting, doesn't it?  When you come to think of it,\" Carlton\ncontinued, meditatively, \"it is not so very remarkable.  Men go all the\nway to Cuba and Mexico, and even to India, after orchids, after a nasty\nflower that grows in an absurd way on the top of a tree.  Why shouldn't\na young man go as far as Germany after a beautiful Princess, who walks\non the ground, and who can talk and think and feel?  She is much more\nworth while than an orchid.\"\n\nMiss Morris laughed indulgently.  \"Well, I didn't know such devotion\nexisted at this end of the century,\" she said; \"it's quite nice and\nencouraging.  I hope you will succeed, I am sure.  I only wish we were\ngoing to be near enough to see how you get on. I have never been a\nconfidante when there was a real Princess concerned,\" she said; \"it\nmakes it so much more amusing.  May one ask what your plans are?\"\n\nCarlton doubted if he had any plans as yet.  \"I have to reach the\nground first,\" he said, \"and after that I must reconnoitre.  I may\npossibly adopt your idea, and ask to paint her portrait, only I dislike\nconfusing my social and professional sides.  As a matter of fact,\nthough,\" he said, after a pause, laughing guiltily, \"I have done a\nlittle of that already.  I prepared her, as it were, for my coming.  I\nsent her studies of two pictures I made last winter in Berlin.  One of\nthe Prime Minister, and one of Ludwig, the tragedian at the Court\nTheatre.  I sent them to her through my London agent, so that she would\nthink they had come from some one of her English friends, and I told\nthe dealer not to let any one know who had forwarded them.  My idea was\nthat it might help me, perhaps, if she knew something about me before I\nappeared in person.  It was a sort of letter of introduction written by\nmyself.\"\n\n\"Well, really,\" expostulated Miss Morris, \"you certainly woo in a royal\nway.  Are you in the habit of giving away your pictures to any one\nwhose photograph you happen to like?  That seems to me to be giving new\nlamps for old to a degree.  I must see if I haven't some of my sister's\nphotographs in my trunk.  She is considered very beautiful.\"\n\n\"Well, you wait until you see this particular portrait, and--you will\nunderstand it better,\" said Carlton.\n\nThe steamer reached Southampton early in the afternoon, and Carlton\nsecured a special compartment on the express to London for Mrs. Downs\nand her niece and himself, with one adjoining for their maid and Nolan.\nIt was a beautiful day, and Carlton sat with his eyes fixed upon the\npassing fields and villages, exclaiming with pleasure from time to time\nat the white roads and the feathery trees and hedges, and the red roofs\nof the inns and square towers of the village churches.\n\n\"Hedges are better than barbed-wire fences, aren't they?\" he said.\n\"You see that girl picking wild flowers from one of them?  She looks\njust as though she were posing for a picture for an illustrated paper.\nShe couldn't pick flowers from a barbed-wire fence, could she?  And\nthere would probably be a tramp along the road somewhere to frighten\nher; and see--the chap in knickerbockers farther down the road leaning\non the stile.  I am sure he is waiting for her; and here comes a\ncoach,\" he ran on.  \"Don't the red wheels look well against the hedges?\nIt's a pretty little country, England, isn't it?--like a private park\nor a model village.  I am glad to get back to it--I am glad to see the\nthree-and-six signs with the little slanting dash between the shillings\nand pennies.  Yes, even the steam-rollers and the man with the red flag\nin front are welcome.\"\n\n\"I suppose,\" said Mrs. Downs, \"it's because one has been so long on the\nocean that the ride to London seems so interesting.  It always pays me\nfor the entire trip.  Yes,\" she said, with a sigh, \"in spite of the\npatent-medicine signs they have taken to putting up all along the road.\nIt seems a pity they should adopt our bad habits instead of our good\nones.\"\n\n\"They are a bit slow at adopting anything,\" commented Carlton.  \"Did\nyou know, Mrs. Downs, that electric lights are still as scarce in\nLondon as they are in Timbuctoo?  Why, I saw an electric-light plant\nput up in a Western town in three days once; there were over a hundred\nburners in one saloon, and the engineer who put them up told me in\nconfidence that--\"\n\nWhat the chief engineer told him in confidence was never disclosed, for\nat that moment Miss Morris interrupted him with a sudden sharp\nexclamation.\n\n\"Oh, Mr. Carlton,\" she exclaimed, breathlessly, \"listen to this!\"  She\nhad been reading one of the dozen papers which Carlton had purchased at\nthe station, and was now shaking one of them at him, with her eyes\nfixed on the open page.\n\n\"My dear Edith,\" remonstrated her aunt, \"Mr. Carlton was telling us--\"\n\n\"Yes, I know,\" exclaimed Miss Morris, laughing, \"but this interests him\nmuch more than electric lights.  Who do you think is in London?\" she\ncried, raising her eyes to his, and pausing for proper dramatic effect.\n\"The Princess Aline of Hohenwald!\"\n\n\"No?\" shouted Carlton.\n\n\"Yes,\" Miss Morris answered, mocking his tone.  \"Listen.  'The Queen's\nDrawing-room'--em--e--m--'on her right was the Princess of\nWales'--em--m.  Oh, I can't find it--no--yes, here it is.  'Next to her\nstood the Princess Aline of Hohenwald.  She wore a dress of white silk,\nwith train of silver brocade trimmed with fur.  Ornaments--emeralds and\ndiamonds; orders--Victoria and Albert, jubilee Commemoration Medal,\nCoburg and Gotha, and Hohenwald and Grasse.'\"\n\n\"By Jove!\" cried Carlton, excitedly.  \"I say, is that really there?\nLet me see it, please, for myself.\"\n\nMiss Morris handed him the paper, with her finger on the paragraph, and\npicking up another, began a search down its columns.\n\n\"You are right,\" exclaimed Carlton, solemnly; \"it's she, sure enough.\nAnd here I've been within two hours of her and didn't know it?\"\n\nMiss Morris gave another triumphant cry, as though she had discovered a\nvein of gold.\n\n\"Yes, and here she is again,\" she said, \"in the Gentlewoman: 'The\nQueen's dress was of black, as usual, but relieved by a few violet\nribbons in the bonnet; and Princess Beatrice, who sat by her mother's\nside, showed but little trace of the anxiety caused by Princess Ena's\naccident.  Princess Aline, on the front seat, in a light brown jacket\nand a becoming bonnet, gave the necessary touch to a picture which\nLondoners would be glad to look upon more often.'\"\n\nCarlton sat staring forward, with his hands on his knees, and with his\neyes open wide from excitement.  He presented so unusual an appearance\nof bewilderment and delight that Mrs. Downs looked at him and at her\nniece for some explanation.  \"The young lady seems to interest you,\"\nsaid she, tentatively.\n\n\"She is the most charming creature in the world, Mrs. Downs,\" cried\nCarlton, \"and I was going all the way to Grasse to see her, and now it\nturns out that she is here in England, within a few miles of us.\"  He\nturned and waved his hands at the passing landscape.  \"Every minute\nbrings us nearer together.\"\n\n\"And you didn't feel it in the air!\" mocked Miss Morris, laughing.\n\"You are a pretty poor sort of a man to let a girl tell you where to\nfind the woman you love.\"\n\nCarlton did not answer, but stared at her very seriously and frowned\nintently.  \"Now I have got to begin all over again and readjust\nthings,\" he said.  \"We might have guessed she would be in London, on\naccount of this royal wedding.  It is a great pity it isn't later in\nthe season, when there would be more things going on and more chances\nof meeting her.  Now they will all be interested in themselves, and,\nbeing extremely exclusive, no one who isn't a cousin to the bridegroom\nor an Emperor would have any chance at all.  Still, I can see her!  I\ncan look at her, and that's something.\"\n\n\"It is better than a photograph, anyway,\" said Miss Morris.\n\n\"They will be either at Buckingham Palace or at Windsor, or they will\nstop at Brown's,\" said Carlton.  \"All royalties go to Brown's.  I don't\nknow why, unless it is because it is so expensive; or maybe it is\nexpensive because royalties go there; but, in any event, if they are\nnot at the palace, that is where they will be, and that is where I\nshall have to go too.\"\n\nWhen the train drew up at Victoria Station, Carlton directed Nolan to\ntake his things to Brown's Hotel, but not to unload them until he had\narrived.  Then he drove with the ladies to Cox's, and saw them settled\nthere.  He promised to return at once to dine, and to tell them what he\nhad discovered in his absence. \"You've got to help me in this, Miss\nMorris,\" he said, nervously.  \"I am beginning to feel that I am not\nworthy of her.\"\n\n\"Oh yes, you are!\" she said, laughing; \"but don't forget that 'it's not\nthe lover who comes to woo, but the lover's WAY of wooing,' and that\n'faint heart'--and the rest of it.\"\n\n\"Yes, I know,\" said Carlton, doubtfully; \"but it's a bit sudden, isn't\nit?\"\n\n\"Oh, I am ashamed of you!  You are frightened.\"\n\n\"No, not frightened, exactly,\" said the painter.  \"I think it's just\nnatural emotion.\"\n\nAs Carlton turned into Albemarle Street he noticed a red carpet\nstretching from the doorway of Brown's Hotel out across the sidewalk to\na carriage, and a bareheaded man bustling about apparently assisting\nseveral gentlemen to get into it.  This and another carriage and\nNolan's four-wheeler blocked the way; but without waiting for them to\nmove up, Carlton leaned out of his hansom and called the bareheaded man\nto its side.\n\n\"Is the Duke of Hohenwald stopping at your hotel?\" he asked.  The\nbareheaded man answered that he was.\n\n\"All right, Nolan,\" cried Carlton.  \"They can take in the trunks.\"\n\nHearing this, the bareheaded man hastened to help Carlton to alight.\n\"That was the Duke who just drove off, sir; and those,\" he said,\npointing to three muffled figures who were stepping into a second\ncarriage, \"are his sisters, the Princesses.\"\n\nCarlton stopped midway, with one foot on the step and the other in the\nair.\n\n\"The deuce they are!\" he exclaimed; \"and which is--\" he began, eagerly,\nand then remembering himself, dropped back on the cushions of the\nhansom.\n\nHe broke into the little dining-room at Cox's in so excited a state\nthat two dignified old gentlemen who were eating there sat open-mouthed\nin astonished disapproval.  Mrs. Downs and Miss Morris had just come\ndown stairs.\n\n\"I have seen her!\" Carlton cried, ecstatically; \"only half an hour in\nthe town, and I've seen her already!\"\n\n\"No, really?\" exclaimed Miss Morris.  \"And how did she look?  Is she as\nbeautiful as you expected?\"\n\n\"Well, I can't tell yet,\" Carlton answered.\n\n\"There were three of them, and they were all muffled up, and which one\nof the three she was I don't know.  She wasn't labelled, as in the\npicture, but she was there, and I saw her.  The woman I love was one of\nthat three, and I have engaged rooms at the hotel, and this very night\nthe same roof shelters us both.\"\n\n\n\n\nII\n\n\n\"The course of true love certainly runs smoothly with you,\" said Miss\nMorris, as they seated themselves at the table.  \"What is your next\nmove?  What do you mean to do now?\"\n\n\"The rest is very simple,\" said Carlton.  \"To-morrow morning I will go\nto the Row; I will be sure to find some one there who knows all about\nthem--where they are going, and who they are seeing, and what\nengagements they may have.  Then it will only be a matter of looking up\nsome friend in the Household or in one of the embassies who can present\nme.\"\n\n\"Oh,\" said Miss Morris, in the tone of keenest disappointment, \"but\nthat is such a commonplace ending!  You started out so romantically.\nCouldn't you manage to meet her in a less conventional way?\"\n\n\"I am afraid not,\" said Carlton.  \"You see, I want to meet her very\nmuch, and to meet her very soon, and the quickest way of meeting her,\nwhether it's romantic or not, isn't a bit too quick for me.  There will\nbe romance enough after I am presented, if I have my way.\"\n\nBut Carlton was not to have his way; for he had overlooked the fact\nthat it requires as many to make an introduction as a bargain, and he\nhad left the Duke of Hohenwald out of his considerations.  He met many\npeople he knew in the Row the next morning; they asked him to lunch,\nand brought their horses up to the rail, and he patted the horses'\nheads, and led the conversation around to the royal wedding, and\nthrough it to the Hohenwalds.  He learned that they had attended a\nreception at the German Embassy on the previous night, and it was one\nof the secretaries of that embassy who informed him of their intended\ndeparture that morning on the eleven o'clock train to Paris.\n\n\"To Paris!\" cried Carlton, in consternation.  \"What! all of them?\"\n\n\"Yes, all of them, of course.  Why?\" asked the young German.  But\nCarlton was already dodging across the tan-bark to Piccadilly and\nwaving his stick at a hansom.\n\nNolan met him at the door of Brown's Hotel with an anxious countenance.\n\n\"Their Royal Highnesses have gone, sir,\" he said.  \"But I've packed\nyour trunks and sent them to the station.  Shall I follow them, sir?\"\n\n\"Yes,\" said Carlton.  \"Follow the trunks and follow the Hohenwalds.  I\nwill come over on the Club train at four.  Meet me at the station, and\ntell me to what hotel they have gone.  Wait; if I miss you, you can\nfind me at the Hotel Continental; but if they go straight on through\nParis, you go with them, and telegraph me here and to the Continental.\nTelegraph at every station, so I can keep track of you.  Have you\nenough money?\"\n\n\"I have, sir--enough for a long trip, sir.\"\n\n\"Well, you'll need it,\" said Carlton, grimly.  \"This is going to be a\nlong trip.  It is twenty minutes to eleven now; you will have to hurry.\nHave you paid my bill here?\"\n\n\"I have, sir,\" said Nolan.\n\n\"Then get off, and don't lose sight of those people again.\"\n\nCarlton attended to several matters of business, and then lunched with\nMrs. Downs and her niece.  He had grown to like them very much, and was\nsorry to lose sight of them, but consoled himself by thinking he would\nsee them a few days at least in Paris.  He judged that he would be\nthere for some time, as he did not think the Princess Aline and her\nsisters would pass through that city without stopping to visit the\nshops on the Rue de la Paix.\n\n\"All women are not princesses,\" he argued, \"but all princesses are\nwomen.\"\n\n\"We will be in Paris on Wednesday,\" Mrs. Downs told him.  \"The Orient\nExpress leaves there twice a week, on Mondays and Thursdays, and we\nhave taken an apartment for next Thursday, and will go right on to\nConstantinople.\"\n\n\"But I thought you said you had to buy a lot of clothes there?\" Carlton\nexpostulated.\n\nMrs. Downs said that they would do that on their way home.\n\nNolan met Carlton at the station, and told him that he had followed the\nHohenwalds to the Hotel Meurice.  \"There is the Duke, sir, and the\nthree Princesses,\" Nolan said, \"and there are two German gentlemen\nacting as equerries, and an English captain, a sort of A.D.C. to the\nDuke, and two elderly ladies, and eight servants.  They travel very\nsimple, sir, and their people are in undress livery.  Brown and red,\nsir.\"\n\nCarlton pretended not to listen to this.  He had begun to doubt but\nthat Nolan's zeal would lead him into some indiscretion, and would end\ndisastrously to himself.  He spent the evening alone in front of the\nCafe de la Paix, pleasantly occupied in watching the life and movement\nof that great meeting of the highways.  It did not seem possible that\nhe had ever been away.  It was as though he had picked up a book and\nopened it at the page and place at which he had left off reading it a\nmoment before.  There was the same type, the same plot, and the same\ncharacters, who were doing the same characteristic things.  Even the\nwaiter who tipped out his coffee knew him; and he knew, or felt as\nthough he knew, half of those who passed, or who shared with him the\nhalf of the sidewalk.  The women at the next table considered the slim,\ngood-looking young American with friendly curiosity, and the men with\nthem discussed him in French, until a well-known Parisian recognized\nCarlton in passing, and hailed him joyously in the same language, at\nwhich the women laughed and the men looked sheepishly conscious.\n\nOn the following morning Carlton took up his post in the open court of\nthe Meurice, with his coffee and the Figaro to excuse his loitering\nthere.  He had not been occupied with these over-long before Nolan\napproached him, in some excitement, with the information that their\nRoyal Highnesses--as he delighted to call them--were at that moment\n\"coming down the lift.\"\n\nCarlton could hear their voices, and wished to step around the corner\nand see them; it was for this chance he had been waiting; but he could\nnot afford to act in so undignified a manner before Nolan, so he merely\ncrossed his legs nervously, and told the servant to go back to the\nrooms.\n\n\"Confound him!\" he said; \"I wish he would let me conduct my own affairs\nin my own way.  If I don't stop him, he'll carry the Princess Aline off\nby force and send me word where he has hidden her.\"\n\nThe Hohenwalds had evidently departed for a day's outing, as up to five\no'clock they had not returned; and Carlton, after loitering all the\nafternoon, gave up waiting for them, and went out to dine at Laurent's,\nin the Champs Elysees.  He had finished his dinner, and was leaning\nluxuriously forward, with his elbows on the table, and knocking the\ncigar ashes into his coffee-cup.  He was pleasantly content.  The trees\nhung heavy with leaves over his head, a fountain played and overflowed\nat his elbow, and the lamps of the fiacres passing and repassing on the\nAvenue of the Champs Elysees shone like giant fire-flies through the\nfoliage.  The touch of the gravel beneath his feet emphasized the free,\nout-of-door charm of the place, and the faces of the others around him\nlooked more than usually cheerful in the light of the candles\nflickering under the clouded shades.  His mind had gone back to his\nearlier student days in Paris, when life always looked as it did now in\nthe brief half-hour of satisfaction which followed a cold bath or a\ngood dinner, and he had forgotten himself and his surroundings.  It was\nthe voices of the people at the table behind him that brought him back\nto the present moment.  A man was talking; he spoke in English, with an\naccent.\n\n\"I should like to go again through the Luxembourg,\" he said; \"but you\nneed not be bound by what I do.\"\n\n\"I think it would be pleasanter if we all keep together,\" said a girl's\nvoice, quietly.  She also spoke in English, and with the same accent.\n\nThe people whose voices had interrupted him were sitting and standing\naround a long table, which the waiters had made large enough for their\nparty by placing three of the smaller ones side by side; they had\nfinished their dinner, and the women, who sat with their backs towards\nCarlton, were pulling on their gloves.\n\n\"Which is it to be, then?\" said the gentleman, smiling.  \"The pictures\nor the dressmakers?\"\n\nThe girl who had first spoken turned to the one next to her.\n\n\"Which would you rather do, Aline?\" she asked.\n\nCarlton moved so suddenly that the men behind him looked at him\ncuriously; but he turned, nevertheless, in his chair and faced them,\nand in order to excuse his doing so beckoned to one of the waiters.  He\nwas within two feet of the girl who had been called \"Aline.\"  She\nraised her head to speak, and saw Carlton staring open-eyed at her.\nShe glanced at him for an instant, as if to assure herself that she did\nnot know him, and then, turning to her brother, smiled in the same\ntolerant, amused way in which she had so often smiled upon Carlton from\nthe picture.\n\n\"I am afraid I had rather go to the Bon March,\" she said.\n\nOne of the waiters stepped in between them, and Carlton asked him for\nhis bill; but when it came he left it lying on the plate, and sat\nstaring out into the night between the candles, puffing sharply on his\ncigar, and recalling to his memory his first sight of the Princess\nAline of Hohenwald.\n\nThat night, as he turned into bed, he gave a comfortable sigh of\ncontent.  \"I am glad she chose the dressmakers instead of the\npictures,\" he said.\n\nMrs. Downs and Miss Morris arrived in Paris on Wednesday, and expressed\ntheir anxiety to have Carlton lunch with them, and to hear him tell of\nthe progress of his love-affair.  There was not much to tell; the\nHohenwalds had come and gone from the hotel as freely as any other\ntourists in Paris, but the very lack of ceremony about their movements\nwas in itself a difficulty.  The manner of acquaintance he could make\nin the court of the Hotel Meurice with one of the men over a cup of\ncoffee or a glass of bock would be as readily discontinued as begun,\nand for his purpose it would have been much better if the Hohenwalds\nhad been living in state with a visitors' book and a chamberlain.\n\nOn Wednesday evening Carlton took the ladies to the opera, where the\nHohenwalds occupied a box immediately opposite them.  Carlton pretended\nto be surprised at this fact, but Mrs. Downs doubted his sincerity.\n\n\"I saw Nolan talking to their courier to-day,\" she said, \"and I fancy\nhe asked a few leading questions.\"\n\n\"Well, he didn't learn much if he did,\" he said.  \"The fellow only\ntalks German.\"\n\n\"Ah, then he has been asking questions!\" said Miss Morris.\n\n\"Well, he does it on his own responsibility,\" said Carlton, \"for I told\nhim to have nothing to do with servants.  He has too much zeal, has\nNolan; I'm afraid of him.\"\n\n\"If you were only half as interested as he is,\" said Miss Morris, \"you\nwould have known her long ago.\"\n\n\"Long ago?\" exclaimed Carlton.  \"I only saw her four days since.\"\n\n\"She is certainly very beautiful,\" said Miss Morris, looking across the\nauditorium.\n\n\"But she isn't there,\" said Carlton.\n\n\"That's the eldest sister; the two other sisters went out on the coach\nthis morning to Versailles, and were too tired to come tonight.  At\nleast, so Nolan says.  He seems to have established a friendship for\ntheir English maid, but whether it's on my account or his own I don't\nknow.  I doubt his unselfishness.\"\n\n\"How disappointing of her!\" said Miss Morris.  \"And after you had\nselected a box just across the way, too.  It is such a pity to waste it\non us.\"  Carlton smiled, and looked up at her impudently, as though he\nmeant to say something; but remembering that she was engaged to be\nmarried, changed his mind, and lowered his eyes to his programme.\n\n\"Why didn't you say it?\" asked Miss Morris, calmly, turning her glass\nto the stage.  \"Wasn't it pretty?\"\n\n\"No,\" said Carlton--\"not pretty enough.\"\n\nThe ladies left the hotel the next day to take the Orient Express,\nwhich left Paris at six o'clock.  They had bidden Carlton goodbye at\nfour the same afternoon, and as he had come to their rooms for that\npurpose, they were in consequence a little surprised to see him at the\nstation, running wildly along the platform, followed by Nolan and a\nporter.  He came into their compartment after the train had started,\nand shook his head sadly at them from the door.\n\n\"Well, what do you think of this?\" he said.  \"You can't get rid of me,\nyou see.  I'm going with you.\"\n\n\"Going with us?\" asked Mrs. Downs.  \"How far?\"\n\nCarlton laughed, and, coming inside, dropped onto the cushions with a\nsigh.  \"I don't know,\" he said, dejectedly.  \"All the way, I'm afraid.\nThat is, I mean, I'm very glad I am to have your society for a few days\nmore; but really I didn't bargain for this.\"\n\n\"You don't mean to tell me that THEY are on this train?\" said Miss\nMorris.\n\n\"They are,\" said Carlton.  \"They have a car to themselves at the rear.\nThey only made up their minds to go this morning, and they nearly\nsucceeded in giving me the slip again; but it seems that their English\nmaid stopped Nolan in the hall to bid him good-bye, and so he found out\ntheir plans.  They are going direct to Constantinople, and then to\nAthens.  They had meant to stay in Paris two weeks longer, it seems,\nbut they changed their minds last night.  It was a very close shave for\nme.  I only got back to the hotel in time to hear from the concierge\nthat Nolan had flown with all of my things, and left word for me to\nfollow.  Just fancy!  Suppose I had missed the train, and had had to\nchase him clear across the continent of Europe with not even a razor--\"\n\n\"I am glad,\" said Miss Morris, \"that Nolan has not taken a fancy to ME.\nI doubt if I could resist such impetuosity.\"\n\nThe Orient Express, in which Carlton and the mistress of his heart and\nfancy were speeding towards the horizon's utmost purple rim, was made\nup of six cars, one dining-car with a smoking-apartment attached, and\nfive sleeping-cars, including the one reserved for the Duke of\nHohenwald and his suite.  These cars were lightly built, and rocked in\nconsequence, and the dust raised by the rapid movement of the train\nswept through cracks and open windows, and sprinkled the passengers\nwith a fine and irritating coating of soot and earth.  There was one\nservant to the entire twenty-two passengers.  He spoke eight languages,\nand never slept; but as his services were in demand by several people\nin as many different cars at the same moment he satisfied no one, and\nthe complaint-box in the smoking-car was stuffed full to the slot in\nconsequence before they had crossed the borders of France.\n\nCarlton and Miss Morris went out upon one of the platforms and sat down\nupon a tool-box.  \"It's isn't as comfortable here as in an\nobservation-car at home,\" said Carlton, \"but it's just as noisy.\"\n\nHe pointed out to her from time to time the peasants gathering twigs,\nand the blue-bloused gendarmes guarding the woods and the fences\nskirting them.  \"Nothing is allowed to go to waste in this country,\" he\nsaid.  \"It looks as though they went over it once a month with a\nlawn-mower and a pruning-knife.  I believe they number the trees as we\nnumber the houses.\"\n\n\"And did you notice the great fortifications covered with grass?\" she\nsaid.  \"We have passed such a lot of them.\"\n\nCarlton nodded.\n\n\"And did you notice that they all faced only one way?\"\n\nCarlton laughed, and nodded again.  \"Towards Germany,\" he said.\n\nBy the next day they had left the tall poplars and white roads behind\nthem, and were crossing the land of low shiny black helmets and brass\nspikes.  They had come into a country of low mountains and black\nforests, with old fortified castles topping the hills, and with\nred-roofed villages scattered around the base.\n\n\"How very military it all is!\" Mrs. Downs said.  \"Even the men at the\nlonely little stations in the forests wear uniforms; and do you notice\nhow each of them rolls up his red flag and holds it like a sword, and\nsalutes the train as it passes?\"\n\nThey spent the hour during which the train shifted from one station in\nVienna to the other driving about in an open carriage, and stopped for\na few moments in front of a cafe to drink beer and to feel solid earth\nunder them again, returning to the train with a feeling which was\nalmost that of getting back to their own rooms.  Then they came to\ngreat steppes covered with long thick grass, and flooded in places with\nlittle lakes of broken ice; great horned cattle stood knee-deep in this\ngrass, and at the villages and way-stations were people wearing\nsheepskin jackets and waistcoats covered with silver buttons.  In one\nplace there was a wedding procession waiting for the train to pass,\nwith the friends of the bride and groom in their best clothes, the\nwomen with silver breastplates, and boots to their knees.  It seemed\nhardly possible that only two days before they had seen another wedding\nparty in the Champs Elysees, where the men wore evening dress, and the\nwomen were bareheaded and with long trains.  In forty-eight hours they\nhad passed through republics, principalities, empires, and kingdoms,\nand from spring to winter.  It was like walking rapidly over a painted\npanorama of Europe.\n\nOn the second evening Carlton went off into the smoking-car alone.  The\nDuke of Hohenwald and two of his friends had finished a late supper,\nand were seated in the apartment adjoining it.  The Duke was a young\nman with a heavy beard and eyeglasses.  He was looking over an\nillustrated catalogue of the Salon, and as Carlton dropped on the sofa\nopposite the Duke raised his head and looked at him curiously, and then\nturned over several pages of the catalogue and studied one of them, and\nthen back at Carlton, as though he were comparing him with something on\nthe page before him.  Carlton was looking out at the night, but he\ncould follow what was going forward, as it was reflected in the glass\nof the car window.  He saw the Duke hand the catalogue to one of the\nequerries, who raised his eyebrows and nodded his head in assent.\nCarlton wondered what this might mean, until he remembered that there\nwas a portrait of himself by a French artist in the Salon, and\nconcluded it had been reproduced in the catalogue.  He could think of\nnothing else which would explain the interest the two men showed in\nhim.  On the morning following he sent Nolan out to purchase a\ncatalogue at the first station at which they stopped, and found that\nhis guess was a correct one.  A portrait of himself had been reproduced\nin black and white, with his name below it.\n\n\"Well, they know who I am now,\" he said to Miss Morris, \"even if they\ndon't know me.  That honor is still in store for them.\"\n\n\"I wish they did not lock themselves up so tightly,\" said Miss Morris.\n\"I want to see her very much.  Cannot we walk up and down the platform\nat the next station?  She may be at the window.\"\n\n\"Of course,\" said Carlton.  \"You could have seen her at Buda-Pesth if\nyou had spoken of it.  She was walking up and down then.  The next time\nthe train stops we will prowl up and down and feast our eyes upon her.\"\n\nBut Miss Morris had her wish gratified without that exertion.  The\nHohenwalds were served in the dining-car after the other passengers had\nfinished, and were in consequence only to be seen when they passed by\nthe doors of the other compartments.  But this same morning, after\nluncheon, the three Princesses, instead of returning to their own car,\nseated themselves in the compartment adjoining the dining-car, while\nthe men of their party lit their cigars and sat in a circle around them.\n\n\"I was wondering how long they could stand three men smoking in one of\nthe boxes they call cars,\" said Mrs. Downs.  She was seated between\nMiss Morris and Carlton, directly opposite the Hohenwalds, and so near\nthem that she had to speak in a whisper.  To avoid doing this Miss\nMorris asked Carlton for a pencil, and scribbled with it in the novel\nshe held on her lap.  Then she passed them both back to him, and said,\naloud: \"Have you read this?  It has such a pretty dedication.\"  The\ndedication read, \"Which is Aline?\"  And Carlton, taking the pencil in\nhis turn, made a rapid sketch of her on the fly-leaf, and wrote beneath\nit:  \"This is she.  Do you wonder I travelled four thousand miles to\nsee her?\"\n\nMiss Morris took the book again, and glanced at the sketch, and then at\nthe three Princesses, and nodded her head.  \"It is very beautiful,\" she\nsaid, gravely, looking out at the passing landscape.\n\n\"Well, not beautiful exactly,\" answered Carlton, surveying the hills\ncritically, \"but certainly very attractive.  It is worth travelling a\nlong way to see, and I should think one would grow very fond of it.\"\n\nMiss Morris tore the fly-leaf out of the book, and slipped it between\nthe pages.  \"May I keep it?\" she said.  Carlton nodded.  \"And\nwill you sign it?\" she asked, smiling.  Carlton shrugged his shoulders,\nand laughed.  \"If you wish it,\" he answered.\n\nThe Princess wore a gray cheviot travelling dress, as did her sisters,\nand a gray Alpine hat.  She was leaning back, talking to the English\ncaptain who accompanied them, and laughing.  Carlton thought he had\nnever seen a woman who appealed so strongly to every taste of which he\nwas possessed.  She seemed so sure of herself, so alert, and yet so\ngracious, so easily entertained, and yet, when she turned her eyes\ntowards the strange, dismal landscape, so seriously intent upon its sad\nbeauty.  The English captain dropped his head, and with the pretence of\npulling at his mustache, covered his mouth as he spoke to her.  When he\nhad finished he gazed consciously at the roof of the car, and she kept\nher eyes fixed steadily at the object towards which they had turned\nwhen he had ceased speaking, and then, after a decent pause, turned her\neyes, as Carlton knew she would, towards him.\n\n\"He was telling her who I am,\" he thought, \"and about the picture in\nthe catalogue.\"\n\nIn a few moments she turned to her sister and spoke to her, pointing\nout at something in the scenery, and the same pantomime was repeated,\nand again with the third sister.\n\n\"Did you see those girls talking about you, Mr. Carlton?\" Miss Morris\nasked, after they had left the car.\n\nCarlton said it looked as though they were.\n\n\"Of course they were,\" said Miss Morris.\n\n\"That Englishman told the Princess Aline something about you, and then\nshe told her sister, and she told the eldest one.  It would be nice if\nthey inherit their father's interest in painting, wouldn't it?\"\n\n\"I would rather have it degenerate into an interest in painters\nmyself,\" said Carlton.\n\nMiss Morris discovered, after she had returned to her own car, that she\nhad left the novel where she had been sitting, and Carlton sent Nolan\nback for it.  It had slipped to the floor, and the fly-leaf upon which\nCarlton had sketched the Princess Aline was lying face down beside it.\nNolan picked up the leaf, and saw the picture, and read the inscription\nbelow: \"This is she.  Do you wonder I travelled four thousand miles to\nsee her?\"\n\nHe handed the book to Miss Morris, and was backing out of the\ncompartment, when she stopped him.\n\n\"There was a loose page in this, Nolan,\" she said.  \"It's gone; did you\nsee it?\"\n\n\"A loose page, miss?\" said Nolan, with some concern.  \"Oh, yes, miss; I\nwas going to tell you; there was a scrap of paper blew away when I was\npassing between the carriages.  Was it something you wanted, miss?\"\n\n\"Something I wanted!\" exclaimed Miss Morris, in dismay.\n\nCarlton laughed easily.  \"It is just as well I didn't sign it, after\nall,\" he said.  \"I don't want to proclaim my devotion to any Hungarian\ngypsy who happens to read English.\"\n\n\"You must draw me another, as a souvenir,\" Miss Morris said.\n\nNolan continued on through the length of the car until he had reached\nthe one occupied by the Hohenwalds, where he waited on the platform\nuntil the English maidservant saw him and came to the door of the\ncarriage.\n\n\"What hotel are your people going to stop at in Constantinople?\" Nolan\nasked.\n\n\"The Grande-Bretagne, I think,\" she answered.\n\n\"That's right,\" said Nolan, approvingly.  \"That's the one we are going\nto.  I thought I would come and tell you about it.  And, by-the-way,\"\nhe said, \"here's a picture somebody's made of your Princess Aline.  She\ndropped it, and I picked it up.  You had better give it back to her.\nWell,\" he added, politely, \"I'm glad you are coming to our hotel in\nConstantinople; it's pleasant having some one to talk to who can speak\nyour own tongue.\"\n\nThe girl returned to the car, and left Nolan alone upon the platform.\nHe exhaled a long breath of suppressed excitement, and then gazed\naround nervously upon the empty landscape.\n\n\"I fancy that's going to hurry things up a bit,\" he murmured, with an\nanxious smile; \"he'd never get along at all if it wasn't for me.\"\n\nFor reasons possibly best understood by the German ambassador, the\nstate of the Hohenwalds at Constantinople differed greatly from that\nwhich had obtained at the French capital.  They no longer came and went\nas they wished, or wandered through the show-places of the city like\nordinary tourists.  There was, on the contrary, not only a change in\ntheir manner towards others, but there was an insistence on their part\nof a difference in the attitude of others towards themselves.  This\nshowed itself in the reserving of the half of the hotel for their use,\nand in the haughty bearing of the equerries, who appeared unexpectedly\nin magnificent uniforms.  The visitors' book was covered with the\nautographs of all of the important people in the Turkish capital, and\nthe Sultan's carriages stood constantly before the door of the hotel,\nawaiting their pleasure, until they became as familiar a sight as the\nstreet dogs, or as cabs in a hansom-cab rank.\n\nAnd in following out the programme which had been laid down for her,\nthe Princess Aline became even less accessible to Carlton than before,\nand he grew desperate and despondent.\n\n\"If the worst comes,\" he said to Miss Morris, \"I shall tell Nolan to\ngive an alarm of fire some night, and then I will run in and rescue her\nbefore they find out there is no fire.  Or he might frighten the horses\nsome day, and give me a chance to stop them.  We might even wait until\nwe reach Greece, and have her carried off by brigands, who would only\ngive her up to me.\"\n\n\"There are no more brigands in Greece,\" said Miss Morris; \"and besides,\nwhy do you suppose they would only give her up to you?\"\n\n\"Because they would be imitation brigands,\" said Carlton, \"and would be\npaid to give her up to no one else.\"\n\n\"Oh, you plan very well,\" scoffed Miss Morris, \"but you don't DO\nanything.\"\n\nCarlton was saved the necessity of doing anything that same morning,\nwhen the English captain in attendance on the Duke sent his card to\nCarlton's room.  He came, he explained, to present the Prince's\ncompliments, and would it be convenient for Mr. Carlton to meet the\nDuke that afternoon?  Mr. Carlton suppressed an unseemly desire to\nshout, and said, after a moment's consideration, that it would.  He\nthen took the English captain down stairs to the smoking-room, and\nrewarded him for his agreeable message.\n\nThe Duke received Carlton in the afternoon, and greeted him most\ncordially, and with as much ease of manner as it is possible for a man\nto possess who has never enjoyed the benefits of meeting other men on\nan equal footing.  He expressed his pleasure in knowing an artist with\nwhose work he was so familiar, and congratulated himself on the happy\naccident which had brought them both to the same hotel.\n\n\"I have more than a natural interest in meeting you,\" said the Prince,\n\"and for a reason which you may or may not know.  I thought possibly\nyou could help me somewhat.  I have within the past few days come into\nthe possession of two of your paintings; they are studies, rather, but\nto me they are even more desirable than the finished work; and I am not\ncorrect in saying that they have come to me exactly, but to my sister,\nthe Princess Aline.\"\n\nCarlton could not withhold a certain start of surprise.  He had not\nexpected that his gift would so soon have arrived, but his face showed\nonly polite attention.\n\n\"The studies were delivered to us in London,\" continued the Duke.\n\"They are of Ludwig the tragedian, and of the German Prime Minister,\ntwo most valuable works, and especially interesting to us.  They came\nwithout any note or message which would inform us who had sent them,\nand when my people made inquiries, the dealer refused to tell them from\nwhom they had come.  He had been ordered to forward them to Grasse,\nbut, on learning of our presence in London, sent them direct to our\nhotel there.  Of course it is embarrassing to have so valuable a\npresent from an anonymous friend, especially so for my sister, to whom\nthey were addressed, and I thought that, besides the pleasure of\nmeeting one of whose genius I am so warm an admirer, I might also learn\nsomething which would enable me to discover who our friend may be.\"  He\npaused, but as Carlton said nothing, continued:  \"As it is now, I do\nnot feel that I can accept the pictures; and yet I know no one to whom\nthey can be returned, unless I send them to the dealer.\"\n\n\"It sounds very mysterious,\" said Carlton smiling; \"and I am afraid I\ncannot help you.  What work I did in Germany was sold in Berlin before\nI left, and in a year may have changed hands several times.  The\nstudies of which you speak are unimportant, and merely studies, and\ncould pass from hand to hand without much record having been kept of\nthem; but personally I am not able to give you any information which\nwould assist you in tracing them.\"\n\n\"Yes,\" said the Duke.  \"Well, then, I shall keep them until I can learn\nmore; and if we can learn nothing, I shall return them to the dealer.\"\n\nCarlton met Miss Morris that afternoon in a state of great excitement.\n\"It's come!\" he cried--\"it's come!  I am to meet her this week.  I have\nmet her brother, and he has asked me to dine with them on Thursday\nnight; that's the day before they leave for Athens; and he particularly\nmentioned that his sisters would be at the dinner, and that it would be\na pleasure to present me.  It seems that the eldest paints, and all of\nthem love art for art's sake, as their father taught them to do; and,\nfor all we know, he may make me court painter, and I shall spend the\nrest of my life at Grasse painting portraits of the Princess Aline, at\nthe age of twenty-two, and at all future ages.  And if he does give me\na commission to paint her, I can tell you now in confidence that that\npicture will require more sittings than any other picture ever painted\nby man.  Her hair will have turned white by the time it is finished,\nand the gown she started to pose in will have become forty years behind\nthe fashion!\"\n\nOn the morning following, Carlton and Mrs. Downs and her niece, with\nall the tourists in Constantinople, were placed in open carriages by\ntheir dragomans, and driven in a long procession to the Seraglio to see\nthe Sultan's treasures.  Those of them who had waited two weeks for\nthis chance looked aggrieved at the more fortunate who had come at the\neleventh hour on the last night's steamer, and seemed to think these\nlatter had attained the privilege without sufficient effort.  The\nministers of the different legations--as is the harmless custom of such\ngentlemen--had impressed every one for whom they had obtained\npermission to see the treasures with the great importance of the\nservice rendered, and had succeeded in making every one feel either\nespecially honored or especially uncomfortable at having given them so\nmuch trouble.  This sense of obligation, and the fact that the\ndragomans had assured the tourists that they were for the time being\nthe guests of the Sultan, awed and depressed most of the visitors to\nsuch an extent that their manner in the long procession of carriages\nsuggested a funeral cortege, with the Hohenwalds in front, escorted by\nBeys and Pashas, as chief mourners.  The procession halted at the\npalace, and the guests of the Sultan were received by numerous effendis\nin single-button frock-coats and freshly ironed fezzes, who served them\nwith glasses of water, and a huge bowl of some sweet stuff, of which\nevery one was supposed to take a spoonful.  There was at first a\ngeneral fear among the Cook's tourists that there would not be enough\nof this to go round, which was succeeded by a greater anxiety lest they\nshould be served twice.  Some of the tourists put the sweet stuff in\ntheir mouths direct and licked the spoon, and others dropped it off the\nspoon into the glass of water, and stirred it about and sipped at it,\nand no one knew who had done the right thing, not even those who\nhappened to have done it.  Carlton and Miss Morris went out on to the\nterrace while this ceremony was going forward, and looked out over the\ngreat panorama of waters, with the Sea of Marmora on one side, the\nGolden Horn on the other, and the Bosporus at their feet.  The sun was\nshining mildly, and the waters were stirred by great and little\nvessels; before them on the opposite bank rose the dark green cypresses\nwhich marked the grim cemetery of England's dead, and behind them were\nthe great turtle-backed mosques and pencil-like minarets of the two\ncities, and close at hand the mosaic walls and beautiful gardens of\nConstantine.\n\n\"Your friends the Hohenwalds don't seem to know you this morning,\" she\nsaid.\n\n\"Oh yes; he spoke to me as we left the hotel,\" Carlton answered.  \"But\nthey are on parade at present.  There are a lot of their countrymen\namong the tourists.\"\n\n\"I feel rather sorry for them,\" Miss Morris said, looking at the group\nwith an amused smile.  \"Etiquette cuts them off from so much innocent\namusement.  Now, you are a gentleman, and the Duke presumably is, and\nwhy should you not go over and say, 'Your Highness, I wish you would\npresent me to your sister, whom I am to meet at dinner to-morrow night.\nI admire her very much,' and then you could point out the historical\nfeatures to her, and show her where they have finished off a blue and\ngreen tiled wall with a rusty tin roof, and make pretty speeches to\nher.  It wouldn't hurt her, and it would do you a lot of good.  The\nsimplest way is always the best way, it seems to me.\"\n\n\"Oh yes, of course,\" said Carlton.  \"Suppose he came over here and\nsaid:  'Carlton, I wish you would present me to your young American\nfriend.  I admire her very much,' I would probably say:  'Do you?\nWell, you will have to wait until she expresses some desire to meet\nyou.'  No; etiquette is all right in itself, only some people don't\nknow its laws, and that is the one instance to my mind where ignorance\nof the law is no excuse.\"\n\nCarlton left Miss Morris talking with the Secretary of the American\nLegation, and went to look for Mrs. Downs.  When he returned he found\nthat the young Secretary had apparently asked and obtained permission\nto present the Duke's equerries and some of his diplomatic confreres,\nwho were standing now about her in an attentive semicircle, and\npointing out the different palaces and points of interest.  Carlton was\nsomewhat disturbed at the sight, and reproached himself with not having\npresented any one to her before.  He was sure now that she must have\nhad a dull time of it; but he wished, nevertheless, that if she was to\nmeet other men, the Secretary had allowed him to act as master of\nceremonies.\n\n\"I suppose you know,\" that gentleman was saying as Carlton came up,\n\"that when you pass by Abydos, on the way to Athens, you will see where\nLeander swam the Hellespont to meet Hero.  That little white\nlight-house is called Leander in honor of him.  It makes rather an\ninteresting contrast--does it not?--to think of that chap swimming\nalong in the dark, and then to find that his monument to-day is a\nlighthouse, with revolving lamps and electric appliances, and with\nocean tramps and bridges and men-of-war around it.  We have improved in\nour mechanism since then,\" he said, with an air, \"but I am afraid the\nmen of to-day don't do that sort of thing for the women of to-day.\"\n\n\"Then it is the men who have deteriorated,\" said one of the equerries,\nbowing to Miss Morris; \"it is certainly not the women.\"\n\nThe two Americans looked at Miss Morris to see how she received this,\nbut she smiled good-naturedly.\n\n\"I know a man who did more than that for a woman,\" said Carlton,\ninnocently.  \"He crossed an ocean and several countries to meet her,\nand he hasn't met her yet.\"\n\nMiss Morris looked at him and laughed, in the safety that no one\nunderstood him but herself.\n\n\"But he ran no danger,\" she answered.\n\n\"He didn't, didn't he?\" said Carlton, looking at her closely and\nlaughing.  \"I think he was in very great danger all the time.\"\n\n\"Shocking!\" said Miss Morris, reprovingly; \"and in her very presence,\ntoo.\"  She knitted her brows and frowned at him.  \"I really believe if\nyou were in prison you would make pretty speeches to the jailer's\ndaughter.\"\n\n\"Yes,\" said Carlton, boldly, \"or even to a woman who was a prisoner\nherself.\"\n\n\"I don't know what you mean,\" she said, turning away from him to the\nothers.  \"How far was it that Leander swam?\" she asked.\n\nThe English captain pointed out two spots on either bank, and said that\nthe shores of Abydos were a little over that distance apart.\n\n\"As far as that?\" said Miss Morris.  \"How much he must have cared for\nher!\"  She turned to Carlton for an answer.\n\n\"I beg your pardon,\" he said.  He was measuring the distance between\nthe two points with his eyes.\n\n\"I said how much he must have cared for her!  You wouldn't swim that\nfar for a girl.\"\n\n\"For a girl!\" laughed Carlton, quickly.  \"I was just thinking I would\ndo it for fifty dollars.\"\n\nThe English captain gave a hasty glance at the distance he had pointed\nout, and then turned to Carlton.  \"I'll take you,\" he said, seriously.\n\"I'll bet you twenty pounds you can't do it.\"  There was an easy laugh\nat Carlton's expense, but he only shook his head and smiled.\n\n\"Leave him alone, captain,\" said the American Secretary.  \"It seems to\nme I remember a story of Mr. Carlton's swimming out from Navesink to\nmeet an ocean liner.  It was about three miles, and the ocean was\nrather rough, and when they slowed up he asked them if it was raining\nin London when they left.  They thought he was mad.\"\n\n\"Is that true, Carlton?\" asked the  Englishman.\n\n\"Something like it,\" said the American, \"except that I didn't ask them\nif it was raining in London.  I asked them for a drink, and it was they\nwho were mad.  They thought I was drowning, and slowed up to lower a\nboat, and when they found out I was just swimming around they were\nnaturally angry.\n\n\"Well, I'm glad you didn't bet with me,\" said the captain, with a\nrelieved laugh.\n\nThat evening, as the Englishman was leaving the smoking-room, and after\nhe had bidden Carlton good-night, he turned back and said:  \"I didn't\nlike to ask you before those men this morning, but there was something\nabout your swimming adventure I wanted to know: Did you get that drink?\"\n\n\"I did,\" said Carlton--\"in a bottle.  They nearly broke my shoulder.\"\n\nAs Carlton came into the breakfast-room on the morning of the day he\nwas to meet the Princess Aline at dinner, Miss Morris was there alone,\nand he sat down at the same table, opposite to her.  She looked at him\ncritically, and smiled with evident amusement.\n\n\"'To-day,'\" she quoted, solemnly, \"'the birthday of my life has come.'\"\n\nCarlton poured out his coffee, with a shake of his head, and frowned.\n\"Oh, you can laugh,\" he said, \"but I didn't sleep at all last night.  I\nlay awake making speeches to her.  I know they are going to put me\nbetween the wrong sisters,\" he complained, \"or next to one of those old\nladies-in-waiting, or whatever they are.\"\n\n\"How are you going to begin?\" said Miss Morris.  \"Will you tell her you\nhave followed her from London--or from New York, rather--that you are\nyoung Lochinvar, who came out of the West, and--\"\n\n\"I don't know,\" said Carlton, meditatively, \"just how I shall begin;\nbut I know the curtain is going to rise promptly at eight\no'clock--about the time the soup comes on, I think.  I don't see how\nshe can help but be impressed a little bit.  It isn't every day a man\nhurries around the globe on account of a girl's photograph; and she IS\nbeautiful, isn't she?\"\n\nMiss Morris nodded her head encouragingly.\n\n\"Do you know, sometimes,\" said Carlton, glancing over his shoulders to\nsee if the waiters were out of hearing, \"I fancy she has noticed me.\nOnce or twice I have turned my head in her direction without meaning\nto, and found her looking--well, looking my way, at least.  Don't you\nthink that is a good sign?\" he asked, eagerly.\n\n\"It depends on what you call a 'good sign,'\" said Miss Morris,\njudicially.  \"It is a sign you're good to look at, if that's what you\nwant.  But you probably know that already, and it's nothing to your\ncredit.  It certainly isn't a sign that a person cares for you because\nshe prefers to look at your profile rather than at what the dragomans\nare trying to show her.\"\n\nCarlton drew himself up stiffly.  \"If you knew your ALICE better,\" he\nsaid, with severity, \"you would understand that it is not polite to\nmake personal remarks.  I ask you, as my confidante, if you think she\nhas noticed me, and you make fun of my looks!  That's not the part of a\nconfidante.\"\n\n\"Noticed you!\" laughed Miss Morris, scornfully.  \"How could she help\nit?  You are always in the way.  You are at the door whenever they go\nout or come in, and when we are visiting mosques and palaces you are\ninvariably looking at her instead of the tombs and things, with a\nwistful far-away look, as though you saw a vision.  The first time you\ndid it, after you had turned away I saw her feel to see if her hair was\nall right.  You quite embarrassed her.\"\n\n\"I didn't--I don't!\" stammered Carlton, indignantly.  \"I wouldn't be so\nrude.  Oh, I see I'll have to get another confidante; you are most\nunsympathetic and unkind.\"  But Miss Morris showed her sympathy later in\nthe day, when Carlton needed it sorely; for the dinner towards which he\nhad looked with such pleasurable anticipations and lover-like\nmisgivings did not take place.  The Sultan, so the equerry informed\nhim, had, with Oriental unexpectedness, invited the Duke to dine that\nnight at the Palace, and the Duke, much to his expressed regret, had\nbeen forced to accept what was in the nature of a command.  He sent\nword by his equerry, however, that the dinner to Mr. Carlton was only a\npleasure deferred, and that at Athens, where he understood Carlton was\nalso going, he hoped to have the pleasure of entertaining him and\nmaking him known to his sisters.\n\n\"He is a selfish young egoist,\" said Carlton to Mrs. Downs.  \"As if I\ncared whether he was at the dinner or not!  Why couldn't he have fixed\nit so I might have dined with his sisters alone?  We would never have\nmissed him.  I'll never meet her now.  I know it; I feel it.  Fate is\nagainst me.  Now I will have to follow them on to Athens, and something\nwill turn up there to keep me away from her.  You'll see; you'll see.\nI wonder where they go from Athens?\"\n\nThe Hohenwalds departed the next morning, and as their party had\nengaged all the state-rooms in the little Italian steamer, Carlton was\nforced to wait over for the next.  He was very gloomy over his\ndisappointment, and Miss Morris did her best to amuse him.  She and her\naunt were never idle now, and spent the last few days of their stay in\nConstantinople in the bazars or in excursions up and down the river.\n\n\"These are my last days of freedom,\" Miss Morris said to him once, \"and\nI mean to make the most of them.  After this there will be no more\ntravelling for me.  And I love it so!\" she added, wistfully.\n\nCarlton made no comment, but he felt a certain contemptuous pity for\nthe young man in America who had required such a sacrifice.  \"She is\ntoo nice a girl to let him know she is making a sacrifice,\" he thought,\n\"or giving up anything for him, but SHE won't forget it.\"  And Carlton\nagain commended himself for not having asked any woman to make any\nsacrifices for him.\n\nThey left Constantinople for Athens one moonlight night, three days\nafter the Hohenwalds had taken their departure, and as the evening and\nthe air were warm, they remained upon the upper deck until the boat had\nentered the Dardanelles.  There were few passengers, and Mrs. Downs\nwent below early, leaving Miss Morris and Carlton hanging over the\nrail, and looking down upon a band of Hungarian gypsies, who were\nplaying the weird music of their country on the deck beneath them.  The\nlow receding hills lay close on either hand, and ran back so sharply\nfrom the narrow waterway that they seemed to shut in the boat from the\nworld beyond.  The moonlight showed a little mud fort or a thatched\ncottage on the bank fantastically, as through a mist, and from time to\ntime as they sped forward they saw the camp-fire of a sentry, and his\nshadow as he passed between it and them, or stopped to cover it with\nwood.  The night was so still that they could hear the waves in the\nsteamer's wake washing up over the stones on either shore, and the\nmuffled beat of the engines echoed back from either side of the valley\nthrough which they passed.  There was a great lantern hanging midway\nfrom the mast, and shining down upon the lower deck.  It showed a group\nof Greeks, Turks, and Armenians, in strange costumes, sleeping, huddled\ntogether in picturesque confusion over the bare boards, or wide-awake\nand voluble, smoking and chatting together in happy company.  The music\nof the tizanes rose in notes of passionate ecstasy and sharp,\nunexpected bursts of melody.  It ceased and began again, as though the\nmusicians were feeling their way, and then burst out once more into\nshrill defiance.  It stirred Carlton with a strange turbulent unrest.\nFrom the banks the night wind brought soft odors of fresh earth and of\nheavy foliage.\n\n\"The music of different countries,\" Carlton said at last, \"means many\ndifferent things.  But it seems to me that the music of Hungary is the\nmusic of love.\"\n\nMiss Morris crossed her arms comfortably on the rail, and he heard her\nlaugh softly.  \"Oh no, it is not,\" she said, undisturbed.  \"It is a\npassionate, gusty, heady sort of love, if you like, but it's no more\nlike the real thing than burgundy is like clear, cold, good water.\nIt's not the real thing at all.\"\n\n\"I beg your pardon,\" said Carlton, meekly.  \"Of course I don't know\nanything about it.\"  He had been waked out of the spell which the night\nand the tizanes had placed upon him as completely as though some one had\nshaken him sharply by the shoulder.  \"I bow,\" he said, \"to your superior\nknowledge.  I know nothing about it.\"\n\n\"No; you are quite right.  I don't believe you do know anything about\nit,\" said the girl, \"or you wouldn't have made such a comparison.\"\n\n\"Do you know, Miss Morris,\" said Carlton, seriously, \"that I believe\nI'm not able to care for a woman as other men do--at least as some men\ndo; it's just lacking in me, and always will be lacking.  It's like an\near for music; if you haven't got it, if it isn't born in you, you'll\nnever have it.  It's not a thing you can cultivate, and I feel that\nit's not only a misfortune, but a fault.  Now I honestly believe that I\ncare more for the Princess Aline, whom I have never met, than many\nother men could care for her if they knew her well; but what they feel\nwould last, and I have doubts from past experience that what I feel\nwould.  I don't doubt it while it exists, but it never does exist long,\nand so I am afraid it is going to be with me to the end of the\nchapter.\"  He paused for a moment, but the girl did not answer.  \"I am\nspeaking in earnest now,\" he added, with a rueful laugh.\n\n\"I see you are,\" she replied, briefly.  She seemed to be considering\nhis condition as he had described it to her, and he did not interrupt\nher.  From below them came the notes of the waltz the gypsies played.\nIt was full of the undercurrent of sadness that a waltz should have,\nand filled out what Carlton said as the music from the orchestra in a\ntheatre heightens the effect without interrupting the words of the\nactor on the stage.\n\n\"It is strange,\" said Miss Morris.  \"I should have thought you were a\nman who would care very much and in just the right way.  But I don't\nbelieve really--I'm sorry, but I don't believe you do know what love\nmeans at all.\"\n\n\"Oh, it isn't as bad as that,\" said Carlton.  \"I think I know what it\nis, and what it means to other people, but I can't feel it myself.  The\nbest idea I ever got of it--the thing that made it clear to me--was a\nline in a play.  It seemed to express it better than any of the\nlove-poems I ever read.  It was in Shenandoah.\"\n\nMiss Morris laughed.\n\n\"I beg your pardon,\" said Carlton.\n\n\"I beg yours,\" she said.  \"It was only the incongruity that struck me.\nIt seemed so odd to be quoting Shenandoah here in the Dardanelles, with\nthese queer people below us and ancient Troy on one hand--it took me by\nsurprise, that's all.  Please go on.  What was it impressed you?\"\n\n\"Well, the hero in the play,\" said Carlton, \"is an officer in the\nNorthern army, and he is lying wounded in a house near the Shenandoah\nValley.  The girl he loves lives in this house, and is nursing him; but\nshe doesn't love him,  because she sympathizes with the South.  At\nleast she says she doesn't love him.  Both armies are forming in the\nvalley below to begin the battle, and he sees his own regiment\nhurrying past to join them, So he gets up and staggers out on the\nstage, which is set to show the yard in front of the farm-house, and he\ncalls for his horse to follow his men.  Then the girl runs out and begs\nhim not to go; and he asks why, what does it matter to her whether he\ngoes or not?  And she says, 'But I cannot let you go; you may be\nkilled.'  And he says again, 'What is that to you?'  And she says:  'It\nis everything to me.  I love you.'  And he makes a grab at her with his\nwounded arm, and at that instant both armies open fire in the valley\nbelow, and the whole earth and sky seem to open and shut, and the house\nrocks.  The girl rushes at him and crowds up against his breast, and\ncries:  'What is that?  Oh, what is that?' and he holds her tight to\nhim and laughs, and says:  'THAT?  That's only a battle--you love me.'\"\n\nMiss Morris looked steadfastly over the side of the boat at the waters\nrushing by beneath, smiling to herself.  Then she turned her face\ntowards Carlton, and nodded her head at him.  \"I think,\" she said,\ndryly, \"that you have a fair idea of what it means; a rough\nworking-plan at least--enough to begin on.\"\n\n\"I said that I knew what it meant to others.  I am complaining that I\ncannot feel it myself.\"\n\n\"That will come in time, no doubt,\" she said, encouragingly, with the\nair of a connoisseur; \"and let me tell you,\" she added, \"that it will\nbe all the better for the woman that you have doubted yourself so long.\"\n\n\"You think so?\" said Carlton, eagerly.\n\nMiss Morris laughed at his earnestness, and left him to go below to ask\nher aunt to join them, but Mrs. Downs preferred to read in the saloon,\nand Miss Morris returned alone.  She had taken off her Eton jacket and\npulled on a heavy blue football sweater, and over this a reefer.  The\njersey clung to her and showed the lines of her figure, and emphasized\nthe freedom and grace with which she made every movement.  She looked,\nas she walked at his side with her hands in the pockets of her coat and\nwith a flat sailor hat on her head, like a tall, handsome boy; but when\nthey stopped and stood where the light fell full on her hair and the\nexquisite coloring of her skin, Carlton thought her face had never\nseemed so delicate or fair as it did then, rising from the collar of\nthe rough jersey, and contrasted with the hat and coat of a man's\nattire.  They paced the deck for an hour later, until every one else\nhad left it, and at midnight were still loath to give up the beautiful\nnight and the charm of their strange surroundings.  There were long\nsilent places in their talk, during which Carlton tramped beside her\nwith his head half turned, looking at her and noting with an artist's\neye the free light step, the erect carriage, and the unconscious beauty\nof her face.  The captain of the steamer joined them after midnight,\nand falling into step, pointed out to Miss Morris where great cities\nhad stood, where others lay buried, and where beyond the hills were the\nalmost inaccessible monasteries of the Greek Church.  The moonlight\nturned the banks into shadowy substances, in which the ghosts of former\ndays seemed to make a part; and spurred by the young girl's interest,\nthe Italian, to entertain her, called up all the legends of mythology\nand the stories of Roman explorers and Turkish conquerors.\n\n\"I turn in now,\" he said, after Miss Morris had left them.  \"A most\ncharming young lady.  Is it not so?\" he added, waving his cigarette in\na gesture which expressed the ineffectiveness of the adjective.\n\n\"Yes, very,\" said Carlton.  \"Good-night, sir.\"\n\nHe turned, and leaned with both elbows on the rail, and looked out at\nthe misty banks, puffing at his cigar.  Then he dropped it hissing into\nthe water, and, stifling a yawn, looked up and down the length of the\ndeserted deck.  It seemed particularly bare and empty.\n\n\"What a pity she's engaged!\" Carlton said.  \"She loses so much by it.\"\n\nThey steamed slowly into the harbor of the Piraeus at an early hour the\nnext morning, with a flotilla of small boats filled with shrieking\nporters and hotel-runners at the sides.  These men tossed their\npainters to the crew, and crawled up them like a boarding crew of\npirates, running wildly about the deck, and laying violent hands on any\npiece of baggage they saw unclaimed.  The passengers' trunks had been\nthrown out in a heap on the deck, and Nolan and Carlton were clambering\nover them, looking for their own effects, while Miss Morris stood\nbelow, as far out of the confusion as she could place herself, and\npointed out the different pieces that belonged to her.  As she stood\nthere one of the hotel-runners, a burly, greasy Levantine in pursuit of\na possible victim, shouldered her intentionally and roughly out of the\nway.  He shoved her so sharply that she lost her balance and fell back\nagainst the rail.  Carlton saw what had happened, and made a flying\nleap from the top of the pile of trunks, landing beside her, and in\ntime to seize the escaping offender by the collar.  He jerked him back\noff his feet.\n\n\"How dare you--\" he began.\n\nBut he did not finish.  He felt the tips of Miss Morris's fingers laid\nupon his shoulder, and her voice saying, in an annoyed tone:  \"Don't;\nplease don't.\"  And, to his surprise, his fingers lost their grip on\nthe man's shirt, his arms dropped at his side, and his blood began to\nflow calmly again through his veins.  Carlton was aware that he had a\nvery quick temper.  He was always engaging in street rows, as he called\nthem, with men who he thought had imposed on him or on some one else,\nand though he was always ashamed of himself later, his temper had never\nbeen satisfied without a blow or an apology.  Women had also touched\nhim before, and possibly with a greater familiarity; but these had\nstirred him, not quieted him; and men who had laid detaining hands on\nhim had had them beaten down for their pains.  But this girl had merely\ntouched him gently, and he had been made helpless.  It was most\nperplexing; and while the custom-house officials were passing his\nluggage, he found himself rubbing his arm curiously, as though it were\nnumb, and looking down at it with an amused smile.  He did not comment\non the incident, although he smiled at the recollection of his prompt\nobedience several times during the day.  But as he was stepping into\nthe cab to drive to Athens, he saw the offending ruffian pass, dripping\nwith water, and muttering bitter curses.  When he saw Carlton he\ndisappeared instantly in the crowd.  Carlton stepped over to where\nNolan sat beside the driver on the box.  \"Nolan,\" he said, in a low\nvoice, \"isn't that the fellow who--\"\n\n\"Yes, sir,\" said Nolan, touching his hat gravely.  \"He was pulling a\nvalise one way, and the gentleman that owned it, sir, was pulling it\nthe other, and the gentleman let go sudden, and the Italian went over\nbackwards off the pier.\"\n\nCarlton smiled grimly with secret satisfaction.\n\n\"Nolan,\" he said, \"you're not telling the truth.  You did it yourself.\"\nNolan touched his cap and coughed consciously.  There had been no\ndetaining fingers on Nolan's arm.\n\n\n\n\nIII\n\n\n\"You are coming now, Miss Morris,\" exclaimed Carlton from the front of\nthe carriage in which they were moving along the sunny road to Athens,\n\"into a land where one restores his lost illusions.  Anybody who wishes\nto get back his belief in beautiful things should come here to do it,\njust as he would go to a German sanitarium to build up his nerves or\nhis appetite.  You have only to drink in the atmosphere and you are\ncured.  I know no better antidote than Athens for a siege of cable-cars\nand muddy asphalt pavements and a course of Robert Elsmeres and the\nHeavenly Twins.  Wait until you see the statues of the young athletes\nin the Museum,\" he cried, enthusiastically, \"and get a glimpse of the\nblue sky back of Mount Hymettus, and the moonlight some evening on the\nAcropolis, and you'll be convinced that nothing counts for much in this\nworld but health and straight limbs, and tall marble pillars, and eyes\ntrained to see only what is beautiful.  Give people a love for beauty\nand a respect for health, Miss Morris, and the result is going to be,\nwhat they once had here, the best art and the greatest writers and\nsatirists and poets.  The same audience that applauded Euripides and\nSophocles in the open theatre used to cross the road the same day to\napplaud the athletes who ran naked in the Olympian games, and gave them\nas great honor.  I came here once on a walking tour with a chap who\nwasn't making as much of himself as he should have done, and he went\naway a changed man, and became a personage in the world, and you would\nnever guess what it was that did it.  He saw a statue of one of the\nGreek gods in the Museum which showed certain muscles that he couldn't\nfind in his own body, and he told me he was going to train down until\nthey did show; and he stopped drinking and loafing to do it, and took\nto exercising and working; and by the time the muscles showed out clear\nand strong he was so keen over life that he wanted to make the most of\nit, and, as I said, he has done it.  That's what a respect for his own\nbody did for him.\"\n\nThe carriage stopped at the hotel on one side of the public square of\nAthens, with the palace and its gardens blocking one end, and yellow\nhouses with red roofs, and gay awnings over the cafes, surrounding it.\nIt was a bright sunny day, and the city was clean and cool and pretty.\n\n\"Breakfast?\" exclaimed Miss Morris, in answer to Carlton's inquiry;\n\"yes, I suppose so, but I won't feel safe until I have my feet on that\nrock.\"  She was standing on the steps of the hotel, looking up with\nexpectant, eager eyes at the great Acropolis above the city.\n\n\"It has been there for a long time now,\" suggested Carlton, \"and I\nthink you can risk its being there for a half-hour longer.\"\n\n\"Well,\" she said, reluctantly, \"but I don't wish to lose this chance.\nThere might be an earthquake, for instance.\"\n\n\n\"We are likely to see THEM this morning,\" said Carlton, as he left the\nhotel with the ladies and drove towards the Acropolis.  \"Nolan has been\ninterviewing the English maid, and she tells him they spend the greater\npart of their time up there on the rock.  They are living very simply\nhere, as they did in Paris; that is, for the present.  On Wednesday the\nKing gives a dinner and a reception in their honor.\"\n\n\"When does your dinner come off?\" asked Miss Morris.\n\n\"Never,\" said Carlton, grimly.\n\n\"One of the reasons why I like to come back to Athens so much,\" said\nMrs. Downs, \"is because there are so few other tourists here to spoil\nthe local color for you, and there are almost as few guides as\ntourists, so that you can wander around undisturbed and discover things\nfor yourself.  They don't label every fallen column, and place fences\naround the temples.  They seem to put you on your good behavior.  Then\nI always like to go to a place where you are as much of a curiosity to\nthe people as they are to you.  It seems to excuse your staring about\nyou.\"\n\n\"A curiosity!\" exclaimed Carlton; \"I should say so!  The last time I\nwas here I tried to wear a pair of knickerbockers around the city, and\nthe people stared so that I had to go back to the hotel and change\nthem.  I shouldn't have minded it so much in any other country, but I\nthought men who wore Jaeger underclothing and women's petticoats for a\nnational costume might have excused so slight an eccentricity as\nknickerbockers.  THEY had no right to throw the first stone.\"\n\nThe rock upon which the temples of the Acropolis are built is more of a\nhill than a rock.  It is much steeper upon one side than the other,\nwith a sheer fall a hundred yards broad; on the opposite side there are\nthe rooms of the Hospital of Aesculapius and the theatres of Dionysus\nand Herodes Atticus.  The top of the rock holds the Parthenon and the\nother smaller temples, or what yet remains of them, and its surface is\nlittered with broken marble and stones and pieces of rock.  The top is\nso closely built over that the few tourists who visit it can imagine\nthemselves its sole occupants for a half-hour at a time.  When Carlton\nand his friends arrived, the place appeared quite deserted.  They left\nthe carriage at the base of the rock, and climbed up to the entrance on\nfoot.\n\n\"Now, before I go on to the Parthenon,\" said Miss Morris, \"I want to\nwalk around the sides, and see what is there.  I shall begin with that\ntheatre to the left, and I warn you that I mean to take my time about\nit.  So you people who have been here before can run along by\nyourselves, but I mean to enjoy it leisurely.  I am safe by myself\nhere, am I not?\" she asked.\n\n\"As safe as though you were in the Metropolitan Museum,\" said Carlton,\nas he and Mrs. Downs followed Miss Morris along the side of the hill\ntowards the ruined theatre of Herodes, and stood at its top, looking\ndown into the basin below.  From their feet ran a great semicircle of\nmarble seats, descending tier below tier to a marble pavement, and\nfacing a great ruined wall of pillars and arches which in the past had\nformed the background for the actors.  From the height on which they\nstood above the city they could see the green country stretching out\nfor miles on every side and swimming in the warm sunlight, the dark\ngroves of myrtle on the hills, the silver ribbon of the inland water,\nand the dark blue AEgean Sea.  The bleating of sheep and the tinkling\nof the bells came up to them from the pastures below, and they imagined\nthey could hear the shepherds piping to their flocks from one little\nhill-top to another.\n\n\"The country is not much changed,\" said Carlton.  \"And when you stand\nwhere we are now, you can imagine that you see the procession winding\nits way over the road to the Eleusinian Mysteries, with the gilded\nchariots, and the children carrying garlands, and the priestesses\nleading the bulls for the sacrifice.\"\n\n\"What can we imagine is going on here?\" said Miss Morris, pointing with\nher parasol to the theatre below.\n\n\"Oh, this is much later,\" said Carlton.  \"This was built by the Romans.\nThey used to act and to hold their public meetings here.  This\ncorresponds to the top row of our gallery, and you can imagine that you\nare looking down on the bent backs of hundreds of bald-headed men in\nwhite robes, listening to the speakers strutting about below there.\"\n\n\"I wonder how much they could hear from this height?\" said Mrs. Downs.\n\n\"Well, they had that big wall for a sounding-board, and the air is so\nsoft here that their voices should have carried easily, and I believe\nthey wore masks with mouth-pieces, that conveyed the sound like a\nfireman's trumpet.  If you like, I will run down there and call up to\nyou, and you can hear how it sounded.  I will speak in my natural voice\nfirst, and if that doesn't reach you, wave your parasol, and I will try\nit a little louder.\"\n\n\"Oh, do!\" said Miss Morris.  \"It will be very good of you.  I should\nlike to hear a real speech in the theatre of Herodes,\" she said, as she\nseated herself on the edge of the marble crater.\n\n\"I'll have to speak in English,\" said Carlton, as he disappeared; \"my\nGreek isn't good enough to carry that far.\"\n\nMrs. Downs seated herself beside her niece, and Carlton began\nscrambling down the side of the amphitheatre.  The marble benches were\nbroken in parts, and where they were perfect were covered with a fine\nlayer of moss as smooth and soft as green velvet, so that Carlton, when\nhe was not laboriously feeling for his next foothold with the toe of\nhis boot, was engaged in picking spring flowers from the beds of moss\nand sticking them, for safe-keeping, in his button-hole.  He was\nseveral minutes in making the descent, and so busily occupied in doing\nit that he did not look up until he had reached the level of the\nground, and jumped lightly from the first row of seats to the stage,\ncovered with moss, which lay like a heavy rug over the marble pavement.\nWhen he did look up he saw a tableau that made his heart, which was\nbeating quickly from the exertion of the descent, stand still with\nconsternation.  The Hohenwalds had, in his short absence, descended\nfrom the entrance of the Acropolis, and had stopped on their way to the\nroad below to look into the cool green and white basin of the theatre.\nAt the moment Carlton looked up the Duke was standing in front of Mrs.\nDowns and Miss Morris, and all of the men had their hats off.  Then, in\npantomime, and silhouetted against the blue sky behind them, Carlton\nsaw the Princesses advance beside their brother, and Mrs. Downs and her\nniece courtesied three times, and then the whole party faced about in a\nline and looked down at him.  The meaning of the tableau was only too\nplain.\n\n\"Good heavens!\" gasped Carlton.  \"Everybody's getting introduced to\neverybody else, and I've missed the whole thing!  If they think I'm\ngoing to stay down here and amuse them, and miss all the fun myself,\nthey are greatly mistaken.\"  He made a mad rush for the front first row\nof seats; but there was a cry of remonstrance from above, and, looking\nup, he saw all of the men waving him back.\n\n\"Speech!\" cried the young English Captain, applauding loudly, as though\nwelcoming an actor on his first entrance.  \"Hats off!\" he cried.  \"Down\nin front!  Speech!\"\n\n\"Confound that ass!\" said Carlton, dropping back to the marble pavement\nagain, and gazing impotently up at the row of figures outlined against\nthe sky.  \"I must look like a bear in the bear-pit at the Zoo,\" he\ngrowled.  \"They'll be throwing buns to me next.\"  He could see the two\nelder sisters talking to Mrs. Downs, who was evidently explaining his\npurpose in going down to the stage of the theatre, and he could see the\nPrincess Aline bending forward, with both hands on her parasol, and\nsmiling.  The captain made a trumpet of his hands, and asked why he\ndidn't begin.\n\n\"Hello! how are you?\" Carlton called back, waving his hat at him in\nsome embarrassment.  \"I wonder if I look as much like a fool as I\nfeel?\" he muttered.\n\n\"What did you say?  We can't hear you,\" answered the captain.\n\n\"Louder! louder!\" called the equerries.  Carlton swore at them under\nhis breath, and turned and gazed round the hole in which he was penned\nin order to make them believe that he had given up the idea of making a\nspeech, or had ever intended doing so.  He tried to think of something\nclever to shout back at them, and rejected \"Ye men of Athens\" as being\ntoo flippant, and \"Friends, Countrymen, Romans,\" as requiring too much\neffort.  When he looked up again the Hohenwalds were moving on their\nway, and as he started once more to scale the side of the theatre the\nDuke waved his hand at him in farewell, and gave another hand to his\nsisters, who disappeared with him behind the edge of the upper row of\nseats.  Carlton turned at once and dropped into one of the marble\nchairs and bowed his head.  When he did reach the top Miss Morris held\nout a sympathetic hand to him and shook her head sadly, but he could\nsee that she was pressing her lips tightly together to keep from\nsmiling.\n\n\"Oh, it's all very funny for you,\" he said, refusing her hand.  \"I\ndon't believe you are in love with anybody.  You don't know what it\nmeans.\"\n\nThey revisited the rock on the next day and on the day after, and then\nleft Athens for an inland excursion to stay overnight.  Miss Morris\nreturned from it with the sense of having done her duty once, and by so\ndoing having earned the right  to act as she pleased in the future.\nWhat she best pleased to do was to wander about over the broad top of\nthe Acropolis, with no serious intent of studying its historical\nvalues, but rather, as she explained it, for the simple satisfaction of\nfeeling that she was there.  She liked to stand on the edge of the low\nwall along its top and look out over the picture of sea and plain and\nmountains that lay below her.  The sun shone brightly, and the wind\nswept by them as though they were on the bridge of an ocean steamer,\nand there was the added invigorating sense of pleasure that comes to us\nwhen we stand on a great height.  Carlton was sitting at her feet,\nshielded from the wind by a fallen column, and gazing up at her with\ncritical approval.\n\n\"You look like a sort of a 'Winged Victory' up there,\" he said, \"with\nthe wind blowing your skirts about and your hair coming down.\"\n\n\"I don't remember that the 'Winged Victory' has any hair to blow\nabout,\" suggested Miss Morris.\n\n\"I'd like to paint you,\" continued Carlton, \"just as you are standing\nnow, only I would put you in a Greek dress; and you could stand a Greek\ndress better than almost any one I know.  I would paint you with your\nhead up and one hand shielding your eyes, and the other pressed against\nyour breast.  It would be stunning.\"  He spoke enthusiastically, but in\nquite an impersonal tone, as though he were discussing the posing of a\nmodel.\n\nMiss Morris jumped down from the low wall on which she had been\nstanding, and said, simply, \"Of course I should like to have you paint\nme very much.\"\n\nMrs. Downs looked up with interest to see if Mr. Carlton was serious.\n\n\"When?\" said Carlton, vaguely.  \"Oh, I don't know.  Of course this is\nentirely too nice to last, and you will be going home soon, and then\nwhen I do get back to the States you will--you will have other things\nto do.\"\n\n\"Yes,\" repeated Miss Morris, \"I shall have something else to do besides\ngazing out at the AEgean Sea.\"  She raised her head and looked across\nthe rock for a moment with some interest.  Her eyes, which had grown\nwistful, lighted again with amusement.  \"Here are your friends,\" she\nsaid, smiling.\n\n\"No!\" exclaimed Carlton, scrambling to his feet.\n\n\"Yes,\" said Miss Morris.  \"The Duke has seen us, and is coming over\nhere.\"\n\nWhen Carlton had gained his feet and turned to look, his friends had\nseparated in different directions, and were strolling about alone or in\npairs among the great columns of the Parthenon.  But the Duke came\ndirectly towards them, and seated himself on a low block of marble in\nfront of the two ladies.  After a word or two about the beauties of the\nplace, he asked if they would go to the reception which the King gave\nto him on the day following.  They answered that they should like to\ncome very much, and the Prince expressed his satisfaction, and said\nthat he would see that the chamberlain sent them invitations.  \"And\nyou, Mr. Carlton, you will come also, I hope.  I wish you to be\npresented to my sisters.  They are only amateurs in art, but they are\ngreat admirers of your work, and they have rebuked me for not having\nalready presented you.  We were all disappointed,\" he continued,\ncourteously, \"at not having you to dine with us that night in\nConstantinople, but now I trust I shall see something of you here.  You\nmust tell us what we are to admire.\"\n\n\"That is very easy,\" said Carlton.  \"Everything.\"\n\n\"You are quite right,\" said the Prince, bowing to the ladies as he\nmoved away.  \"It is all very beautiful.\"\n\n\"Well, now you certainly will meet her,\" said Miss Morris.\n\n\"Oh no, I won't,\" said Carlton, with resignation.  \"I have had two\nchances and lost them, and I'll miss this one too.\"\n\n\"Well, there is a chance you shouldn't miss,\" said Miss Morris,\npointing and nodding her head.  \"There she is now, and all alone.\nShe's sketching, isn't she, or taking notes?  What is she doing?\"\n\nCarlton looked eagerly in the direction Miss Morris had signified, and\nsaw the Princess Aline sitting at some distance from them, with a book\non her lap.  She glanced up from this now and again to look at\nsomething ahead of her, and was apparently deeply absorbed in her\noccupation.\n\n\"There is your opportunity,\" said Mrs. Downs; \"and we are going back to\nthe hotel.  Shall we see you at luncheon?\"\n\n\"Yes,\" said Carlton, \"unless I get a position as drawing-master; in\nthat case I shall be here teaching the three amateurs in art.  Do you\nthink I can do it?\" he asked Miss Morris.\n\n\"Decidedly,\" she answered.  \"I have found you a most educational young\nperson.\"\n\nThey went away together, and Carlton moved cautiously towards the spot\nwhere the Princess was sitting.  He made a long and roundabout detour\nas he did so, in order to keep himself behind her.  He did not mean to\ncome so near that she would see him, but he took a certain satisfaction\nin looking at her when she was alone, though her loneliness was only a\nmatter of the moment, and though he knew that her people were within a\nhundred yards of her.  He was in consequence somewhat annoyed and\nsurprised to see another young man dodging in and out among the pillars\nof the Parthenon immediately ahead of him, and to find that this young\nman also had his attention centred on the young girl, who sat\nunconsciously sketching in the foreground.\n\n\"Now what the devil can he want?\" muttered Carlton, his imagination\ntaking alarm at once.  \"If it would only prove to be some one who meant\nharm to her,\" he thought--\"a brigand, or a beggar, who might be\nobligingly insolent, or even a tipsy man, what a chance it would afford\nfor heroic action!\"\n\nWith this hope he moved forward quickly but silently, hoping that the\nstranger might prove even to be an anarchist with a grudge against\nroyalty.  And as he advanced he had the satisfaction of seeing the\nPrincess glance over her shoulder, and, observing the man, rise and\nwalk quickly away towards the edge of the rock.  There she seated\nherself with her face towards the city, and with her back firmly set\nagainst her pursuer.\n\n\"He is annoying her!\" exclaimed Carlton, delightedly, as he hurried\nforward.  \"It looks as though my chance had come at last.\"  But as he\napproached the stranger he saw, to his great disappointment, that he\nhad nothing more serious to deal with than one of the international\narmy of amateur photographers, who had been stalking the Princess as a\nhunter follows an elk, or as he would have stalked a race-horse or a\nprominent politician, or a Lord Mayor's show, everything being fish\nthat came within the focus of his camera.  A helpless statue and an\nequally helpless young girl were both good subjects and at his mercy.\nHe was bending over, with an anxious expression of countenance, and\nfocussing his camera on the back of the Princess Aline, when Carlton\napproached from the rear.  As the young man put his finger on the\nbutton of the camera, Carlton jogged his arm with his elbow, and pushed\nthe enthusiastic tourist to one side.\n\n\"Say,\" exclaimed that individual, \"look where you're going, will you?\nYou spoiled that plate.\"\n\n\"I'll spoil your camera if you annoy that young lady any longer,\" said\nCarlton, in a low voice.\n\nThe photographer was rapidly rewinding his roll, and the fire of\npursuit was still in his eye.\n\n\"She's a Princess,\" he explained, in an excited whisper.\n\n\"Well,\" said Carlton, \"even a Princess is entitled to some\nconsideration.  Besides,\" he said, in a more amicable tone, \"you\nhaven't a permit to photograph on the Acropolis.  You know you\nhaven't.\"  Carlton was quite sure of this, because there were no such\npermits.\n\nThe amateur looked up in some dismay.  \"I didn't know you had to have\nthem,\" he said.  \"Where can I get one?\"\n\n\"The King may give you one,\" said Carlton.  \"He lives at the palace.\nIf they catch you up here without a license, they will confiscate your\ncamera and lock you up.  You had better vanish before they see you.\"\n\n\"Thank you.  I will,\" said the tourist, anxiously.\n\n\"Now,\" thought Carlton, smiling pleasantly, \"when he goes to the palace\nwith that box and asks for a permit, they'll think he is either a\ndynamiter or a crank, and before they are through with him his interest\nin photography will have sustained a severe shock.\"\n\nAs Carlton turned from watching the rapid flight of the photographer,\nhe observed that the Princess had remarked it also, as she had no doubt\nbeen a witness of what had passed, even if she had not overheard all\nthat had been said.  She rose from her enforced position of refuge with\na look of relief, and came directly towards Carlton along the rough\npath that led through the debris on the top of the Acropolis.  Carlton\nhad thought, as he watched her sitting on the wall, with her chin\nresting on her hand, that she would make a beautiful companion picture\nto the one he had wished to paint of Miss Morris--the one girl standing\nupright, looking fearlessly out to sea, on the top of the low wall,\nwith the wind blowing her skirts about her, and her hair tumbled in the\nbreeze, and the other seated, bending intently forward, as though\nwatching for the return of a long-delayed vessel; a beautifully sad\nface, fine and delicate and noble, the face of a girl on the figure of\na woman.  And when she rose he made no effort to move away, or, indeed,\nto pretend not to have seen her, but stood looking at her as though he\nhad the right to do so, and as though she must know he had that right.\nAs she came towards him the Princess Aline did not stop, nor even\nshorten her steps; but as she passed opposite to him she bowed her\nthanks with a sweet impersonal smile and a dropping of the eyes, and\ncontinued steadily on her way.\n\nCarlton stood for some short time looking after her, with his hat still\nat his side.  She seemed farther from him at that moment than she had\never been before, although she had for the first time recognized him.\nBut he knew that it was only as a human being that she had recognized\nhim.  He put on his hat, and sat down on a rock with his elbows on his\nknees, and filled his pipe.\n\n\"If that had been any other girl,\" he thought, \"I would have gone up to\nher and said, 'Was that man annoying you?' and she would have said,\n'Yes; thank you,' or something; and I would have walked along with her\nuntil we had come up to her friends, and she would have told them I had\nbeen of some slight service to her, and they would have introduced us,\nand all would have gone well.  But because she is a Princess she cannot\nbe approached in that way.  At least she does not think so, and I have\nto act as she has been told I should act, and not as I think I should.\nAfter all, she is only a very beautiful girl, and she must be very\ntired of her cousins and grandmothers, and of not being allowed to see\nany one else.  These royalties make a very picturesque show for the\nrest of us, but indeed it seems rather hard on them.  A hundred years\nfrom now there will be no more kings and queens, and the writers of\nthat day will envy us, just as the writers of this day envy the men who\nwrote of chivalry and tournaments, and they will have to choose their\nheroes from bank presidents, and their heroines from lady lawyers and\ngirl politicians and type-writers.  What a stupid world it will be\nthen!\"\n\nThe next day brought the reception to the Hohenwalds; and Carlton,\nentering the reading-room of the hotel on the same afternoon, found\nMiss Morris and her aunt there together taking tea.  They both looked\nat him with expressions of such genuine commiseration that he stopped\njust as he was going to seat himself and eyed them defiantly.\n\n\"Don't tell me,\" he exclaimed, \"that this has fallen through too!\"\n\nMiss Morris nodded her head silently.\n\nCarlton dropped into the chair beside them, and folded his arms with a\nfrown of grim resignation.  \"What is it?\" he asked.  \"Have they\npostponed the reception?\"\n\n\"No,\" Miss Morris said; \"but the Princess Aline will not be there.\"\n\n\"Of course not,\" said Carlton, calmly, \"of course not.  May I ask why?\nI knew that she wouldn't be there, but I may possibly be allowed to\nexpress some curiosity.\"\n\n\"She turned her ankle on one of the loose stones on the Acropolis this\nafternoon,\" said Miss Morris, \"and sprained it so badly that they had\nto carry her--\"\n\n\"Who carried her?\" Carlton demanded, fiercely.\n\n\"Some of her servants.\"\n\n\"Of course, of course!\" cried Carlton.  \"That's the way it always will\nbe.  I was there the whole afternoon, and I didn't see her.  I wasn't\nthere to help her.  It's Fate, that's what it is--Fate!  There's no use\nin my trying to fight against Fate.  Still,\" he added, anxiously, with\na sudden access of hope, \"she may be well by this evening.\"\n\n\"I hardly think she will,\" said Miss Morris, \"but we will trust so.\"\n\nThe King's palace and gardens stretch along one end of the public park,\nand are but just across the street from the hotel where the Hohenwalds\nand the Americans were staying.  As the hotel was the first building on\nthe left of the square, Carlton could see from his windows the\nilluminations, and the guards of honor, and the carriages arriving and\ndeparting, and the citizens of Athens crowding the parks and peering\nthrough the iron rails into the King's garden.  It was a warm night,\nand lighted grandly by a full moon that showed the Acropolis in\nsilhouette against the sky, and gave a strangely theatrical look to the\nyellow house fronts and red roofs of the town.  Every window in the\nbroad front of the palace was illuminated, and through the open doors\ncame the sound of music, and one without could see rows of tall\nservants in the King's blue and white livery, and the men of his guard\nin their white petticoats and black and white jackets and red caps.\nCarlton pulled a light coat over his evening dress, and, with an\nagitation he could hardly explain, walked across the street and entered\nthe palace.  The line of royalties had broken by the time he reached\nthe ballroom, and the not over-severe etiquette of the Greek court left\nhim free, after a bow to those who still waited to receive it, to move\nabout as he pleased.  His most earnest desire was to learn whether or\nnot the Princess Aline was present, and with that end he clutched the\nEnglish adjutant as that gentleman was hurrying past him, and asked\neagerly if the Princess had recovered from her accident.\n\n\"No,\" said the officer; \"she's able to walk about, but not to stand,\nand sit out a dinner, and dance, and all this sort of thing.  Too bad,\nwasn't it?\"\n\n\"Yes,\" said Carlton, \"very bad.\"  He released his hand from the other's\narm, and dropped back among the men grouped about the doorway.  His\ndisappointment was very keen.  Indeed, he had not known how much this\nmeeting with the Princess had meant to him until he experienced this\ndisappointment, which was succeeded by a wish to find Miss Morris, and\nhave her sympathize and laugh with him.  He became conscious, as he\nsearched with growing impatience the faces of those passing and\nrepassing before him, of how much the habit of going to Miss Morris for\nsympathy in his unlucky love-affair had grown of late upon him.  He\nwondered what he would have done in his travels without her, and\nwhether he should have had the interest to carry on his pursuit had she\nnot been there to urge him on, and to mock at him when he grew\nfainthearted.\n\nBut when he finally did discover her he stood quite still, and for an\ninstant doubted if it were she.  The girl he saw seemed to be a more\nbeautiful sister of the Miss Morris he knew--a taller, fairer, and more\nradiant personage; and he feared that it was not she, until he\nremembered that this was the first time he had ever seen her with her\nhair dressed high upon her head, and in the more distinguished\naccessories of a décolleté gown and train.  Miss Morris had her hand on\nthe arm of one of the equerries, who was battling good-naturedly with\nthe crowd, and trying to draw her away from two persistent youths in\ndiplomatic uniform who were laughing and pressing forward in close\npursuit on the other side.  Carlton approached her with a certain\nfeeling of diffidence, which was most unusual to him, and asked if she\nwere dancing.\n\n\"Mr. Carlton shall decide for me,\" Miss Morris said, dropping the\nequerry's arm and standing beside the American.  \"I have promised all\nof these gentlemen,\" she explained, \"to dance with them, and now they\nwon't agree as to which is to dance first.  They've wasted half this\nwaltz already in discussing it, and they make it much more difficult by\nsaying that no matter how I decide, they will fight duels with the one\nI choose, which is most unpleasant for me.\"\n\n\"Most unpleasant for the gentleman you choose, too,\" suggested Carlton.\n\n\"So,\" continued Miss Morris, \"I have decided to leave it to you.\"\n\n\"Well, if I am to arbitrate between the powers,\" said Carlton, with a\nglance at the three uniforms, \"my decision is that as they insist on\nfighting duels in any event, you had better dance with me until they\nhave settled it between them, and then the survivor can have the next\ndance.\"\n\n\"That's a very good idea,\" said Miss Morris; and taking Carlton's arm,\nshe bowed to the three men and drew away.\n\n\"Mr. Carlton,\" said the equerry, with a bow, \"has added another\nargument in favor of maintaining standing armies, and of not submitting\nquestions to arbitration.\"\n\n\"Let's get out of this,\" said Carlton.  \"You don't want to dance, do\nyou?  Let us go where it's cool.\"\n\nHe led her down the stairs, and out on to the terrace.  They did not\nspeak again until they had left it, and were walking under the trees in\nthe Queen's garden.  He had noticed as they made their way through the\ncrowd how the men and women turned to look at her and made way for her,\nand how utterly unconscious she was of their doing so, with that\nunconsciousness which comes from familiarity with such discrimination,\nand Carlton himself held his head a little higher with the pride and\npleasure the thought gave him that he was in such friendly sympathy\nwith so beautiful a creature.  He stopped before a low stone bench that\nstood on the edge of the path, surrounded by a screen of tropical\ntrees, and guarded by a marble statue.  They were in deep shadow\nthemselves, but the moonlight fell on the path at their feet, and\nthrough the trees on the other side of the path they could see the open\nterrace of the palace, with the dancers moving in and out of the\nlighted windows.  The splash of a fountain came from some short\ndistance behind them, and from time to time they heard the strains of a\nregimental band alternating with the softer strains of a waltz played\nby a group of Hungarian musicians.  For a moment neither of them spoke,\nbut sat watching the white dresses of the women and the uniforms of the\nmen moving in and out among the trees, lighted by the lanterns hanging\nfrom the branches, and the white mist of the moon.\n\n\"Do you know,\" said Carlton, \"I'm rather afraid of you to-night!\"  He\npaused, and watched her for a little time as she sat upright, with her\nhands folded on her lap.\n\n\"You are so very resplendent and queenly and altogether different,\" he\nadded.  The girl moved her bare shoulders slightly and leaned back\nagainst the bench.\n\n\"The Princess did not come,\" she said.\n\n\"No,\" Carlton answered, with a sudden twinge of conscience at having\nforgotten that fact.  \"That's one of the reasons I took you away from\nthose men,\" he explained.  \"I wanted you to sympathize with me.\"\n\nMiss Morris did not answer him at once.  She did not seem to be in a\nsympathetic mood.  Her manner suggested rather that she was tired and\ntroubled.\n\n\"I need sympathy myself to-night,\" she said.  \"We received a letter\nafter dinner that brought bad news for us.  We must go home at once.\"\n\n\"Bad news!\" exclaimed Carlton, with much concern.  \"From home?\"\n\n\"Yes, from home,\" she replied; \"but there is nothing wrong there; it is\nonly bad news for us.  My sister has decided to be married in June\ninstead of July, and that cuts us out of a month on the Continent.\nThat's all.  We shall have to leave immediately--tomorrow.  It seems\nthat Mr. Abbey is able to go away sooner than he had hoped, and they\nare to be married on the first.\"\n\n\"Mr. Abbey!\" exclaimed Carlton, catching at the name.  \"But your sister\nisn't going to marry him, is she?\"\n\nMiss Morris turned her head in some surprise.  \"Yes--why not?\" she said.\n\n\"But I say!\" cried Carlton, \"I thought your aunt told me that YOU were\ngoing to marry Abbey; she told me so that day on the steamer when he\ncame to see you off.\"\n\n\"I marry him--my aunt told you--impossible!\" said Miss Morris, smiling.\n\"She probably said that 'her niece' was going to marry him; she meant\nmy sister.  They had been engaged some time.\"\n\n\"Then who are YOU going to marry?\" stammered Carlton.\n\n\"I am not going to marry any one,\" said Miss Morris.\n\nCarlton stared at her blankly in amazement.  \"Well, that's most\nabsurd!\" he exclaimed.\n\nHe recognized instantly that the expression was hardly adequate, but he\ncould not readjust his mind so suddenly to the new idea, and he\nremained looking at her with many confused memories rushing through his\nbrain.  A dozen questions were on his tongue.  He remembered afterwards\nhow he had noticed a servant trimming the candle in one of the\norange-colored lanterns, and that he had watched him as he disappeared\namong the palms.\n\nThe silence lasted for so long a time that it had taken on a\nsignificance in itself which Carlton recognized.  He pulled himself up\nwith a short laugh.  \"Well,\" he remonstrated, mirthlessly, \"I don't\nthink you've treated ME very well.\"\n\n\"How, not treated you very well?\" Miss Morris asked, settling herself\nmore easily.  She had been sitting during the pause which followed\nCarlton's discovery with a certain rigidity, as if she was on a strain\nof attention.  But her tone was now as friendly as always, and held its\ncustomary suggestion of amusement.  Carlton took his tone from it,\nalthough his mind was still busily occupied with incidents and words of\nhers that she had spoken in their past intercourse.\n\n\"Not fair in letting me think you were engaged,\" he said.  \"I've wasted\nso much time: I'm not half civil enough to engaged girls,\" he\nexplained.\n\n\"You've been quite civil enough to us,\" said Miss Morris, \"as a\ncourier, philosopher, and friend.  I'm very sorry we have to part\ncompany.\"\n\n\"Part company!\" exclaimed Carlton, in sudden alarm.  \"But, I say, we\nmustn't do that.\"\n\n\"But we must, you see,\" said Miss Morris. \"We must go back for the\nwedding, and you will have to follow the Princess Aline.\"\n\n\"Yes, of course,\" Carlton heard his own voice say.  \"I had forgotten\nthe Princess Aline.\"  But he was not thinking of what he was saying,\nnor of the Princess Aline.  He was thinking of the many hours Miss\nMorris and he had been together, of the way she had looked at certain\ntimes, and of how he had caught himself watching her at others; how he\nhad pictured the absent Mr. Abbey travelling with her later over the\nsame route, and without a chaperon, sitting close at her side or\nholding her hand, and telling her just how pretty she was whenever he\nwished to do so, and without any fear of the consequences.  He\nremembered how ready she had been to understand what he was going to\nsay before he had finished saying it, and how she had always made him\nshow the best of himself, and had caused him to leave unsaid many\nthings that became common and unworthy when considered in the light of\nher judgment.  He recalled how impatient he had been when she was late\nat dinner, and how cross he was throughout one whole day when she had\nkept her room.  He felt with a sudden shock of delightful fear that he\nhad grown to depend upon her, that she was the best companion he had\never known; and he remembered moments when they had been alone together\nat the table, or in some old palace, or during a long walk, when they\nhad seemed to have the whole world entirely to themselves, and how he\nhad consoled himself at such times with the thought that no matter how\nlong she might be Abbey's wife, there had been these moments in her\nlife which were his, with which Abbey had had nothing to do.\n\nCarlton turned and looked at her with strange wide-open eyes, as though\nhe saw her for the first time.  He felt so sure of himself and of his\nlove for her that the happiness of it made him tremble, and the thought\nthat if he spoke she might answer him in the old, friendly, mocking\ntone of good-fellowship filled him with alarm.  At that moment it\nseemed to Carlton that the most natural thing in the world for them to\ndo would be to go back again together over the road they had come,\nseeing everything in the new light of his love for her, and so travel\non and on for ever over the world, learning to love each other more and\nmore each succeeding day, and leaving the rest of the universe to move\nalong without them.\n\nHe leaned forward with his arm along the back of the bench, and bent\nhis face towards hers.  Her hand lay at her side, and his own closed\nover it, but the shock that the touch of her fingers gave him stopped\nand confused the words upon his tongue.  He looked strangely at her,\nand could not find the speech he needed.\n\nMiss Morris gave his hand a firm, friendly little pressure and drew her\nown away, as if he had taken hers only in an exuberance of good feeling.\n\n\"You have been very nice to us,\" she said, with an effort to make her\ntone sound kindly and approving.  \"And we--\"\n\n\"You mustn't go; I can't let you go,\" said Carlton, hoarsely.  There\nwas no mistaking his tone or his earnestness now.  \"IF you go,\" he went\non, breathlessly, \"I must go with you.\"\n\nThe girl moved restlessly; she leaned forward, and drew in her breath\nwith a slight, nervous tremor.  Then she turned and faced him, almost\nas though she were afraid of him or of herself, and they sat so for an\ninstant in silence.  The air seemed to have grown close and heavy, and\nCarlton saw her dimly.  In the silence he heard the splash of the\nfountain behind them, and the rustling of the leaves in the night wind,\nand the low, sighing murmur of a waltz.\n\nHe raised his head to listen, and she saw in the moonlight that he was\nsmiling.  It was as though he wished to delay any answer she might make\nto his last words.\n\n\"That is the waltz,\" he said, still speaking in a whisper, \"that the\ngypsies played that night--\"  He stopped, and Miss Morris answered him\nby bending her head slowly in assent.  It seemed to be an effort for\nher to even make that slight gesture.\n\n\"YOU don't remember it,\" said Carlton.  \"It meant nothing to you.  I\nmean that night on the steamer when I told you what love meant to other\npeople.  What a fool I was!\" he said, with an uncertain laugh.\n\n\"Yes, I remember it,\" she said--\"last Thursday night, on the steamer.\"\n\n\"Thursday night!\" exclaimed Carlton, indignantly.  \"Wednesday night,\nTuesday night, how should I know what night of the week it was?  It was\nthe night of my life to me.  That night I knew that I loved you as I\nhad never hoped to care for any one in this world.  When I told you\nthat I did not know what love meant I felt all the time that I was\nlying.  I knew that I loved you, and that I could never love any one\nelse,  and that I had never loved any one before; and if I had thought\nthen you could care for me, your engagement or your promises would\nnever have stopped my telling you so.  You said that night that I would\nlearn to love all the better, and more truly, for having doubted myself\nso long, and, oh, Edith,\" he cried, taking both her hands and holding\nthem close in his own, \"I cannot let you go now!  I love you so!  Don't\nlaugh at me; don't mock at me.  All the rest of my life depends on you.\"\n\nAnd then Miss Morris laughed softly, just as he had begged her not to\ndo, but her laughter was so full of happiness, and came so gently and\nsweetly, and spoke so truly of content, that though he let go of her\nhands with one of his, it was only that he might draw her to him, until\nher face touched his, and she felt the strength of his arm as he held\nher against his breast.\n\n\nThe Hohenwalds occupied the suite of rooms on the first floor of the\nhotel, with the privilege of using the broad balcony that reached out\nfrom it over the front entrance.  And at the time when Mrs. Downs and\nEdith Morris and Carlton drove up to the hotel from the ball, the\nPrincess Aline was leaning over the balcony and watching the lights go\nout in the upper part of the house, and the moonlight as it fell on the\ntrees and statues in the public park below.  Her foot was still in\nbandages, and she was wrapped in a long cloak to keep her from the\ncold.  Inside of the open windows that led out on to the balcony her\nsisters were taking off their ornaments, and discussing the incidents\nof the night just over.\n\nThe Princess Aline, unnoticed by those below, saw Carlton help Mrs.\nDowns to alight from the carriage, and then give his hand to another\nmuffled figure that followed her; and while Mrs. Downs was ascending\nthe steps, and before the second muffled figure had left the shadow of\nthe carriage and stepped into the moonlight, the Princess Aline saw\nCarlton draw her suddenly back and kiss her lightly on the cheek, and\nheard a protesting gasp, and saw Miss Morris pull her cloak over her\nhead and run up the steps.  Then she saw Carlton shake hands with them,\nand stand for a moment after they had disappeared, gazing up at the\nmoon and fumbling in the pockets of his coat.  He drew out a cigar-case\nand leisurely selected a cigar, and with much apparent content lighted\nit, and then, with his head, thrown back and his chest expanded, as\nthough he were challenging the world, he strolled across the street and\ndisappeared among the shadows of the deserted park.\n\nThe Princess walked back to one of the open windows, and stood there\nleaning against the side.  \"That young Mr. Carlton, the artist,\" she\nsaid to her sisters, \"is engaged to that beautiful American girl we met\nthe other day.\"\n\n\"Really!\" said the elder sister.  \"I thought it was probable.  Who told\nyou?\"\n\n\"I saw him kiss her good-night,\" said the Princess, stepping into the\nwindow, \"as they got out of their carriage just now.\"\n\nThe Princess Aline stood for a moment looking thoughtfully at the\nfloor, and then walked across the room to a little writing-desk.  She\nunlocked a drawer in this and took from it two slips of paper, which\nshe folded in her hand.  Then she returned slowly across the room, and\nstepped out again on to the balcony.\n\nOne of the pieces of paper held the picture Carlton had drawn of her,\nand under which he had written:  \"This is she.  Do you wonder I\ntravelled four thousand miles to see her?\"  And the other was the\npicture of Carlton himself, which she had cut out of the catalogue of\nthe Salon.\n\nFrom the edge of the balcony where the Princess stood she could see the\nglimmer of Carlton's white linen and the red glow of his cigar as he\nstrode proudly up and down the path of the public park, like a sentry\nkeeping watch.  She folded the pieces of paper together and tore them\nslowly into tiny fragments, and let them fall through her fingers into\nthe street below.  Then she returned again to the room, and stood\nlooking at her sisters.\n\n\"Do you know,\" she said, \"I think I am a little tired of travelling so\nmuch.  I want to go back to Grasse.\"  She put her hand to her, forehead\nand held it there for a moment.  \"I think I am a little homesick,\" said\nthe Princess Aline.\n\n\n\n\nTHE END",
