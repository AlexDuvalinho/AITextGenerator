His popularity waned, and by the time\nhe died he was virtually forgotten.  _Billy Budd_ was\nhis last great novel.  As his writing declined, Melville\nsailed again, around Cape Horn to San Francisco on a clipper\nship commanded by his brother.\n\n\n  File:         Contents:\n\n  moby-001.txt  Preliminary Matter.
