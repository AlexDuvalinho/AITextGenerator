One appeared in the\n_New Quarterly_, one in _Macmillan’s_, and the rest in the _Cornhill\nMagazine_.  To the _Cornhill_ I owe a double debt of thanks; first, that\nI was received there in the very best society, and under the eye of the\nvery best of editors; and second, that the proprietors have allowed me to\nrepublish so considerable an amount of copy.\n\nThese nine worthies have been brought together from many different ages\nand countries.  Not the most erudite of men could be perfectly prepared\nto deal with so many and such various sides of human life and manners.\nTo pass a true judgment upon Knox and Burns implies a grasp upon the very\ndeepest strain of thought in Scotland,—a country far more essentially\ndifferent from England than many parts of America; for, in a sense, the\nfirst of these men re-created Scotland, and the second is its most\nessentially national production.  To treat fitly of Hugo and Villon would\ninvolve yet wider knowledge, not only of a country foreign to the author\nby race, history, and religion, but of the growth and liberties of art.\nOf the two Americans, Whitman and Thoreau, each is the type of something\nnot so much realised as widely sought after among the late generations of\ntheir countrymen; and to see them clearly in a nice relation to the\nsociety that brought them forth, an author would require a large habit of\nlife among modern Americans.  As for Yoshida, I have already disclaimed\nresponsibility; it was but my hand that held the pen.\n\nIn truth, these are but the readings of a literary vagrant.  One book led\nto another, one study to another.  The first was published with\ntrepidation.  Since no bones were broken, the second was launched with\ngreater confidence.  So, by insensible degrees, a young man of our\ngeneration acquires, in his own eyes, a kind of roving judicial\ncommission through the ages; and, having once escaped the perils of the\nFreemans and the Furnivalls, sets himself up to right the wrongs of\nuniversal history and criticism.  Now, it is one thing to write with\nenjoyment on a subject while the story is hot in your mind from recent\nreading, coloured with recent prejudice; and it is quite another business\nto put these writings coldly forth again in a bound volume.  We are most\nof us attached to our opinions; that is one of the “natural affections”\nof which we hear so much in youth; but few of us are altogether free from\nparalysing doubts and scruples.  For my part, I have a small idea of the\ndegree of accuracy possible to man, and I feel sure these studies teem\nwith error.  One and all were written with genuine interest in the\nsubject; many, however, have been conceived and finished with imperfect\nknowledge; and all have lain, from beginning to end, under the\ndisadvantages inherent in this style of writing.\n\nOf these disadvantages a word must here be said.  The writer of short\nstudies, having to condense in a few pages the events of a whole\nlifetime, and the effect on his own mind of many various volumes, is\nbound, above all things, to make that condensation logical and striking.\nFor the only justification of his writing at all is that he shall present\na brief, reasoned, and memorable view.  By the necessity of the case, all\nthe more neutral circumstances are omitted from his narrative; and that\nof itself, by the negative exaggeration of which I have spoken in the\ntext, lends to the matter in hand a certain false and specious glitter.\nBy the necessity of the case, again, he is forced to view his subject\nthroughout in a particular illumination, like a studio artifice.  Like\nHales with Pepys, he must nearly break his sitter’s neck to get the\nproper shadows on the portrait.  It is from one side only that he has\ntime to represent his subject.  The side selected will either be the one\nmost striking to himself, or the one most obscured by controversy; and in\nboth cases that will be the one most liable to strained and sophisticated\nreading.  In a biography, this and that is displayed; the hero is seen at\nhome, playing the flute; the different tendencies of his work come, one\nafter another, into notice; and thus something like a true, general\nimpression of the subject may at last be struck.  But in the short study,\nthe writer, having seized his “point of view,” must keep his eye steadily\nto that.  He seeks, perhaps, rather to differentiate than truly to\ncharacterise.  The proportions of the sitter must be sacrificed to the\nproportions of the portrait; the lights are heightened, the shadows\novercharged; the chosen expression, continually forced, may degenerate at\nlength into a grimace; and we have at best something of a caricature, at\nworst a calumny.  Hence, if they be readable at all, and hang together by\ntheir own ends, the peculiar convincing force of these brief\nrepresentations.  They take so little a while to read, and yet in that\nlittle while the subject is so repeatedly introduced in the same light\nand with the same expression, that, by sheer force of repetition, that\nview is imposed upon the reader.  The two English masters of the style,\nMacaulay and Carlyle, largely exemplify its dangers.  Carlyle, indeed,\nhad so much more depth and knowledge of the heart, his portraits of\nmankind are felt and rendered with so much more poetic comprehension, and\nhe, like his favourite Ram Dass, had a fire in his belly so much more\nhotly burning than the patent reading lamp by which Macaulay studied,\nthat it seems at first sight hardly fair to bracket them together.  But\nthe “point of view” was imposed by Carlyle on the men he judged of in his\nwritings with an austerity not only cruel but almost stupid.  They are\ntoo often broken outright on the Procrustean bed; they are probably\nalways disfigured.  The rhetorical artifice of Macaulay is easily spied;\nit will take longer to appreciate the moral bias of Carlyle.  So with all\nwriters who insist on forcing some significance from all that comes\nbefore them; and the writer of short studies is bound, by the necessity\nof the case, to write entirely in that spirit.  What he cannot vivify he\nshould omit.\n\nHad it been possible to rewrite some of these papers, I hope I should\nhave had the courage to attempt it.  But it is not possible.  Short\nstudies are, or should be, things woven like a carpet, from which it is\nimpossible to detach a strand.  What is perverted has its place there for\never, as a part of the technical means by which what is right has been\npresented.  It is only possible to write another study, and then, with a\nnew “point of view,” would follow new perversions and perhaps a fresh\ncaricature.  Hence, it will be, at least, honest to offer a few grains of\nsalt to be taken with the text; and as some words of apology, addition,\ncorrection, or amplification fall to be said on almost every study in the\nvolume, it will be most simple to run them over in their order.  But this\nmust not be taken as a propitiatory offering to the gods of shipwreck; I\ntrust my cargo unreservedly to the chances of the sea; and do not, by\ncriticising myself, seek to disarm the wrath of other and less partial\ncritics.\n\n_Hugo’s Romances_.—This is an instance of the “point of view.”  The five\nromances studied with a different purpose might have given different\nresults, even with a critic so warmly interested in their favour.  The\ngreat contemporary master of wordmanship, and indeed of all literary arts\nand technicalities, had not unnaturally dazzled a beginner.  But it is\nbest to dwell on merits, for it is these that are most often overlooked.\n\n_Burns_.—I have left the introductory sentences on Principal Shairp,\npartly to explain my own paper, which was merely supplemental to his\namiable but imperfect book, partly because that book appears to me truly\nmisleading both as to the character and the genius of Burns.  This seems\nungracious, but Mr. Shairp has himself to blame; so good a Wordsworthian\nwas out of character upon that stage.\n\nThis half apology apart, nothing more falls to be said except upon a\nremark called forth by my study in the columns of a literary Review.  The\nexact terms in which that sheet disposed of Burns I cannot now recall;\nbut they were to this effect—that Burns was a bad man, the impure vehicle\nof fine verses; and that this was the view to which all criticism tended.\nNow I knew, for my own part, that it was with the profoundest pity, but\nwith a growing esteem, that I studied the man’s desperate efforts to do\nright; and the more I reflected, the stranger it appeared to me that any\nthinking being should feel otherwise.  The complete letters shed, indeed,\na light on the depths to which Burns had sunk in his character of Don\nJuan, but they enhance in the same proportion the hopeless nobility of\nhis marrying Jean.  That I ought to have stated this more noisily I now\nsee; but that any one should fail to see it for himself, is to me a thing\nboth incomprehensible and worthy of open scorn.  If Burns, on the facts\ndealt with in this study, is to be called a bad man, I question very much\nwhether either I or the writer in the Review have ever encountered what\nit would be fair to call a good one.  All have some fault.  The fault of\neach grinds down the hearts of those about him, and—let us not blink the\ntruth—hurries both him and them into the grave.  And when we find a man\npersevering indeed, in his fault, as all of us do, and openly overtaken,\nas not all of us are, by its consequences, to gloss the matter over, with\ntoo polite biographers, is to do the work of the wrecker disfiguring\nbeacons on a perilous seaboard; but to call him bad, with a\nself-righteous chuckle, is to be talking in one’s sleep with Heedless and\nToo-bold in the arbour.\n\nYet it is undeniable that much anger and distress is raised in many\nquarters by the least attempt to state plainly, what every one well\nknows, of Burns’s profligacy, and of the fatal consequences of his\nmarriage.  And for this there are perhaps two subsidiary reasons.  For,\nfirst, there is, in our drunken land, a certain privilege extended to\ndrunkenness.  In Scotland, in particular, it is almost respectable, above\nall when compared with any “irregularity between the sexes.”  The\nselfishness of the one, so much more gross in essence, is so much less\nimmediately conspicuous in its results that our demiurgeous Mrs. Grundy\nsmiles apologetically on its victims.  It is often said—I have heard it\nwith these ears—that drunkenness “may lead to vice.”  Now I did not think\nit at all proved that Burns was what is called a drunkard; and I was\nobliged to dwell very plainly on the irregularity and the too frequent\nvanity and meanness of his relations to women.  Hence, in the eyes of\nmany, my study was a step towards the demonstration of Burns’s radical\nbadness.\n\nBut second, there is a certain class, professors of that low morality so\ngreatly more distressing than the better sort of vice, to whom you must\nnever represent an act that was virtuous in itself, as attended by any\nother consequences than a large family and fortune.  To hint that Burns’s\nmarriage had an evil influence is, with this class, to deny the moral\nlaw.  Yet such is the fact.  It was bravely done; but he had presumed too\nfar on his strength.  One after another the lights of his life went out,\nand he fell from circle to circle to the dishonoured sickbed of the end.\nAnd surely for any one that has a thing to call a soul he shines out\ntenfold more nobly in the failure of that frantic effort to do right,\nthan if he had turned on his heel with Worldly Wiseman, married a\ncongenial spouse, and lived orderly and died reputably an old man.  It is\nhis chief title that he refrained from “the wrong that amendeth wrong.”\nBut the common, trashy mind of our generation is still aghast, like the\nJews of old, at any word of an unsuccessful virtue.  Job has been written\nand read; the tower of Siloam fell nineteen hundred years ago; yet we\nhave still to desire a little Christianity, or, failing that, a little\neven of that rude, old, Norse nobility of soul, which saw virtue and vice\nalike go unrewarded, and was yet not shaken in its faith.\n\n_Walt Whitman_.—This is a case of a second difficulty which lies\ncontinually before the writer of critical studies: that he has to mediate\nbetween the author whom he loves and the public who are certainly\nindifferent and frequently averse.  Many articles had been written on\nthis notable man.  One after another had leaned, in my eyes, either to\npraise or blame unduly.  In the last case, they helped to blindfold our\nfastidious public to an inspiring writer; in the other, by an excess of\nunadulterated praise, they moved the more candid to revolt.  I was here\non the horns of a dilemma; and between these horns I squeezed myself with\nperhaps some loss to the substance of the paper.  Seeing so much in\nWhitman that was merely ridiculous, as well as so much more that was\nunsurpassed in force and fitness,—seeing the true prophet doubled, as I\nthought, in places with the Bull in a China Shop,—it appeared best to\nsteer a middle course, and to laugh with the scorners when I thought they\nhad any excuse, while I made haste to rejoice with the rejoicers over\nwhat is imperishably good, lovely, human, or divine, in his extraordinary\npoems.  That was perhaps the right road; yet I cannot help feeling that\nin this attempt to trim my sails between an author whom I love and honour\nand a public too averse to recognise his merit, I have been led into a\ntone unbecoming from one of my stature to one of Whitman’s.  But the good\nand the great man will go on his way not vexed with my little shafts of\nmerriment.  He, first of any one, will understand how, in the attempt to\nexplain him credibly to Mrs. Grundy, I have been led into certain airs of\nthe man of the world, which are merely ridiculous in me, and were not\nintentionally discourteous to himself.  But there is a worse side to the\nquestion; for in my eagerness to be all things to all men, I am afraid I\nmay have sinned against proportion.  It will be enough to say here that\nWhitman’s faults are few and unimportant when they are set beside his\nsurprising merits.  I had written another paper full of gratitude for the\nhelp that had been given me in my life, full of enthusiasm for the\nintrinsic merit of the poems, and conceived in the noisiest extreme of\nyouthful eloquence.  The present study was a rifacimento.  From it, with\nthe design already mentioned, and in a fit of horror at my old excess,\nthe big words and emphatic passages were ruthlessly excised.  But this\nsort of prudence is frequently its own punishment; along with the\nexaggeration, some of the truth is sacrificed; and the result is cold,\nconstrained, and grudging.  In short, I might almost everywhere have\nspoken more strongly than I did.\n\n_Thoreau_.—Here is an admirable instance of the “point of view” forced\nthroughout, and of too earnest reflection on imperfect facts.  Upon me\nthis pure, narrow, sunnily-ascetic Thoreau had exercised a great charm.\nI have scarce written ten sentences since I was introduced to him, but\nhis influence might be somewhere detected by a close observer.  Still it\nwas as a writer that I had made his acquaintance; I took him on his own\nexplicit terms; and when I learned details of his life, they were, by the\nnature of the case and my own _parti-pris_, read even with a certain\nviolence in terms of his writings.  There could scarce be a perversion\nmore justifiable than that; yet it was still a perversion.  The study\nindeed, raised so much ire in the breast of Dr. Japp (H. A. Page),\nThoreau’s sincere and learned disciple, that had either of us been men, I\nplease myself with thinking, of less temper and justice, the difference\nmight have made us enemies instead of making us friends.  To him who knew\nthe man from the inside, many of my statements sounded like inversions\nmade on purpose; and yet when we came to talk of them together, and he\nhad understood how I was looking at the man through the books, while he\nhad long since learned to read the books through the man, I believe he\nunderstood the spirit in which I had been led astray.\n\nOn two most important points, Dr. Japp added to my knowledge, and with\nthe same blow fairly demolished that part of my criticism.  First, if\nThoreau were content to dwell by Walden Pond, it was not merely with\ndesigns of self-improvement, but to serve mankind in the highest sense.\nHither came the fleeing slave; thence was he despatched along the road to\nfreedom.  That shanty in the woods was a station in the great Underground\nRailroad; that adroit and philosophic solitary was an ardent worker, soul\nand body, in that so much more than honourable movement, which, if\natonement were possible for nations, should have gone far to wipe away\nthe guilt of slavery.  But in history sin always meets with condign\npunishment; the generation passes, the offence remains, and the innocent\nmust suffer.  No underground railroad could atone for slavery, even as no\nbills in Parliament can redeem the ancient wrongs of Ireland.  But here\nat least is a new light shed on the Walden episode.\n\nSecond, it appears, and the point is capital, that Thoreau was once\nfairly and manfully in love, and, with perhaps too much aping of the\nangel, relinquished the woman to his brother.  Even though the brother\nwere like to die of it, we have not yet heard the last opinion of the\nwoman.  But be that as it may, we have here the explanation of the\n“rarefied and freezing air” in which I complained that he had taught\nhimself to breathe.  Reading the man through the books, I took his\nprofessions in good faith.  He made a dupe of me, even as he was seeking\nto make a dupe of himself, wresting philosophy to the needs of his own\nsorrow.  But in the light of this new fact, those pages, seemingly so\ncold, are seen to be alive with feeling.  What appeared to be a lack of\ninterest in the philosopher turns out to have been a touching insincerity\nof the man to his own heart; and that fine-spun airy theory of\nfriendship, so devoid, as I complained, of any quality of flesh and\nblood, a mere anodyne to lull his pains.  The most temperate of living\ncritics once marked a passage of my own with a cross and the words, “This\nseems nonsense.”  It not only seemed; it was so.  It was a private\nbravado of my own, which I had so often repeated to keep up my spirits,\nthat I had grown at last wholly to believe it, and had ended by setting\nit down as a contribution to the theory of life.  So with the more icy\nparts of this philosophy of Thoreau’s.  He was affecting the Spartanism\nhe had not; and the old sentimental wound still bled afresh, while he\ndeceived himself with reasons.\n\nThoreau’s theory, in short, was one thing and himself another: of the\nfirst, the reader will find what I believe to be a pretty faithful\nstatement and a fairly just criticism in the study; of the second he will\nfind but a contorted shadow.  So much of the man as fitted nicely with\nhis doctrines, in the photographer’s phrase, came out.  But that large\npart which lay outside and beyond, for which he had found or sought no\nformula, on which perhaps his philosophy even looked askance, is wanting\nin my study, as it was wanting in the guide I followed.  In some ways a\nless serious writer, in all ways a nobler man, the true Thoreau still\nremains to be depicted.\n\n_Villon_.—I am tempted to regret that I ever wrote on this subject, not\nmerely because the paper strikes me as too picturesque by half, but\nbecause I regarded Villon as a bad fellow.  Others still think well of\nhim, and can find beautiful and human traits where I saw nothing but\nartistic evil; and by the principle of the art, those should have written\nof the man, and not I.  Where you see no good, silence is the best.\nThough this penitence comes too late, it may be well, at least, to give\nit expression.\n\nThe spirit of Villon is still living in the literature of France.  Fat\nPeg is oddly of a piece with the work of Zola, the Goncourts, and the\ninfinitely greater Flaubert; and, while similar in ugliness, still\nsurpasses them in native power.  The old author, breaking with an _éclat\nde voix_, out of his tongue-tied century, has not yet been touched on his\nown ground, and still gives us the most vivid and shocking impression of\nreality.  Even if that were not worth doing at all, it would be worth\ndoing as well as he has done it; for the pleasure we take in the author’s\nskill repays us, or at least reconciles us to the baseness of his\nattitude.  Fat Peg (_La Grosse Margot_) is typical of much; it is a piece\nof experience that has nowhere else been rendered into literature; and a\nkind of gratitude for the author’s plainness mingles, as we read, with\nthe nausea proper to the business.  I shall quote here a verse of an old\nstudents’ song, worth laying side by side with Villon’s startling\nballade.  This singer, also, had an unworthy mistress, but he did not\nchoose to share the wages of dishonour; and it is thus, with both wit and\npathos, that he laments her fall:—\n\n    Nunc plango florem\n       Ætatis teneræ\n    Nitidiorem\n       Veneris sidere:\n    Tunc columbinam\n       Mentis dulcedinem,\n    Nunc serpentinam\n       Amaritudinem.\n    Verbo rogantes\n       Removes ostio,\n    Munera dantes\n       Foves cubiculo,\n             Illos abire præcipis\n             A quibus nihil accipis,\n             Cæcos claudosque recipis,\n             Viros illustres decipis\n                Cum melle venenosa. {0}\n\nBut our illustrious writer of ballades it was unnecessary to deceive; it\nwas the flight of beauty alone, not that of honesty or honour, that he\nlamented in his song; and the nameless mediæval vagabond has the best of\nthe comparison.\n\nThere is now a Villon Society in England; and Mr. John Payne has\ntranslated him entirely into English, a task of unusual difficulty.  I\nregret to find that Mr. Payne and I are not always at one as to the\nauthor’s meaning; in such cases I am bound to suppose that he is in the\nright, although the weakness of the flesh withholds me from anything\nbeyond a formal submission.  He is now upon a larger venture, promising\nus at last that complete Arabian Nights to which we have all so long\nlooked forward.\n\n_Charles of Orleans_.—Perhaps I have done scanty justice to the charm of\nthe old Duke’s verses, and certainly he is too much treated as a fool.\nThe period is not sufficiently remembered.  What that period was, to what\na blank of imbecility the human mind had fallen, can only be known to\nthose who have waded in the chronicles.  Excepting Comines and La Salle\nand Villon, I have read no author who did not appal me by his torpor; and\neven the trial of Joan of Arc, conducted as it was by chosen clerks,\nbears witness to a dreary, sterile folly,—a twilight of the mind peopled\nwith childish phantoms.  In relation to his contemporaries, Charles seems\nquite a lively character.\n\nIt remains for me to acknowledge the kindness of Mr. Henry Pyne, who,\nimmediately on the appearance of the study, sent me his edition of the\nDebate between the Heralds: a courtesy from the expert to the amateur\nonly too uncommon in these days.\n\n_Knox_.—Knox, the second in order of interest among the reformers, lies\ndead and buried in the works of the learned and unreadable M‘Crie.  It\nremains for some one to break the tomb and bring him forth, alive again\nand breathing, in a human book.  With the best intentions in the world, I\nhave only added two more flagstones, ponderous like their predecessors,\nto the mass of obstruction that buries the reformer from the world; I\nhave touched him in my turn with that “mace of death,” which Carlyle has\nattributed to Dryasdust; and my two dull papers are, in the matter of\ndulness, worthy additions to the labours of M‘Crie.  Yet I believe they\nare worth reprinting in the interest of the next biographer of Knox.  I\ntrust his book may be a masterpiece; and I indulge the hope that my two\nstudies may lend him a hint or perhaps spare him a delay in its\ncomposition.\n\nOf the _Pepys_ I can say nothing; for it has been too recently through my\nhands; and I still retain some of the heat of composition.  Yet it may\nserve as a text for the last remark I have to offer.  To Pepys I think I\nhave been amply just; to the others, to Burns, Thoreau, Whitman, Charles\nof Orleans, even Villon, I have found myself in the retrospect ever too\ngrudging of praise, ever too disrespectful in manner.  It is not easy to\nsee why I should have been most liberal to the man of least pretensions.\nPerhaps some cowardice withheld me from the proper warmth of tone;\nperhaps it is easier to be just to those nearer us in rank of mind.  Such\nat least is the fact, which other critics may explain.  For these were\nall men whom, for one reason or another, I loved; or when I did not love\nthe men, my love was the greater to their books.

This is in the nature of things.  Men who\nare in any way typical of a stage of progress may be compared more justly\nto the hand upon the dial of the clock, which continues to advance as it\nindicates, than to the stationary milestone, which is only the measure of\nwhat is past.  The movement is not arrested.  That significant something\nby which the work of such a man differs from that of his predecessors,\ngoes on disengaging itself and becoming more and more articulate and\ncognisable.  The same principle of growth that carried his first book\nbeyond the books of previous writers, carries his last book beyond his\nfirst.  And just as the most imbecile production of any literary age\ngives us sometimes the very clue to comprehension we have sought long and\nvainly in contemporary masterpieces, so it may be the very weakest of an\nauthor’s books that, coming in the sequel of many others, enables us at\nlast to get hold of what underlies the whole of them—of that spinal\nmarrow of significance that unites the work of his life into something\norganic and rational.  This is what has been done by _Quatre Vingt\nTreize_ for the earlier romances of Victor Hugo, and, through them, for a\nwhole division of modern literature.  We have here the legitimate\ncontinuation of a long and living literary tradition; and hence, so far,\nits explanation.  When many lines diverge from each other in direction so\nslightly as to confuse the eye, we know that we have only to produce them\nto make the chaos plain: this is continually so in literary history; and\nwe shall best understand the importance of Victor Hugo’s romances if we\nthink of them as some such prolongation of one of the main lines of\nliterary tendency.\n\n                                * * * * *\n\nWhen we compare the novels of Walter Scott with those of the man of\ngenius who preceded him, and whom he delighted to honour as a master in\nthe art—I mean Henry Fielding—we shall be somewhat puzzled, at the first\nmoment, to state the difference that there is between these two.\nFielding has as much human science; has a far firmer hold upon the tiller\nof his story; has a keen sense of character, which he draws (and Scott\noften does so too) in a rather abstract and academical manner; and\nfinally, is quite as humorous and quite as good-humoured as the great\nScotchman.  With all these points of resemblance between the men, it is\nastonishing that their work should be so different.  The fact is, that\nthe English novel was looking one way and seeking one set of effects in\nthe hands of Fielding; and in the hands of Scott it was looking eagerly\nin all ways and searching for all the effects that by any possibility it\ncould utilise.  The difference between these two men marks a great\nenfranchisement.  With Scott the Romantic movement, the movement of an\nextended curiosity and an enfranchised imagination, has begun.  This is a\ntrite thing to say; but trite things are often very indefinitely\ncomprehended: and this enfranchisement, in as far as it regards the\ntechnical change that came over modern prose romance, has never perhaps\nbeen explained with any clearness.\n\nTo do so, it will be necessary roughly to compare the two sets of\nconventions upon which plays and romances are respectively based.  The\npurposes of these two arts are so much alike, and they deal so much with\nthe same passions and interests, that we are apt to forget the\nfundamental opposition of their methods.  And yet such a fundamental\nopposition exists.  In the drama the action is developed in great measure\nby means of things that remain outside of the art; by means of real\nthings, that is, and not artistic conventions for things.  This is a sort\nof realism that is not to be confounded with that realism in painting of\nwhich we hear so much.  The realism in painting is a thing of purposes;\nthis, that we have to indicate in the drama, is an affair of method.  We\nhave heard a story, indeed, of a painter in France who, when he wanted to\npaint a sea-beach, carried realism from his ends to his means, and\nplastered real sand upon his canvas; and that is precisely what is done\nin the drama.  The dramatic author has to paint his beaches with real\nsand: real live men and women move about the stage; we hear real voices;\nwhat is feigned merely puts a sense upon what is; we do actually see a\nwoman go behind a screen as Lady Teazle, and, after a certain interval,\nwe do actually see her very shamefully produced again.  Now all these\nthings, that remain as they were in life, and are not transmuted into any\nartistic convention, are terribly stubborn and difficult to deal with;\nand hence there are for the dramatist many resultant limitations in time\nand space.  These limitations in some sort approximate towards those of\npainting: the dramatic author is tied down, not indeed to a moment, but\nto the duration of each scene or act; he is confined to the stage, almost\nas the painter is confined within his frame.  But the great restriction\nis this, that a dramatic author must deal with his actors, and with his\nactors alone.  Certain moments of suspense, certain significant\ndispositions of personages, a certain logical growth of emotion, these\nare the only means at the disposal of the playwright.  It is true that,\nwith the assistance of the scene-painter, the costumier and the conductor\nof the orchestra, he may add to this something of pageant, something of\nsound and fury; but these are, for the dramatic writer, beside the mark,\nand do not come under the vivifying touch of his genius.  When we turn to\nromance, we find this no longer.  Here nothing is reproduced to our\nsenses directly.  Not only the main conception of the work, but the\nscenery, the appliances, the mechanism by which this conception is\nbrought home to us, have been put through the crucible of another man’s\nmind, and come out again, one and all, in the form of written words.\nWith the loss of every degree of such realism as we have described, there\nis for art a clear gain of liberty and largeness of competence.  Thus,\npainting, in which the round outlines of things are thrown on to a flat\nboard, is far more free than sculpture, in which their solidity is\npreserved.  It is by giving up these identities that art gains true\nstrength.  And so in the case of novels as compared with the stage.\nContinuous narration is the flat board on to which the novelist throws\neverything.  And from this there results for him a great loss of\nvividness, but a great compensating gain in his power over the subject;\nso that he can now subordinate one thing to another in importance, and\nintroduce all manner of very subtle detail, to a degree that was before\nimpossible.  He can render just as easily the flourish of trumpets before\na victorious emperor and the gossip of country market women, the gradual\ndecay of forty years of a man’s life and the gesture of a passionate\nmoment.  He finds himself equally unable, if he looks at it from one\npoint of view—equally able, if he looks at it from another point of\nview—to reproduce a colour, a sound, an outline, a logical argument, a\nphysical action.  He can show his readers, behind and around the\npersonages that for the moment occupy the foreground of his story, the\ncontinual suggestion of the landscape; the turn of the weather that will\nturn with it men’s lives and fortunes, dimly foreshadowed on the horizon;\nthe fatality of distant events, the stream of national tendency, the\nsalient framework of causation.  And all this thrown upon the flat\nboard—all this entering, naturally and smoothly, into the texture of\ncontinuous intelligent narration.\n\nThis touches the difference between Fielding and Scott.  In the work of\nthe latter, true to his character of a modern and a romantic, we become\nsuddenly conscious of the background.  Fielding, on the other hand,\nalthough he had recognised that the novel was nothing else than an epic\nin prose, wrote in the spirit not of the epic, but of the drama.  This is\nnot, of course, to say that the drama was in any way incapable of a\nregeneration similar in kind to that of which I am now speaking with\nregard to the novel.  The notorious contrary fact is sufficient to guard\nthe reader against such a misconstruction.  All that is meant is, that\nFielding remained ignorant of certain capabilities which the novel\npossesses over the drama; or, at least, neglected and did not develop\nthem.  To the end he continued to see things as a playwright sees them.\nThe world with which he dealt, the world he had realised for himself and\nsought to realise and set before his readers, was a world of exclusively\nhuman interest.  As for landscape, he was content to underline stage\ndirections, as it might be done in a play-book: Tom and Molly retire into\na practicable wood.  As for nationality and public sentiment, it is\ncurious enough to think that Tom Jones is laid in the year forty-five,\nand that the only use he makes of the rebellion is to throw a troop of\nsoldiers into his hero’s way.  It is most really important, however, to\nremark the change which has been introduced into the conception of\ncharacter by the beginning of the romantic movement and the consequent\nintroduction into fiction of a vast amount of new material.  Fielding\ntells us as much as he thought necessary to account for the actions of\nhis creatures; he thought that each of these actions could be decomposed\non the spot into a few simple personal elements, as we decompose a force\nin a question of abstract dynamics.  The larger motives are all unknown\nto him; he had not understood that the nature of the landscape or the\nspirit of the times could be for anything in a story; and so, naturally\nand rightly, he said nothing about them.  But Scott’s instinct, the\ninstinct of the man of an age profoundly different, taught him otherwise;\nand, in his work, the individual characters begin to occupy a\ncomparatively small proportion of that canvas on which armies manœuvre,\nand great hills pile themselves upon each other’s shoulders.  Fielding’s\ncharacters were always great to the full stature of a perfectly arbitrary\nwill.  Already in Scott we begin to have a sense of the subtle influences\nthat moderate and qualify a man’s personality; that personality is no\nlonger thrown out in unnatural isolation, but is resumed into its place\nin the constitution of things.\n\nIt is this change in the manner of regarding men and their actions first\nexhibited in romance, that has since renewed and vivified history.  For\nart precedes philosophy and even science.  People must have noticed\nthings and interested themselves in them before they begin to debate upon\ntheir causes or influence.  And it is in this way that art is the pioneer\nof knowledge; those predilections of the artist he knows not why, those\nirrational acceptations and recognitions, reclaim, out of the world that\nwe have not yet realised, ever another and another corner; and after the\nfacts have been thus vividly brought before us and have had time to\nsettle and arrange themselves in our minds, some day there will be found\nthe man of science to stand up and give the explanation.  Scott took an\ninterest in many things in which Fielding took none; and for this reason,\nand no other, he introduced them into his romances.  If he had been told\nwhat would be the nature of the movement that he was so lightly\ninitiating, he would have been very incredulous and not a little\nscandalised.  At the time when he wrote, the real drift of this new\nmanner of pleasing people in fiction was not yet apparent; and, even now,\nit is only by looking at the romances of Victor Hugo that we are enabled\nto form any proper judgment in the matter.  These books are not only\ndescended by ordinary generation from the Waverley novels, but it is in\nthem chiefly that we shall find the revolutionary tradition of Scott\ncarried farther that we shall find Scott himself, in so far as regards\nhis conception of prose fiction and its purposes, surpassed in his own\nspirit, instead of tamely followed.  We have here, as I said before, a\nline of literary tendency produced, and by this production definitely\nseparated from others.  When we come to Hugo, we see that the deviation,\nwhich seemed slight enough and not very serious between Scott and\nFielding, is indeed such a great gulph in thought and sentiment as only\nsuccessive generations can pass over: and it is but natural that one of\nthe chief advances that Hugo has made upon Scott is an advance in\nself-consciousness.  Both men follow the same road; but where the one\nwent blindly and carelessly, the other advances with all deliberation and\nforethought.  There never was artist much more unconscious than Scott;\nand there have been not many more conscious than Hugo.  The passage at\nthe head of these pages shows how organically he had understood the\nnature of his own changes.  He has, underlying each of the five great\nromances (which alone I purpose here to examine), two deliberate designs:\none artistic, the other consciously ethical and intellectual.  This is a\nman living in a different world from Scott, who professes sturdily (in\none of his introductions) that he does not believe in novels having any\nmoral influence at all; but still Hugo is too much of an artist to let\nhimself be hampered by his dogmas; and the truth is that the artistic\nresult seems, in at least one great instance, to have very little\nconnection with the other, or directly ethical result.\n\nThe artistic result of a romance, what is left upon the memory by any\nreally powerful and artistic novel, is something so complicated and\nrefined that it is difficult to put a name upon it and yet something as\nsimple as nature.  These two propositions may seem mutually destructive,\nbut they are so only in appearance.  The fact is that art is working far\nahead of language as well as of science, realising for us, by all manner\nof suggestions and exaggerations, effects for which as yet we have no\ndirect name; nay, for which we may never perhaps have a direct name, for\nthe reason that these effects do not enter very largely into the\nnecessities of life.  Hence alone is that suspicion of vagueness that\noften hangs about the purpose of a romance: it is clear enough to us in\nthought; but we are not used to consider anything clear until we are able\nto formulate it in words, and analytical language has not been\nsufficiently shaped to that end.  We all know this difficulty in the case\nof a picture, simple and strong as may be the impression that it has left\nwith us; and it is only because language is the medium of romance, that\nwe are prevented from seeing that the two cases are the same.  It is not\nthat there is anything blurred or indefinite in the impression left with\nus, it is just because the impression is so very definite after its own\nkind, that we find it hard to fit it exactly with the expressions of our\nphilosophical speech.\n\nIt is this idea which underlies and issues from a romance, this something\nwhich it is the function of that form of art to create, this epical\nvalue, that I propose chiefly to seek and, as far as may be, to throw\ninto relief, in the present study.  It is thus, I believe, that we shall\nsee most clearly the great stride that Hugo has taken beyond his\npredecessors, and how, no longer content with expressing more or less\nabstract relations of man to man, he has set before himself the task of\nrealising, in the language of romance, much of the involution of our\ncomplicated lives.\n\nThis epical value is not to be found, let it be understood, in every\nso-called novel.  The great majority are not works of art in anything but\na very secondary signification.  One might almost number on one’s fingers\nthe works in which such a supreme artistic intention has been in any way\nsuperior to the other and lesser aims, themselves more or less artistic,\nthat generally go hand in hand with it in the conception of prose\nromance.  The purely critical spirit is, in most novels, paramount.  At\nthe present moment we can recall one man only, for whose works it would\nhave been equally possible to accomplish our present design: and that man\nis Hawthorne.  There is a unity, an unwavering creative purpose, about\nsome at least of Hawthorne’s romances, that impresses itself on the most\nindifferent reader; and the very restrictions and weaknesses of the man\nserved perhaps to strengthen the vivid and single impression of his\nworks.  There is nothing of this kind in Hugo: unity, if he attains to\nit, is indeed unity out of multitude; and it is the wonderful power of\nsubordination and synthesis thus displayed, that gives us the measure of\nhis talent.  No amount of mere discussion and statement, such as this,\ncould give a just conception of the greatness of this power.  It must be\nfelt in the books themselves, and all that can be done in the present\nessay is to recall to the reader the more general features of each of the\nfive great romances, hurriedly and imperfectly, as space will permit, and\nrather as a suggestion than anything more complete.\n\n                                * * * * *\n\nThe moral end that the author had before him in the conception of _Notre\nDame de Paris_ was (he tells us) to “denounce” the external fatality that\nhangs over men in the form of foolish and inflexible superstition.  To\nspeak plainly, this moral purpose seems to have mighty little to do with\nthe artistic conception; moreover it is very questionably handled, while\nthe artistic conception is developed with the most consummate success.\nOld Paris lives for us with newness of life: we have ever before our eyes\nthe city cut into three by the two arms of the river, the boat-shaped\nisland “moored” by five bridges to the different shores, and the two\nunequal towns on either hand.  We forget all that enumeration of palaces\nand churches and convents which occupies so many pages of admirable\ndescription, and the thoughtless reader might be inclined to conclude\nfrom this, that they were pages thrown away; but this is not so: we\nforget, indeed, the details, as we forget or do not see the different\nlayers of paint on a completed picture; but the thing desired has been\naccomplished, and we carry away with us a sense of the “Gothic profile”\nof the city, of the “surprising forest of pinnacles and towers and\nbelfries,” and we know not what of rich and intricate and quaint.  And\nthroughout, Notre Dame has been held up over Paris by a height far\ngreater than that of its twin towers: the Cathedral is present to us from\nthe first page to the last; the title has given us the clue, and already\nin the Palace of Justice the story begins to attach itself to that\ncentral building by character after character.  It is purely an effect of\nmirage; Notre Dame does not, in reality, thus dominate and stand out\nabove the city; and any one who should visit it, in the spirit of the\nScott-tourists to Edinburgh or the Trossachs, would be almost offended at\nfinding nothing more than this old church thrust away into a corner.  It\nis purely an effect of mirage, as we say; but it is an effect that\npermeates and possesses the whole book with astonishing consistency and\nstrength.  And then, Hugo has peopled this Gothic city, and, above all,\nthis Gothic church, with a race of men even more distinctly Gothic than\ntheir surroundings.  We know this generation already: we have seen them\nclustered about the worn capitals of pillars, or craning forth over the\nchurch-leads with the open mouths of gargoyles.  About them all there is\nthat sort of stiff quaint unreality, that conjunction of the grotesque,\nand even of a certain bourgeois snugness, with passionate contortion and\nhorror, that is so characteristic of Gothic art.  Esmeralda is somewhat\nan exception; she and the goat traverse the story like two children who\nhave wandered in a dream.  The finest moment of the book is when these\ntwo share with the two other leading characters, Dom Claude and\nQuasimodo, the chill shelter of the old cathedral.  It is here that we\ntouch most intimately the generative artistic idea of the romance: are\nthey not all four taken out of some quaint moulding, illustrative of the\nBeatitudes, or the Ten Commandments, or the seven deadly sins?  What is\nQuasimodo but an animated gargoyle?  What is the whole book but the\nreanimation of Gothic art?\n\nIt is curious that in this, the earliest of the five great romances,\nthere should be so little of that extravagance that latterly we have come\nalmost to identify with the author’s manner.  Yet even here we are\ndistressed by words, thoughts, and incidents that defy belief and\nalienate the sympathies.  The scene of the _in pace_, for example, in\nspite of its strength, verges dangerously on the province of the penny\nnovelist.  I do not believe that Quasimodo rode upon the bell; I should\nas soon imagine that he swung by the clapper.  And again the following\ntwo sentences, out of an otherwise admirable chapter, surely surpass what\nit has ever entered into the heart of any other man to imagine (vol. ii.\np. 180): “Il souffrait tant que par instants il s’arrachait des poignées\nde cheveux, _pour voir s’ils ne blanchissaient pas_.”  And, p. 181: “Ses\npensées étaient si insupportables qu’il prenait sa tête à deux mains et\ntâchait de l’arracher de ses épaules _pour la briser sur le pavé_.”\n\nOne other fault, before we pass on.  In spite of the horror and misery\nthat pervade all of his later work, there is in it much less of actual\nmelodrama than here, and rarely, I should say never, that sort of\nbrutality, that useless insufferable violence to the feelings, which is\nthe last distinction between melodrama and true tragedy.  Now, in _Notre\nDame_, the whole story of Esmeralda’s passion for the worthless archer is\nunpleasant enough; but when she betrays herself in her last hiding-place,\nherself and her wretched mother, by calling out to this sordid hero who\nhas long since forgotten her—well, that is just one of those things that\nreaders will not forgive; they do not like it, and they are quite right;\nlife is hard enough for poor mortals, without having it indefinitely\nembittered for them by bad art.\n\n                                * * * * *\n\nWe look in vain for any similar blemish in _Les Misérables_.  Here, on\nthe other hand, there is perhaps the nearest approach to literary\nrestraint that Hugo has ever made: there is here certainly the ripest and\nmost easy development of his powers.  It is the moral intention of this\ngreat novel to awaken us a little, if it may be—for such awakenings are\nunpleasant—to the great cost of this society that we enjoy and profit by,\nto the labour and sweat of those who support the litter, civilisation, in\nwhich we ourselves are so smoothly carried forward.  People are all glad\nto shut their eyes; and it gives them a very simple pleasure when they\ncan forget that our laws commit a million individual injustices, to be\nonce roughly just in the general; that the bread that we eat, and the\nquiet of the family, and all that embellishes life and makes it worth\nhaving, have to be purchased by death—by the deaths of animals, and the\ndeaths of men wearied out with labour, and the deaths of those criminals\ncalled tyrants and revolutionaries, and the deaths of those\nrevolutionaries called criminals.  It is to something of all this that\nVictor Hugo wishes to open men’s eyes in _Les Misérables_; and this moral\nlesson is worked out in masterly coincidence with the artistic effect.\nThe deadly weight of civilisation to those who are below presses sensibly\non our shoulders as we read.  A sort of mocking indignation grows upon us\nas we find Society rejecting, again and again, the services of the most\nserviceable; setting Jean Valjean to pick oakum, casting Galileo into\nprison, even crucifying Christ.  There is a haunting and horrible sense\nof insecurity about the book.  The terror we thus feel is a terror for\nthe machinery of law, that we can hear tearing, in the dark, good and bad\nbetween its formidable wheels with the iron stolidity of all machinery,\nhuman or divine.  This terror incarnates itself sometimes and leaps\nhorribly out upon us; as when the crouching mendicant looks up, and Jean\nValjean, in the light of the street lamp, recognises the face of the\ndetective; as when the lantern of the patrol flashes suddenly through the\ndarkness of the sewer; or as when the fugitive comes forth at last at\nevening, by the quiet riverside, and finds the police there also, waiting\nstolidly for vice and stolidly satisfied to take virtue instead.  The\nwhole book is full of oppression, and full of prejudice, which is the\ngreat cause of oppression.  We have the prejudices of M. Gillenormand,\nthe prejudices of Marius, the prejudices in revolt that defend the\nbarricade, and the throned prejudices that carry it by storm.  And then\nwe have the admirable but ill-written character of Javert, the man who\nhad made a religion of the police, and would not survive the moment when\nhe learned that there was another truth outside the truth of laws; a just\ncreation, over which the reader will do well to ponder.\n\nWith so gloomy a design this great work is still full of life and light\nand love.  The portrait of the good Bishop is one of the most agreeable\nthings in modern literature.  The whole scene at Montfermeil is full of\nthe charm that Hugo knows so well how to throw about children.  Who can\nforget the passage where Cosette, sent out at night to draw water, stands\nin admiration before the illuminated booth, and the huckster behind “lui\nfaisait un peu l’effet d’être le Père éternel?”  The pathos of the\nforlorn sabot laid trustingly by the chimney in expectation of the Santa\nClaus that was not, takes us fairly by the throat; there is nothing in\nShakespeare that touches the heart more nearly.  The loves of Cosette and\nMarius are very pure and pleasant, and we cannot refuse our affection to\nGavroche, although we may make a mental reservation of our profound\ndisbelief in his existence.  Take it for all in all, there are few books\nin the world that can be compared with it.  There is as much calm and\nserenity as Hugo has ever attained to; the melodramatic coarsenesses that\ndisfigured _Notre Dame_ are no longer present.  There is certainly much\nthat is painfully improbable; and again, the story itself is a little too\nwell constructed; it produces on us the effect of a puzzle, and we grow\nincredulous as we find that every character fits again and again into the\nplot, and is, like the child’s cube, serviceable on six faces; things are\nnot so well arranged in life as all that comes to.  Some of the\ndigressions, also, seem out of place, and do nothing but interrupt and\nirritate.  But when all is said, the book remains of masterly conception\nand of masterly development, full of pathos, full of truth, full of a\nhigh eloquence.\n\n                                * * * * *\n\nSuperstition and social exigency having been thus dealt with in the first\ntwo members of the series, it remained for _Les Travailleurs de la Mer_\nto show man hand to hand with the elements, the last form of external\nforce that is brought against him.  And here once more the artistic\neffect and the moral lesson are worked out together, and are, indeed,\none.  Gilliat, alone upon the reef at his herculean task, offers a type\nof human industry in the midst of the vague “diffusion of forces into the\nillimitable,” and the visionary development of “wasted labour” in the\nsea, and the winds, and the clouds.  No character was ever thrown into\nsuch strange relief as Gilliat.  The great circle of sea-birds that come\nwanderingly around him on the night of his arrival, strikes at once the\nnote of his pre-eminence and isolation.  He fills the whole reef with his\nindefatigable toil; this solitary spot in the ocean rings with the\nclamour of his anvil; we see him as he comes and goes, thrown out sharply\nagainst the clear background of the sea.  And yet his isolation is not to\nbe compared with the isolation of Robinson Crusoe, for example; indeed,\nno two books could be more instructive to set side by side than _Les\nTravailleurs_ and this other of the old days before art had learnt to\noccupy itself with what lies outside of human will.  Crusoe was one sole\ncentre of interest in the midst of a nature utterly dead and utterly\nunrealised by the artist; but this is not how we feel with Gilliat; we\nfeel that he is opposed by a “dark coalition of forces,” that an “immense\nanimosity” surrounds him; we are the witnesses of the terrible warfare\nthat he wages with “the silent inclemency of phenomena going their own\nway, and the great general law, implacable and passive:” “a conspiracy of\nthe indifferency of things” is against him.  There is not one interest on\nthe reef, but two.  Just as we recognise Gilliat for the hero, we\nrecognise, as implied by this indifferency of things, this direction of\nforces to some purpose outside our purposes, yet another character who\nmay almost take rank as the villain of the novel, and the two face up to\none another blow for blow, feint for feint, until, in the storm, they\nfight it epically out, and Gilliat remains the victor;—a victor, however,\nwho has still to encounter the octopus.  I need say nothing of the\ngruesome, repulsive excellence of that famous scene; it will be enough to\nremind the reader that Gilliat is in pursuit of a crab when he is himself\nassaulted by the devil fish, and that this, in its way, is the last touch\nto the inner significance of the book; here, indeed, is the true position\nof man in the universe.\n\nBut in _Les Travailleurs_, with all its strength, with all its eloquence,\nwith all the beauty and fitness of its main situations, we cannot conceal\nfrom ourselves that there is a thread of something that will not bear\ncalm scrutiny.  There is much that is disquieting about the storm,\nadmirably as it begins.  I am very doubtful whether it would be possible\nto keep the boat from foundering in such circumstances, by any amount of\nbreakwater and broken rock.  I do not understand the way in which the\nwaves are spoken of, and prefer just to take it as a loose way of\nspeaking, and pass on.  And lastly, how does it happen that the sea was\nquite calm next day?  Is this great hurricane a piece of scene-painting\nafter all?  And when we have forgiven Gilliat’s prodigies of strength\n(although, in soberness, he reminds us more of Porthos in the Vicomte de\nBragelonne than is quite desirable), what is to be said to his suicide,\nand how are we to condemn in adequate terms that unprincipled avidity\nafter effect, which tells us that the sloop disappeared over the horizon,\nand the head under the water, at one and the same moment?  Monsieur Hugo\nmay say what he will, but we know better; we know very well that they did\nnot; a thing like that raises up a despairing spirit of opposition in a\nman’s readers; they give him the lie fiercely, as they read.  Lastly, we\nhave here already some beginning of that curious series of English\nblunders, that makes us wonder if there are neither proof-sheets nor\njudicious friends in the whole of France, and affects us sometimes with a\nsickening uneasiness as to what may be our own exploits when we touch\nupon foreign countries and foreign tongues.  It is here that we shall\nfind the famous “first of the fourth,” and many English words that may be\ncomprehensible perhaps in Paris.  It is here that we learn that “laird”\nin Scotland is the same title as “lord” in England.  Here, also, is an\naccount of a Highland soldier’s equipment, which we recommend to the\nlovers of genuine fun.\n\n                                * * * * *\n\nIn_ L’Homme qui Rit_, it was Hugo’s object to ‘denounce’ (as he would say\nhimself) the aristocratic principle as it was exhibited in England; and\nthis purpose, somewhat more unmitigatedly satiric than that of the two\nlast, must answer for much that is unpleasant in the book.  The\nrepulsiveness of the scheme of the story, and the manner in which it is\nbound up with impossibilities and absurdities, discourage the reader at\nthe outset, and it needs an effort to take it as seriously as it\ndeserves.  And yet when we judge it deliberately, it will be seen that,\nhere again, the story is admirably adapted to the moral.  The\nconstructive ingenuity exhibited throughout is almost morbid.  Nothing\ncould be more happily imagined, as a _reductio ad absurdum_ of the\naristocratic principle, than the adventures of Gwynplaine, the itinerant\nmountebank, snatched suddenly out of his little way of life, and\ninstalled without preparation as one of the hereditary legislators of a\ngreat country.  It is with a very bitter irony that the paper, on which\nall this depends, is left to float for years at the will of wind and\ntide.  What, again, can be finer in conception than that voice from the\npeople heard suddenly in the House of Lords, in solemn arraignment of the\npleasures and privileges of its splendid occupants?  The horrible\nlaughter, stamped for ever “by order of the king” upon the face of this\nstrange spokesman of democracy, adds yet another feature of justice to\nthe scene; in all time, travesty has been the argument of oppression;\nand, in all time, the oppressed might have made this answer: “If I am\nvile, is it not your system that has made me so?”  This ghastly laughter\ngives occasion, moreover, for the one strain of tenderness running\nthrough the web of this unpleasant story: the love of the blind girl Dea,\nfor the monster.  It is a most benignant providence that thus\nharmoniously brings together these two misfortunes; it is one of those\ncompensations, one of those afterthoughts of a relenting destiny, that\nreconcile us from time to time to the evil that is in the world; the\natmosphere of the book is purified by the presence of this pathetic love;\nit seems to be above the story somehow, and not of it, as the full moon\nover the night of some foul and feverish city.\n\nThere is here a quality in the narration more intimate and particular\nthan is general with Hugo; but it must be owned, on the other hand, that\nthe book is wordy, and even, now and then, a little wearisome.  Ursus and\nhis wolf are pleasant enough companions; but the former is nearly as much\nan abstract type as the latter.  There is a beginning, also, of an abuse\nof conventional conversation, such as may be quite pardonable in the\ndrama where needs must, but is without excuse in the romance.  Lastly, I\nsuppose one must say a word or two about the weak points of this not\nimmaculate novel; and if so, it will be best to distinguish at once.  The\nlarge family of English blunders, to which we have alluded already in\nspeaking of _Les Travailleurs_, are of a sort that is really indifferent\nin art.  If Shakespeare makes his ships cast anchor by some seaport of\nBohemia, if Hugo imagines Tom-Tim-Jack to be a likely nickname for an\nEnglish sailor, or if either Shakespeare, or Hugo, or Scott, for that\nmatter, be guilty of “figments enough to confuse the march of a whole\nhistory—anachronisms enough to overset all, chronology,” {27} the life of\ntheir creations, the artistic truth and accuracy of their work, is not so\nmuch as compromised.  But when we come upon a passage like the sinking of\nthe “Ourque” in this romance, we can do nothing but cover our face with\nour hands: the conscientious reader feels a sort of disgrace in the very\nreading.  For such artistic falsehoods, springing from what I have called\nalready an unprincipled avidity after effect, no amount of blame can be\nexaggerated; and above all, when the criminal is such a man as Victor\nHugo.  We cannot forgive in him what we might have passed over in a\nthird-rate sensation novelist.  Little as he seems to know of the sea and\nnautical affairs, he must have known very well that vessels do not go\ndown as he makes the “Ourque” go down; he must have known that such a\nliberty with fact was against the laws of the game, and incompatible with\nall appearance of sincerity in conception or workmanship.\n\n                                * * * * *\n\nIn each of these books, one after another, there has been some departure\nfrom the traditional canons of romance; but taking each separately, one\nwould have feared to make too much of these departures, or to found any\ntheory upon what was perhaps purely accidental.  The appearance of\n_Quatre Vingt Treize_ has put us out of the region of such doubt.  Like a\ndoctor who has long been hesitating how to classify an epidemic malady,\nwe have come at last upon a case so well marked that our uncertainty is\nat an end.  It is a novel built upon “a sort of enigma,” which was at\nthat date laid before revolutionary France, and which is presented by\nHugo to Tellmarch, to Lantenac, to Gauvain, and very terribly to\nCimourdain, each of whom gives his own solution of the question, clement\nor stern, according to the temper of his spirit.  That enigma was this:\n“Can a good action be a bad action?  Does not he who spares the wolf kill\nthe sheep?”  This question, as I say, meets with one answer after another\nduring the course of the book, and yet seems to remain undecided to the\nend.  And something in the same way, although one character, or one set\nof characters, after another comes to the front and occupies our\nattention for the moment, we never identify our interest with any of\nthese temporary heroes nor regret them after they are withdrawn.  We soon\ncome to regard them somewhat as special cases of a general law; what we\nreally care for is something that they only imply and body forth to us.\nWe know how history continues through century after century; how this\nking or that patriot disappears from its pages with his whole generation,\nand yet we do not cease to read, nor do we even feel as if we had reached\nany legitimate conclusion, because our interest is not in the men, but in\nthe country that they loved or hated, benefited or injured.  And so it is\nhere: Gauvain and Cimourdain pass away, and we regard them no more than\nthe lost armies of which we find the cold statistics in military annals;\nwhat we regard is what remains behind; it is the principle that put these\nmen where they were, that filled them for a while with heroic\ninspiration, and has the power, now that they are fallen, to inspire\nothers with the same courage.  The interest of the novel centres about\nrevolutionary France: just as the plot is an abstract judicial\ndifficulty, the hero is an abstract historical force.  And this has been\ndone, not, as it would have been before, by the cold and cumbersome\nmachinery of allegory, but with bold, straightforward realism, dealing\nonly with the objective materials of art, and dealing with them so\nmasterfully that the palest abstractions of thought come before us, and\nmove our hopes and fears, as if they were the young men and maidens of\ncustomary romance.\n\nThe episode of the mother and children in _Quatre Vingt Treize_ is equal\nto anything that Hugo has ever written.  There is one chapter in the\nsecond volume, for instance, called “_Sein guéri_, _cœur saignant_,” that\nis full of the very stuff of true tragedy, and nothing could be more\ndelightful than the humours of the three children on the day before the\nassault.  The passage on La Vendée is really great, and the scenes in\nParis have much of the same broad merit.  The book is full, as usual, of\npregnant and splendid sayings.  But when thus much is conceded by way of\npraise, we come to the other scale of the balance, and find this, also,\nsomewhat heavy.  There is here a yet greater over-employment of\nconventional dialogue than in _L’Homme qui Rit_; and much that should\nhave been said by the author himself, if it were to be said at all, he\nhas most unwarrantably put into the mouths of one or other of his\ncharacters.  We should like to know what becomes of the main body of the\ntroop in the wood of La Saudraie during the thirty pages or so in which\nthe foreguard lays aside all discipline, and stops to gossip over a woman\nand some children.  We have an unpleasant idea forced upon us at one\nplace, in spite of all the good-natured incredulity that we can summon up\nto resist it.  Is it possible that Monsieur Hugo thinks they ceased to\nsteer the corvette while the gun was loose?  Of the chapter in which\nLantenac and Halmalho are alone together in the boat, the less said the\nbetter; of course, if there were nothing else, they would have been\nswamped thirty times over during the course of Lantenac’s harangue.\nAgain, after Lantenac has landed, we have scenes of almost inimitable\nworkmanship that suggest the epithet “statuesque” by their clear and\ntrenchant outline; but the tocsin scene will not do, and the tocsin\nunfortunately pervades the whole passage, ringing continually in our ears\nwith a taunting accusation of falsehood.  And then, when we come to the\nplace where Lantenac meets the royalists, under the idea that he is going\nto meet the republicans, it seems as if there were a hitch in the stage\nmechanism.  I have tried it over in every way, and I cannot conceive any\ndisposition that would make the scene possible as narrated.\n\n                                * * * * *\n\nSuch then, with their faults and their signal excellences, are the five\ngreat novels.\n\nRomance is a language in which many persons learn to speak with a certain\nappearance of fluency; but there are few who can ever bend it to any\npractical need, few who can ever be said to express themselves in it.  It\nhas become abundantly plain in the foregoing examination that Victor Hugo\noccupies a high place among those few.  He has always a perfect command\nover his stories; and we see that they are constructed with a high regard\nto some ulterior purpose, and that every situation is informed with moral\nsignificance and grandeur.  Of no other man can the same thing be said in\nthe same degree.  His romances are not to be confused with “the novel\nwith a purpose” as familiar to the English reader: this is generally the\nmodel of incompetence; and we see the moral clumsily forced into every\nhole and corner of the story, or thrown externally over it like a carpet\nover a railing.  Now the moral significance, with Hugo, is of the essence\nof the romance; it is the organising principle.  If you could somehow\ndespoil _Les Misérables or Les Travailleurs_ of their distinctive lesson,\nyou would find that the story had lost its interest and the book was\ndead.\n\nHaving thus learned to subordinate his story to an idea, to make his art\nspeak, he went on to teach it to say things heretofore unaccustomed.  If\nyou look back at the five books of which we have now so hastily spoken,\nyou will be astonished at the freedom with which the original purposes of\nstory-telling have been laid aside and passed by.  Where are now the two\nlovers who descended the main watershed of all the Waverley novels, and\nall the novels that have tried to follow in their wake?  Sometimes they\nare almost lost sight of before the solemn isolation of a man against the\nsea and sky, as in _Les Travailleurs_; sometimes, as in _Les Misérables_,\nthey merely figure for awhile, as a beautiful episode in the epic of\noppression; sometimes they are entirely absent, as in _Quatre Vingt\nTreize_.  There is no hero in _Notre Dame_: in _Les Misérables_ it is an\nold man: in _L’Homme qui Rit_ it is a monster: in _Quatre Vingt Treize_\nit is the Revolution.  Those elements that only began to show themselves\ntimidly, as adjuncts, in the novels of Walter Scott, have usurped ever\nmore and more of the canvas; until we find the whole interest of one of\nHugo’s romances centring around matter that Fielding would have banished\nfrom his altogether, as being out of the field of fiction.  So we have\nelemental forces occupying nearly as large a place, playing (so to speak)\nnearly as important a _rôle_, as the man, Gilliat, who opposes and\novercomes them.  So we find the fortunes of a nation put upon the stage\nwith as much vividness as ever before the fortunes of a village maiden or\na lost heir; and the forces that oppose and corrupt a principle holding\nthe attention quite as strongly as the wicked barons or dishonest\nattorneys of the past.  Hence those individual interests that were\nsupreme in Fielding, and even in Scott, stood out over everything else\nand formed as it were the spine of the story, figure here only as one set\nof interests among many sets, one force among many forces, one thing to\nbe treated out of a whole world of things equally vivid and important.\nSo that, for Hugo, man is no longer an isolated spirit without antecedent\nor relation here below, but a being involved in the action and reaction\nof natural forces, himself a centre of such action and reaction or an\nunit in a great multitude, chased hither and thither by epidemic terrors\nand aspirations, and, in all seriousness, blown about by every wind of\ndoctrine.  This is a long way that we have travelled: between such work\nand the work of Fielding is there not, indeed, a great gulph in thought\nand sentiment?\n\nArt, thus conceived, realises for men a larger portion of life, and that\nportion one that it is more difficult for them to realise unaided; and,\nbesides helping them to feel more intensely those restricted personal\ninterests which are patent to all, it awakes in them some consciousness\nof those more general relations that are so strangely invisible to the\naverage man in ordinary moods.  It helps to keep man in his place in\nnature, and, above all, it helps him to understand more intelligently the\nresponsibilities of his place in society.  And in all this generalisation\nof interest, we never miss those small humanities that are at the\nopposite pole of excellence in art; and while we admire the intellect\nthat could see life thus largely, we are touched with another sentiment\nfor the tender heart that slipped the piece of gold into Cosette’s sabot,\nthat was virginally troubled at the fluttering of her dress in the spring\nwind, or put the blind girl beside the deformity of the laughing man.\nThis, then, is the last praise that we can award to these romances.  The\nauthor has shown a power of just subordination hitherto unequalled; and\nas, in reaching forward to one class of effects, he has not been\nforgetful or careless of the other, his work is more nearly complete\nwork, and his art, with all its imperfections, deals more comprehensively\nwith the materials of life than that of any of his otherwise more sure\nand masterly predecessors.\n\nThese five books would have made a very great fame for any writer, and\nyet they are but one façade of the monument that Victor Hugo has erected\nto his genius.  Everywhere we find somewhat the same greatness, somewhat\nthe same infirmities.  In his poems and plays there are the same\nunaccountable protervities that have already astonished us in the\nromances.  There, too, is the same feverish strength, welding the fiery\niron of his idea under forge-hammer repetitions—an emphasis that is\nsomehow akin to weaknesses—strength that is a little epileptic.  He\nstands so far above all his contemporaries, and so incomparably excels\nthem in richness, breadth, variety, and moral earnestness, that we almost\nfeel as if he had a sort of right to fall oftener and more heavily than\nothers; but this does not reconcile us to seeing him profit by the\nprivilege so freely.  We like to have, in our great men, something that\nis above question; we like to place an implicit faith in them, and see\nthem always on the platform of their greatness; and this, unhappily,\ncannot be with Hugo.  As Heine said long ago, his is a genius somewhat\ndeformed; but, deformed as it is, we accept it gladly; we shall have the\nwisdom to see where his foot slips, but we shall have the justice also to\nrecognise in him one of the greatest artists of our generation, and, in\nmany ways, one of the greatest artists of time.  If we look back, yet\nonce, upon these five romances, we see blemishes such as we can lay to\nthe charge of no other man in the number of the famous; but to what other\nman can we attribute such sweeping innovations, such a new and\nsignificant presentment of the life of man, such an amount, if we merely\nthink of the amount, of equally consummate performance?\n\n\n\n\nSOME ASPECTS OF ROBERT BURNS\n\n\nTO write with authority about another man, we must have fellow-feeling\nand some common ground of experience with our subject.  We may praise or\nblame according as we find him related to us by the best or worst in\nourselves; but it is only in virtue of some relationship that we can be\nhis judges, even to condemn.  Feelings which we share and understand\nenter for us into the tissue of the man’s character; those to which we\nare strangers in our own experience we are inclined to regard as blots,\nexceptions, inconsistencies, and excursions of the diabolic; we conceive\nthem with repugnance, explain them with difficulty, and raise our hands\nto heaven in wonder when we find them in conjunction with talents that we\nrespect or virtues that we admire.  David, king of Israel, would pass a\nsounder judgment on a man than either Nathaniel or David Hume.  Now,\nPrincipal Shairp’s recent volume, although I believe no one will read it\nwithout respect and interest, has this one capital defect—that there is\nimperfect sympathy between the author and the subject, between the critic\nand the personality under criticism.  Hence an inorganic, if not an\nincoherent, presentation of both the poems and the man.  Of _Holy\nWillie’s Prayer_, Principal Shairp remarks that “those who have loved\nmost what was best in Burns’s poetry must have regretted that it was ever\nwritten.”  To the _Jolly Beggars_, so far as my memory serves me, he\nrefers but once; and then only to remark on the “strange, not to say\npainful,” circumstance that the same hand which wrote the _Cotter’s\nSaturday Night_ should have stooped to write the _Jolly Beggars_.  The\n_Saturday Night_ may or may not be an admirable poem; but its\nsignificance is trebled, and the power and range of the poet first\nappears, when it is set beside the _Jolly Beggars_.  To take a man’s work\npiecemeal, except with the design of elegant extracts, is the way to\navoid, and not to perform, the critic’s duty.  The same defect is\ndisplayed in the treatment of Burns as a man, which is broken,\napologetical, and confused.  The man here presented to us is not that\nBurns, _teres atque rotundus_—a burly figure in literature, as, from our\npresent vantage of time, we have begun to see him.  This, on the other\nhand, is Burns as he may have appeared to a contemporary clergyman, whom\nwe shall conceive to have been a kind and indulgent but orderly and\northodox person, anxious to be pleased, but too often hurt and\ndisappointed by the behaviour of his red-hot _protégé_, and solacing\nhimself with the explanation that the poet was “the most inconsistent of\nmen.”  If you are so sensibly pained by the misconduct of your subject,\nand so paternally delighted with his virtues, you will always be an\nexcellent gentleman, but a somewhat questionable biographer.  Indeed, we\ncan only be sorry and surprised that Principal Shairp should have chosen\na theme so uncongenial.  When we find a man writing on Burns, who likes\nneither _Holy Willie_, nor the _Beggars_, nor the _Ordination_, nothing\nis adequate to the situation but the old cry of Géronte: “Que diable\nallait-il faire dans cette galère?”  And every merit we find in the book,\nwhich is sober and candid in a degree unusual with biographies of Burns,\nonly leads us to regret more heartily that good work should be so greatly\nthrown away.\n\nIt is far from my intention to tell over again a story that has been so\noften told; but there are certainly some points in the character of Burns\nthat will bear to be brought out, and some chapters in his life that\ndemand a brief rehearsal.  The unity of the man’s nature, for all its\nrichness, has fallen somewhat out of sight in the pressure of new\ninformation and the apologetical ceremony of biographers.  Mr. Carlyle\nmade an inimitable bust of the poet’s head of gold; may I not be forgiven\nif my business should have more to do with the feet, which were of clay?\n\n\n\nYOUTH.\n\n\nAny view of Burns would be misleading which passed over in silence the\ninfluences of his home and his father.  That father, William Burnes,\nafter having been for many years a gardener, took a farm, married, and,\nlike an emigrant in a new country, built himself a house with his own\nhands.  Poverty of the most distressing sort, with sometimes the near\nprospect of a gaol, embittered the remainder of his life.  Chill,\nbackward, and austere with strangers, grave and imperious in his family,\nhe was yet a man of very unusual parts and of an affectionate nature.  On\nhis way through life he had remarked much upon other men, with more\nresult in theory than practice; and he had reflected upon many subjects\nas he delved the garden.  His great delight was in solid conversation; he\nwould leave his work to talk with the schoolmaster Murdoch; and Robert,\nwhen he came home late at night, not only turned aside rebuke but kept\nhis father two hours beside the fire by the charm of his merry and\nvigorous talk.  Nothing is more characteristic of the class in general,\nand William Burnes in particular, than the pains he took to get proper\nschooling for his boys, and, when that was no longer possible, the sense\nand resolution with which he set himself to supply the deficiency by his\nown influence.  For many years he was their chief companion; he spoke\nwith them seriously on all subjects as if they had been grown men; at\nnight, when work was over, he taught them arithmetic; he borrowed books\nfor them on history, science, and theology; and he felt it his duty to\nsupplement this last—the trait is laughably Scottish—by a dialogue of his\nown composition, where his own private shade of orthodoxy was exactly\nrepresented.  He would go to his daughter as she stayed afield herding\ncattle, to teach her the names of grasses and wild flowers, or to sit by\nher side when it thundered.  Distance to strangers, deep family\ntenderness, love of knowledge, a narrow, precise, and formal reading of\ntheology—everything we learn of him hangs well together, and builds up a\npopular Scotch type.  If I mention the name of Andrew Fairservice, it is\nonly as I might couple for an instant Dugald Dalgetty with old Marshal\nLoudon, to help out the reader’s comprehension by a popular but unworthy\ninstance of a class.  Such was the influence of this good and wise man\nthat his household became a school to itself, and neighbours who came\ninto the farm at meal-time would find the whole family, father, brothers,\nand sisters, helping themselves with one hand, and holding a book in the\nother.  We are surprised at the prose style of Robert; that of Gilbert\nneed surprise us no less; even William writes a remarkable letter for a\nyoung man of such slender opportunities.  One anecdote marks the taste of\nthe family.  Murdoch brought _Titus Andronicus_, and, with such dominie\nelocution as we may suppose, began to read it aloud before this rustic\naudience; but when he had reached the passage where Tamora insults\nLavinia, with one voice and “in an agony of distress” they refused to\nhear it to an end.  In such a father and with such a home, Robert had\nalready the making of an excellent education; and what Murdoch added,\nalthough it may not have been much in amount, was in character the very\nessence of a literary training.  Schools and colleges, for one great man\nwhom they complete, perhaps unmake a dozen; the strong spirit can do well\nupon more scanty fare.\n\nRobert steps before us, almost from the first, in his complete\ncharacter—a proud, headstrong, impetuous lad, greedy of pleasure, greedy\nof notice; in his own phrase “panting after distinction,” and in his\nbrother’s “cherishing a particular jealousy of people who were richer or\nof more consequence than himself:” with all this, he was emphatically of\nthe artist nature.  Already he made a conspicuous figure in Tarbolton\nchurch, with the only tied hair in the parish, “and his plaid, which was\nof a particular colour, wrapped in a particular manner round his\nshoulders.”  Ten years later, when a married man, the father of a family,\na farmer, and an officer of Excise, we shall find him out fishing in\nmasquerade, with fox-skin cap, belted great-coat, and great Highland\nbroadsword.  He liked dressing up, in fact, for its own sake.  This is\nthe spirit which leads to the extravagant array of Latin Quarter\nstudents, and the proverbial velveteen of the English landscape-painter;\nand, though the pleasure derived is in itself merely personal, it shows a\nman who is, to say the least of it, not pained by general attention and\nremark.  His father wrote the family name _Burnes_; Robert early adopted\nthe orthography _Burness_ from his cousin in the Mearns; and in his\ntwenty-eighth year changed it once more to _Burns_.  It is plain that the\nlast transformation was not made without some qualm; for in addressing\nhis cousin he adheres, in at least one more letter, to spelling number\ntwo.  And this, again, shows a man preoccupied about the manner of his\nappearance even down to the name, and little willing to follow custom.\nAgain, he was proud, and justly proud, of his powers in conversation.  To\nno other man’s have we the same conclusive testimony from different\nsources and from every rank of life.  It is almost a commonplace that the\nbest of his works was what he said in talk.  Robertson the historian\n“scarcely ever met any man whose conversation displayed greater vigour;”\nthe Duchess of Gordon declared that he “carried her off her feet;” and,\nwhen he came late to an inn, the servants would get out of bed to hear\nhim talk.  But, in these early days at least, he was determined to shine\nby any means.  He made himself feared in the village for his tongue.  He\nwould crush weaker men to their faces, or even perhaps—for the statement\nof Sillar is not absolute—say cutting things of his acquaintances behind\ntheir back.  At the church door, between sermons, he would parade his\nreligious views amid hisses.  These details stamp the man.  He had no\ngenteel timidities in the conduct of his life.  He loved to force his\npersonality upon the world.  He would please himself, and shine.  Had he\nlived in the Paris of 1830, and joined his lot with the Romantics, we can\nconceive him writing _Jehan_ for _Jean_, swaggering in Gautier’s red\nwaistcoat, and horrifying Bourgeois in a public café with paradox and\ngasconnade.\n\nA leading trait throughout his whole career was his desire to be in love.\n_Ne fait pas ce tour qui veut_.  His affections were often enough\ntouched, but perhaps never engaged.  He was all his life on a voyage of\ndiscovery, but it does not appear conclusively that he ever touched the\nhappy isle.  A man brings to love a deal of ready-made sentiment, and\neven from childhood obscurely prognosticates the symptoms of this vital\nmalady.  Burns was formed for love; he had passion, tenderness, and a\nsingular bent in the direction; he could foresee, with the intuition of\nan artist, what love ought to be; and he could not conceive a worthy life\nwithout it.  But he had ill-fortune, and was besides so greedy after\nevery shadow of the true divinity, and so much the slave of a strong\ntemperament, that perhaps his nerve was relaxed and his heart had lost\nthe power of self-devotion before an opportunity occurred.  The\ncircumstances of his youth doubtless counted for something in the result.\nFor the lads of Ayrshire, as soon as the day’s work was over and the\nbeasts were stabled, would take the road, it might be in a winter\ntempest, and travel perhaps miles by moss and moorland to spend an hour\nor two in courtship.  Rule 10 of the Bachelors’ Club at Tarbolton\nprovides that “every man proper for a member of this Society must be a\nprofessed lover of _one or more_ of the female sex.”  The rich, as Burns\nhimself points out, may have a choice of pleasurable occupations, but\nthese lads had nothing but their “cannie hour at e’en.”  It was upon love\nand flirtation that this rustic society was built; gallantry was the\nessence of life among the Ayrshire hills as well as in the Court of\nVersailles; and the days were distinguished from each other by\nlove-letters, meetings, tiffs, reconciliations, and expansions to the\nchosen confidant, as in a comedy of Marivaux.  Here was a field for a man\nof Burns’s indiscriminate personal ambition, where he might pursue his\nvoyage of discovery in quest of true love, and enjoy temporary triumphs\nby the way.  He was “constantly the victim of some fair enslaver”—at\nleast, when it was not the other way about; and there were often\nunderplots and secondary fair enslavers in the background.  Many—or may\nwe not say most?—of these affairs were entirely artificial.  One, he\ntells us, he began out of “a vanity of showing his parts in courtship,”\nfor he piqued himself on his ability at a love-letter.  But, however they\nbegan, these flames of his were fanned into a passion ere the end; and he\nstands unsurpassed in his power of self-deception, and positively without\na competitor in the art, to use his own words, of “battering himself into\na warm affection,”—a debilitating and futile exercise.  Once he had\nworked himself into the vein, “the agitations of his mind and body” were\nan astonishment to all who knew him.  Such a course as this, however\npleasant to a thirsty vanity, was lowering to his nature.  He sank more\nand more towards the professional Don Juan.  With a leer of what the\nFrench call fatuity, he bids the belles of Mauchline beware of his\nseductions; and the same cheap self-satisfaction finds a yet uglier vent\nwhen he plumes himself on the scandal at the birth of his first bastard.\nWe can well believe what we hear of his facility in striking up an\nacquaintance with women: he would have conquering manners; he would bear\ndown upon his rustic game with the grace that comes of absolute\nassurance—the Richelieu of Lochlea or Mossgiel.  In yet another manner\ndid these quaint ways of courtship help him into fame.  If he were great\nas principal, he was unrivalled as confidant.  He could enter into a\npassion; he could counsel wary moves, being, in his own phrase, so old a\nhawk; nay, he could turn a letter for some unlucky swain, or even string\na few lines of verse that should clinch the business and fetch the\nhesitating fair one to the ground.  Nor, perhaps, was it only his\n“curiosity, zeal, and intrepid dexterity” that recommended him for a\nsecond in such affairs; it must have been a distinction to have the\nassistance and advice of _Rab the Ranter_; and one who was in no way\nformidable by himself might grow dangerous and attractive through the\nfame of his associate.\n\nI think we can conceive him, in these early years, in that rough moorland\ncountry, poor among the poor with his seven pounds a year, looked upon\nwith doubt by respectable elders, but for all that the best talker, the\nbest letter-writer, the most famous lover and confidant, the laureate\npoet, and the only man who wore his hair tied in the parish.  He says he\nhad then as high a notion of himself as ever after; and I can well\nbelieve it.  Among the youth he walked _facile princeps_, an apparent\ngod; and even if, from time to time, the Reverend Mr. Auld should swoop\nupon him with the thunders of the Church, and, in company with seven\nothers, Rab the Ranter must figure some fine Sunday on the stool of\nrepentance, would there not be a sort of glory, an infernal apotheosis,\nin so conspicuous a shame?  Was not Richelieu in disgrace more idolised\nthan ever by the dames of Paris? and when was the highwayman most\nacclaimed but on his way to Tyburn?  Or, to take a simile from nearer\nhome, and still more exactly to the point, what could even corporal\npunishment avail, administered by a cold, abstract, unearthly\nschool-master, against the influence and fame of the school’s hero?\n\nAnd now we come to the culminating point of Burns’s early period.  He\nbegan to be received into the unknown upper world.  His fame soon spread\nfrom among his fellow-rebels on the benches, and began to reach the\nushers and monitors of this great Ayrshire academy.  This arose in part\nfrom his lax views about religion; for at this time that old war of the\ncreeds and confessors, which is always grumbling from end to end of our\npoor Scotland, brisked up in these parts into a hot and virulent\nskirmish; and Burns found himself identified with the opposition party,—a\nclique of roaring lawyers and half-heretical divines, with wit enough to\nappreciate the value of the poet’s help, and not sufficient taste to\nmoderate his grossness and personality.  We may judge of their surprise\nwhen _Holy Willie_ was put into their hand; like the amorous lads of\nTarbolton, they recognised in him the best of seconds.  His satires began\nto go the round in manuscript; Mr. Aiken, one of the lawyers, “read him\ninto fame;” he himself was soon welcome in many houses of a better sort,\nwhere his admirable talk, and his manners, which he had direct from his\nMaker, except for a brush he gave them at a country dancing school,\ncompleted what his poems had begun.  We have a sight of him at his first\nvisit to Adamhill, in his ploughman’s shoes, coasting around the carpet\nas though that were sacred ground.  But he soon grew used to carpets and\ntheir owners; and he was still the superior of all whom he encountered,\nand ruled the roost in conversation.  Such was the impression made, that\na young clergyman, himself a man of ability, trembled and became confused\nwhen he saw Robert enter the church in which he was to preach.  It is not\nsurprising that the poet determined to publish: he had now stood the test\nof some publicity, and under this hopeful impulse he composed in six\nwinter months the bulk of his more important poems.  Here was a young man\nwho, from a very humble place, was mounting rapidly; from the cynosure of\na parish, he had become the talk of a county; once the bard of rural\ncourtships, he was now about to appear as a bound and printed poet in the\nworld’s bookshops.\n\nA few more intimate strokes are necessary to complete the sketch.  This\nstrong young plough-man, who feared no competitor with the flail,\nsuffered like a fine lady from sleeplessness and vapours; he would fall\ninto the blackest melancholies, and be filled with remorse for the past\nand terror for the future.  He was still not perhaps devoted to religion,\nbut haunted by it; and at a touch of sickness prostrated himself before\nGod in what I can only call unmanly penitence.  As he had aspirations\nbeyond his place in the world, so he had tastes, thoughts, and weaknesses\nto match.  He loved to walk under a wood to the sound of a winter\ntempest; he had a singular tenderness for animals; he carried a book with\nhim in his pocket when he went abroad, and wore out in this service two\ncopies of the _Man of Feeling_.  With young people in the field at work\nhe was very long-suffering; and when his brother Gilbert spoke sharply to\nthem—“O man, ye are no for young folk,” he would say, and give the\ndefaulter a helping hand and a smile.  In the hearts of the men whom he\nmet, he read as in a book; and, what is yet more rare, his knowledge of\nhimself equalled his knowledge of others.  There are no truer things said\nof Burns than what is to be found in his own letters.  Country Don Juan\nas he was, he had none of that blind vanity which values itself on what\nit is not; he knew his own strength and weakness to a hair: he took\nhimself boldly for what he was, and, except in moments of hypochondria,\ndeclared himself content.\n\n\n\nTHE LOVE STORIES.\n\n\nOn the night of Mauchline races, 1785, the young men and women of the\nplace joined in a penny ball, according to their custom.  In the same set\ndanced Jean Armour, the master-mason’s daughter, and our dark-eyed Don\nJuan.  His dog (not the immortal Luath, but a successor unknown to fame,\n_caret quia vate sacro_), apparently sensible of some neglect, followed\nhis master to and fro, to the confusion of the dancers.  Some mirthful\ncomments followed; and Jean heard the poet say to his partner—or, as I\nshould imagine, laughingly launch the remark to the company at large—that\n“he wished he could get any of the lasses to like him as well as his\ndog.”  Some time after, as the girl was bleaching clothes on Mauchline\ngreen, Robert chanced to go by, still accompanied by his dog; and the\ndog, “scouring in long excursion,” scampered with four black paws across\nthe linen.  This brought the two into conversation; when Jean, with a\nsomewhat hoydenish advance, inquired if “he had yet got any of the lasses\nto like him as well as his dog?”\n\nIt is one of the misfortunes of the professional Don Juan that his honour\nforbids him to refuse battle; he is in life like the Roman soldier upon\nduty, or like the sworn physician who must attend on all diseases.  Burns\naccepted the provocation; hungry hope reawakened in his heart; here was a\ngirl—pretty, simple at least, if not honestly stupid, and plainly not\naverse to his attentions: it seemed to him once more as if love might\nhere be waiting him.  Had he but known the truth! for this facile and\nempty-headed girl had nothing more in view than a flirtation; and her\nheart, from the first and on to the end of her story, was engaged by\nanother man.  Burns once more commenced the celebrated process of\n“battering himself into a warm affection;” and the proofs of his success\nare to be found in many verses of the period.  Nor did he succeed with\nhimself only; Jean, with her heart still elsewhere, succumbed to his\nfascination, and early in the next year the natural consequence became\nmanifest.  It was a heavy stroke for this unfortunate couple.  They had\ntrifled with life, and were now rudely reminded of life’s serious issues.\nJean awoke to the ruin of her hopes; the best she had now to expect was\nmarriage with a man who was a stranger to her dearest thoughts; she might\nnow be glad if she could get what she would never have chosen.  As for\nBurns, at the stroke of the calamity he recognised that his voyage of\ndiscovery had led him into a wrong hemisphere—that he was not, and never\nhad been, really in love with Jean.  Hear him in the pressure of the\nhour.  “Against two things,” he writes, “I am as fixed as fate—staying at\nhome, and owning her conjugally.  The first, by heaven, I will not\ndo!—the last, by hell, I will never do!”  And then he adds, perhaps\nalready in a more relenting temper: “If you see Jean, tell her I will\nmeet her, so God help me in my hour of need.”  They met accordingly; and\nBurns, touched with her misery, came down from these heights of\nindependence, and gave her a written acknowledgment of marriage.  It is\nthe punishment of Don Juanism to create continually false\npositions—relations in life which are wrong in themselves, and which it\nis equally wrong to break or to perpetuate.  This was such a case.\nWorldly Wiseman would have laughed and gone his way; let us be glad that\nBurns was better counselled by his heart.  When we discover that we can\nbe no longer true, the next best is to be kind.  I daresay he came away\nfrom that interview not very content, but with a glorious conscience; and\nas he went homeward, he would sing his favourite, “How are Thy servants\nblest, O Lord!”  Jean, on the other hand, armed with her “lines,”\nconfided her position to the master-mason, her father, and his wife.\nBurns and his brother were then in a fair way to ruin themselves in their\nfarm; the poet was an execrable match for any well-to-do country lass;\nand perhaps old Armour had an inkling of a previous attachment on his\ndaughter’s part.  At least, he was not so much incensed by her slip from\nvirtue as by the marriage which had been designed to cover it.  Of this\nhe would not hear a word. Jean, who had besought the acknowledgment only\nto appease her parents, and not at all from any violent inclination to\nthe poet, readily gave up the paper for destruction; and all parties\nimagined, although wrongly, that the marriage was thus dissolved.  To a\nproud man like Burns here was a crushing blow.  The concession which had\nbeen wrung from his pity was now publicly thrown back in his teeth.  The\nArmour family preferred disgrace to his connection.  Since the promise,\nbesides, he had doubtless been busy “battering himself” back again into\nhis affection for the girl; and the blow would not only take him in his\nvanity, but wound him at the heart.\n\nHe relieved himself in verse; but for such a smarting affront manuscript\npoetry was insufficient to console him.  He must find a more powerful\nremedy in good flesh and blood, and after this discomfiture, set forth\nagain at once upon his voyage of discovery in quest of love.  It is\nperhaps one of the most touching things in human nature, as it is a\ncommonplace of psychology, that when a man has just lost hope or\nconfidence in one love, he is then most eager to find and lean upon\nanother.  The universe could not be yet exhausted; there must be hope and\nlove waiting for him somewhere; and so, with his head down, this poor,\ninsulted poet ran once more upon his fate.  There was an innocent and\ngentle Highland nursery-maid at service in a neighbouring family; and he\nhad soon battered himself and her into a warm affection and a secret\nengagement.  Jean’s marriage lines had not been destroyed till March 13,\n1786; yet all was settled between Burns and Mary Campbell by Sunday, May\n14, when they met for the last time, and said farewell with rustic\nsolemnities upon the banks of Ayr.  They each wet their hands in a\nstream, and, standing one on either bank, held a Bible between them as\nthey vowed eternal faith.  Then they exchanged Bibles, on one of which\nBurns, for greater security, had inscribed texts as to the binding nature\nof an oath; and surely, if ceremony can do aught to fix the wandering\naffections, here were two people united for life.  Mary came of a\nsuperstitious family, so that she perhaps insisted on these rites; but\nthey must have been eminently to the taste of Burns at this period; for\nnothing would seem superfluous, and no oath great enough, to stay his\ntottering constancy.\n\nEvents of consequence now happened thickly in the poet’s life.  His book\nwas announced; the Armours sought to summon him at law for the aliment of\nthe child; he lay here and there in hiding to correct the sheets; he was\nunder an engagement for Jamaica, where Mary was to join him as his wife;\nnow, he had “orders within three weeks at latest to repair aboard the\n_Nancy_, Captain Smith;” now his chest was already on the road to\nGreenock; and now, in the wild autumn weather on the moorland, he\nmeasures verses of farewell:—\n\n    “The bursting tears my heart declare;\n    Farewell the bonny banks of Ayr!”\n\nBut the great master dramatist had secretly another intention for the\npiece; by the most violent and complicated solution, in which death and\nbirth and sudden fame all play a part as interposing deities, the\nact-drop fell upon a scene of transformation.  Jean was brought to bed of\ntwins, and, by an amicable arrangement, the Burnses took the boy to bring\nup by hand, while the girl remained with her mother.  The success of the\nbook was immediate and emphatic; it put £20 at once into the author’s\npurse; and he was encouraged upon all hands to go to Edinburgh and push\nhis success in a second and larger edition.  Third and last in these\nseries of interpositions, a letter came one day to Mossgiel Farm for\nRobert.  He went to the window to read it; a sudden change came over his\nface, and he left the room without a word.  Years afterwards, when the\nstory began to leak out, his family understood that he had then learned\nthe death of Highland Mary.  Except in a few poems and a few dry\nindications purposely misleading as to date, Burns himself made no\nreference to this passage of his life; it was an adventure of which, for\nI think sufficient reasons, he desired to bury the details.  Of one thing\nwe may be glad: in after years he visited the poor girl’s mother, and\nleft her with the impression that he was “a real warm-hearted chield.”\n\nPerhaps a month after he received this intelligence, he set out for\nEdinburgh on a pony he had borrowed from a friend.  The town that winter\nwas “agog with the ploughman poet.”  Robertson, Dugald Stewart, Blair,\n“Duchess Gordon and all the gay world,” were of his acquaintance.  Such a\nrevolution is not to be found in literary history.  He was now, it must\nbe remembered, twenty-seven years of age; he had fought since his early\nboyhood an obstinate battle against poor soil, bad seed, and inclement\nseasons, wading deep in Ayrshire mosses, guiding the plough in the furrow\nwielding “the thresher’s weary flingin’-tree;” and his education, his\ndiet, and his pleasures, had been those of a Scotch countryman.  Now he\nstepped forth suddenly among the polite and learned.  We can see him as\nhe then was, in his boots and buckskins, his blue coat and waistcoat\nstriped with buff and blue, like a farmer in his Sunday best; the heavy\nploughman’s figure firmly planted on its burly legs; his face full of\nsense and shrewdness, and with a somewhat melancholy air of thought, and\nhis large dark eye “literally glowing” as he spoke.  “I never saw such\nanother eye in a human head,” says Walter Scott, “though I have seen the\nmost distinguished men of my time.”  With men, whether they were lords or\nomnipotent critics, his manner was plain, dignified, and free from\nbashfulness or affectation.  If he made a slip, he had the social courage\nto pass on and refrain from explanation.  He was not embarrassed in this\nsociety, because he read and judged the men; he could spy snobbery in a\ntitled lord; and, as for the critics, he dismissed their system in an\nepigram.  “These gentlemen,” said he, “remind me of some spinsters in my\ncountry who spin their thread so fine that it is neither fit for weft nor\nwoof.”  Ladies, on the other hand, surprised him; he was scarce commander\nof himself in their society; he was disqualified by his acquired nature\nas a Don Juan; and he, who had been so much at his ease with country\nlasses, treated the town dames to an extreme of deference.  One lady, who\nmet him at a ball, gave Chambers a speaking sketch of his demeanour.\n“His manner was not prepossessing—scarcely, she thinks, manly or natural.\nIt seemed as if he affected a rusticity or _landertness_, so that when he\nsaid the music was ‘bonnie, bonnie,’ it was like the expression of a\nchild.”  These would be company manners; and doubtless on a slight degree\nof intimacy the affectation would grow less.  And his talk to women had\nalways “a turn either to the pathetic or humorous, which engaged the\nattention particularly.”\n\nThe Edinburgh magnates (to conclude this episode at once) behaved well to\nBurns from first to last.  Were heaven-born genius to revisit us in\nsimilar guise, I am not venturing too far when I say that he need expect\nneither so warm a welcome nor such solid help.  Although Burns was only a\npeasant, and one of no very elegant reputation as to morals, he was made\nwelcome to their homes.  They gave him a great deal of good advice,\nhelped him to some five hundred pounds of ready money, and got him, as\nsoon as he asked it, a place in the Excise.  Burns, on his part, bore the\nelevation with perfect dignity; and with perfect dignity returned, when\nthe time had come, into a country privacy of life.  His powerful sense\nnever deserted him, and from the first he recognised that his Edinburgh\npopularity was but an ovation and the affair of a day.  He wrote a few\nletters in a high-flown, bombastic vein of gratitude; but in practice he\nsuffered no man to intrude upon his self-respect.  On the other hand, he\nnever turned his back, even for a moment, on his old associates; and he\nwas always ready to sacrifice an acquaintance to a friend, although the\nacquaintance were a duke.  He would be a bold man who should promise\nsimilar conduct in equally exacting circumstances.  It was, in short, an\nadmirable appearance on the stage of life—socially successful, intimately\nself-respecting, and like a gentleman from first to last.\n\nIn the present study, this must only be taken by the way, while we return\nto Burns’s love affairs.  Even on the road to Edinburgh he had seized\nupon the opportunity of a flirtation, and had carried the “battering” so\nfar that when next he moved from town, it was to steal two days with this\nanonymous fair one.  The exact importance to Burns of this affair may be\ngathered from the song in which he commemorated its occurrence.  “I love\nthe dear lassie,” he sings, “because she loves me;” or, in the tongue of\nprose: “Finding an opportunity, I did not hesitate to profit by it, and\neven now, if it returned, I should not hesitate to profit by it again.”\nA love thus founded has no interest for mortal man.  Meantime, early in\nthe winter, and only once, we find him regretting Jean in his\ncorrespondence.  “Because”—such is his reason—“because he does not think\nhe will ever meet so delicious an armful again;” and then, after a brief\nexcursion into verse, he goes straight on to describe a new episode in\nthe voyage of discovery with the daughter of a Lothian farmer for a\nheroine.  I must ask the reader to follow all these references to his\nfuture wife; they are essential to the comprehension of Burns’s character\nand fate.  In June, we find him back at Mauchline, a famous man.  There,\nthe Armour family greeted him with a “mean, servile compliance,” which\nincreased his former disgust.  Jean was not less compliant; a second time\nthe poor girl submitted to the fascination of the man whom she did not\nlove, and whom she had so cruelly insulted little more than a year ago;\nand, though Burns took advantage of her weakness, it was in the ugliest\nand most cynical spirit, and with a heart absolutely indifferent.  Judge\nof this by a letter written some twenty days after his return—a letter to\nmy mind among the most degrading in the whole collection—a letter which\nseems to have been inspired by a boastful, libertine bagman.  “I am\nafraid,” it goes, “I have almost ruined one source, the principal one,\nindeed, of my former happiness—the eternal propensity I always had to\nfall in love.  My heart no more glows with feverish rapture; I have no\nparadisiacal evening interviews.”  Even the process of “battering” has\nfailed him, you perceive.  Still he had some one in his eye—a lady, if\nyou please, with a fine figure and elegant manners, and who had “seen the\npolitest quarters in Europe.”  “I frequently visited her,” he writes,\n“and after passing regularly the intermediate degrees between the distant\nformal bow and the familiar grasp round the waist, I ventured, in my\ncareless way, to talk of friendship in rather ambiguous terms; and after\nher return to —, I wrote her in the same terms.  Miss, construing my\nremarks further than even I intended, flew off in a tangent of female\ndignity and reserve, like a mounting lark in an April morning; and wrote\nme an answer which measured out very completely what an immense way I had\nto travel before I could reach the climate of her favours.  But I am an\nold hawk at the sport, and wrote her such a cool, deliberate, prudent\nreply, as brought my bird from her aerial towerings, pop, down to my\nfoot, like Corporal Trim’s hat.”  I avow a carnal longing, after this\ntranscription, to buffet the Old Hawk about the ears.  There is little\nquestion that to this lady he must have repeated his addresses, and that\nhe was by her (Miss Chalmers) eventually, though not at all unkindly,\nrejected.  One more detail to characterise the period.  Six months after\nthe date of this letter, Burns, back in Edinburgh, is served with a writ\n_in meditatione fugæ_, on behalf of some Edinburgh fair one, probably of\nhumble rank, who declared an intention of adding to his family.\n\nAbout the beginning of December (1787), a new period opens in the story\nof the poet’s random affections.  He met at a tea party one Mrs. Agnes\nM’Lehose, a married woman of about his own age, who, with her two\nchildren, had been deserted by an unworthy husband.  She had wit, could\nuse her pen, and had read _Werther_ with attention.  Sociable, and even\nsomewhat frisky, there was a good, sound, human kernel in the woman; a\nwarmth of love, strong dogmatic religious feeling, and a considerable,\nbut not authoritative, sense of the proprieties.  Of what biographers\nrefer to daintily as “her somewhat voluptuous style of beauty,” judging\nfrom the silhouette in Mr. Scott Douglas’s invaluable edition, the reader\nwill be fastidious if he does not approve.  Take her for all in all, I\nbelieve she was the best woman Burns encountered.  The pair took a fancy\nfor each other on the spot; Mrs. M’Lehose, in her turn, invited him to\ntea; but the poet, in his character of the Old Hawk, preferred a\n_tête-à-tête_, excused himself at the last moment, and offered a visit\ninstead.  An accident confined him to his room for nearly a month, and\nthis led to the famous Clarinda and Sylvander correspondence.  It was\nbegun in simple sport; they are already at their fifth or sixth exchange,\nwhen Clarinda writes: “It is really curious so much _fun_ passing between\ntwo persons who saw each other only _once_;” but it is hardly safe for a\nman and woman in the flower of their years to write almost daily, and\nsometimes in terms too ambiguous, sometimes in terms too plain, and\ngenerally in terms too warm, for mere acquaintance.  The exercise\npartakes a little of the nature of battering, and danger may be\napprehended when next they meet.  It is difficult to give any account of\nthis remarkable correspondence; it is too far away from us, and perhaps,\nnot yet far enough, in point of time and manner; the imagination is\nbaffled by these stilted literary utterances, warming, in bravura\npassages, into downright truculent nonsense.  Clarinda has one famous\nsentence in which she bids Sylvander connect the thought of his mistress\nwith the changing phases of the year; it was enthusiastically admired by\nthe swain, but on the modern mind produces mild amazement and alarm.\n“Oh, Clarinda,” writes Burns, “shall we not meet in a state—some yet\nunknown state—of being, where the lavish hand of Plenty shall minister to\nthe highest wish of Benevolence, and where the chill north wind of\nPrudence shall never blow over the flowery field of Enjoyment?”  The\ndesign may be that of an Old Hawk, but the style is more suggestive of a\nBird of Paradise.  It is sometimes hard to fancy they are not gravely\nmaking fun of each other as they write.  Religion, poetry, love, and\ncharming sensibility, are the current topics.  “I am delighted, charming\nClarinda, with your honest enthusiasm for religion,” writes Burns; and\nthe pair entertained a fiction that this was their “favourite subject.”\n“This is Sunday,” writes the lady, “and not a word on our favourite\nsubject.  O fy ‘divine Clarinda!’”  I suspect, although quite\nunconsciously on the part of the lady, who was bent on his redemption,\nthey but used the favourite subject as a stalking-horse.  In the\nmeantime, the sportive acquaintance was ripening steadily into a genuine\npassion.  Visits took place, and then became frequent.  Clarinda’s\nfriends were hurt and suspicious; her clergyman interfered; she herself\nhad smart attacks of conscience, but her heart had gone from her control;\nit was altogether his, and she “counted all things but loss—heaven\nexcepted—that she might win and keep him.”  Burns himself was transported\nwhile in her neighbourhood, but his transports somewhat rapidly declined\nduring an absence.  I am tempted to imagine that, womanlike, he took on\nthe colour of his mistress’s feeling; that he could not but heat himself\nat the fire of her unaffected passion; but that, like one who should\nleave the hearth upon a winter’s night, his temperature soon fell when he\nwas out of sight, and in a word, though he could share the symptoms, that\nhe had never shared the disease.  At the same time, amid the fustian of\nthe letters there are forcible and true expressions, and the love verses\nthat he wrote upon Clarinda are among the most moving in the language.\n\nWe are approaching the solution.  In mid-winter, Jean, once more in the\nfamily way, was turned out of doors by her family; and Burns had her\nreceived and cared for in the house of a friend.  For he remained to the\nlast imperfect in his character of Don Juan, and lacked the sinister\ncourage to desert his victim.  About the middle of February (1788), he\nhad to tear himself from his Clarinda and make a journey into the\nsouth-west on business.  Clarinda gave him two shirts for his little son.\nThey were daily to meet in prayer at an appointed hour.  Burns, too late\nfor the post at Glasgow, sent her a letter by parcel that she might not\nhave to wait.  Clarinda on her part writes, this time with a beautiful\nsimplicity: “I think the streets look deserted-like since Monday; and\nthere’s a certain insipidity in good kind folks I once enjoyed not a\nlittle.  Miss Wardrobe supped here on Monday.  She once named you, which\nkept me from falling asleep.  I drank your health in a glass of ale—as\nthe lasses do at Hallowe’en—‘in to mysel’.’”  Arrived at Mauchline, Burns\ninstalled Jean Armour in a lodging, and prevailed on Mrs. Armour to\npromise her help and countenance in the approaching confinement.  This\nwas kind at least; but hear his expressions: “I have taken her a room; I\nhave taken her to my arms; I have given her a mahogany bed; I have given\nher a guinea. . . . I swore her privately and solemnly never to attempt\nany claim on me as a husband, even though anybody should persuade her she\nhad such a claim—which she has not, neither during my life nor after my\ndeath.  She did all this like a good girl.”  And then he took advantage\nof the situation.  To Clarinda he wrote: “I this morning called for a\ncertain woman.  I am disgusted with her; I cannot endure her;” and he\naccused her of “tasteless insipidity, vulgarity of soul, and mercenary\nfawning.”  This was already in March; by the thirteenth of that month he\nwas back in Edinburgh.  On the 17th, he wrote to Clarinda: “Your hopes,\nyour fears, your cares, my love, are mine; so don’t mind them.  I will\ntake you in my hand through the dreary wilds of this world, and scare\naway the ravening bird or beast that would annoy you.”  Again, on the\n21st: “Will you open, with satisfaction and delight, a letter from a man\nwho loves you, who has loved you, and who will love you, to death,\nthrough death, and for ever. . . . How rich am I to have such a treasure\nas you! . . . ‘The Lord God knoweth,’ and, perhaps, ‘Israel he shall\nknow,’ my love and your merit.  Adieu, Clarinda!  I am going to remember\nyou in my prayers.”  By the 7th of April, seventeen days later he had\nalready decided to make Jean Armour publicly his wife.\n\nA more astonishing stage-trick is not to be found.  And yet his conduct\nis seen, upon a nearer examination, to be grounded both in reason and in\nkindness.  He was now about to embark on a solid worldly career; he had\ntaken a farm; the affair with Clarinda, however gratifying to his heart,\nwas too contingent to offer any great consolation to a man like Burns, to\nwhom marriage must have seemed the very dawn of hope and self-respect.\nThis is to regard the question from its lowest aspect; but there is no\ndoubt that he entered on this new period of his life with a sincere\ndetermination to do right.  He had just helped his brother with a loan of\na hundred and eighty pounds; should he do nothing for the poor girl whom\nhe had ruined?  It was true he could not do as he did without brutally\nwounding Clarinda; that was the punishment of his bygone fault; he was,\nas he truly says, “damned with a choice only of different species of\nerror and misconduct.”  To be professional Don Juan, to accept the\nprovocation of any lively lass upon the village green, may thus lead a\nman through a series of detestable words and actions, and land him at\nlast in an undesired and most unsuitable union for life.  If he had been\nstrong enough to refrain or bad enough to persevere in evil; if he had\nonly not been Don Juan at all, or been Don Juan altogether, there had\nbeen some possible road for him throughout this troublesome world; but a\nman, alas! who is equally at the call of his worse and better instincts,\nstands among changing events without foundation or resource. {71}\n\n\n\nDOWNWARD COURSE.\n\n\nIt may be questionable whether any marriage could have tamed Burns; but\nit is at least certain that there was no hope for him in the marriage he\ncontracted.  He did right, but then he had done wrong before; it was, as\nI said, one of those relations in life which it seems equally wrong to\nbreak or to perpetuate.  He neither loved nor respected his wife.  “God\nknows,” he writes, “my choice was as random as blind man’s buff.”  He\nconsoles himself by the thought that he has acted kindly to her; that she\n“has the most sacred enthusiasm of attachment to him;” that she has a\ngood figure; that she has a “wood-note wild,” “her voice rising with ease\nto B natural,” no less.  The effect on the reader is one of unmingled\npity for both parties concerned.  This was not the wife who (in his own\nwords) could “enter into his favourite studies or relish his favourite\nauthors;” this was not even a wife, after the affair of the marriage\nlines, in whom a husband could joy to place his trust.  Let her manage a\nfarm with sense, let her voice rise to B natural all day long, she would\nstill be a peasant to her lettered lord, and an object of pity rather\nthan of equal affection.  She could now be faithful, she could now be\nforgiving, she could now be generous even to a pathetic and touching\ndegree; but coming from one who was unloved, and who had scarce shown\nherself worthy of the sentiment, these were all virtues thrown away,\nwhich could neither change her husband’s heart nor affect the inherent\ndestiny of their relation.  From the outset, it was a marriage that had\nno root in nature; and we find him, ere long, lyrically regretting\nHighland Mary, renewing correspondence with Clarinda in the warmest\nlanguage, on doubtful terms with Mrs. Riddel, and on terms unfortunately\nbeyond any question with Anne Park.\n\nAlas! this was not the only ill circumstance in his future.  He had been\nidle for some eighteen months, superintending his new edition, hanging on\nto settle with the publisher, travelling in the Highlands with Willie\nNichol, or philandering with Mrs. M’Lehose; and in this period the\nradical part of the man had suffered irremediable hurt.  He had lost his\nhabits of industry, and formed the habit of pleasure.  Apologetical\nbiographers assure us of the contrary; but from the first, he saw and\nrecognised the danger for himself; his mind, he writes, is “enervated to\nan alarming degree” by idleness and dissipation; and again, “my mind has\nbeen vitiated with idleness.”  It never fairly recovered.  To business he\ncould bring the required diligence and attention without difficulty; but\nhe was thenceforward incapable, except in rare instances, of that\nsuperior effort of concentration which is required for serious literary\nwork.  He may be said, indeed, to have worked no more, and only amused\nhimself with letters.  The man who had written a volume of masterpieces\nin six months, during the remainder of his life rarely found courage for\nany more sustained effort than a song.  And the nature of the songs is\nitself characteristic of these idle later years; for they are often as\npolished and elaborate as his earlier works were frank, and headlong, and\ncolloquial; and this sort of verbal elaboration in short flights is, for\na man of literary turn, simply the most agreeable of pastimes.  The\nchange in manner coincides exactly with the Edinburgh visit.  In 1786 he\nhad written the _Address to a Louse_, which may be taken as an extreme\ninstance of the first manner; and already, in 1787, we come upon the\nrosebud pieces to Miss Cruikshank, which are extreme examples of the\nsecond.  The change was, therefore, the direct and very natural\nconsequence of his great change in life; but it is not the less typical\nof his loss of moral courage that he should have given up all larger\nventures, nor the less melancholy that a man who first attacked\nliterature with a hand that seemed capable of moving mountains, should\nhave spent his later years in whittling cherry-stones.\n\nMeanwhile, the farm did not prosper; he had to join to it the salary of\nan exciseman; at last he had to give it up, and rely altogether on the\nlatter resource.  He was an active officer; and, though he sometimes\ntempered severity with mercy, we have local testimony oddly representing\nthe public feeling of the period, that, while “in everything else he was\na perfect gentleman, when he met with anything seizable he was no better\nthan any other gauger.”\n\nThere is but one manifestation of the man in these last years which need\ndelay us: and that was the sudden interest in politics which arose from\nhis sympathy with the great French Revolution.  His only political\nfeeling had been hitherto a sentimental Jacobitism, not more or less\nrespectable than that of Scott, Aytoun, and the rest of what George\nBorrow has nicknamed the “Charlie over the water” Scotchmen.  It was a\nsentiment almost entirely literary and picturesque in its origin, built\non ballads and the adventures of the Young Chevalier; and in Burns it is\nthe more excusable, because he lay out of the way of active politics in\nhis youth.  With the great French Revolution, something living,\npractical, and feasible appeared to him for the first time in this realm\nof human action.  The young ploughman who had desired so earnestly to\nrise, now reached out his sympathies to a whole nation animated with the\nsame desire.  Already in 1788 we find the old Jacobitism hand in hand\nwith the new popular doctrine, when, in a letter of indignation against\nthe zeal of a Whig clergyman, he writes: “I daresay the American Congress\nin 1776 will be allowed to be as able and as enlightened as the English\nConvention was in 1688; and that their posterity will celebrate the\ncentenary of their deliverance from us, as duly and sincerely as we do\nours from the oppressive measures of the wrong-headed house of Stuart.”\nAs time wore on, his sentiments grew more pronounced and even violent;\nbut there was a basis of sense and generous feeling to his hottest\nexcess.  What he asked was a fair chance for the individual in life; an\nopen road to success and distinction for all classes of men.  It was in\nthe same spirit that he had helped to found a public library in the\nparish where his farm was situated, and that he sang his fervent snatches\nagainst tyranny and tyrants.  Witness, were it alone, this verse:—\n\n    “Here’s freedom to him that wad read,\n    Here’s freedom to him that wad write;\n    There’s nane ever feared that the truth should be heard\n    But them wham the truth wad indite.”\n\nYet his enthusiasm for the cause was scarce guided by wisdom.  Many\nstories are preserved of the bitter and unwise words he used in country\ncoteries; how he proposed Washington’s health as an amendment to Pitt’s,\ngave as a toast “the last verse of the last chapter of Kings,” and\ncelebrated Dumouriez in a doggrel impromptu full of ridicule and hate.\nNow his sympathies would inspire him with _Scots_, _wha hae_; now involve\nhim in a drunken broil with a loyal officer, and consequent apologies and\nexplanations, hard to offer for a man of Burns’s stomach.  Nor was this\nthe front of his offending.  On February 27, 1792, he took part in the\ncapture of an armed smuggler, bought at the subsequent sale four\ncarronades, and despatched them with a letter to the French Assembly.\nLetter and guns were stopped at Dover by the English officials; there was\ntrouble for Burns with his superiors; he was reminded firmly, however\ndelicately, that, as a paid official, it was his duty to obey and to be\nsilent; and all the blood of this poor, proud, and falling man must have\nrushed to his head at the humiliation.  His letter to Mr. Erskine,\nsubsequently Earl of Mar, testifies, in its turgid, turbulent phrases, to\na perfect passion of alarmed self-respect and vanity.  He had been\nmuzzled, and muzzled, when all was said, by his paltry salary as an\nexciseman; alas! had he not a family to keep?  Already, he wrote, he\nlooked forward to some such judgment from a hackney scribbler as this:\n“Burns, notwithstanding the _fanfaronnade_ of independence to be found in\nhis works, and after having been held forth to view and to public\nestimation as a man of some genius, yet, quite destitute of resources\nwithin himself to support his borrowed dignity, he dwindled into a paltry\nexciseman, and shrunk out the rest of his insignificant existence in the\nmeanest of pursuits, and among the vilest of mankind.”  And then on he\ngoes, in a style of rhodomontade, but filled with living indignation, to\ndeclare his right to a political opinion, and his willingness to shed his\nblood for the political birthright of his sons.  Poor, perturbed spirit!\nhe was indeed exercised in vain; those who share and those who differ\nfrom his sentiments about the Revolution, alike understand and sympathise\nwith him in this painful strait; for poetry and human manhood are lasting\nlike the race, and politics, which are but a wrongful striving after\nright, pass and change from year to year and age to age.  The _Twa Dogs_\nhas already outlasted the constitution of Siéyès and the policy of the\nWhigs; and Burns is better known among English-speaking races than either\nPitt or Fox.\n\nMeanwhile, whether as a man, a husband, or a poet, his steps led\ndownward.  He knew, knew bitterly, that the best was out of him; he\nrefused to make another volume, for he felt that it would be a\ndisappointment; he grew petulantly alive to criticism, unless he was sure\nit reached him from a friend.  For his songs, he would take nothing; they\nwere all that he could do; the proposed Scotch play, the proposed series\nof Scotch tales in verse, all had gone to water; and in a fling of pain\nand disappointment, which is surely noble with the nobility of a viking,\nhe would rather stoop to borrow than to accept money for these last and\ninadequate efforts of his muse.  And this desperate abnegation rises at\ntimes near to the height of madness; as when he pretended that he had not\nwritten, but only found and published, his immortal _Auld Lang Syne_.  In\nthe same spirit he became more scrupulous as an artist; he was doing so\nlittle, he would fain do that little well; and about two months before\nhis death, he asked Thomson to send back all his manuscripts for revisal,\nsaying that he would rather write five songs to his taste than twice that\nnumber otherwise.  The battle of his life was lost; in forlorn efforts to\ndo well, in desperate submissions to evil, the last years flew by.  His\ntemper is dark and explosive, launching epigrams, quarrelling with his\nfriends, jealous of young puppy officers.  He tries to be a good father;\nhe boasts himself a libertine.  Sick, sad, and jaded, he can refuse no\noccasion of temporary pleasure, no opportunity to shine; and he who had\nonce refused the invitations of lords and ladies is now whistled to the\ninn by any curious stranger.  His death (July 21, 1796), in his\nthirty-seventh year, was indeed a kindly dispensation.  It is the fashion\nto say he died of drink; many a man has drunk more and yet lived with\nreputation, and reached a good age.  That drink and debauchery helped to\ndestroy his constitution, and were the means of his unconscious suicide,\nis doubtless true; but he had failed in life, had lost his power of work,\nand was already married to the poor, unworthy, patient Jean, before he\nhad shown his inclination to convivial nights, or at least before that\ninclination had become dangerous either to his health or his\nself-respect.  He had trifled with life, and must pay the penalty.  He\nhad chosen to be Don Juan, he had grasped at temporary pleasures, and\nsubstantial happiness and solid industry had passed him by.  He died of\nbeing Robert Burns, and there is no levity in such a statement of the\ncase; for shall we not, one and all, deserve a similar epitaph?\n\n\n\nWORKS.\n\n\nThe somewhat cruel necessity which has lain upon me throughout this paper\nonly to touch upon those points in the life of Burns where correction or\namplification seemed desirable, leaves me little opportunity to speak of\nthe works which have made his name so famous.  Yet, even here, a few\nobservations seem necessary.\n\nAt the time when the poet made his appearance and great first success,\nhis work was remarkable in two ways.  For, first, in an age when poetry\nhad become abstract and conventional, instead of continuing to deal with\nshepherds, thunderstorms, and personifications, he dealt with the actual\ncircumstances of his life, however matter-of-fact and sordid these might\nbe.  And, second, in a time when English versification was particularly\nstiff, lame, and feeble, and words were used with ultra-academical\ntimidity, he wrote verses that were easy, racy, graphic, and forcible,\nand used language with absolute tact and courage as it seemed most fit to\ngive a clear impression.  If you take even those English authors whom we\nknow Burns to have most admired and studied, you will see at once that he\nowed them nothing but a warning.  Take Shenstone, for instance, and watch\nthat elegant author as he tries to grapple with the facts of life.  He\nhas a description, I remember, of a gentleman engaged in sliding or\nwalking on thin ice, which is a little miracle of incompetence.  You see\nmy memory fails me, and I positively cannot recollect whether his hero\nwas sliding or walking; as though a writer should describe a skirmish,\nand the reader, at the end, be still uncertain whether it were a charge\nof cavalry or a slow and stubborn advance of foot.  There could be no\nsuch ambiguity in Burns; his work is at the opposite pole from such\nindefinite and stammering performances; and a whole lifetime passed in\nthe study of Shenstone would only lead a man further and further from\nwriting the _Address to a Louse_.  Yet Burns, like most great artists,\nproceeded from a school and continued a tradition; only the school and\ntradition were Scotch, and not English.  While the English language was\nbecoming daily more pedantic and inflexible, and English letters more\ncolourless and slack, there was another dialect in the sister country,\nand a different school of poetry tracing its descent, through King James\nI., from Chaucer.  The dialect alone accounts for much; for it was then\nwritten colloquially, which kept it fresh and supple; and, although not\nshaped for heroic flights, it was a direct and vivid medium for all that\nhad to do with social life.  Hence, whenever Scotch poets left their\nlaborious imitations of bad English verses, and fell back on their own\ndialect, their style would kindle, and they would write of their\nconvivial and somewhat gross existences with pith and point.  In Ramsay,\nand far more in the poor lad Fergusson, there was mettle, humour,\nliterary courage, and a power of saying what they wished to say\ndefinitely and brightly, which in the latter case should have justified\ngreat anticipations.  Had Burns died at the same age as Fergusson, he\nwould have left us literally nothing worth remark.  To Ramsay and to\nFergusson, then, he was indebted in a very uncommon degree, not only\nfollowing their tradition and using their measures, but directly and\navowedly imitating their pieces.  The same tendency to borrow a hint, to\nwork on some one else’s foundation, is notable in Burns from first to\nlast, in the period of song-writing as well as in that of the early\npoems; and strikes one oddly in a man of such deep originality, who left\nso strong a print on all he touched, and whose work is so greatly\ndistinguished by that character of “inevitability” which Wordsworth\ndenied to Goethe.\n\nWhen we remember Burns’s obligations to his predecessors, we must never\nforget his immense advances on them.  They had already “discovered”\nnature; but Burns discovered poetry—a higher and more intense way of\nthinking of the things that go to make up nature, a higher and more ideal\nkey of words in which to speak of them.  Ramsay and Fergusson excelled at\nmaking a popular—or shall we say vulgar?—sort of society verses, comical\nand prosaic, written, you would say, in taverns while a supper party\nwaited for its laureate’s word; but on the appearance of Burns, this\ncoarse and laughing literature was touched to finer issues, and learned\ngravity of thought and natural pathos.\n\nWhat he had gained from his predecessors was a direct, speaking style,\nand to walk on his own feet instead of on academical stilts.  There was\nnever a man of letters with more absolute command of his means; and we\nmay say of him, without excess, that his style was his slave.  Hence that\nenergy of epithet, so concise and telling, that a foreigner is tempted to\nexplain it by some special richness or aptitude in the dialect he wrote.\nHence that Homeric justice and completeness of description which gives us\nthe very physiognomy of nature, in body and detail, as nature is.  Hence,\ntoo, the unbroken literary quality of his best pieces, which keeps him\nfrom any slip into the weariful trade of word-painting, and presents\neverything, as everything should be presented by the art of words, in a\nclear, continuous medium of thought.  Principal Shairp, for instance,\ngives us a paraphrase of one tough verse of the original; and for those\nwho know the Greek poets only by paraphrase, this has the very quality\nthey are accustomed to look for and admire in Greek.  The contemporaries\nof Burns were surprised that he should visit so many celebrated mountains\nand waterfalls, and not seize the opportunity to make a poem.  Indeed, it\nis not for those who have a true command of the art of words, but for\npeddling, professional amateurs, that these pointed occasions are most\nuseful and inspiring.  As those who speak French imperfectly are glad to\ndwell on any topic they may have talked upon or heard others talk upon\nbefore, because they know appropriate words for it in French, so the\ndabbler in verse rejoices to behold a waterfall, because he has learned\nthe sentiment and knows appropriate words for it in poetry.  But the\ndialect of Burns was fitted to deal with any subject; and whether it was\na stormy night, a shepherd’s collie, a sheep struggling in the snow, the\nconduct of cowardly soldiers in the field, the gait and cogitations of a\ndrunken man, or only a village cockcrow in the morning, he could find\nlanguage to give it freshness, body, and relief.  He was always ready to\nborrow the hint of a design, as though he had a difficulty in\ncommencing—a difficulty, let us say, in choosing a subject out of a world\nwhich seemed all equally living and significant to him; but once he had\nthe subject chosen, he could cope with nature single-handed, and make\nevery stroke a triumph.  Again, his absolute mastery in his art enabled\nhim to express each and all of his different humours, and to pass\nsmoothly and congruously from one to another.  Many men invent a dialect\nfor only one side of their nature—perhaps their pathos or their humour,\nor the delicacy of their senses—and, for lack of a medium, leave all the\nothers unexpressed.  You meet such an one, and find him in conversation\nfull of thought, feeling, and experience, which he has lacked the art to\nemploy in his writings.  But Burns was not thus hampered in the practice\nof the literary art; he could throw the whole weight of his nature into\nhis work, and impregnate it from end to end.  If Doctor Johnson, that\nstilted and accomplished stylist, had lacked the sacred Boswell, what\nshould we have known of him? and how should we have delighted in his\nacquaintance as we do?  Those who spoke with Burns tell us how much we\nhave lost who did not.  But I think they exaggerate their privilege: I\nthink we have the whole Burns in our possession set forth in his\nconsummate verses.\n\nIt was by his style, and not by his matter, that he affected Wordsworth\nand the world.  There is, indeed, only one merit worth considering in a\nman of letters—that he should write well; and only one damning fault—that\nhe should write ill.  We are little the better for the reflections of the\nsailor’s parrot in the story.  And so, if Burns helped to change the\ncourse of literary history, it was by his frank, direct, and masterly\nutterance, and not by his homely choice of subjects.  That was imposed\nupon him, not chosen upon a principle.  He wrote from his own experience,\nbecause it was his nature so to do, and the tradition of the school from\nwhich he proceeded was fortunately not opposed to homely subjects.  But\nto these homely subjects he communicated the rich commentary of his\nnature; they were all steeped in Burns; and they interest us not in\nthemselves, but because they have been passed through the spirit of so\ngenuine and vigorous a man.  Such is the stamp of living literature; and\nthere was never any more alive than that of Burns.\n\nWhat a gust of sympathy there is in him sometimes flowing out in byways\nhitherto unused, upon mice, and flowers, and the devil himself; sometimes\nspeaking plainly between human hearts; sometimes ringing out in\nexultation like a peal of bells!  When we compare the _Farmer’s\nSalutation to his Auld Mare Maggie_, with the clever and inhumane\nproduction of half a century earlier, _The Auld Man’s Mare’s dead_, we\nsee in a nutshell the spirit of the change introduced by Burns.  And as\nto its manner, who that has read it can forget how the collie, Luath, in\nthe _Twa Dogs_, describes and enters into the merry-making in the\ncottage?\n\n    “The luntin’ pipe an’ sneeshin’ mill,\n    Are handed round wi’ richt guid will;\n    The canty auld folks crackin’ crouse,\n    The young anes rantin’ through the house—\n    My heart has been sae fain to see them\n    That I for joy hae barkit wi’ them.”\n\nIt was this ardent power of sympathy that was fatal to so many women,\nand, through Jean Armour, to himself at last.  His humour comes from him\nin a stream so deep and easy that I will venture to call him the best of\nhumorous poets.  He turns about in the midst to utter a noble sentiment\nor a trenchant remark on human life, and the style changes and rises to\nthe occasion.  I think it is Principal Shairp who says, happily, that\nBurns would have been no Scotchman if he had not loved to moralise;\nneither, may we add, would he have been his father’s son; but (what is\nworthy of note) his moralisings are to a large extent the moral of his\nown career.  He was among the least impersonal of artists.  Except in the\n_Jolly Beggars_, he shows no gleam of dramatic instinct.  Mr. Carlyle has\ncomplained that _Tam o’ Shanter_ is, from the absence of this quality,\nonly a picturesque and external piece of work; and I may add that in the\n_Twa Dogs_ it is precisely in the infringement of dramatic propriety that\na great deal of the humour of the speeches depends for its existence and\neffect.  Indeed, Burns was so full of his identity that it breaks forth\non every page; and there is scarce an appropriate remark either in praise\nor blame of his own conduct, but he has put it himself into verse.  Alas!\nfor the tenor of these remarks!  They are, indeed, his own pitiful\napology for such a marred existence and talents so misused and stunted;\nand they seem to prove for ever how small a part is played by reason in\nthe conduct of man’s affairs.  Here was one, at least, who with unfailing\njudgment predicted his own fate; yet his knowledge could not avail him,\nand with open eyes he must fulfil his tragic destiny.  Ten years before\nthe end he had written his epitaph; and neither subsequent events, nor\nthe critical eyes of posterity, have shown us a word in it to alter.\nAnd, lastly, has he not put in for himself the last unanswerable plea?—\n\n    “Then gently scan your brother man,\n       Still gentler sister woman;\n    Though they may gang a kennin wrang,\n       To step aside is human:\n    One point must still be greatly dark—”\n\nOne?  Alas!  I fear every man and woman of us is “greatly dark” to all\ntheir neighbours, from the day of birth until death removes them, in\ntheir greatest virtues as well as in their saddest faults; and we, who\nhave been trying to read the character of Burns, may take home the lesson\nand be gentle in our thoughts.\n\n\n\n\nWALT WHITMAN.\n\n\nOF late years the name of Walt Whitman has been a good deal bandied about\nin books and magazines.  It has become familiar both in good and ill\nrepute.  His works have been largely bespattered with praise by his\nadmirers, and cruelly mauled and mangled by irreverent enemies.  Now,\nwhether his poetry is good or bad as poetry, is a matter that may admit\nof a difference of opinion without alienating those who differ.  We could\nnot keep the peace with a man who should put forward claims to taste and\nyet depreciate the choruses in _Samson Agonistes_; but, I think, we may\nshake hands with one who sees no more in Walt Whitman’s volume, from a\nliterary point of view, than a farrago of incompetent essays in a wrong\ndirection.  That may not be at all our own opinion.  We may think that,\nwhen a work contains many unforgettable phrases, it cannot be altogether\ndevoid of literary merit.  We may even see passages of a high poetry here\nand there among its eccentric contents.  But when all is said, Walt\nWhitman is neither a Milton nor a Shakespeare; to appreciate his works is\nnot a condition necessary to salvation; and I would not disinherit a son\nupon the question, nor even think much the worse of a critic, for I\nshould always have an idea what he meant.\n\nWhat Whitman has to say is another affair from how he says it.  It is not\npossible to acquit any one of defective intelligence, or else stiff\nprejudice, who is not interested by Whitman’s matter and the spirit it\nrepresents.  Not as a poet, but as what we must call (for lack of a more\nexact expression) a prophet, he occupies a curious and prominent\nposition.  Whether he may greatly influence the future or not, he is a\nnotable symptom of the present.  As a sign of the times, it would be hard\nto find his parallel.  I should hazard a large wager, for instance, that\nhe was not unacquainted with the works of Herbert Spencer; and yet where,\nin all the history books, shall we lay our hands on two more incongruous\ncontemporaries?  Mr. Spencer so decorous—I had almost said, so dandy—in\ndissent; and Whitman, like a large shaggy dog, just unchained, scouring\nthe beaches of the world and baying at the moon.  And when was an echo\nmore curiously like a satire, than when Mr. Spencer found his Synthetic\nPhilosophy reverberated from the other shores of the Atlantic in the\n“barbaric yawp” of Whitman?\n\n\n\nI.\n\n\nWhitman, it cannot be too soon explained, writes up to a system.  He was\na theoriser about society before he was a poet.  He first perceived\nsomething wanting, and then sat down squarely to supply the want.  The\nreader, running over his works, will find that he takes nearly as much\npleasure in critically expounding his theory of poetry as in making\npoems.  This is as far as it can be from the case of the spontaneous\nvillage minstrel dear to elegy, who has no theory whatever, although\nsometimes he may have fully as much poetry as Whitman.  The whole of\nWhitman’s work is deliberate and preconceived.  A man born into a society\ncomparatively new, full of conflicting elements and interests, could not\nfail, if he had any thoughts at all, to reflect upon the tendencies\naround him.  He saw much good and evil on all sides, not yet settled down\ninto some more or less unjust compromise as in older nations, but still\nin the act of settlement.  And he could not but wonder what it would turn\nout; whether the compromise would be very just or very much the reverse,\nand give great or little scope for healthy human energies.  From idle\nwonder to active speculation is but a step; and he seems to have been\nearly struck with the inefficacy of literature and its extreme\nunsuitability to the conditions.  What he calls “Feudal Literature” could\nhave little living action on the tumult of American democracy; what he\ncalls the “Literature of Wo,” meaning the whole tribe of Werther and\nByron, could have no action for good in any time or place.  Both\npropositions, if art had none but a direct moral influence, would be true\nenough; and as this seems to be Whitman’s view, they were true enough for\nhim.  He conceived the idea of a Literature which was to inhere in the\nlife of the present; which was to be, first, human, and next, American;\nwhich was to be brave and cheerful as per contract; to give culture in a\npopular and poetical presentment; and, in so doing, catch and stereotype\nsome democratic ideal of humanity which should be equally natural to all\ngrades of wealth and education, and suited, in one of his favourite\nphrases, to “the average man.”  To the formation of some such literature\nas this his poems are to be regarded as so many contributions, one\nsometimes explaining, sometimes superseding, the other: and the whole\ntogether not so much a finished work as a body of suggestive hints.  He\ndoes not profess to have built the castle, but he pretends he has traced\nthe lines of the foundation.  He has not made the poetry, but he flatters\nhimself he has done something towards making the poets.\n\nHis notion of the poetic function is ambitious, and coincides roughly\nwith what Schopenhauer has laid down as the province of the\nmetaphysician.  The poet is to gather together for men, and set in order,\nthe materials of their existence.  He is “The Answerer;” he is to find\nsome way of speaking about life that shall satisfy, if only for the\nmoment, man’s enduring astonishment at his own position.  And besides\nhaving an answer ready, it is he who shall provoke the question.  He must\nshake people out of their indifference, and force them to make some\nelection in this world, instead of sliding dully forward in a dream.\nLife is a business we are all apt to mismanage; either living recklessly\nfrom day to day, or suffering ourselves to be gulled out of our moments\nby the inanities of custom.  We should despise a man who gave as little\nactivity and forethought to the conduct of any other business.  But in\nthis, which is the one thing of all others, since it contains them all,\nwe cannot see the forest for the trees.  One brief impression obliterates\nanother.  There is something stupefying in the recurrence of unimportant\nthings.  And it is only on rare provocations that we can rise to take an\noutlook beyond daily concerns, and comprehend the narrow limits and great\npossibilities of our existence.  It is the duty of the poet to induce\nsuch moments of clear sight.  He is the declared enemy of all living by\nreflex action, of all that is done betwixt sleep and waking, of all the\npleasureless pleasurings and imaginary duties in which we coin away our\nhearts and fritter invaluable years.  He has to electrify his readers\ninto an instant unflagging activity, founded on a wide and eager\nobservation of the world, and make them direct their ways by a superior\nprudence, which has little or nothing in common with the maxims of the\ncopy-book.  That many of us lead such lives as they would heartily disown\nafter two hours’ serious reflection on the subject is, I am afraid, a\ntrue, and, I am sure, a very galling thought.  The Enchanted Ground of\ndead-alive respectability is next, upon the map, to the Beulah of\nconsiderate virtue.  But there they all slumber and take their rest in\nthe middle of God’s beautiful and wonderful universe; the drowsy heads\nhave nodded together in the same position since first their fathers fell\nasleep; and not even the sound of the last trumpet can wake them to a\nsingle active thought.\n\nThe poet has a hard task before him to stir up such fellows to a sense of\ntheir own and other people’s principles in life.\n\nAnd it happens that literature is, in some ways, but an indifferent means\nto such an end.  Language is but a poor bull’s-eye lantern wherewith to\nshow off the vast cathedral of the world; and yet a particular thing once\nsaid in words is so definite and memorable, that it makes us forget the\nabsence of the many which remain unexpressed; like a bright window in a\ndistant view, which dazzles and confuses our sight of its surroundings.\nThere are not words enough in all Shakespeare to express the merest\nfraction of a man’s experience in an hour.  The speed of the eyesight and\nthe hearing, and the continual industry of the mind, produce, in ten\nminutes, what it would require a laborious volume to shadow forth by\ncomparisons and roundabout approaches.  If verbal logic were sufficient,\nlife would be as plain sailing as a piece of Euclid.  But, as a matter of\nfact, we make a travesty of the simplest process of thought when we put\nit into words for the words are all coloured and forsworn, apply\ninaccurately, and bring with them, from former uses ideas of praise and\nblame that have nothing to do with the question in hand.  So we must\nalways see to it nearly, that we judge by the realities of life and not\nby the partial terms that represent them in man’s speech; and at times of\nchoice, we must leave words upon one side, and act upon those brute\nconvictions, unexpressed and perhaps inexpressible, which cannot be\nflourished in an argument, but which are truly the sum and fruit of our\nexperience.  Words are for communication, not for judgment.  This is what\nevery thoughtful man knows for himself, for only fools and silly\nschoolmasters push definitions over far into the domain of conduct; and\nthe majority of women, not learned in these scholastic refinements, live\nall-of-a-piece and unconsciously, as a tree grows, without caring to put\na name upon their acts or motives.  Hence, a new difficulty for Whitman’s\nscrupulous and argumentative poet; he must do more than waken up the\nsleepers to his words; he must persuade them to look over the book and at\nlife with their own eyes.\n\nThis side of truth is very present to Whitman; it is this that he means\nwhen he tells us that “To glance with an eye confounds the learning of\nall times.”  But he is not unready.  He is never weary of descanting on\nthe undebatable conviction that is forced upon our minds by the presence\nof other men, of animals, or of inanimate things.  To glance with an eye,\nwere it only at a chair or a park railing, is by far a more persuasive\nprocess, and brings us to a far more exact conclusion, than to read the\nworks of all the logicians extant.  If both, by a large allowance, may be\nsaid to end in certainty, the certainty in the one case transcends the\nother to an incalculable degree.  If people see a lion, they run away; if\nthey only apprehend a deduction, they keep wandering around in an\nexperimental humour.  Now, how is the poet to convince like nature, and\nnot like books?  Is there no actual piece of nature that he can show the\nman to his face, as he might show him a tree if they were walking\ntogether?  Yes, there is one: the man’s own thoughts.  In fact, if the\npoet is to speak efficaciously, he must say what is already in his\nhearer’s mind.  That, alone, the hearer will believe; that, alone, he\nwill be able to apply intelligently to the facts of life.  Any\nconviction, even if it be a whole system or a whole religion, must pass\ninto the condition of commonplace, or postulate, before it becomes fully\noperative.  Strange excursions and high-flying theories may interest, but\nthey cannot rule behaviour.  Our faith is not the highest truth that we\nperceive, but the highest that we have been able to assimilate into the\nvery texture and method of our thinking.  It is not, therefore, by\nflashing before a man’s eyes the weapons of dialectic; it is not by\ninduction, deduction, or construction; it is not by forcing him on from\none stage of reasoning to another, that the man will be effectually\nrenewed.  He cannot be made to believe anything; but he can be made to\nsee that he has always believed it.  And this is the practical canon.  It\nis when the reader cries, “Oh, I know!” and is, perhaps, half irritated\nto see how nearly the author has forestalled his own thoughts, that he is\non the way to what is called in theology a Saving Faith.\n\nHere we have the key to Whitman’s attitude.  To give a certain unity of\nideal to the average population of America—to gather their activities\nabout some conception of humanity that shall be central and normal, if\nonly for the moment—the poet must portray that population as it is.  Like\nhuman law, human poetry is simply declaratory.  If any ideal is possible,\nit must be already in the thoughts of the people; and, by the same\nreason, in the thoughts of the poet, who is one of them.  And hence\nWhitman’s own formula: “The poet is individual—he is complete in himself:\nthe others are as good as he; only he sees it, and they do not.”  To show\nthem how good they are, the poet must study his fellow-countrymen and\nhimself somewhat like a traveller on the hunt for his book of travels.\nThere is a sense, of course, in which all true books are books of travel;\nand all genuine poets must run their risk of being charged with the\ntraveller’s exaggeration; for to whom are such books more surprising than\nto those whose own life is faithfully and smartly pictured?  But this\ndanger is all upon one side; and you may judiciously flatter the portrait\nwithout any likelihood of the sitter’s disowning it for a faithful\nlikeness.  And so Whitman has reasoned: that by drawing at first hand\nfrom himself and his neighbours, accepting without shame the\ninconsistencies and brutalities that go to make up man, and yet treating\nthe whole in a high, magnanimous spirit, he would make sure of belief,\nand at the same time encourage people forward by the means of praise.\n\n\n\nII.\n\n\nWe are accustomed nowadays to a great deal of puling over the\ncircumstances in which we are placed.  The great refinement of many\npoetical gentlemen has rendered them practically unfit for the jostling\nand ugliness of life, and they record their unfitness at considerable\nlength.  The bold and awful poetry of Job’s complaint produces too many\nflimsy imitators; for there is always something consolatory in grandeur,\nbut the symphony transposed for the piano becomes hysterically sad.  This\nliterature of woe, as Whitman calls it, this _Maladie de René_, as we\nlike to call it in Europe, is in many ways a most humiliating and sickly\nphenomenon.  Young gentlemen with three or four hundred a year of private\nmeans look down from a pinnacle of doleful experience on all the grown\nand hearty men who have dared to say a good word for life since the\nbeginning of the world.  There is no prophet but the melancholy Jacques,\nand the blue devils dance on all our literary wires.\n\nIt would be a poor service to spread culture, if this be its result,\namong the comparatively innocent and cheerful ranks of men.  When our\nlittle poets have to be sent to look at the ploughman and learn wisdom,\nwe must be careful how we tamper with our ploughmen.  Where a man in not\nthe best of circumstances preserves composure of mind, and relishes ale\nand tobacco, and his wife and children, in the intervals of dull and\nunremunerative labour; where a man in this predicament can afford a\nlesson by the way to what are called his intellectual superiors, there is\nplainly something to be lost, as well as something to be gained, by\nteaching him to think differently.  It is better to leave him as he is\nthan to teach him whining.  It is better that he should go without the\ncheerful lights of culture, if cheerless doubt and paralysing\nsentimentalism are to be the consequence.  Let us, by all means, fight\nagainst that hide-bound stolidity of sensation and sluggishness of mind\nwhich blurs and decolorises for poor natures the wonderful pageant of\nconsciousness; let us teach people, as much as we can, to enjoy, and they\nwill learn for themselves to sympathise; but let us see to it, above all,\nthat we give these lessons in a brave, vivacious note, and build the man\nup in courage while we demolish its substitute, indifference.\n\nWhitman is alive to all this.  He sees that, if the poet is to be of any\nhelp, he must testify to the livableness of life.  His poems, he tells\nus, are to be “hymns of the praise of things.”  They are to make for a\ncertain high joy in living, or what he calls himself “a brave delight fit\nfor freedom’s athletes.”  And he has had no difficulty in introducing his\noptimism: it fitted readily enough with his system; for the average man\nis truly a courageous person and truly fond of living.  One of Whitman’s\nremarks upon this head is worth quotation, as he is there perfectly\nsuccessful, and does precisely what he designs to do throughout: Takes\nordinary and even commonplace circumstances; throws them out, by a happy\nturn of thinking, into significance and something like beauty; and tacks\na hopeful moral lesson to the end.\n\n    “The passionate tenacity of hunters, woodmen, early risers,\n    cultivators of gardens and orchards and fields, he says, the love of\n    healthy women for the manly form, seafaring persons, drivers of\n    horses, the passion for light and the open air,—all is an old\n    unvaried sign of the unfailing perception of beauty, and of a\n    residence of the poetic in outdoor people.”\n\nThere seems to me something truly original in this choice of trite\nexamples.  You will remark how adroitly Whitman begins, hunters and\nwoodmen being confessedly romantic.  And one thing more.  If he had said\n“the love of healthy men for the female form,” he would have said almost\na silliness; for the thing has never been dissembled out of delicacy, and\nis so obvious as to be a public nuisance.  But by reversing it, he tells\nus something not unlike news; something that sounds quite freshly in\nwords; and, if the reader be a man, gives him a moment of great\nself-satisfaction and spiritual aggrandisement.  In many different\nauthors you may find passages more remarkable for grammar, but few of a\nmore ingenious turn, and none that could be more to the point in our\nconnection.  The tenacity of many ordinary people in ordinary pursuits is\na sort of standing challenge to everybody else.  If one man can grow\nabsorbed in delving his garden, others may grow absorbed and happy over\nsomething else.  Not to be upsides in this with any groom or gardener, is\nto be very meanly organised.  A man should be ashamed to take his food if\nhe has not alchemy enough in his stomach to turn some of it into intense\nand enjoyable occupation.\n\nWhitman tries to reinforce this cheerfulness by keeping up a sort of\noutdoor atmosphere of sentiment.  His book, he tells us, should be read\n“among the cooling influences of external nature;” and this\nrecommendation, like that other famous one which Hawthorne prefixed to\nhis collected tales, is in itself a character of the work.  Every one who\nhas been upon a walking or a boating tour, living in the open air, with\nthe body in constant exercise and the mind in fallow, knows true ease and\nquiet.  The irritating action of the brain is set at rest; we think in a\nplain, unfeverish temper; little things seem big enough, and great things\nno longer portentous; and the world is smilingly accepted as it is.  This\nis the spirit that Whitman inculcates and parades.  He thinks very ill of\nthe atmosphere of parlours or libraries.  Wisdom keeps school outdoors.\nAnd he has the art to recommend this attitude of mind by simply pluming\nhimself upon it as a virtue; so that the reader, to keep the advantage\nover his author which most readers enjoy, is tricked into professing the\nsame view.  And this spirit, as it is his chief lesson, is the greatest\ncharm of his work.  Thence, in spite of an uneven and emphatic key of\nexpression, something trenchant and straightforward, something simple and\nsurprising, distinguishes his poems.  He has sayings that come home to\none like the Bible.  We fall upon Whitman, after the works of so many men\nwho write better, with a sense of relief from strain, with a sense of\ntouching nature, as when one passes out of the flaring, noisy\nthoroughfares of a great city into what he himself has called, with\nunexcelled imaginative justice of language, “the huge and thoughtful\nnight.”  And his book in consequence, whatever may be the final judgment\nof its merit, whatever may be its influence on the future, should be in\nthe hands of all parents and guardians as a specific for the distressing\nmalady of being seventeen years old.  Green-sickness yields to his\ntreatment as to a charm of magic; and the youth, after a short course of\nreading, ceases to carry the universe upon his shoulders.\n\n\n\nIII.\n\n\nWhitman is not one of those who can be deceived by familiarity.  He\nconsiders it just as wonderful that there are myriads of stars, as that\none man should rise from the dead.  He declares “a hair on the back of\nhis hand just as curious as any special revelation.”  His whole life is\nto him what it was to Sir Thomas Browne, one perpetual miracle.\nEverything is strange, everything unaccountable, everything beautiful;\nfrom a bug to the moon, from the sight of the eyes to the appetite for\nfood.  He makes it his business to see things as if he saw them for the\nfirst time, and professes astonishment on principle.  But he has no\nleaning towards mythology; avows his contempt for what he calls\n“unregenerate poetry;” and does not mean by nature\n\n    “The smooth walks, trimmed hedges, butterflies, posies, and\n    nightingales of the English poets, but the whole orb, with its\n    geologic history, the Kosmos, carrying fire and snow, that rolls\n    through the illimitable areas, light as a feather though weighing\n    billions of tons.”\n\nNor is this exhaustive; for in his character of idealist all impressions,\nall thoughts, trees and people, love and faith, astronomy, history, and\nreligion, enter upon equal terms into his notion of the universe.  He is\nnot against religion; not, indeed, against any religion.  He wishes to\ndrag with a larger net, to make a more comprehensive synthesis, than any\nor than all of them put together.  In feeling after the central type of\nman, he must embrace all eccentricities; his cosmology must subsume all\ncosmologies, and the feelings that gave birth to them; his statement of\nfacts must include all religion and all irreligion, Christ and Boodha,\nGod and the devil.  The world as it is, and the whole world as it is,\nphysical, and spiritual, and historical, with its good and bad, with its\nmanifold inconsistencies, is what he wishes to set forth, in strong,\npicturesque, and popular lineaments, for the understanding of the average\nman.  One of his favourite endeavours is to get the whole matter into a\nnutshell; to knock the four corners of the universe, one after another,\nabout his readers’ ears; to hurry him, in breathless phrases, hither and\nthither, back and forward, in time and space; to focus all this about his\nown momentary personality; and then, drawing the ground from under his\nfeet, as if by some cataclysm of nature, to plunge him into the\nunfathomable abyss sown with enormous suns and systems, and among the\ninconceivable numbers and magnitudes and velocities of the heavenly\nbodies.  So that he concludes by striking into us some sense of that\ndisproportion of things which Shelley has illuminated by the ironical\nflash of these eight words: The desire of the moth for the star.\n\nThe same truth, but to what a different purpose!  Whitman’s moth is\nmightily at his ease about all the planets in heaven, and cannot think\ntoo highly of our sublunary tapers.  The universe is so large that\nimagination flags in the effort to conceive it; but here, in the\nmeantime, is the world under our feet, a very warm and habitable corner.\n“The earth, that is sufficient; I do not want the constellations any\nnearer,” he remarks.  And again: “Let your soul stand cool and composed,”\nsays he, “before a million universes.”  It is the language of a\ntranscendental common sense, such as Thoreau held and sometimes uttered.\nBut Whitman, who has a somewhat vulgar inclination for technical talk and\nthe jargon of philosophy, is not content with a few pregnant hints; he\nmust put the dots upon his i’s; he must corroborate the songs of Apollo\nby some of the darkest talk of human metaphysic.  He tells his disciples\nthat they must be ready “to confront the growing arrogance of Realism.”\nEach person is, for himself, the keystone and the occasion of this\nuniversal edifice.  “Nothing, not God,” he says, “is greater to one than\noneself is;” a statement with an irreligious smack at the first sight;\nbut like most startling sayings, a manifest truism on a second.  He will\ngive effect to his own character without apology; he sees “that the\nelementary laws never apologise.”  “I reckon,” he adds, with quaint\ncolloquial arrogance, “I reckon I behave no prouder than the level I\nplant my house by, after all.”  The level follows the law of its being;\nso, unrelentingly, will he; everything, every person, is good in his own\nplace and way; God is the maker of all and all are in one design.  For he\nbelieves in God, and that with a sort of blasphemous security.  “No array\nof terms,” quoth he, “no array of terms can say how much at peace I am\nabout God and about death.”  There certainly never was a prophet who\ncarried things with a higher hand; he gives us less a body of dogmas than\na series of proclamations by the grace of God; and language, you will\nobserve, positively fails him to express how far he stands above the\nhighest human doubts and trepidations.\n\nBut next in order of truths to a person’s sublime conviction of himself,\ncomes the attraction of one person for another, and all that we mean by\nthe word love:—\n\n    “The dear love of man for his comrade—the attraction of friend for\n    friend,\n    Of the well-married husband and wife, of children and parents,\n    Of city for city and land for land.”\n\nThe solitude of the most sublime idealist is broken in upon by other\npeople’s faces; he sees a look in their eyes that corresponds to\nsomething in his own heart; there comes a tone in their voices which\nconvicts him of a startling weakness for his fellow-creatures.  While he\nis hymning the _ego_ and commercing with God and the universe, a woman\ngoes below his window; and at the turn of her skirt, or the colour of her\neyes, Icarus is recalled from heaven by the run.  Love is so startlingly\nreal that it takes rank upon an equal footing of reality with the\nconsciousness of personal existence.  We are as heartily persuaded of the\nidentity of those we love as of our own identity.  And so sympathy pairs\nwith self-assertion, the two gerents of human life on earth; and\nWhitman’s ideal man must not only be strong, free, and self-reliant in\nhimself, but his freedom must be bounded and his strength perfected by\nthe most intimate, eager, and long-suffering love for others.  To some\nextent this is taking away with the left hand what has been so generously\ngiven with the right.  Morality has been ceremoniously extruded from the\ndoor only to be brought in again by the window.  We are told, on one\npage, to do as we please; and on the next we are sharply upbraided for\nnot having done as the author pleases.  We are first assured that we are\nthe finest fellows in the world in our own right; and then it appears\nthat we are only fine fellows in so far as we practise a most quixotic\ncode of morals.  The disciple who saw himself in clear ether a moment\nbefore is plunged down again among the fogs and complications of duty.\nAnd this is all the more overwhelming because Whitman insists not only on\nlove between sex and sex, and between friends of the same sex, but in the\nfield of the less intense political sympathies; and his ideal man must\nnot only be a generous friend but a conscientious voter into the bargain.\n\nHis method somewhat lessens the difficulty.  He is not, the reader will\nremember, to tell us how good we ought to be, but to remind us how good\nwe are.  He is to encourage us to be free and kind, by proving that we\nare free and kind already.  He passes our corporate life under review, to\nshow that it is upheld by the very virtues of which he makes himself the\nadvocate.  “There is no object so soft,” he says somewhere in his big,\nplain way, “there is no object so soft but it makes a hub for the wheel’d\nuniverse.”  Rightly understood, it is on the softest of all objects, the\nsympathetic heart, that the wheel of society turns easily and securely as\non a perfect axle.  There is no room, of course, for doubt or discussion,\nabout conduct, where every one is to follow the law of his being with\nexact compliance.  Whitman hates doubt, deprecates discussion, and\ndiscourages to his utmost the craving, carping sensibilities of the\nconscience.  We are to imitate, to use one of his absurd and happy\nphrases, “the satisfaction and aplomb of animals.”  If he preaches a sort\nof ranting Christianity in morals, a fit consequent to the ranting\noptimism of his cosmology, it is because he declares it to be the\noriginal deliverance of the human heart; or at least, for he would be\nhonestly historical in method, of the human heart as at present\nChristianised.  His is a morality without a prohibition; his policy is\none of encouragement all round.  A man must be a born hero to come up to\nWhitman’s standard in the practice of any of the positive virtues; but of\na negative virtue, such as temperance or chastity, he has so little to\nsay, that the reader need not be surprised if he drops a word or two upon\nthe other side.  He would lay down nothing that would be a clog; he would\nprescribe nothing that cannot be done ruddily, in a heat.  The great\npoint is to get people under way.  To the faithful Whitmanite this would\nbe justified by the belief that God made all, and that all was good; the\nprophet, in this doctrine, has only to cry “Tally-ho,” and mankind will\nbreak into a gallop on the road to El Dorado.  Perhaps, to another class\nof minds, it may look like the result of the somewhat cynical reflection\nthat you will not make a kind man out of one who is unkind by any\nprecepts under heaven; tempered by the belief that, in natural\ncircumstances, the large majority is well disposed.  Thence it would\nfollow, that if you can only get every one to feel more warmly and act\nmore courageously, the balance of results will be for good.\n\nSo far, you see, the doctrine is pretty coherent as a doctrine; as a\npicture of man’s life it is incomplete and misleading, although eminently\ncheerful.  This he is himself the first to acknowledge; for if he is\nprophetic in anything, it is in his noble disregard of consistency.  “Do\nI contradict myself?” he asks somewhere; and then pat comes the answer,\nthe best answer ever given in print, worthy of a sage, or rather of a\nwoman: “Very well, then, I contradict myself!” with this addition, not so\nfeminine and perhaps not altogether so satisfactory: “I am large—I\ncontain multitudes.”  Life, as a matter of fact, partakes largely of the\nnature of tragedy.  The gospel according to Whitman, even if it be not so\nlogical, has this advantage over the gospel according to Pangloss, that\nit does not utterly disregard the existence of temporal evil.  Whitman\naccepts the fact of disease and wretchedness like an honest man; and\ninstead of trying to qualify it in the interest of his optimism, sets\nhimself to spur people up to be helpful.  He expresses a conviction,\nindeed, that all will be made up to the victims in the end; that “what is\nuntried and afterward” will fail no one, not even “the old man who has\nlived without purpose and feels it with bitterness worse than gall.”  But\nthis is not to palliate our sense of what is hard or melancholy in the\npresent.  Pangloss, smarting under one of the worst things that ever was\nsupposed to come from America, consoled himself with the reflection that\nit was the price we have to pay for cochineal.  And with that murderous\nparody, logical optimism and the praises of the best of possible words\nwent irrevocably out of season, and have been no more heard of in the\nmouths of reasonable men.  Whitman spares us all allusions to the\ncochineal; he treats evil and sorrow in a spirit almost as of welcome; as\nan old sea-dog might have welcomed the sight of the enemy’s topsails off\nthe Spanish Main.  There, at least, he seems to say, is something obvious\nto be done.  I do not know many better things in literature than the\nbrief pictures,—brief and vivid like things seen by lightning,—with which\nhe tries to stir up the world’s heart upon the side of mercy.  He braces\nus, on the one hand, with examples of heroic duty and helpfulness; on the\nother, he touches us with pitiful instances of people needing help.  He\nknows how to make the heart beat at a brave story; to inflame us with\njust resentment over the hunted slave; to stop our mouths for shame when\nhe tells of the drunken prostitute.  For all the afflicted, all the weak,\nall the wicked, a good word is said in a spirit which I can only call one\nof ultra-Christianity; and however wild, however contradictory, it may be\nin parts, this at least may be said for his book, as it may be said of\nthe Christian Gospels, that no one will read it, however respectable, but\nhe gets a knock upon his conscience; no one however fallen, but he finds\na kindly and supporting welcome.\n\n\n\nIV.\n\n\nNor has he been content with merely blowing the trumpet for the battle of\nwell-doing; he has given to his precepts the authority of his own brave\nexample.  Naturally a grave, believing man, with little or no sense of\nhumour, he has succeeded as well in life as in his printed performances.\nThe spirit that was in him has come forth most eloquently in his actions.\nMany who have only read his poetry have been tempted to set him down as\nan ass, or even as a charlatan; but I never met any one who had known him\npersonally who did not profess a solid affection and respect for the\nman’s character.  He practises as he professes; he feels deeply that\nChristian love for all men, that toleration, that cheerful delight in\nserving others, which he often celebrates in literature with a doubtful\nmeasure of success.  And perhaps, out of all his writings, the best and\nthe most human and convincing passages are to be found in “these soil’d\nand creas’d little livraisons, each composed of a sheet or two of paper,\nfolded small to carry in the pocket, and fastened with a pin,” which he\nscribbled during the war by the bedsides of the wounded or in the\nexcitement of great events.  They are hardly literature in the formal\nmeaning of the word; he has left his jottings for the most part as he\nmade them; a homely detail, a word from the lips of a dying soldier, a\nbusiness memorandum, the copy of a letter-short, straightforward to the\npoint, with none of the trappings of composition; but they breathe a\nprofound sentiment, they give us a vivid look at one of the sides of\nlife, and they make us acquainted with a man whom it is an honour to\nlove.\n\nWhitman’s intense Americanism, his unlimited belief in the future of\nThese States (as, with reverential capitals, he loves to call them), made\nthe war a period of great trial to his soul.  The new virtue, Unionism,\nof which he is the sole inventor, seemed to have fallen into premature\nunpopularity.  All that he loved, hoped, or hated, hung in the balance.\nAnd the game of war was not only momentous to him in its issues; it\nsublimated his spirit by its heroic displays, and tortured him intimately\nby the spectacle of its horrors.  It was a theatre, it was a place of\neducation, it was like a season of religious revival.  He watched Lincoln\ngoing daily to his work; he studied and fraternised with young soldiery\npassing to the front; above all, he walked the hospitals, reading the\nBible, distributing clean clothes, or apples, or tobacco; a patient,\nhelpful, reverend man, full of kind speeches.\n\nHis memoranda of this period are almost bewildering to read.  From one\npoint of view they seem those of a district visitor; from another, they\nlook like the formless jottings of an artist in the picturesque.  More\nthan one woman, on whom I tried the experiment, immediately claimed the\nwriter for a fellow-woman.  More than one literary purist might identify\nhim as a shoddy newspaper correspondent without the necessary faculty of\nstyle.  And yet the story touches home; and if you are of the weeping\norder of mankind, you will certainly find your eyes fill with tears, of\nwhich you have no reason to be ashamed.  There is only one way to\ncharacterise a work of this order, and that is to quote.  Here is a\npassage from a letter to a mother, unknown to Whitman, whose son died in\nhospital:—\n\n    “Frank, as far as I saw, had everything requisite in surgical\n    treatment, nursing, etc.  He had watches much of the time.  He was so\n    good and well-behaved, and affectionate, I myself liked him very\n    much.  I was in the habit of coming in afternoons and sitting by him,\n    and he liked to have me—liked to put out his arm and lay his hand on\n    my knee—would keep it so a long while.  Toward the last he was more\n    restless and flighty at night—often fancied himself with his\n    regiment—by his talk sometimes seem’d as if his feelings were hurt by\n    being blamed by his officers for something he was entirely innocent\n    of—said ‘I never in my life was thought capable of such a thing, and\n    never was.’  At other times he would fancy himself talking as it\n    seem’d to children or such like, his relatives, I suppose, and giving\n    them good advice; would talk to them a long while.  All the time he\n    was out of his head not one single bad word, or thought, or idea\n    escaped him.  It was remark’d that many a man’s conversation in his\n    senses was not half so good as Frank’s delirium.\n\n    “He was perfectly willing to die—he had become very weak, and had\n    suffer’d a good deal, and was perfectly resign’d, poor boy.  I do not\n    know his past life, but I feel as if it must have been good.  At any\n    rate what I saw of him here, under the most trying circumstances,\n    with a painful wound, and among strangers, I can say that he behaved\n    so brave, so composed, and so sweet and affectionate, it could not be\n    surpassed.  And now, like many other noble and good men, after\n    serving his country as a soldier, he has yielded up his young life at\n    the very outset in her service.  Such things are gloomy—yet there is\n    a text, ‘God doeth all things well,’ the meaning of which, after due\n    time, appears to the soul.\n\n    “I thought perhaps a few words, though from a stranger, about your\n    son, from one who was with him at the last, might be worth while, for\n    I loved the young man, though I but saw him immediately to lose him.”\n\nIt is easy enough to pick holes in the grammar of this letter, but what\nare we to say of its profound goodness and tenderness?  It is written as\nthough he had the mother’s face before his eyes, and saw her wincing in\nthe flesh at every word.  And what, again, are we to say of its sober\ntruthfulness, not exaggerating, not running to phrases, not seeking to\nmake a hero out of what was only an ordinary but good and brave young\nman?  Literary reticence is not Whitman’s stronghold; and this reticence\nis not literary, but humane; it is not that of a good artist but that of\na good man.  He knew that what the mother wished to hear about was Frank;\nand he told her about her Frank as he was.\n\n\n\nV.\n\n\nSomething should be said of Whitman’s style, for style is of the essence\nof thinking.  And where a man is so critically deliberate as our author,\nand goes solemnly about his poetry for an ulterior end, every indication\nis worth notice.  He has chosen a rough, unrhymed, lyrical verse;\nsometimes instinct with a fine processional movement; often so rugged and\ncareless that it can only be described by saying that he has not taken\nthe trouble to write prose.  I believe myself that it was selected\nprincipally because it was easy to write, although not without\nrecollections of the marching measures of some of the prose in our\nEnglish Old Testament.  According to Whitman, on the other hand, “the\ntime has arrived to essentially break down the barriers of form between\nProse and Poetry . . . for the most cogent purposes of those great inland\nstates, and for Texas, and California, and Oregon;”—a statement which is\namong the happiest achievements of American humour.  He calls his verses\n“recitatives,” in easily followed allusion to a musical form.\n“Easily-written, loose-fingered chords,” he cries, “I feel the thrum of\nyour climax and close.”  Too often, I fear, he is the only one who can\nperceive the rhythm; and in spite of Mr. Swinburne, a great part of his\nwork considered as verses is poor bald stuff.  Considered, not as verse,\nbut as speech, a great part of it is full of strange and admirable\nmerits.  The right detail is seized; the right word, bold and trenchant,\nis thrust into its place.  Whitman has small regard to literary\ndecencies, and is totally free from literary timidities.  He is neither\nafraid of being slangy nor of being dull; nor, let me add, of being\nridiculous.  The result is a most surprising compound of plain grandeur,\nsentimental affectation, and downright nonsense.  It would be useless to\nfollow his detractors and give instances of how bad he can be at his\nworst; and perhaps it would be not much wiser to give extracted specimens\nof how happily he can write when he is at his best.  These come in to\nmost advantage in their own place; owing something, it may be, to the\noffset of their curious surroundings.  And one thing is certain, that no\none can appreciate Whitman’s excellences until he has grown accustomed to\nhis faults.  Until you are content to pick poetry out of his pages almost\nas you must pick it out of a Greek play in Bohn’s translation, your\ngravity will be continually upset, your ears perpetually disappointed,\nand the whole book will be no more to you than a particularly flagrant\nproduction by the Poet Close.\n\nA writer of this uncertain quality was, perhaps, unfortunate in taking\nfor thesis the beauty of the world as it now is, not only on the\nhill-tops but in the factory; not only by the harbour full of stately\nships, but in the magazine of the hopelessly prosaic hatter.  To show\nbeauty in common things is the work of the rarest tact.  It is not to be\ndone by the wishing.  It is easy to posit as a theory, but to bring it\nhome to men’s minds is the problem of literature, and is only\naccomplished by rare talent, and in comparatively rare instances.  To bid\nthe whole world stand and deliver, with a dogma in one’s right hand by\nway of pistol; to cover reams of paper in a galloping, headstrong vein;\nto cry louder and louder over everything as it comes up, and make no\ndistinction in one’s enthusiasm over the most incomparable matters; to\nprove one’s entire want of sympathy for the jaded, literary palate, by\ncalling, not a spade a spade, but a hatter a hatter, in a lyrical\napostrophe;—this, in spite of all the airs of inspiration, is not the way\nto do it.  It may be very wrong, and very wounding to a respectable\nbranch of industry, but the word “hatter” cannot be used seriously in\nemotional verse; not to understand this, is to have no literary tact; and\nI would, for his own sake, that this were the only inadmissible\nexpression with which Whitman had bedecked his pages.  The book teems\nwith similar comicalities; and, to a reader who is determined to take it\nfrom that side only, presents a perfect carnival of fun.\n\nA good deal of this is the result of theory playing its usual vile trick\nupon the artist.  It is because he is a Democrat that Whitman must have\nin the hatter.  If you may say Admiral, he reasons, why may you not say\nHatter?  One man is as good as another, and it is the business of the\n“great poet” to show poetry in the life of the one as well as the other.\nA most incontrovertible sentiment surely, and one which nobody would\nthink of controverting, where—and here is the point—where any beauty has\nbeen shown.  But how, where that is not the case? where the hatter is\nsimply introduced, as God made him and as his fellow-men have miscalled\nhim, at the crisis of a high-flown rhapsody?  And what are we to say,\nwhere a man of Whitman’s notable capacity for putting things in a bright,\npicturesque, and novel way, simply gives up the attempt, and indulges,\nwith apparent exultation, in an inventory of trades or implements, with\nno more colour or coherence than so many index-words out of a dictionary?\nI do not know that we can say anything, but that it is a prodigiously\namusing exhibition for a line or so.  The worst of it is, that Whitman\nmust have known better.  The man is a great critic, and, so far as I can\nmake out, a good one; and how much criticism does it require to know that\ncapitulation is not description, or that fingering on a dumb keyboard,\nwith whatever show of sentiment and execution, is not at all the same\nthing as discoursing music?  I wish I could believe he was quite honest\nwith us; but, indeed, who was ever quite honest who wrote a book for a\npurpose?  It is a flight beyond the reach of human magnanimity.\n\nOne other point, where his means failed him, must be touched upon,\nhowever shortly.  In his desire to accept all facts loyally and simply,\nit fell within his programme to speak at some length and with some\nplainness on what is, for I really do not know what reason, the most\ndelicate of subjects.  Seeing in that one of the most serious and\ninteresting parts of life, he was aggrieved that it should be looked upon\nas ridiculous or shameful.  No one speaks of maternity with his tongue in\nhis cheek; and Whitman made a bold push to set the sanctity of fatherhood\nbeside the sanctity of motherhood, and introduce this also among the\nthings that can be spoken of without either a blush or a wink.  But the\nPhilistines have been too strong; and, to say truth, Whitman has rather\nplayed the fool.  We may be thoroughly conscious that his end is\nimproving; that it would be a good thing if a window were opened on these\nclose privacies of life; that on this subject, as on all others, he now\nand then lets fall a pregnant saying.  But we are not satisfied.  We feel\nthat he was not the man for so difficult an enterprise.  He loses our\nsympathy in the character of a poet by attracting too much of our\nattention in that of a Bull in a China Shop.  And where, by a little more\nart, we might have been solemnised ourselves, it is too often Whitman\nalone who is solemn in the face of an audience somewhat indecorously\namused.\n\n\n\nVI.\n\n\nLastly, as most important, after all, to human beings in our disputable\nstate, what is that higher prudence which was to be the aim and issue of\nthese deliberate productions?\n\nWhitman is too clever to slip into a succinct formula.  If he could have\nadequately said his say in a single proverb, it is to be presumed he\nwould not have put himself to the trouble of writing several volumes.  It\nwas his programme to state as much as he could of the world with all its\ncontradictions, and leave the upshot with God who planned it.  What he\nhas made of the world and the world’s meanings is to be found at large in\nhis poems.  These altogether give his answers to the problems of belief\nand conduct; in many ways righteous and high-spirited, in some ways loose\nand contradictory.  And yet there are two passages from the preface to\nthe _Leaves of Grass_ which do pretty well condense his teaching on all\nessential points, and yet preserve a measure of his spirit.\n\n    “This is what you shall do,” he says in the one, “love the earth, and\n    sun, and animals, despise riches, give alms to every one that asks,\n    stand up for the stupid and crazy, devote your income and labour to\n    others, hate tyrants, argue not concerning God, have patience and\n    indulgence towards the people, take off your hat to nothing known or\n    unknown, or to any man or number of men; go freely with powerful\n    uneducated persons, and with the young, and mothers of families, read\n    these leaves (his own works) in the open air every season of every\n    year of your life; re-examine all you have been told at school or\n    church, or in any book, and dismiss whatever insults your own soul.”\n\n    “The prudence of the greatest poet,” he adds in the other—and the\n    greatest poet is, of course, himself—“knows that the young man who\n    composedly perilled his life and lost it, has done exceeding well for\n    himself; while the man who has not perilled his life, and retains it\n    to old age in riches and ease, has perhaps achieved nothing for\n    himself worth mentioning; and that only that person has no great\n    prudence to learn, who has learnt to prefer real long-lived things,\n    and favours body and soul the same, and perceives the indirect surely\n    following the direct, and what evil or good he does leaping onward\n    and waiting to meet him again, and who in his spirit, in any\n    emergency whatever, neither hurries nor avoids death.”\n\nThere is much that is Christian in these extracts, startlingly Christian.\nAny reader who bears in mind Whitman’s own advice and “dismisses whatever\ninsults his own soul” will find plenty that is bracing, brightening, and\nchastening to reward him for a little patience at first.  It seems hardly\npossible that any being should get evil from so healthy a book as the\n_Leaves of Grass_, which is simply comical wherever it falls short of\nnobility; but if there be any such, who cannot both take and leave, who\ncannot let a single opportunity pass by without some unworthy and unmanly\nthought, I should have as great difficulty, and neither more nor less, in\nrecommending the works of Whitman as in lending them Shakespeare, or\nletting them go abroad outside of the grounds of a private asylum.\n\n\n\n\nHENRY DAVID THOREAU:\nHIS CHARACTER AND OPINIONS.\n\n\nI.\n\n\nTHOREAU’S thin, penetrating, big-nosed face, even in a bad woodcut,\nconveys some hint of the limitations of his mind and character.  With his\nalmost acid sharpness of insight, with his almost animal dexterity in\nact, there went none of that large, unconscious geniality of the world’s\nheroes.  He was not easy, not ample, not urbane, not even kind; his\nenjoyment was hardly smiling, or the smile was not broad enough to be\nconvincing; he had no waste lands nor kitchen-midden in his nature, but\nwas all improved and sharpened to a point.  “He was bred to no\nprofession,” says Emerson; “he never married; he lived alone; he never\nwent to church; he never voted; he refused to pay a tax to the State; he\nate no flesh, he drank no wine, he never knew the use of tobacco and,\nthough a naturalist, he used neither trap nor gun.  When asked at dinner\nwhat dish he preferred, he answered, ‘the nearest.’”  So many negative\nsuperiorities begin to smack a little of the prig.  From his later works\nhe was in the habit of cutting out the humorous passages, under the\nimpression that they were beneath the dignity of his moral muse; and\nthere we see the prig stand public and confessed.  It was “much easier,”\nsays Emerson acutely, much easier for Thoreau to say _no_ than _yes_; and\nthat is a characteristic which depicts the man.  It is a useful\naccomplishment to be able to say _no_, but surely it is the essence of\namiability to prefer to say _yes_ where it is possible.  There is\nsomething wanting in the man who does not hate himself whenever he is\nconstrained to say no.  And there was a great deal wanting in this born\ndissenter.  He was almost shockingly devoid of weaknesses; he had not\nenough of them to be truly polar with humanity; whether you call him\ndemi-god or demi-man, he was at least not altogether one of us, for he\nwas not touched with a feeling of our infirmities.  The world’s heroes\nhave room for all positive qualities, even those which are disreputable,\nin the capacious theatre of their dispositions.  Such can live many\nlives; while a Thoreau can live but one, and that only with perpetual\nforesight.\n\nHe was no ascetic, rather an Epicurean of the nobler sort; and he had\nthis one great merit, that he succeeded so far as to be happy.  “I love\nmy fate to the core and rind,” he wrote once; and even while he lay\ndying, here is what he dictated (for it seems he was already too feeble\nto control the pen):  “You ask particularly after my health.  I _suppose_\nthat I have not many months to live, but of course know nothing about it.\nI may say that I am enjoying existence as much as ever, and regret\nnothing.”  It is not given to all to bear so clear a testimony to the\nsweetness of their fate, nor to any without courage and wisdom; for this\nworld in itself is but a painful and uneasy place of residence, and\nlasting happiness, at least to the self-conscious, comes only from\nwithin.  Now Thoreau’s content and ecstasy in living was, we may say,\nlike a plant that he had watered and tended with womanish solicitude; for\nthere is apt to be something unmanly, something almost dastardly, in a\nlife that does not move with dash and freedom, and that fears the bracing\ncontact of the world.  In one word, Thoreau was a skulker.  He did not\nwish virtue to go out of him among his fellow-men, but slunk into a\ncorner to hoard it for himself.  He left all for the sake of certain\nvirtuous self-indulgences.  It is true that his tastes were noble; that\nhis ruling passion was to keep himself unspotted from the world; and that\nhis luxuries were all of the same healthy order as cold tubs and early\nrising.  But a man may be both coldly cruel in the pursuit of goodness,\nand morbid even in the pursuit of health.  I cannot lay my hands on the\npassage in which he explains his abstinence from tea and coffee, but I am\nsure I have the meaning correctly.  It is this; He thought it bad economy\nand worthy of no true virtuoso to spoil the natural rapture of the\nmorning with such muddy stimulants; let him but see the sun rise, and he\nwas already sufficiently inspirited for the labours of the day.  That may\nbe reason good enough to abstain from tea; but when we go on to find the\nsame man, on the same or similar grounds, abstain from nearly everything\nthat his neighbours innocently and pleasurably use, and from the rubs and\ntrials of human society itself into the bargain, we recognise that\nvaletudinarian healthfulness which is more delicate than sickness itself.\nWe need have no respect for a state of artificial training.  True health\nis to be able to do without it.  Shakespeare, we can imagine, might begin\nthe day upon a quart of ale, and yet enjoy the sunrise to the full as\nmuch as Thoreau, and commemorate his enjoyment in vastly better verses.\nA man who must separate himself from his neighbours’ habits in order to\nbe happy, is in much the same case with one who requires to take opium\nfor the same purpose.  What we want to see is one who can breast into the\nworld, do a man’s work, and still preserve his first and pure enjoyment\nof existence.\n\nThoreau’s faculties were of a piece with his moral shyness; for they were\nall delicacies.  He could guide himself about the woods on the darkest\nnight by the touch of his feet.  He could pick up at once an exact dozen\nof pencils by the feeling, pace distances with accuracy, and gauge cubic\ncontents by the eye.  His smell was so dainty that he could perceive the\nfœtor of dwelling-houses as he passed them by at night; his palate so\nunsophisticated that, like a child, he disliked the taste of wine—or\nperhaps, living in America, had never tasted any that was good; and his\nknowledge of nature was so complete and curious that he could have told\nthe time of year, within a day or so, by the aspect of the plants.  In\nhis dealings with animals, he was the original of Hawthorne’s Donatello.\nHe pulled the woodchuck out of its hole by the tail; the hunted fox came\nto him for protection; wild squirrels have been seen to nestle in his\nwaistcoat; he would thrust his arm into a pool and bring forth a bright,\npanting fish, lying undismayed in the palm of his hand.  There were few\nthings that he could not do.  He could make a house, a boat, a pencil, or\na book.  He was a surveyor, a scholar, a natural historian.  He could\nrun, walk, climb, skate, swim, and manage a boat.  The smallest occasion\nserved to display his physical accomplishment; and a manufacturer, from\nmerely observing his dexterity with the window of a railway carriage,\noffered him a situation on the spot.  “The only fruit of much living,” he\nobserves, “is the ability to do some slight thing better.”  But such was\nthe exactitude of his senses, so alive was he in every fibre, that it\nseems as if the maxim should be changed in his case, for he could do most\nthings with unusual perfection.  And perhaps he had an approving eye to\nhimself when he wrote: “Though the youth at last grows indifferent, the\nlaws of the universe are not indifferent, _but are for ever on the side\nof the most sensitive_.”\n\n\n\nII.\n\n\nThoreau had decided, it would seem, from the very first to lead a life of\nself-improvement: the needle did not tremble as with richer natures, but\npointed steadily north; and as he saw duty and inclination in one, he\nturned all his strength in that direction.  He was met upon the threshold\nby a common difficulty.  In this world, in spite of its many agreeable\nfeatures, even the most sensitive must undergo some drudgery to live.  It\nis not possible to devote your time to study and meditation without what\nare quaintly but happily denominated private means; these absent, a man\nmust contrive to earn his bread by some service to the public such as the\npublic cares to pay him for; or, as Thoreau loved to put it, Apollo must\nserve Admetus.  This was to Thoreau even a sourer necessity than it is to\nmost; there was a love of freedom, a strain of the wild man, in his\nnature, that rebelled with violence against the yoke of custom; and he\nwas so eager to cultivate himself and to be happy in his own society,\nthat he could consent with difficulty even to the interruptions of\nfriendship.  “_Such are my engagements to myself_ that I dare not\npromise,” he once wrote in answer to an invitation; and the italics are\nhis own.  Marcus Aurelius found time to study virtue, and between whiles\nto conduct the imperial affairs of Rome; but Thoreau is so busy improving\nhimself, that he must think twice about a morning call.  And now imagine\nhim condemned for eight hours a day to some uncongenial and unmeaning\nbusiness!  He shrank from the very look of the mechanical in life; all\nshould, if possible, be sweetly spontaneous and swimmingly progressive.\nThus he learned to make lead-pencils, and, when he had gained the best\ncertificate and his friends began to congratulate him on his\nestablishment in life, calmly announced that he should never make\nanother.  “Why should I?” said he “I would not do again what I have done\nonce.”  For when a thing has once been done as well as it wants to be, it\nis of no further interest to the self-improver.  Yet in after years, and\nwhen it became needful to support his family, he returned patiently to\nthis mechanical art—a step more than worthy of himself.\n\nThe pencils seem to have been Apollo’s first experiment in the service of\nAdmetus; but others followed.  “I have thoroughly tried school-keeping,”\nhe writes, “and found that my expenses were in proportion, or rather out\nof proportion, to my income; for I was obliged to dress and train, not to\nsay think and believe, accordingly, and I lost my time into the bargain.\nAs I did not teach for the benefit of my fellow-men, but simply for a\nlivelihood, this was a failure.  I have tried trade, but I found that it\nwould take ten years to get under way in that, and that then I should\nprobably be on my way to the devil.”  Nothing, indeed, can surpass his\nscorn for all so-called business.  Upon that subject gall squirts from\nhim at a touch.  “The whole enterprise of this nation is not illustrated\nby a thought,” he writes; “it is not warmed by a sentiment; there is\nnothing in it for which a man should lay down his life, nor even his\ngloves.”  And again: “If our merchants did not most of them fail, and the\nbanks too, my faith in the old laws of this world would be staggered.\nThe statement that ninety-six in a hundred doing such business surely\nbreak down is perhaps the sweetest fact that statistics have revealed.”\nThe wish was probably father to the figures; but there is something\nenlivening in a hatred of so genuine a brand, hot as Corsican revenge,\nand sneering like Voltaire.\n\nPencils, school-keeping, and trade being thus discarded one after\nanother, Thoreau, with a stroke of strategy, turned the position.  He saw\nhis way to get his board and lodging for practically nothing; and Admetus\nnever got less work out of any servant since the world began.  It was his\nambition to be an oriental philosopher; but he was always a very Yankee\nsort of oriental.  Even in the peculiar attitude in which he stood to\nmoney, his system of personal economics, as we may call it, he displayed\na vast amount of truly down-East calculation, and he adopted poverty like\na piece of business.  Yet his system is based on one or two ideas which,\nI believe, come naturally to all thoughtful youths, and are only pounded\nout of them by city uncles.  Indeed, something essentially youthful\ndistinguishes all Thoreau’s knock-down blows at current opinion.  Like\nthe posers of a child, they leave the orthodox in a kind of speechless\nagony.  These know the thing is nonsense.  They are sure there must be an\nanswer, yet somehow cannot find it.  So it is with his system of economy.\nHe cuts through the subject on so new a plane that the accepted arguments\napply no longer; he attacks it in a new dialect where there are no\ncatchwords ready made for the defender; after you have been boxing for\nyears on a polite, gladiatorial convention, here is an assailant who does\nnot scruple to hit below the belt.\n\n“The cost of a thing,” says he, “is _the amount of what I will call life_\nwhich is required to be exchanged for it, immediately or in the long\nrun.”  I have been accustomed to put it to myself, perhaps more clearly,\nthat the price we have to pay for money is paid in liberty.  Between\nthese two ways of it, at least, the reader will probably not fail to find\na third definition of his own; and it follows, on one or other, that a\nman may pay too dearly for his livelihood, by giving, in Thoreau’s terms,\nhis whole life for it, or, in mine, bartering for it the whole of his\navailable liberty, and becoming a slave till death.  There are two\nquestions to be considered—the quality of what we buy, and the price we\nhave to pay for it.  Do you want a thousand a year, a two thousand a\nyear, or a ten thousand a year livelihood? and can you afford the one you\nwant?  It is a matter of taste; it is not in the least degree a question\nof duty, though commonly supposed so.  But there is no authority for that\nview anywhere.  It is nowhere in the Bible.  It is true that we might do\na vast amount of good if we were wealthy, but it is also highly\nimprobable; not many do; and the art of growing rich is not only quite\ndistinct from that of doing good, but the practice of the one does not at\nall train a man for practising the other.  “Money might be of great\nservice to me,” writes Thoreau; “but the difficulty now is that I do not\nimprove my opportunities, and therefore I am not prepared to have my\nopportunities increased.”  It is a mere illusion that, above a certain\nincome, the personal desires will be satisfied and leave a wider margin\nfor the generous impulse.  It is as difficult to be generous, or anything\nelse, except perhaps a member of Parliament, on thirty thousand as on two\nhundred a year.\n\nNow Thoreau’s tastes were well defined.  He loved to be free, to be\nmaster of his times and seasons, to indulge the mind rather than the\nbody; he preferred long rambles to rich dinners, his own reflections to\nthe consideration of society, and an easy, calm, unfettered, active life\namong green trees to dull toiling at the counter of a bank.  And such\nbeing his inclination he determined to gratify it.  A poor man must save\noff something; he determined to save off his livelihood.  “When a man has\nattained those things which are necessary to life,” he writes, “there is\nanother alternative than to obtain the superfluities; _he may adventure\non life now_, his vacation from humbler toil having commenced.”  Thoreau\nwould get shelter, some kind of covering for his body, and necessary\ndaily bread; even these he should get as cheaply as possible; and then,\nhis vacation from humbler toil having commenced, devote himself to\noriental philosophers, the study of nature, and the work of\nself-improvement.\n\nPrudence, which bids us all go to the ant for wisdom and hoard against\nthe day of sickness, was not a favourite with Thoreau.  He preferred that\nother, whose name is so much misappropriated: Faith.  When he had secured\nthe necessaries of the moment, he would not reckon up possible accidents\nor torment himself with trouble for the future.  He had no toleration for\nthe man “who ventures to live only by the aid of the mutual insurance\ncompany, which has promised to bury him decently.”  He would trust\nhimself a little to the world.  “We may safely trust a good deal more\nthan we do,” says he.  “How much is not done by us! or what if we had\nbeen taken sick?”  And then, with a stab of satire, he describes\ncontemporary mankind in a phrase: “All the day long on the alert, at\nnight we unwillingly say our prayers and commit ourselves to\nuncertainties.”  It is not likely that the public will be much affected\nby Thoreau, when they blink the direct injunctions of the religion they\nprofess; and yet, whether we will or no, we make the same hazardous\nventures; we back our own health and the honesty of our neighbours for\nall that we are worth; and it is chilling to think how many must lose\ntheir wager.\n\nIn 1845, twenty-eight years old, an age by which the liveliest have\nusually declined into some conformity with the world, Thoreau, with a\ncapital of something less than five pounds and a borrowed axe, walked\nforth into the woods by Walden Pond, and began his new experiment in\nlife.  He built himself a dwelling, and returned the axe, he says with\ncharacteristic and workman-like pride, sharper than when he borrowed it;\nhe reclaimed a patch, where he cultivated beans, peas, potatoes, and\nsweet corn; he had his bread to bake, his farm to dig, and for the matter\nof six weeks in the summer he worked at surveying, carpentry, or some\nother of his numerous dexterities, for hire.\n\nFor more than five years, this was all that he required to do for his\nsupport, and he had the winter and most of the summer at his entire\ndisposal.  For six weeks of occupation, a little cooking and a little\ngentle hygienic gardening, the man, you may say, had as good as stolen\nhis livelihood.  Or we must rather allow that he had done far better; for\nthe thief himself is continually and busily occupied; and even one born\nto inherit a million will have more calls upon his time than Thoreau.\nWell might he say, “What old people tell you you cannot do, you try and\nfind you can.”  And how surprising is his conclusion: “I am convinced\nthat _to maintain oneself on this earth is not a hardship_, _but a\npastime_, if we will live simply and wisely; _as the pursuits of simpler\nnations are still the sports of the more artificial_.”\n\nWhen he had enough of that kind of life, he showed the same simplicity in\ngiving it up as in beginning it.  There are some who could have done the\none, but, vanity forbidding, not the other; and that is perhaps the story\nof the hermits; but Thoreau made no fetish of his own example, and did\nwhat he wanted squarely.  And five years is long enough for an experiment\nand to prove the success of transcendental Yankeeism.  It is not his\nfrugality which is worthy of note; for, to begin with, that was inborn,\nand therefore inimitable by others who are differently constituted; and\nagain, it was no new thing, but has often been equalled by poor Scotch\nstudents at the universities.  The point is the sanity of his view of\nlife, and the insight with which he recognised the position of money, and\nthought out for himself the problem of riches and a livelihood.  Apart\nfrom his eccentricities, he had perceived, and was acting on, a truth of\nuniversal application.  For money enters in two different characters into\nthe scheme of life.  A certain amount, varying with the number and empire\nof our desires, is a true necessary to each one of us in the present\norder of society; but beyond that amount, money is a commodity to be\nbought or not to be bought, a luxury in which we may either indulge or\nstint ourselves, like any other.  And there are many luxuries that we may\nlegitimately prefer to it, such as a grateful conscience, a country life,\nor the woman of our inclination.  Trite, flat, and obvious as this\nconclusion may appear, we have only to look round us in society to see\nhow scantily it has been recognised; and perhaps even ourselves, after a\nlittle reflection, may decide to spend a trifle less for money, and\nindulge ourselves a trifle more in the article of freedom.\n\n\n\nIII.\n\n\n“To have done anything by which you earned money merely,” says Thoreau,\n“is to be” (have been, he means) “idle and worse.”  There are two\npassages in his letters, both, oddly enough, relating to firewood, which\nmust be brought together to be rightly understood.  So taken, they\ncontain between them the marrow of all good sense on the subject of work\nin its relation to something broader than mere livelihood.  Here is the\nfirst: “I suppose I have burned up a good-sized tree to-night—and for\nwhat?  I settled with Mr. Tarbell for it the other day; but that wasn’t\nthe final settlement.  I got off cheaply from him.  At last one will say:\n‘Let us see, how much wood did you burn, sir?’  And I shall shudder to\nthink that the next question will be, ‘What did you do while you were\nwarm?’”  Even after we have settled with Admetus in the person of Mr.\nTarbell, there comes, you see, a further question.  It is not enough to\nhave earned our livelihood.  Either the earning itself should have been\nserviceable to mankind, or something else must follow.  To live is\nsometimes very difficult, but it is never meritorious in itself; and we\nmust have a reason to allege to our own conscience why we should continue\nto exist upon this crowded earth.\n\nIf Thoreau had simply dwelt in his house at Walden, a lover of trees,\nbirds, and fishes, and the open air and virtue, a reader of wise books,\nan idle, selfish self-improver, he would have managed to cheat Admetus,\nbut, to cling to metaphor, the devil would have had him in the end.\nThose who can avoid toil altogether and dwell in the Arcadia of private\nmeans, and even those who can, by abstinence, reduce the necessary amount\nof it to some six weeks a year, having the more liberty, have only the\nhigher moral obligation to be up and doing in the interest of man.\n\nThe second passage is this: “There is a far more important and warming\nheat, commonly lost, which precedes the burning of the wood.  It is the\nsmoke of industry, which is incense.  I had been so thoroughly warmed in\nbody and spirit, that when at length my fuel was housed, I came near\nselling it to the ashman, as if I had extracted all its heat.”  Industry\nis, in itself and when properly chosen, delightful and profitable to the\nworker; and when your toil has been a pleasure, you have not, as Thoreau\nsays, “earned money merely,” but money, health, delight, and moral\nprofit, all in one.  “We must heap up a great pile of doing for a small\ndiameter of being,” he says in another place; and then exclaims, “How\nadmirably the artist is made to accomplish his self-culture by devotion\nto his art!”  We may escape uncongenial toil, only to devote ourselves to\nthat which is congenial.  It is only to transact some higher business\nthat even Apollo dare play the truant from Admetus.  We must all work for\nthe sake of work; we must all work, as Thoreau says again, in any\n“absorbing pursuit—it does not much matter what, so it be honest;” but\nthe most profitable work is that which combines into one continued effort\nthe largest proportion of the powers and desires of a man’s nature; that\ninto which he will plunge with ardour, and from which he will desist with\nreluctance; in which he will know the weariness of fatigue, but not that\nof satiety; and which will be ever fresh, pleasing, and stimulating to\nhis taste.  Such work holds a man together, braced at all points; it does\nnot suffer him to doze or wander; it keeps him actively conscious of\nhimself, yet raised among superior interests; it gives him the profit of\nindustry with the pleasures of a pastime.  This is what his art should be\nto the true artist, and that to a degree unknown in other and less\nintimate pursuits.  For other professions stand apart from the human\nbusiness of life; but an art has its seat at the centre of the artist’s\ndoings and sufferings, deals directly with his experiences, teaches him\nthe lessons of his own fortunes and mishaps, and becomes a part of his\nbiography.  So says Goethe:\n\n    “Spät erklingt was früh erklang;\n    Glück und Unglück wird Gesang.”\n\nNow Thoreau’s art was literature; and it was one of which he had\nconceived most ambitiously.  He loved and believed in good books.  He\nsaid well, “Life is not habitually seen from any common platform so truly\nand unexaggerated as in the light of literature.”  But the literature he\nloved was of the heroic order.  “Books, not which afford us a cowering\nenjoyment, but in which each thought is of unusual daring; such as an\nidle man cannot read, and a timid one would not be entertained by, which\neven make us dangerous to existing institutions—such I call good books.”\nHe did not think them easy to be read.  “The heroic books,” he says,\n“even if printed in the character of our mother-tongue, will always be in\na language dead to degenerate times; and we must laboriously seek the\nmeaning of each word and line, conjecturing a larger sense than common\nuse permits out of what wisdom and valour and generosity we have.”  Nor\ndoes he suppose that such books are easily written.  “Great prose, of\nequal elevation, commands our respect more than great verse,” says he,\n“since it implies a more permanent and level height, a life more pervaded\nwith the grandeur of the thought.  The poet often only makes an\nirruption, like the Parthian, and is off again, shooting while he\nretreats; but the prose writer has conquered like a Roman and settled\ncolonies.”  We may ask ourselves, almost with dismay, whether such works\nexist at all but in the imagination of the student.  For the bulk of the\nbest of books is apt to be made up with ballast; and those in which\nenergy of thought is combined with any stateliness of utterance may be\nalmost counted on the fingers.  Looking round in English for a book that\nshould answer Thoreau’s two demands of a style like poetry and sense that\nshall be both original and inspiriting, I come to Milton’s\n_Areopagitica_, and can name no other instance for the moment.  Two\nthings at least are plain: that if a man will condescend to nothing more\ncommonplace in the way of reading, he must not look to have a large\nlibrary; and that if he proposes himself to write in a similar vein, he\nwill find his work cut out for him.\n\nThoreau composed seemingly while he walked, or at least exercise and\ncomposition were with him intimately connected; for we are told that “the\nlength of his walk uniformly made the length of his writing.”  He speaks\nin one place of “plainness and vigour, the ornaments of style,” which is\nrather too paradoxical to be comprehensively, true.\n\nIn another he remarks: “As for style of writing, if one has anything to\nsay it drops from him simply as a stone falls to the ground.”  We must\nconjecture a very large sense indeed for the phrase “if one has anything\nto say.”  When truth flows from a man, fittingly clothed in style and\nwithout conscious effort, it is because the effort has been made and the\nwork practically completed before he sat down to write.  It is only out\nof fulness of thinking that expression drops perfect like a ripe fruit;\nand when Thoreau wrote so nonchalantly at his desk, it was because he had\nbeen vigorously active during his walk.  For neither clearness\ncompression, nor beauty of language, come to any living creature till\nafter a busy and a prolonged acquaintance with the subject on hand.  Easy\nwriters are those who, like Walter Scott, choose to remain contented with\na less degree of perfection than is legitimately within the compass of\ntheir powers.  We hear of Shakespeare and his clean manuscript; but in\nface of the evidence of the style itself and of the various editions of\n_Hamlet_, this merely proves that Messrs.  Hemming and Condell were\nunacquainted with the common enough phenomenon called a fair copy.  He\nwho would recast a tragedy already given to the world must frequently and\nearnestly have revised details in the study.  Thoreau himself, and in\nspite of his protestations, is an instance of even extreme research in\none direction; and his effort after heroic utterance is proved not only\nby the occasional finish, but by the determined exaggeration of his\nstyle.  “I trust you realise what an exaggerator I am—that I lay myself\nout to exaggerate,” he writes.  And again, hinting at the explanation:\n“Who that has heard a strain of music feared lest he should speak\nextravagantly any more for ever?”  And yet once more, in his essay on\nCarlyle, and this time with his meaning well in hand: “No truth, we\nthink, was ever expressed but with this sort of emphasis, that for the\ntime there seemed to be no other.”  Thus Thoreau was an exaggerative and\na parabolical writer, not because he loved the literature of the East,\nbut from a desire that people should understand and realise what he was\nwriting.  He was near the truth upon the general question; but in his own\nparticular method, it appears to me, he wandered.  Literature is not less\na conventional art than painting or sculpture; and it is the least\nstriking, as it is the most comprehensive of the three.  To hear a strain\nof music to see a beautiful woman, a river, a great city, or a starry\nnight, is to make a man despair of his Lilliputian arts in language.\nNow, to gain that emphasis which seems denied to us by the very nature of\nthe medium, the proper method of literature is by selection, which is a\nkind of negative exaggeration.  It is the right of the literary artist,\nas Thoreau was on the point of seeing, to leave out whatever does not\nsuit his purpose.  Thus we extract the pure gold; and thus the\nwell-written story of a noble life becomes, by its very omissions, more\nthrilling to the reader.  But to go beyond this, like Thoreau, and to\nexaggerate directly, is to leave the saner classical tradition, and to\nput the reader on his guard.  And when you write the whole for the half,\nyou do not express your thought more forcibly, but only express a\ndifferent thought which is not yours.\n\nThoreau’s true subject was the pursuit of self-improvement combined with\nan unfriendly criticism of life as it goes on in our societies; it is\nthere that he best displays the freshness and surprising trenchancy of\nhis intellect; it is there that his style becomes plain and vigorous, and\ntherefore, according to his own formula, ornamental.  Yet he did not care\nto follow this vein singly, but must drop into it by the way in books of\na different purport.  _Walden_, _or Life in the Woods_, _A Week on the\nConcord and Merrimack Rivers_, _The Maine Woods_,—such are the titles he\naffects.  He was probably reminded by his delicate critical perception\nthat the true business of literature is with narrative; in reasoned\nnarrative, and there alone, that art enjoys all its advantages, and\nsuffers least from its defects.  Dry precept and disembodied\ndisquisition, as they can only be read with an effort of abstraction, can\nnever convey a perfectly complete or a perfectly natural impression.\nTruth, even in literature, must be clothed with flesh and blood, or it\ncannot tell its whole story to the reader.  Hence the effect of anecdote\non simple minds; and hence good biographies and works of high,\nimaginative art, are not only far more entertaining, but far more\nedifying, than books of theory or precept.  Now Thoreau could not clothe\nhis opinions in the garment of art, for that was not his talent; but he\nsought to gain the same elbow-room for himself, and to afford a similar\nrelief to his readers, by mingling his thoughts with a record of\nexperience.\n\nAgain, he was a lover of nature.  The quality which we should call\nmystery in a painting, and which belongs so particularly to the aspect of\nthe external world and to its influence upon our feelings, was one which\nhe was never weary of attempting to reproduce in his books.  The seeming\nsignificance of nature’s appearances, their unchanging strangeness to the\nsenses, and the thrilling response which they waken in the mind of man,\ncontinued to surprise and stimulate his spirits.  It appeared to him, I\nthink, that if we could only write near enough to the facts, and yet with\nno pedestrian calm, but ardently, we might transfer the glamour of\nreality direct upon our pages; and that, if it were once thus captured\nand expressed, a new and instructive relation might appear between men’s\nthoughts and the phenomena of nature.  This was the eagle that he pursued\nall his life long, like a schoolboy with a butterfly net.  Hear him to a\nfriend: “Let me suggest a theme for you—to state to yourself precisely\nand completely what that walk over the mountains amounted to for you,\nreturning to this essay again and again until you are satisfied that all\nthat was important in your experience is in it.  Don’t suppose that you\ncan tell it precisely the first dozen times you try, but at ’em again;\nespecially when, after a sufficient pause you suspect that you are\ntouching the heart or summit of the matter, reiterate your blows there,\nand account for the mountain to yourself.  Not that the story need be\nlong, but it will take a long while to make it short.”  Such was the\nmethod, not consistent for a man whose meanings were to “drop from him as\na stone falls to the ground.”  Perhaps the most successful work that\nThoreau ever accomplished in this direction is to be found in the\npassages relating to fish in the _Week_.  These are remarkable for a\nvivid truth of impression and a happy suitability of language, not\nfrequently surpassed.\n\nWhatever Thoreau tried to do was tried in fair, square prose, with\nsentences solidly built, and no help from bastard rhythms.  Moreover,\nthere is a progression—I cannot call it a progress—in his work towards a\nmore and more strictly prosaic level, until at last he sinks into the\nbathos of the prosy.  Emerson mentions having once remarked to Thoreau:\n“Who would not like to write something which all can read, like _Robinson\nCrusoe_? and who does not see with regret that his page is not solid with\na right materialistic treatment which delights everybody?”  I must say in\npassing that it is not the right materialistic treatment which delights\nthe world in _Robinson_, but the romantic and philosophic interest of the\nfable.  The same treatment does quite the reverse of delighting us when\nit is applied, in _Colonel Jack_, to the management of a plantation.  But\nI cannot help suspecting Thoreau to have been influenced either by this\nidentical remark or by some other closely similar in meaning.  He began\nto fall more and more into a detailed materialistic treatment; he went\ninto the business doggedly, as one who should make a guide-book; he not\nonly chronicled what had been important in his own experience, but\nwhatever might have been important in the experience of anybody else; not\nonly what had affected him, but all that he saw or heard.  His ardour had\ngrown less, or perhaps it was inconsistent with a right materialistic\ntreatment to display such emotions as he felt; and, to complete the\neventful change, he chose, from a sense of moral dignity, to gut these\nlater works of the saving quality of humour.  He was not one of those\nauthors who have learned, in his own words, “to leave out their dulness.”\nHe inflicts his full quantity upon the reader in such books as _Cape\nCod_, or _The Yankee in Canada_.  Of the latter he confessed that he had\nnot managed to get much of himself into it.  Heaven knows he had not, nor\nyet much of Canada, we may hope.  “Nothing,” he says somewhere, “can\nshock a brave man but dulness.”  Well, there are few spots more shocking\nto the brave than the pages of _The Yankee in Canada_.\n\nThere are but three books of his that will be read with much pleasure:\nthe _Week_, _Walden_, and the collected letters.  As to his poetry,\nEmerson’s word shall suffice for us, it is so accurate and so prettily\nsaid: “The thyme and majoram are not yet honey.”  In this, as in his\nprose, he relied greatly on the goodwill of the reader, and wrote\nthroughout in faith.  It was an exercise of faith to suppose that many\nwould understand the sense of his best work, or that any could be\nexhilarated by the dreary chronicling of his worst.  “But,” as he says,\n“the gods do not hear any rude or discordant sound, as we learn from the\necho; and I know that the nature towards which I launch these sounds is\nso rich that it will modulate anew and wonderfully improve my rudest\nstrain.”\n\n\n\nIV.\n\n\n“What means the fact,” he cries, “that a soul which has lost all hope for\nitself can inspire in another listening soul such an infinite confidence\nin it, even while it is expressing its despair?”  The question is an echo\nand an illustration of the words last quoted; and it forms the key-note\nof his thoughts on friendship.  No one else, to my knowledge, has spoken\nin so high and just a spirit of the kindly relations; and I doubt whether\nit be a drawback that these lessons should come from one in many ways so\nunfitted to be a teacher in this branch.  The very coldness and egoism of\nhis own intercourse gave him a clearer insight into the intellectual\nbasis of our warm, mutual tolerations; and testimony to their worth comes\nwith added force from one who was solitary and disobliging, and of whom a\nfriend remarked, with equal wit and wisdom, “I love Henry, but I cannot\nlike him.”\n\nHe can hardly be persuaded to make any distinction between love and\nfriendship; in such rarefied and freezing air, upon the mountain-tops of\nmeditation, had he taught himself to breathe.  He was, indeed, too\naccurate an observer not to have remarked that “there exists already a\nnatural disinterestedness and liberality” between men and women; yet, he\nthought, “friendship is no respecter of sex.”  Perhaps there is a sense\nin which the words are true; but they were spoken in ignorance; and\nperhaps we shall have put the matter most correctly, if we call love a\nfoundation for a nearer and freer degree of friendship than can be\npossible without it.  For there are delicacies, eternal between persons\nof the same sex, which are melted and disappear in the warmth of love.\n\nTo both, if they are to be right, he attributes the same nature and\ncondition.  “We are not what we are,” says he, “nor do we treat or esteem\neach other for such, but for what we are capable of being.”  “A friend is\none who incessantly pays us the compliment of expecting all the virtues\nfrom us, and who can appreciate them in us.”  “The friend asks no return\nbut that his friend will religiously accept and wear and not disgrace his\napotheosis of him.”  “It is the merit and preservation of friendship that\nit takes place on a level higher than the actual characters of the\nparties would seem to warrant.”  This is to put friendship on a pedestal\nindeed; and yet the root of the matter is there; and the last sentence,\nin particular, is like a light in a dark place, and makes many mysteries\nplain.  We are different with different friends; yet if we look closely\nwe shall find that every such relation reposes on some particular\napotheosis of oneself; with each friend, although we could not\ndistinguish it in words from any other, we have at least one special\nreputation to preserve: and it is thus that we run, when mortified, to\nour friend or the woman that we love, not to hear ourselves called\nbetter, but to be better men in point of fact.  We seek this society to\nflatter ourselves with our own good conduct.  And hence any falsehood in\nthe relation, any incomplete or perverted understanding, will spoil even\nthe pleasure of these visits.  Thus says Thoreau again: “Only lovers know\nthe value of truth.”  And yet again: “They ask for words and deeds, when\na true relation is word and deed.”\n\nBut it follows that since they are neither of them so good as the other\nhopes, and each is, in a very honest manner, playing a part above his\npowers, such an intercourse must often be disappointing to both.  “We may\nbid farewell sooner than complain,” says Thoreau, “for our complaint is\ntoo well grounded to be uttered.”  “We have not so good a right to hate\nany as our friend.”\n\n    “It were treason to our love\n    And a sin to God above,\n    One iota to abate\n    Of a pure, impartial hate.”\n\nLove is not blind, nor yet forgiving.  “O yes, believe me,” as the song\nsays, “Love has eyes!”  The nearer the intimacy, the more cuttingly do we\nfeel the unworthiness of those we love; and because you love one, and\nwould die for that love to-morrow, you have not forgiven, and you never\nwill forgive, that friend’s misconduct.  If you want a person’s faults,\ngo to those who love him.  They will not tell you, but they know.  And\nherein lies the magnanimous courage of love, that it endures this\nknowledge without change.\n\nIt required a cold, distant personality like that of Thoreau, perhaps, to\nrecognise and certainly to utter this truth; for a more human love makes\nit a point of honour not to acknowledge those faults of which it is most\nconscious.  But his point of view is both high and dry.  He has no\nillusions; he does not give way to love any more than to hatred, but\npreserves them both with care like valuable curiosities.  A more\nbald-headed picture of life, if I may so express myself, has seldom been\npresented.  He is an egoist; he does not remember, or does not think it\nworth while to remark, that, in these near intimacies, we are ninety-nine\ntimes disappointed in our beggarly selves for once that we are\ndisappointed in our friend; that it is we who seem most frequently\nundeserving of the love that unites us; and that it is by our friend’s\nconduct that we are continually rebuked and yet strengthened for a fresh\nendeavour.  Thoreau is dry, priggish, and selfish.  It is profit he is\nafter in these intimacies; moral profit, certainly, but still profit to\nhimself.  If you will be the sort of friend I want, he remarks naïvely,\n“my education cannot dispense with your society.”  His education! as\nthough a friend were a dictionary.  And with all this, not one word about\npleasure, or laughter, or kisses, or any quality of flesh and blood.  It\nwas not inappropriate, surely, that he had such close relations with the\nfish.  We can understand the friend already quoted, when he cried: “As\nfor taking his arm, I would as soon think of taking the arm of an\nelm-tree!”\n\nAs a matter of fact he experienced but a broken enjoyment in his\nintimacies.  He says he has been perpetually on the brink of the sort of\nintercourse he wanted, and yet never completely attained it.  And what\nelse had he to expect when he would not, in a happy phrase of Carlyle’s,\n“nestle down into it”?  Truly, so it will be always if you only stroll in\nupon your friends as you might stroll in to see a cricket match; and even\nthen not simply for the pleasure of the thing, but with some afterthought\nof self-improvement, as though you had come to the cricket match to bet.\nIt was his theory that people saw each other too frequently, so that\ntheir curiosity was not properly whetted, nor had they anything fresh to\ncommunicate; but friendship must be something else than a society for\nmutual improvement—indeed, it must only be that by the way, and to some\nextent unconsciously; and if Thoreau had been a man instead of a manner\nof elm-tree, he would have felt that he saw his friends too seldom, and\nhave reaped benefits unknown to his philosophy from a more sustained and\neasy intercourse.  We might remind him of his own words about love: “We\nshould have no reserve; we should give the whole of ourselves to that\nbusiness.  But commonly men have not imagination enough to be thus\nemployed about a human being, but must be coopering a barrel, forsooth.”\nAy, or reading oriental philosophers.  It is not the nature of the rival\noccupation, it is the fact that you suffer it to be a rival, that renders\nloving intimacy impossible.  Nothing is given for nothing in this world;\nthere can be no true love, even on your own side, without devotion;\ndevotion is the exercise of love, by which it grows; but if you will give\nenough of that, if you will pay the price in a sufficient “amount of what\nyou call life,” why then, indeed, whether with wife or comrade, you may\nhave months and even years of such easy, natural, pleasurable, and yet\nimproving intercourse as shall make time a moment and kindness a delight.\n\nThe secret of his retirement lies not in misanthropy, of which he had no\ntincture, but part in his engrossing design of self-improvement and part\nin the real deficiencies of social intercourse.  He was not so much\ndifficult about his fellow human beings as he could not tolerate the\nterms of their association.  He could take to a man for any genuine\nqualities, as we see by his admirable sketch of the Canadian woodcutter\nin _Walden_; but he would not consent, in his own words, to “feebly\nfabulate and paddle in the social slush.”  It seemed to him, I think,\nthat society is precisely the reverse of friendship, in that it takes\nplace on a lower level than the characters of any of the parties would\nwarrant us to expect.  The society talk of even the most brilliant man is\nof greatly less account than what you will get from him in (as the French\nsay) a little committee.  And Thoreau wanted geniality; he had not enough\nof the superficial, even at command; he could not swoop into a parlour\nand, in the naval phrase, “cut out” a human being from that dreary port;\nnor had he inclination for the task.  I suspect he loved books and nature\nas well and near as warmly as he loved his fellow-creatures,—a\nmelancholy, lean degeneration of the human character.\n\n“As for the dispute about solitude and society,” he thus sums up: “Any\ncomparison is impertinent.  It is an idling down on the plain at the base\nof the mountain instead of climbing steadily to its top.  Of course you\nwill be glad of all the society you can get to go up with?  Will you go\nto glory with me? is the burden of the song.  It is not that we love to\nbe alone, but that we love to soar, and when we do soar the company grows\nthinner and thinner till there is none at all.  It is either the tribune\non the plain, a sermon on the mount, or a very private ecstasy still\nhigher up.  Use all the society that will abet you.”  But surely it is no\nvery extravagant opinion that it is better to give than to receive, to\nserve than to use our companions; and above all, where there is no\nquestion of service upon either side, that it is good to enjoy their\ncompany like a natural man.  It is curious and in some ways dispiriting\nthat a writer may be always best corrected out of his own mouth; and so,\nto conclude, here is another passage from Thoreau which seems aimed\ndirectly at himself: “Do not be too moral; you may cheat yourself out of\nmuch life so. . . .  _All fables_, _indeed_, _have their morals_; _but\nthe innocent enjoy the story_.”\n\n\n\nV.\n\n\n“The only obligation,” says he, “which I have a right to assume is to do\nat any time what I think right.”  “Why should we ever go abroad, even\nacross the way, to ask a neighbour’s advice?”  “There is a nearer\nneighbour within, who is incessantly telling us how we should behave.\n_But we wait for the neighbour without to tell us of some false_, _easier\nway_.”  “The greater part of what my neighbours call good I believe in my\nsoul to be bad.”  To be what we are, and to become what we are capable of\nbecoming, is the only end of life.  It is “when we fall behind ourselves”\nthat “we are cursed with duties and the neglect of duties.”  “I love the\nwild,” he says, “not less than the good.”  And again: “The life of a good\nman will hardly improve us more than the life of a freebooter, for the\ninevitable laws appear as plainly in the infringement as in the\nobservance, and” (mark this) “_our lives are sustained by a nearly equal\nexpense of virtue of some kind_.”  Even although he were a prig, it will\nbe owned he could announce a startling doctrine.  “As for doing good,” he\nwrites elsewhere, “that is one of the professions that are full.\nMoreover, I have tried it fairly, and, strange as it may seem, am\nsatisfied that it does not agree with my constitution.  Probably I should\nnot conscientiously and deliberately forsake my particular calling to do\nthe good which society demands of me, to save the universe from\nannihilation; and I believe that a like but infinitely greater\nsteadfastness elsewhere is all that now preserves it.  If you should ever\nbe betrayed into any of these philanthropies, do not let your left hand\nknow what your right hand does, for it is not worth knowing.”  Elsewhere\nhe returns upon the subject, and explains his meaning thus: “If I ever\n_did_ a man any good in their sense, of course it was something\nexceptional and insignificant compared with the good or evil I am\nconstantly doing by being what I am.”\n\nThere is a rude nobility, like that of a barbarian king, in this unshaken\nconfidence in himself and indifference to the wants, thoughts, or\nsufferings of others.  In his whole works I find no trace of pity.  This\nwas partly the result of theory, for he held the world too mysterious to\nbe criticised, and asks conclusively: “What right have I to grieve who\nhave not ceased to wonder?”  But it sprang still more from constitutional\nindifference and superiority; and he grew up healthy, composed, and\nunconscious from among life’s horrors, like a green bay-tree from a field\nof battle.  It was from this lack in himself that he failed to do justice\nto the spirit of Christ; for while he could glean more meaning from\nindividual precepts than any score of Christians, yet he conceived life\nin such a different hope, and viewed it with such contrary emotions, that\nthe sense and purport of the doctrine as a whole seems to have passed him\nby or left him unimpressed.  He could understand the idealism of the\nChristian view, but he was himself so unaffectedly unhuman that he did\nnot recognise the human intention and essence of that teaching.  Hence he\ncomplained that Christ did not leave us a rule that was proper and\nsufficient for this world, not having conceived the nature of the rule\nthat was laid down; for things of that character that are sufficiently\nunacceptable become positively non-existent to the mind.  But perhaps we\nshall best appreciate the defect in Thoreau by seeing it supplied in the\ncase of Whitman.  For the one, I feel confident, is the disciple of the\nother; it is what Thoreau clearly whispered that Whitman so uproariously\nbawls; it is the same doctrine, but with how immense a difference! the\nsame argument, but used to what a new conclusion!  Thoreau had plenty of\nhumour until he tutored himself out of it, and so forfeited that best\nbirthright of a sensible man; Whitman, in that respect, seems to have\nbeen sent into the world naked and unashamed; and yet by a strange\nconsummation, it is the theory of the former that is arid, abstract, and\nclaustral.  Of these two philosophies so nearly identical at bottom, the\none pursues Self-improvement—a churlish, mangy dog; the other is up with\nthe morning, in the best of health, and following the nymph Happiness,\nbuxom, blithe, and debonair.  Happiness, at least, is not solitary; it\njoys to communicate; it loves others, for it depends on them for its\nexistence; it sanctions and encourages to all delights that are not\nunkind in themselves; if it lived to a thousand, it would not make\nexcision of a single humorous passage; and while the self-improver\ndwindles towards the prig, and, if he be not of an excellent constitution\nmay even grow deformed into an Obermann, the very name and appearance of\na happy man breathe of good-nature, and help the rest of us to live.\n\nIn the case of Thoreau, so great a show of doctrine demands some outcome\nin the field of action.  If nothing were to be done but build a shanty\nbeside Walden Pond, we have heard altogether too much of these\ndeclarations of independence.  That the man wrote some books is nothing\nto the purpose, for the same has been done in a suburban villa.  That he\nkept himself happy is perhaps a sufficient excuse, but it is\ndisappointing to the reader.  We may be unjust, but when a man despises\ncommerce and philanthropy alike, and has views of good so soaring that he\nmust take himself apart from mankind for their cultivation, we will not\nbe content without some striking act.  It was not Thoreau’s fault if he\nwere not martyred; had the occasion come, he would have made a noble\nending.  As it is, he did once seek to interfere in the world’s course;\nhe made one practical appearance on the stage of affairs; and a strange\none it was, and strangely characteristic of the nobility and the\neccentricity of the man.  It was forced on him by his calm but radical\nopposition to negro slavery.  “Voting for the right is doing nothing for\nit,” he saw; “it is only expressing to men feebly your desire that it\nshould prevail.”  For his part, he would not “for an instant recognise\nthat political organisation for _his_ government which is the _slave’s_\ngovernment also.”  “I do not hesitate to say,” he adds, “that those who\ncall themselves Abolitionists should at once effectually withdraw their\nsupport, both in person and property, from the government of\nMassachusetts.”  That is what he did: in 1843 he ceased to pay the\npoll-tax.  The highway-tax he paid, for he said he was as desirous to be\na good neighbour as to be a bad subject; but no more poll-tax to the\nState of Massachusetts.  Thoreau had now seceded, and was a polity unto\nhimself; or, as he explains it with admirable sense, “In fact, I quietly\ndeclare war with the State after my fashion, though I will still make\nwhat use and get what advantage of her I can, as is usual in such cases.”\nHe was put in prison; but that was a part of his design.  “Under a\ngovernment which imprisons any unjustly, the true place for a just man is\nalso a prison.  I know this well, that if one thousand, if one hundred,\nif ten men whom I could name—ay, if _one_ HONEST man, in this State of\nMassachusetts, _ceasing to hold slaves_, were actually to withdraw from\nthis copartnership, and be locked up in the county gaol therefor, it\nwould be the abolition of slavery in America.  For it matters not how\nsmall the beginning may seem to be; what is once well done is done for\never.”  Such was his theory of civil disobedience.\n\nAnd the upshot?  A friend paid the tax for him; continued year by year to\npay it in the sequel; and Thoreau was free to walk the woods unmolested.\nIt was a _fiasco_, but to me it does not seem laughable; even those who\njoined in the laughter at the moment would be insensibly affected by this\nquaint instance of a good man’s horror for injustice.  We may compute the\nworth of that one night’s imprisonment as outweighing half a hundred\nvoters at some subsequent election: and if Thoreau had possessed as great\na power of persuasion as (let us say) Falstaff, if he had counted a party\nhowever small, if his example had been followed by a hundred or by thirty\nof his fellows, I cannot but believe it would have greatly precipitated\nthe era of freedom and justice.  We feel the misdeeds of our country with\nso little fervour, for we are not witnesses to the suffering they cause;\nbut when we see them wake an active horror in our fellow-man, when we see\na neighbour prefer to lie in prison rather than be so much as passively\nimplicated in their perpetration, even the dullest of us will begin to\nrealise them with a quicker pulse.\n\nNot far from twenty years later, when Captain John Brown was taken at\nHarper’s Ferry, Thoreau was the first to come forward in his defence.\nThe committees wrote to him unanimously that his action was premature.\n“I did not send to you for advice,” said he, “but to announce that I was\nto speak.”  I have used the word “defence;” in truth he did not seek to\ndefend him, even declared it would be better for the good cause that he\nshould die; but he praised his action as I think Brown would have liked\nto hear it praised.\n\nThus this singularly eccentric and independent mind, wedded to a\ncharacter of so much strength, singleness, and purity, pursued its own\npath of self-improvement for more than half a century, part gymnosophist,\npart backwoodsman; and thus did it come twice, though in a subaltern\nattitude, into the field of political history.\n\n                                * * * * *\n\nNOTE.—For many facts in the above essay, among which I may mention the\nincident of the squirrel, I am indebted to _Thoreau_: _His Life and\nAims_, by J. A. Page, or, as is well known, Dr. Japp.\n\n\n\n\nYOSHIDA-TORAJIRO\n\n\nTHE name at the head of this page is probably unknown to the English\nreader, and yet I think it should become a household word like that of\nGaribaldi or John Brown.  Some day soon, we may expect to hear more fully\nthe details of Yoshida’s history, and the degree of his influence in the\ntransformation of Japan; even now there must be Englishmen acquainted\nwith the subject, and perhaps the appearance of this sketch may elicit\nsomething more complete and exact.  I wish to say that I am not, rightly\nspeaking, the author of the present paper: I tell the story on the\nauthority of an intelligent Japanese gentleman, Mr. Taiso Masaki, who\ntold it me with an emotion that does honour to his heart; and though I\nhave taken some pains, and sent my notes to him to be corrected, this can\nbe no more than an imperfect outline.\n\nYoshida-Torajiro was son to the hereditary military instructor of the\nhouse of Choshu.   The name you are to pronounce with an equality of\naccent on the different syllables, almost as in French, the vowels as in\nItalian, but the consonants in the English manner—except the _j_, which\nhas the French sound, or, as it has been cleverly proposed to write it,\nthe sound of _zh_.  Yoshida was very learned in Chinese letters, or, as\nwe might say, in the classics, and in his father’s subject; fortification\nwas among his favourite studies, and he was a poet from his boyhood.  He\nwas born to a lively and intelligent patriotism; the condition of Japan\nwas his great concern; and while he projected a better future, he lost no\nopportunity of improving his knowledge of her present state.  With this\nend he was continually travelling in his youth, going on foot and\nsometimes with three days’ provision on his back, in the brave,\nself-helpful manner of all heroes.  He kept a full diary while he was\nthus upon his journeys, but it is feared that these notes have been\ndestroyed.  If their value were in any respect such as we have reason to\nexpect from the man’s character, this would be a loss not easy to\nexaggerate.  It is still wonderful to the Japanese how far he contrived\nto push these explorations; a cultured gentleman of that land and period\nwould leave a complimentary poem wherever he had been hospitably\nentertained; and a friend of Mr. Masaki, who was likewise a great\nwanderer, has found such traces of Yoshida’s passage in very remote\nregions of Japan.\n\nPolitics is perhaps the only profession for which no preparation is\nthought necessary; but Yoshida considered otherwise, and he studied the\nmiseries of his fellow-countrymen with as much attention and research as\nthough he had been going to write a book instead of merely to propose a\nremedy.  To a man of his intensity and singleness, there is no question\nbut that this survey was melancholy in the extreme.  His dissatisfaction\nis proved by the eagerness with which he threw himself into the cause of\nreform; and what would have discouraged another braced Yoshida for his\ntask.  As he professed the theory of arms, it was firstly the defences of\nJapan that occupied his mind.  The external feebleness of that country\nwas then illustrated by the manners of overriding barbarians, and the\nvisits of big barbarian war ships: she was a country beleaguered.  Thus\nthe patriotism of Yoshida took a form which may be said to have defeated\nitself: he had it upon him to keep out these all-powerful foreigners,\nwhom it is now one of his chief merits to have helped to introduce; but a\nman who follows his own virtuous heart will be always found in the end to\nhave been fighting for the best.  One thing leads naturally to another in\nan awakened mind, and that with an upward progress from effect to cause.\nThe power and knowledge of these foreigners were things inseparable; by\nenvying them their military strength, Yoshida came to envy them their\nculture; from the desire to equal them in the first, sprang his desire to\nshare with them in the second; and thus he is found treating in the same\nbook of a new scheme to strengthen the defences of Kioto and of the\nestablishment, in the same city, of a university of foreign teachers.  He\nhoped, perhaps, to get the good of other lands without their evil; to\nenable Japan to profit by the knowledge of the barbarians, and still keep\nher inviolate with her own arts and virtues.  But whatever was the\nprecise nature of his hope, the means by which it was to be accomplished\nwere both difficult and obvious.  Some one with eyes and understanding\nmust break through the official cordon, escape into the new world, and\nstudy this other civilisation on the spot.  And who could be better\nsuited for the business?  It was not without danger, but he was without\nfear.  It needed preparation and insight; and what had he done since he\nwas a child but prepare himself with the best culture of Japan, and\nacquire in his excursions the power and habit of observing?\n\nHe was but twenty-two, and already all this was clear in his mind, when\nnews reached Choshu that Commodore Perry was lying near to Yeddo.  Here,\nthen, was the patriot’s opportunity.  Among the Samurai of Choshu, and in\nparticular among the councillors of the Daimio, his general culture, his\nviews, which the enlightened were eager to accept, and, above all, the\nprophetic charm, the radiant persuasion of the man, had gained him many\nand sincere disciples.  He had thus a strong influence at the provincial\nCourt; and so he obtained leave to quit the district, and, by way of a\npretext, a privilege to follow his profession in Yeddo.  Thither he\nhurried, and arrived in time to be too late: Perry had weighed anchor,\nand his sails had vanished from the waters of Japan.  But Yoshida, having\nput his hand to the plough, was not the man to go back; he had entered\nupon this business, and, please God, he would carry it through; and so he\ngave up his professional career and remained in Yeddo to be at hand\nagainst the next opportunity.  By this behaviour he put himself into an\nattitude towards his superior, the Daimio of Choshu, which I cannot\nthoroughly explain.  Certainly, he became a _Ronyin_, a broken man, a\nfeudal outlaw; certainly he was liable to be arrested if he set foot upon\nhis native province; yet I am cautioned that “he did not really break his\nallegiance,” but only so far separated himself as that the prince could\nno longer be held accountable for his late vassal’s conduct.  There is\nsome nicety of feudal custom here that escapes my comprehension.\n\nIn Yeddo, with this nondescript political status, and cut off from any\nmeans of livelihood, he was joyfully supported by those who sympathised\nwith his design.  One was Sákuma-Shozan, hereditary retainer of one of\nthe Shogun’s councillors, and from him he got more than money or than\nmoney’s worth.  A steady, respectable man, with an eye to the world’s\nopinion, Sákuma was one of those who, if they cannot do great deeds in\ntheir own person, have yet an ardour of admiration for those who can,\nthat recommends them to the gratitude of history.  They aid and abet\ngreatness more, perhaps, than we imagine.  One thinks of them in\nconnection with Nicodemus, who visited our Lord by night.  And Sákuma was\nin a position to help Yoshida more practically than by simple\ncountenance; for he could read Dutch, and was eager to communicate what\nhe knew.\n\nWhile the young Ronyin thus lay studying in Yeddo, news came of a Russian\nship at Nangasaki.  No time was to be lost.  Sákuma contributed “a long\ncopy of encouraging verses;” and off set Yoshida on foot for Nangasaki.\nHis way lay through his own province of Choshu; but, as the highroad to\nthe south lay apart from the capital, he was able to avoid arrest.  He\nsupported himself, like a _trouvère_, by his proficiency in verse.  He\ncarried his works along with him, to serve as an introduction.  When he\nreached a town he would inquire for the house of any one celebrated for\nswordsmanship, or poetry, or some of the other acknowledged forms of\nculture; and there, on giving a taste of his skill, he would be received\nand entertained, and leave behind him, when he went away, a compliment in\nverse.  Thus he travelled through the Middle Ages on his voyage of\ndiscovery into the nineteenth century.  When he reached Nangasaki he was\nonce more too late.  The Russians were gone.  But he made a profit on his\njourney in spite of fate, and stayed awhile to pick up scraps of\nknowledge from the Dutch interpreters—a low class of men, but one that\nhad opportunities; and then, still full of purpose, returned to Yeddo on\nfoot, as he had come.\n\nIt was not only his youth and courage that supported him under these\nsuccessive disappointments, but the continual affluence of new disciples.\nThe man had the tenacity of a Bruce or a Columbus, with a pliability that\nwas all his own.  He did not fight for what the world would call success;\nbut for “the wages of going on.”  Check him off in a dozen directions, he\nwould find another outlet and break forth.  He missed one vessel after\nanother, and the main work still halted; but so long as he had a single\nJapanese to enlighten and prepare for the better future, he could still\nfeel that he was working for Japan.  Now, he had scarce returned from\nNangasaki, when he was sought out by a new inquirer, the most promising\nof all.  This was a common soldier, of the Hemming class, a dyer by\nbirth, who had heard vaguely {179} of Yoshida’s movements, and had become\nfilled with wonder as to their design.  This was a far different inquirer\nfrom Sákuma-Shozan, or the councillors of the Daimio of Choshu.  This was\nno two-sworded gentleman, but the common stuff of the country, born in\nlow traditions and unimproved by books; and yet that influence, that\nradiant persuasion that never failed Yoshida in any circumstance of his\nshort life, enchanted, enthralled, and converted the common soldier, as\nit had done already with the elegant and learned.  The man instantly\nburned up into a true enthusiasm; his mind had been only waiting for a\nteacher; he grasped in a moment the profit of these new ideas; he, too,\nwould go to foreign, outlandish parts, and bring back the knowledge that\nwas to strengthen and renew Japan; and in the meantime, that he might be\nthe better prepared, Yoshida set himself to teach, and he to learn, the\nChinese literature.  It is an episode most honourable to Yoshida, and yet\nmore honourable still to the soldier, and to the capacity and virtue of\nthe common people of Japan.\n\nAnd now, at length, Commodore Perry returned to Simoda.  Friends crowded\nround Yoshida with help, counsels, and encouragement.  One presented him\nwith a great sword, three feet long and very heavy, which, in the\nexultation of the hour, he swore to carry throughout all his wanderings,\nand to bring back—a far-travelled weapon—to Japan.  A long letter was\nprepared in Chinese for the American officers; it was revised and\ncorrected by Sákuma, and signed by Yoshida, under the name of\nUrinaki-Manji, and by the soldier under that of Ichigi-Koda.  Yoshida had\nsupplied himself with a profusion of materials for writing; his dress was\nliterally stuffed with paper which was to come back again enriched with\nhis observations, and make a great and happy kingdom of Japan.  Thus\nequipped, this pair of emigrants set forward on foot from Yeddo, and\nreached Simoda about nightfall.  At no period within history can travel\nhave presented to any European creature the same face of awe and terror\nas to these courageous Japanese.  The descent of Ulysses into hell is a\nparallel more near the case than the boldest expedition in the Polar\ncircles.  For their act was unprecedented; it was criminal; and it was to\ntake them beyond the pale of humanity into a land of devils.  It is not\nto be wondered at if they were thrilled by the thought of their unusual\nsituation; and perhaps the soldier gave utterance to the sentiment of\nboth when he sang, “in Chinese singing” (so that we see he had already\nprofited by his lessons), these two appropriate verses:\n\n    “We do not know where we are to sleep to-night,\n    In a thousand miles of desert where we can see no human smoke.”\n\nIn a little temple, hard by the sea-shore, they lay down to repose; sleep\novertook them as they lay; and when they awoke, “the east was already\nwhite” for their last morning in Japan.  They seized a fisherman’s boat\nand rowed out—Perry lying far to sea because of the two tides.  Their\nvery manner of boarding was significant of determination; for they had no\nsooner caught hold upon the ship than they kicked away their boat to make\nreturn impossible.  And now you would have thought that all was over.\nBut the Commodore was already in treaty with the Shogun’s Government; it\nwas one of the stipulations that no Japanese was to be aided in escaping\nfrom Japan; and Yoshida and his followers were handed over as prisoners\nto the authorities at Simoda.  That night he who had been to explore the\nsecrets of the barbarian slept, if he might sleep at all, in a cell too\nshort for lying down at full length, and too low for standing upright.\nThere are some disappointments too great for commentary.\n\nSákuma, implicated by his handwriting, was sent into his own province in\nconfinement, from which he was soon released.  Yoshida and the soldier\nsuffered a long and miserable period of captivity, and the latter,\nindeed, died, while yet in prison, of a skin disease.  But such a spirit\nas that of Yoshida-Torajiro is not easily made or kept a captive; and\nthat which cannot be broken by misfortune you shall seek in vain to\nconfine in a bastille.  He was indefatigably active, writing reports to\nGovernment and treatises for dissemination.  These latter were\ncontraband; and yet he found no difficulty in their distribution, for he\nalways had the jailor on his side.  It was in vain that they kept\nchanging him from one prison to another; Government by that plan only\nhastened the spread of new ideas; for Yoshida had only to arrive to make\na convert.  Thus, though he himself has laid by the heels, he confirmed\nand extended his party in the State.\n\nAt last, after many lesser transferences, he was given over from the\nprisons of the Shogun to those of his own superior, the Daimio of Choshu.\nI conceive it possible that he may then have served out his time for the\nattempt to leave Japan, and was now resigned to the provincial Government\non a lesser count, as a Ronyin or feudal rebel.  But, however that may\nbe, the change was of great importance to Yoshida; for by the influence\nof his admirers in the Daimio’s council, he was allowed the privilege,\nunderhand, of dwelling in his own house.  And there, as well to keep up\ncommunication with his fellow-reformers as to pursue his work of\neducation, he received boys to teach.  It must not be supposed that he\nwas free; he was too marked a man for that; he was probably assigned to\nsome small circle, and lived, as we should say, under police\nsurveillance; but to him, who had done so much from under lock and key,\nthis would seem a large and profitable liberty.\n\nIt was at this period that Mr. Masaki was brought into personal contact\nwith Yoshida; and hence, through the eyes of a boy of thirteen, we get\none good look at the character and habits of the hero.  He was ugly and\nlaughably disfigured with the smallpox; and while nature had been so\nniggardly with him from the first, his personal habits were even\nsluttish.  His clothes were wretched; when he ate or washed he wiped his\nhands upon his sleeves; and as his hair was not tied more than once in\nthe two months, it was often disgusting to behold.  With such a picture,\nit is easy to believe that he never married.  A good teacher, gentle in\nact, although violent and abusive in speech, his lessons were apt to go\nover the heads of his scholars and to leave them gaping, or more often\nlaughing.  Such was his passion for study that he even grudged himself\nnatural repose; and when he grew drowsy over his books he would, if it\nwas summer, put mosquitoes up his sleeve; and, if it was winter, take off\nhis shoes and run barefoot on the snow.  His handwriting was\nexceptionally villainous; poet though he was, he had no taste for what\nwas elegant; and in a country where to write beautifully was not the mark\nof a scrivener but an admired accomplishment for gentlemen, he suffered\nhis letters to be jolted out of him by the press of matter and the heat\nof his convictions.  He would not tolerate even the appearance of a\nbribe; for bribery lay at the root of much that was evil in Japan, as\nwell as in countries nearer home; and once when a merchant brought him\nhis son to educate, and added, as was customary, {185} a little private\nsweetener, Yoshida dashed the money in the giver’s face, and launched\ninto such an outbreak of indignation as made the matter public in the\nschool.  He was still, when Masaki knew him, much weakened by his\nhardships in prison; and the presentation sword, three feet long, was too\nheavy for him to wear without distress; yet he would always gird it on\nwhen he went to dig in his garden.  That is a touch which qualifies the\nman.  A weaker nature would have shrunk from the sight of what only\ncommemorated a failure.  But he was of Thoreau’s mind, that if you can\n“make your failure tragical by courage, it will not differ from success.”\nHe could look back without confusion to his enthusiastic promise.  If\nevents had been contrary, and he found himself unable to carry out that\npurpose—well, there was but the more reason to be brave and constant in\nanother; if he could not carry the sword into barbarian lands, it should\nat least be witness to a life spent entirely for Japan.\n\nThis is the sight we have of him as he appeared to schoolboys, but not\nrelated in the schoolboy spirit.  A man so careless of the graces must be\nout of court with boys and women.  And, indeed, as we have all been more\nor less to school, it will astonish no one that Yoshida was regarded by\nhis scholars as a laughing-stock.  The schoolboy has a keen sense of\nhumour.  Heroes he learns to understand and to admire in books; but he is\nnot forward to recognise the heroic under the traits of any contemporary\nman, and least of all in a brawling, dirty, and eccentric teacher.  But\nas the years went by, and the scholars of Yoshida continued in vain to\nlook around them for the abstractly perfect, and began more and more to\nunderstand the drift of his instructions, they learned to look back upon\ntheir comic school-master as upon the noblest of mankind.\n\nThe last act of this brief and full existence was already near at hand.\nSome of his work was done; for already there had been Dutch teachers\nadmitted into Nangasaki, and the country at large was keen for the new\nlearning.  But though the renaissance had begun, it was impeded and\ndangerously threatened by the power of the Shogun.  His minister—the same\nwho was afterwards assassinated in the snow in the very midst of his\nbodyguard—not only held back pupils from going to the Dutchmen, but by\nspies and detectives, by imprisonment and death, kept thinning out of\nJapan the most intelligent and active spirits.  It is the old story of a\npower upon its last legs—learning to the bastille, and courage to the\nblock; when there are none left but sheep and donkeys, the State will\nhave been saved.  But a man must not think to cope with a Revolution; nor\na minister, however fortified with guards, to hold in check a country\nthat had given birth to such men as Yoshida and his soldier-follower.\nThe violence of the ministerial Tarquin only served to direct attention\nto the illegality of his master’s rule; and people began to turn their\nallegiance from Yeddo and the Shogun to the long-forgotten Mikado in his\nseclusion at Kioto.  At this juncture, whether in consequence or not, the\nrelations between these two rulers became strained; and the Shogun’s\nminister set forth for Kioto to put another affront upon the rightful\nsovereign.  The circumstance was well fitted to precipitate events.  It\nwas a piece of religion to defend the Mikado; it was a plain piece of\npolitical righteousness to oppose a tyrannical and bloody usurpation.  To\nYoshida the moment for action seemed to have arrived.  He was himself\nstill confined in Choshu.  Nothing was free but his intelligence; but\nwith that he sharpened a sword for the Shogun’s minister.  A party of his\nfollowers were to waylay the tyrant at a village on the Yeddo and Kioto\nroad, present him with a petition, and put him to the sword.  But Yoshida\nand his friends were closely observed; and the too great expedition of\ntwo of the conspirators, a boy of eighteen and his brother, wakened the\nsuspicion of the authorities, and led to a full discovery of the plot and\nthe arrest of all who were concerned.\n\nIn Yeddo, to which he was taken, Yoshida was thrown again into a strict\nconfinement.  But he was not left destitute of sympathy in this last hour\nof trial.  In the next cell lay one Kusákabé, a reformer from the\nsouthern highlands of Satzuma.  They were in prison for different plots\nindeed, but for the same intention; they shared the same beliefs and the\nsame aspirations for Japan; many and long were the conversations they\nheld through the prison wall, and dear was the sympathy that soon united\nthem.  It fell first to the lot of Kusákabé to pass before the judges;\nand when sentence had been pronounced he was led towards the place of\ndeath below Yoshida’s window.  To turn the head would have been to\nimplicate his fellow-prisoner; but he threw him a look from his eye, and\nbade him farewell in a loud voice, with these two Chinese verses:—\n\n    “It is better to be a crystal and be broken,\n    Than to remain perfect like a tile upon the housetop.”\n\nSo Kusákabé, from the highlands of Satzuma, passed out of the theatre of\nthis world.  His death was like an antique worthy’s.\n\nA little after, and Yoshida too must appear before the Court.  His last\nscene was of a piece with his career, and fitly crowned it.  He seized on\nthe opportunity of a public audience, confessed and gloried in his\ndesign, and, reading his auditors a lesson in the history of their\ncountry, told at length the illegality of the Shogun’s power and the\ncrimes by which its exercise was sullied.  So, having said his say for\nonce, he was led forth and executed, thirty-one years old.\n\nA military engineer, a bold traveller (at least in wish), a poet, a\npatriot, a schoolmaster, a friend to learning, a martyr to reform,—there\nare not many men, dying at seventy, who have served their country in such\nvarious characters.  He was not only wise and provident in thought, but\nsurely one of the fieriest of heroes in execution.  It is hard to say\nwhich is most remarkable—his capacity for command, which subdued his very\njailors; his hot, unflagging zeal; or his stubborn superiority to defeat.\nHe failed in each particular enterprise that he attempted; and yet we\nhave only to look at his country to see how complete has been his general\nsuccess.  His friends and pupils made the majority of leaders in that\nfinal Revolution, now some twelve years old; and many of them are, or\nwere until the other day, high placed among the rulers of Japan.  And\nwhen we see all round us these brisk intelligent students, with their\nstrange foreign air, we should never forget how Yoshida marched afoot\nfrom Choshu to Yeddo, and from Yeddo to Nangasaki, and from Nangasaki\nback again to Yeddo; how he boarded the American ship, his dress stuffed\nwith writing material; nor how he languished in prison, and finally gave\nhis death, as he had formerly given all his life and strength and\nleisure, to gain for his native land that very benefit which she now\nenjoys so largely.  It is better to be Yoshida and perish, than to be\nonly Sákuma and yet save the hide.  Kusákabé, of Satzuma, has said the\nword: it is better to be a crystal and be broken.\n\nI must add a word; for I hope the reader will not fail to perceive that\nthis is as much the story of a heroic people as that of a heroic man.  It\nis not enough to remember Yoshida; we must not forget the common soldier,\nnor Kusákabé, nor the boy of eighteen, Nomura, of Choshu, whose eagerness\nbetrayed the plot.  It is exhilarating to have lived in the same days\nwith these great-hearted gentlemen.  Only a few miles from us, to speak\nby the proportion of the universe, while I was droning over my lessons,\nYoshida was goading himself to be wakeful with the stings of the\nmosquito; and while you were grudging a penny income tax, Kusákabé was\nstepping to death with a noble sentence on his lips.\n\n\n\n\nFRANÇOIS VILLON, STUDENT, POET, AND HOUSEBREAKER.\n\n\nPERHAPS one of the most curious revolutions in literary history is the\nsudden bull’s-eye light cast by M. Longnon on the obscure existence of\nFrançois Villon. {192}  His book is not remarkable merely as a chapter of\nbiography exhumed after four centuries.  To readers of the poet it will\nrecall, with a flavour of satire, that characteristic passage in which he\nbequeaths his spectacles—with a humorous reservation of the case—to the\nhospital for blind paupers known as the Fifteen-Score.  Thus equipped,\nlet the blind paupers go and separate the good from the bad in the\ncemetery of the Innocents!  For his own part the poet can see no\ndistinction.  Much have the dead people made of their advantages.  What\ndoes it matter now that they have lain in state beds and nourished portly\nbodies upon cakes and cream!  Here they all lie, to be trodden in the\nmud; the large estate and the small, sounding virtue and adroit or\npowerful vice, in very much the same condition; and a bishop not to be\ndistinguished from a lamp-lighter with even the strongest spectacles.\n\nSuch was Villon’s cynical philosophy.  Four hundred years after his\ndeath, when surely all danger might be considered at an end, a pair of\ncritical spectacles have been applied to his own remains; and though he\nleft behind him a sufficiently ragged reputation from the first, it is\nonly after these four hundred years that his delinquencies have been\nfinally tracked home, and we can assign him to his proper place among the\ngood or wicked.  It is a staggering thought, and one that affords a fine\nfigure of the imperishability of men’s acts, that the stealth of the\nprivate inquiry office can be carried so far back into the dead and dusty\npast.  We are not so soon quit of our concerns as Villon fancied.  In the\nextreme of dissolution, when not so much as a man’s name is remembered,\nwhen his dust is scattered to the four winds, and perhaps the very grave\nand the very graveyard where he was laid to rest have been forgotten,\ndesecrated, and buried under populous towns,—even in this extreme let an\nantiquary fall across a sheet of manuscript, and the name will be\nrecalled, the old infamy will pop out into daylight like a toad out of a\nfissure in the rock, and the shadow of the shade of what was once a man\nwill be heartily pilloried by his descendants.  A little while ago and\nVillon was almost totally forgotten; then he was revived for the sake of\nhis verses; and now he is being revived with a vengeance in the detection\nof his misdemeanours.  How unsubstantial is this projection of a man’s\nexistence, which can lie in abeyance for centuries and then be brushed up\nagain and set forth for the consideration of posterity by a few dips in\nan antiquary’s inkpot!  This precarious tenure of fame goes a long way to\njustify those (and they are not few) who prefer cakes and cream in the\nimmediate present.\n\n\n\n\nA WILD YOUTH.\n\n\nFrançois de Montcorbier, _alias_ François des Loges, _alias_ François\nVillon, _alias_ Michel Mouton, Master of Arts in the University of Paris,\nwas born in that city in the summer of 1431.  It was a memorable year for\nFrance on other and higher considerations.  A great-hearted girl and a\npoor-hearted boy made, the one her last, the other his first appearance\non the public stage of that unhappy country.  On the 30th of May the\nashes of Joan of Arc were thrown into the Seine, and on the 2d of\nDecember our Henry Sixth made his Joyous Entry dismally enough into\ndisaffected and depopulating Paris.  Sword and fire still ravaged the\nopen country.  On a single April Saturday twelve hundred persons, besides\nchildren, made their escape out of the starving capital.  The hangman, as\nis not uninteresting to note in connection with Master Francis, was kept\nhard at work in 1431; on the last of April and on the 4th of May alone,\nsixty-two bandits swung from Paris gibbets. {195}  A more confused or\ntroublous time it would have been difficult to select for a start in\nlife.  Not even a man’s nationality was certain; for the people of Paris\nthere was no such thing as a Frenchman.  The English were the English\nindeed, but the French were only the Armagnacs, whom, with Joan of Arc at\ntheir head, they had beaten back from under their ramparts not two years\nbefore.  Such public sentiment as they had centred about their dear Duke\nof Burgundy, and the dear Duke had no more urgent business than to keep\nout of their neighbourhood. . . .  At least, and whether he liked it or\nnot, our disreputable troubadour was tubbed and swaddled as a subject of\nthe English crown.\n\nWe hear nothing of Villon’s father except that he was poor and of mean\nextraction.  His mother was given piously, which does not imply very much\nin an old Frenchwoman, and quite uneducated.  He had an uncle, a monk in\nan abbey at Angers, who must have prospered beyond the family average,\nand was reported to be worth five or six hundred crowns.  Of this uncle\nand his money-box the reader will hear once more.  In 1448 Francis became\na student of the University of Paris; in 1450 he took the degree of\nBachelor, and in 1452 that of Master of Arts.  His _bourse_, or the sum\npaid weekly for his board, was of the amount of two sous.  Now two sous\nwas about the price of a pound of salt butter in the bad times of 1417;\nit was the price of half-a-pound in the worse times of 1419; and in 1444,\njust four years before Villon joined the University, it seems to have\nbeen taken as the average wage for a day’s manual labour. {196}  In\nshort, it cannot have been a very profuse allowance to keep a sharp-set\nlad in breakfast and supper for seven mortal days; and Villon’s share of\nthe cakes and pastry and general good cheer, to which he is never weary\nof referring, must have been slender from the first.\n\nThe educational arrangements of the University of Paris were, to our way\nof thinking, somewhat incomplete.  Worldly and monkish elements were\npresented in a curious confusion, which the youth might disentangle for\nhimself.  If he had an opportunity, on the one hand, of acquiring much\nhair-drawn divinity and a taste for formal disputation, he was put in the\nway of much gross and flaunting vice upon the other.  The lecture room of\na scholastic doctor was sometimes under the same roof with establishments\nof a very different and peculiarly unedifying order.  The students had\nextraordinary privileges, which by all accounts they abused\nextraordinarily.  And while some condemned themselves to an almost\nsepulchral regularity and seclusion, others fled the schools, swaggered\nin the street “with their thumbs in their girdle,” passed the night in\nriot, and behaved themselves as the worthy forerunners of Jehan Frollo in\nthe romance of _Notre Dame de Paris_.  Villon tells us himself that he\nwas among the truants, but we hardly needed his avowal.  The burlesque\nerudition in which he sometimes indulged implies no more than the merest\nsmattering of knowledge; whereas his acquaintance with blackguard haunts\nand industries could only have been acquired by early and consistent\nimpiety and idleness.  He passed his degrees, it is true; but some of us\nwho have been to modern universities will make their own reflections on\nthe value of the test.  As for his three pupils, Colin Laurent, Girard\nGossouyn, and Jehan Marceau—if they were really his pupils in any serious\nsense—what can we say but God help them!  And sure enough, by his own\ndescription, they turned out as ragged, rowdy, and ignorant as was to be\nlooked for from the views and manners of their rare preceptor.\n\nAt some time or other, before or during his university career, the poet\nwas adopted by Master Guillaume de Villon, chaplain of Saint\nBenoît-le-Bétourné near the Sorbonne.  From him he borrowed the surname\nby which he is known to posterity.  It was most likely from his house,\ncalled the _Porte Rouge_, and situated in a garden in the cloister of St.\nBenoît, that Master Francis heard the bell of the Sorbonne ring out the\nAngelus while he was finishing his _Small Testament_ at Christmastide in\n1456.  Towards this benefactor he usually gets credit for a respectable\ndisplay of gratitude.  But with his trap and pitfall style of writing, it\nis easy to make too sure.  His sentiments are about as much to be relied\non as those of a professional beggar; and in this, as in so many other\nmatters, he comes towards us whining and piping the eye, and goes off\nagain with a whoop and his finger to his nose.  Thus, he calls Guillaume\nde Villon his “more than father,” thanks him with a great show of\nsincerity for having helped him out of many scrapes, and bequeaths him\nhis portion of renown.  But the portion of renown which belonged to a\nyoung thief, distinguished (if, at the period when he wrote this legacy,\nhe was distinguished at all) for having written some more or less obscene\nand scurrilous ballads, must have been little fitted to gratify the\nself-respect or increase the reputation of a benevolent ecclesiastic.\nThe same remark applies to a subsequent legacy of the poet’s library,\nwith specification of one work which was plainly neither decent nor\ndevout.  We are thus left on the horns of a dilemma.  If the chaplain was\na godly, philanthropic personage, who had tried to graft good principles\nand good behaviour on this wild slip of an adopted son, these jesting\nlegacies would obviously cut him to the heart.  The position of an\nadopted son towards his adoptive father is one full of delicacy; where a\nman lends his name he looks for great consideration.  And this legacy of\nVillon’s portion of renown may be taken as the mere fling of an\nunregenerate scapegrace who has wit enough to recognise in his own shame\nthe readiest weapon of offence against a prosy benefactor’s feelings.\nThe gratitude of Master Francis figures, on this reading, as a frightful\n_minus_ quantity.  If, on the other hand, those jests were given and\ntaken in good humour, the whole relation between the pair degenerates\ninto the unedifying complicity of a debauched old chaplain and a witty\nand dissolute young scholar.  At this rate the house with the red door\nmay have rung with the most mundane minstrelsy; and it may have been\nbelow its roof that Villon, through a hole in the plaster, studied, as he\ntells us, the leisures of a rich ecclesiastic.\n\nIt was, perhaps, of some moment in the poet’s life that he should have\ninhabited the cloister of Saint Benoît.  Three of the most remarkable\namong his early acquaintances are Catherine de Vausselles, for whom he\nentertained a short-lived affection and an enduring and most unmanly\nresentment; Regnier de Montigny, a young blackguard of good birth; and\nColin de Cayeux, a fellow with a marked aptitude for picking locks.  Now\nwe are on a foundation of mere conjecture, but it is at least curious to\nfind that two of the canons of Saint Benoît answered respectively to the\nnames of Pierre de Vaucel and Etienne de Montigny, and that there was a\nhouseholder called Nicolas de Cayeux in a street—the Rue des Poirées—in\nthe immediate neighbourhood of the cloister.  M. Longnon is almost ready\nto identify Catherine as the niece of Pierre; Regnier as the nephew of\nEtienne, and Colin as the son of Nicolas.  Without going so far, it must\nbe owned that the approximation of names is significant.  As we go on to\nsee the part played by each of these persons in the sordid melodrama of\nthe poet’s life, we shall come to regard it as even more notable.  Is it\nnot Clough who has remarked that, after all, everything lies in\njuxtaposition?  Many a man’s destiny has been settled by nothing\napparently more grave than a pretty face on the opposite side of the\nstreet and a couple of bad companions round the corner.\n\nCatherine de Vausselles (or de Vaucel—the change is within the limits of\nVillon’s licence) had plainly delighted in the poet’s conversation; near\nneighbours or not, they were much together and Villon made no secret of\nhis court, and suffered himself to believe that his feeling was repaid in\nkind.  This may have been an error from the first, or he may have\nestranged her by subsequent misconduct or temerity.  One can easily\nimagine Villon an impatient wooer.  One thing, at least, is sure: that\nthe affair terminated in a manner bitterly humiliating to Master Francis.\nIn presence of his lady-love, perhaps under her window and certainly with\nher connivance, he was unmercifully thrashed by one Noë le Joly—beaten,\nas he says himself, like dirty linen on the washing-board.  It is\ncharacteristic that his malice had notably increased between the time\nwhen he wrote the _Small Testament_ immediately on the back of the\noccurrence, and the time when he wrote the _Large Testament_ five years\nafter.  On the latter occasion nothing is too bad for his “damsel with\nthe twisted nose,” as he calls her.  She is spared neither hint nor\naccusation, and he tells his messenger to accost her with the vilest\ninsults.  Villon, it is thought, was out of Paris when these amenities\nescaped his pen; or perhaps the strong arm of Noë le Joly would have been\nagain in requisition.  So ends the love story, if love story it may\nproperly be called.  Poets are not necessarily fortunate in love; but\nthey usually fall among more romantic circumstances and bear their\ndisappointment with a better grace.\n\nThe neighbourhood of Regnier de Montigny and Colin de Cayeux was probably\nmore influential on his after life than the contempt of Catherine.  For a\nman who is greedy of all pleasures, and provided with little money and\nless dignity of character, we may prophesy a safe and speedy voyage\ndownward.  Humble or even truckling virtue may walk unspotted in this\nlife.  But only those who despise the pleasures can afford to despise the\nopinion of the world.  A man of a strong, heady temperament, like Villon,\nis very differently tempted.  His eyes lay hold on all provocations\ngreedily, and his heart flames up at a look into imperious desire; he is\nsnared and broached-to by anything and everything, from a pretty face to\na piece of pastry in a cookshop window; he will drink the rinsing of the\nwine cup, stay the latest at the tavern party; tap at the lit windows,\nfollow the sound of singing, and beat the whole neighbourhood for another\nreveller, as he goes reluctantly homeward; and grudge himself every hour\nof sleep as a black empty period in which he cannot follow after\npleasure.  Such a person is lost if he have not dignity, or, failing\nthat, at least pride, which is its shadow and in many ways its\nsubstitute.  Master Francis, I fancy, would follow his own eager\ninstincts without much spiritual struggle.  And we soon find him fallen\namong thieves in sober, literal earnest, and counting as acquaintances\nthe most disreputable people he could lay his hands on: fellows who stole\nducks in Paris Moat; sergeants of the criminal court, and archers of the\nwatch; blackguards who slept at night under the butchers’ stalls, and for\nwhom the aforesaid archers peered about carefully with lanterns; Regnier\nde Montigny, Colin de Cayeux, and their crew, all bound on a favouring\nbreeze towards the gallows; the disorderly abbess of Port Royal, who went\nabout at fair time with soldiers and thieves, and conducted her abbey on\nthe queerest principles, and most likely Perette Mauger, the great Paris\nreceiver of stolen goods, not yet dreaming, poor woman! of the last scene\nof her career when Henry Cousin, executor of the high justice, shall bury\nher, alive and most reluctant, in front of the new Montigny gibbet. {204}\nNay, our friend soon began to take a foremost rank in this society.  He\ncould string off verses, which is always an agreeable talent; and he\ncould make himself useful in many other ways.  The whole ragged army of\nBohemia, and whosoever loved good cheer without at all loving to work and\npay for it, are addressed in contemporary verses as the “Subjects of\nFrançois Villon.”  He was a good genius to all hungry and unscrupulous\npersons; and became the hero of a whole legendary cycle of tavern tricks\nand cheateries.  At best, these were doubtful levities, rather too\nthievish for a schoolboy, rather too gamesome for a thief.  But he would\nnot linger long in this equivocal border land.  He must soon have\ncomplied with his surroundings.  He was one who would go where the\ncannikin clinked, not caring who should pay; and from supping in the\nwolves’ den, there is but a step to hunting with the pack.  And here, as\nI am on the chapter of his degradation, I shall say all I mean to say\nabout its darkest expression, and be done with it for good.  Some\ncharitable critics see no more than a _jeu d’esprit_, a graceful and\ntrifling exercise of the imagination, in the grimy ballad of Fat Peg\n(_Grosse Margot_).  I am not able to follow these gentlemen to this\npolite extreme.  Out of all Villon’s works that ballad stands forth in\nflaring reality, gross and ghastly, as a thing written in a contraction\nof disgust.  M. Longnon shows us more and more clearly at every page that\nwe are to read our poet literally, that his names are the names of real\npersons, and the events he chronicles were actual events.  But even if\nthe tendency of criticism had run the other way, this ballad would have\ngone far to prove itself.  I can well understand the reluctance of worthy\npersons in this matter; for of course it is unpleasant to think of a man\nof genius as one who held, in the words of Marina to Boult—\n\n       “A place, for which the pained’st fiend\n    Of hell would not in reputation change.”\n\nBut beyond this natural unwillingness, the whole difficulty of the case\nsprings from a highly virtuous ignorance of life.  Paris now is not so\ndifferent from the Paris of then; and the whole of the doings of Bohemia\nare not written in the sugar-candy pastorals of Murger.  It is really not\nat all surprising that a young man of the fifteenth century, with a knack\nof making verses, should accept his bread upon disgraceful terms.  The\nrace of those who do is not extinct; and some of them to this day write\nthe prettiest verses imaginable. . . .  After this, it were impossible\nfor Master Francis to fall lower: to go and steal for himself would be an\nadmirable advance from every point of view, divine or human.\n\nAnd yet it is not as a thief, but as a homicide, that he makes his first\nappearance before angry justice.  On June 5, 1455, when he was about\ntwenty-four, and had been Master of Arts for a matter of three years, we\nbehold him for the first time quite definitely.  Angry justice had, as it\nwere, photographed him in the act of his homicide; and M. Longnon,\nrummaging among old deeds, has turned up the negative and printed it off\nfor our instruction.  Villon had been supping—copiously we may\nbelieve—and sat on a stone bench in front of the Church of St. Benoît, in\ncompany with a priest called Gilles and a woman of the name of Isabeau.\nIt was nine o’clock, a mighty late hour for the period, and evidently a\nfine summer’s night.  Master Francis carried a mantle, like a prudent\nman, to keep him from the dews (_serain_), and had a sword below it\ndangling from his girdle.  So these three dallied in front of St. Benoît,\ntaking their pleasure (_pour soy esbatre_).  Suddenly there arrived upon\nthe scene a priest, Philippe Chermoye or Sermaise, also with sword and\ncloak, and accompanied by one Master Jehan le Mardi.  Sermaise, according\nto Villon’s account, which is all we have to go upon, came up blustering\nand denying God; as Villon rose to make room for him upon the bench,\nthrust him rudely back into his place; and finally drew his sword and cut\nopen his lower lip, by what I should imagine was a very clumsy stroke.\nUp to this point, Villon professes to have been a model of courtesy, even\nof feebleness: and the brawl, in his version, reads like the fable of the\nwolf and the lamb.  But now the lamb was roused; he drew his sword,\nstabbed Sermaise in the groin, knocked him on the head with a big stone,\nand then, leaving him to his fate, went away to have his own lip doctored\nby a barber of the name of Fouquet.  In one version, he says that Gilles,\nIsabeau, and Le Mardi ran away at the first high words, and that he and\nSermaise had it out alone; in another, Le Mardi is represented as\nreturning and wresting Villon’s sword from him: the reader may please\nhimself.  Sermaise was picked up, lay all that night in the prison of\nSaint Benoît, where he was examined by an official of the Châtelet and\nexpressly pardoned Villon, and died on the following Saturday in the\nHôtel Dieu.\n\nThis, as I have said, was in June.  Not before January of the next year\ncould Villon extract a pardon from the king; but while his hand was in,\nhe got two.  One is for “François des Loges, alias (_autrement dit_) de\nVillon;” and the other runs in the name of François de Montcorbier.  Nay,\nit appears there was a further complication; for in the narrative of the\nfirst of these documents, it is mentioned that he passed himself off upon\nFouquet, the barber-surgeon, as one Michel Mouton.  M. Longnon has a\ntheory that this unhappy accident with Sermaise was the cause of Villon’s\nsubsequent irregularities; and that up to that moment he had been the\npink of good behaviour.  But the matter has to my eyes a more dubious\nair.  A pardon necessary for Des Loges and another for Montcorbier? and\nthese two the same person? and one or both of them known by the _alias\nof_ Villon, however honestly come by? and lastly, in the heat of the\nmoment, a fourth name thrown out with an assured countenance?  A ship is\nnot to be trusted that sails under so many colours.  This is not the\nsimple bearing of innocence.  No—the young master was already treading\ncrooked paths; already, he would start and blench at a hand upon his\nshoulder, with the look we know so well in the face of Hogarth’s Idle\nApprentice; already, in the blue devils, he would see Henry Cousin, the\nexecutor of high justice, going in dolorous procession towards\nMontfaucon, and hear the wind and the birds crying around Paris gibbet.\n\n\n\nA GANG OF THIEVES.\n\n\nIn spite of the prodigious number of people who managed to get hanged,\nthe fifteenth century was by no means a bad time for criminals.  A great\nconfusion of parties and great dust of fighting favoured the escape of\nprivate housebreakers and quiet fellows who stole ducks in Paris Moat.\nPrisons were leaky; and as we shall see, a man with a few crowns in his\npocket and perhaps some acquaintance among the officials, could easily\nslip out and become once more a free marauder.  There was no want of a\nsanctuary where he might harbour until troubles blew by; and accomplices\nhelped each other with more or less good faith.  Clerks, above all, had\nremarkable facilities for a criminal way of life; for they were\nprivileged, except in cases of notorious incorrigibility, to be plucked\nfrom the hands of rude secular justice and tried by a tribunal of their\nown.  In 1402, a couple of thieves, both clerks of the University, were\ncondemned to death by the Provost of Paris.  As they were taken to\nMontfaucon, they kept crying “high and clearly” for their benefit of\nclergy, but were none the less pitilessly hanged and gibbeted.  Indignant\nAlma Mater interfered before the king; and the Provost was deprived of\nall royal offices, and condemned to return the bodies and erect a great\nstone cross, on the road from Paris to the gibbet graven with the\neffigies of these two holy martyrs. {210}  We shall hear more of the\nbenefit of clergy; for after this the reader will not be surprised to\nmeet with thieves in the shape of tonsured clerks, or even priests and\nmonks.\n\nTo a knot of such learned pilferers our poet certainly belonged; and by\nturning over a few more of M. Longnon’s negatives, we shall get a clear\nidea of their character and doings.  Montigny and De Cayeux are names\nalready known; Guy Tabary, Petit-Jehan, Dom Nicolas, little Thibault, who\nwas both clerk and goldsmith, and who made picklocks and melted plate for\nhimself and his companions—with these the reader has still to become\nacquainted.  Petit-Jehan and De Cayeux were handy fellows and enjoyed a\nuseful pre-eminence in honour of their doings with the picklock.\n“_Dictus des Cahyeus est fortis operator crochetorum_,” says Tabary’s\ninterrogation, “_sed dictus Petit-Jehan_, _ejus socius_, _est forcius\noperator_.”  But the flower of the flock was little Thibault; it was\nreported that no lock could stand before him; he had a persuasive hand;\nlet us salute capacity wherever we may find it.  Perhaps the term _gang_\nis not quite properly applied to the persons whose fortunes we are now\nabout to follow; rather they were independent malefactors, socially\nintimate, and occasionally joining together for some serious operation\njust as modern stockjobbers form a syndicate for an important loan.  Nor\nwere they at all particular to any branch of misdoing.  They did not\nscrupulously confine themselves to a single sort of theft, as I hear is\ncommon among modern thieves.  They were ready for anything, from\npitch-and-toss to manslaughter.  Montigny, for instance, had neglected\nneither of these extremes, and we find him accused of cheating at games\nof hazard on the one hand, and on the other of the murder of one Thevenin\nPensete in a house by the Cemetery of St. John.  If time had only spared\nus some particulars, might not this last have furnished us with the\nmatter of a grisly winter’s tale?\n\nAt Christmas-time in 1456, readers of Villon will remember that he was\nengaged on the _Small Testament_.  About the same period, _circa festum\nnativitatis Domini_, he took part in a memorable supper at the Mule\nTavern, in front of the Church of St. Mathurin.  Tabary, who seems to\nhave been very much Villon’s creature, had ordered the supper in the\ncourse of the afternoon.  He was a man who had had troubles in his time\nand languished in the Bishop of Paris’s prisons on a suspicion of picking\nlocks; confiding, convivial, not very astute—who had copied out a whole\nimproper romance with his own right hand.  This supper-party was to be\nhis first introduction to De Cayeux and Petit-Jehan, which was probably a\nmatter of some concern to the poor man’s muddy wits; in the sequel, at\nleast, he speaks of both with an undisguised respect, based on\nprofessional inferiority in the matter of picklocks.  Dom Nicolas, a\nPicardy monk, was the fifth and last at table.  When supper had been\ndespatched and fairly washed down, we may suppose, with white Baigneux or\nred Beaune, which were favourite wines among the fellowship, Tabary was\nsolemnly sworn over to secrecy on the night’s performances; and the party\nleft the Mule and proceeded to an unoccupied house belonging to Robert de\nSaint-Simon.  This, over a low wall, they entered without difficulty.\nAll but Tabary took off their upper garments; a ladder was found and\napplied to the high wall which separated Saint-Simon’s house from the\ncourt of the College of Navarre; the four fellows in their shirt-sleeves\n(as we might say) clambered over in a twinkling; and Master Guy Tabary\nremained alone beside the overcoats.  From the court the burglars made\ntheir way into the vestry of the chapel, where they found a large chest,\nstrengthened with iron bands and closed with four locks.  One of these\nlocks they picked, and then, by levering up the corner, forced the other\nthree.  Inside was a small coffer, of walnut wood, also barred with iron,\nbut fastened with only three locks, which were all comfortably picked by\nway of the keyhole.  In the walnut coffer—a joyous sight by our thieves’\nlantern—were five hundred crowns of gold.  There was some talk of opening\nthe aumries, where, if they had only known, a booty eight or nine times\ngreater lay ready to their hand; but one of the party (I have a humorous\nsuspicion it was Dom Nicolas, the Picardy monk) hurried them away.  It\nwas ten o’clock when they mounted the ladder; it was about midnight\nbefore Tabary beheld them coming back.  To him they gave ten crowns, and\npromised a share of a two-crown dinner on the morrow; whereat we may\nsuppose his mouth watered.  In course of time, he got wind of the real\namount of their booty and understood how scurvily he had been used; but\nhe seems to have borne no malice.  How could he, against such superb\noperators as Petit-Jehan and De Cayeux; or a person like Villon, who\ncould have made a new improper romance out of his own head, instead of\nmerely copying an old one with mechanical right hand?\n\nThe rest of the winter was not uneventful for the gang.  First they made\na demonstration against the Church of St. Mathurin after chalices, and\nwere ignominiously chased away by barking dogs.  Then Tabary fell out\nwith Casin Chollet, one of the fellows who stole ducks in Paris Moat, who\nsubsequently became a sergeant of the Châtelet and distinguished himself\nby misconduct, followed by imprisonment and public castigation, during\nthe wars of Louis Eleventh.  The quarrel was not conducted with a proper\nregard to the king’s peace, and the pair publicly belaboured each other\nuntil the police stepped in, and Master Tabary was cast once more into\nthe prisons of the Bishop.  While he still lay in durance, another job\nwas cleverly executed by the band in broad daylight, at the Augustine\nMonastery.  Brother Guillaume Coiffier was beguiled by an accomplice to\nSt. Mathurin to say mass; and during his absence, his chamber was entered\nand five or six hundred crowns in money and some silver plate\nsuccessfully abstracted.  A melancholy man was Coiffier on his return!\nEight crowns from this adventure were forwarded by little Thibault to the\nincarcerated Tabary; and with these he bribed the jailor and reappeared\nin Paris taverns.  Some time before or shortly after this, Villon set out\nfor Angers, as he had promised in the _Small Testament_.  The object of\nthis excursion was not merely to avoid the presence of his cruel mistress\nor the strong arm of Noë le Joly, but to plan a deliberate robbery on his\nuncle the monk.  As soon as he had properly studied the ground, the\nothers were to go over in force from Paris—picklocks and all—and away\nwith my uncle’s strongbox!  This throws a comical sidelight on his own\naccusation against his relatives, that they had “forgotten natural duty”\nand disowned him because he was poor.  A poor relation is a distasteful\ncircumstance at the best, but a poor relation who plans deliberate\nrobberies against those of his blood, and trudges hundreds of weary\nleagues to put them into execution, is surely a little on the wrong side\nof toleration.  The uncle at Angers may have been monstrously undutiful;\nbut the nephew from Paris was upsides with him.\n\nOn the 23d April, that venerable and discreet person, Master Pierre\nMarchand, Curate and Prior of Paray-le-Monial, in the diocese of\nChartres, arrived in Paris and put up at the sign of the Three\nChandeliers, in the Rue de la Huchette.  Next day, or the day after, as\nhe was breakfasting at the sign of the Armchair, he fell into talk with\ntwo customers, one of whom was a priest and the other our friend Tabary.\nThe idiotic Tabary became mighty confidential as to his past life.\nPierre Marchand, who was an acquaintance of Guillaume Coiffier’s and had\nsympathised with him over his loss, pricked up his ears at the mention of\npicklocks, and led on the transcriber of improper romances from one thing\nto another, until they were fast friends.  For picklocks the Prior of\nParay professed a keen curiosity; but Tabary, upon some late alarm, had\nthrown all his into the Seine.  Let that be no difficulty, however, for\nwas there not little Thibault, who could make them of all shapes and\nsizes, and to whom Tabary, smelling an accomplice, would be only too glad\nto introduce his new acquaintance?  On the morrow, accordingly, they met;\nand Tabary, after having first wet his whistle at the prior’s expense,\nled him to Notre Dame and presented him to four or five “young\ncompanions,” who were keeping sanctuary in the church.  They were all\nclerks, recently escaped, like Tabary himself, from the episcopal\nprisons.  Among these we may notice Thibault, the operator, a little\nfellow of twenty-six, wearing long hair behind.  The Prior expressed,\nthrough Tabary, his anxiety to become their accomplice and altogether\nsuch as they were (_de leur sorte et de leurs complices_).  Mighty polite\nthey showed themselves, and made him many fine speeches in return.  But\nfor all that, perhaps because they had longer heads than Tabary, perhaps\nbecause it is less easy to wheedle men in a body, they kept obstinately\nto generalities and gave him no information as to their exploits, past,\npresent, or to come.  I suppose Tabary groaned under this reserve; for no\nsooner were he and the Prior out of the church than he fairly emptied his\nheart to him, gave him full details of many hanging matters in the past,\nand explained the future intentions of the band.  The scheme of the hour\nwas to rob another Augustine monk, Robert de la Porte, and in this the\nPrior agreed to take a hand with simulated greed.  Thus, in the course of\ntwo days, he had turned this wineskin of a Tabary inside out.  For a\nwhile longer the farce was carried on; the Prior was introduced to\nPetit-Jehan, whom he describes as a little, very smart man of thirty,\nwith a black beard and a short jacket; an appointment was made and broken\nin the de la Porte affair; Tabary had some breakfast at the Prior’s\ncharge and leaked out more secrets under the influence of wine and\nfriendship; and then all of a sudden, on the 17th of May, an alarm sprang\nup, the Prior picked up his skirts and walked quietly over to the\nChâtelet to make a deposition, and the whole band took to their heels and\nvanished out of Paris and the sight of the police.\n\nVanish as they like, they all go with a clog about their feet.  Sooner or\nlater, here or there, they will be caught in the fact, and ignominiously\nsent home.  From our vantage of four centuries afterwards, it is odd and\npitiful to watch the order in which the fugitives are captured and\ndragged in.\n\nMontigny was the first.  In August of that same year, he was laid by the\nheels on many grievous counts; sacrilegious robberies, frauds,\nincorrigibility, and that bad business about Thevenin Pensete in the\nhouse by the cemetery of St. John.  He was reclaimed by the\necclesiastical authorities as a clerk; but the claim was rebutted on the\nscore of incorrigibility, and ultimately fell to the ground; and he was\ncondemned to death by the Provost of Paris.  It was a very rude hour for\nMontigny, but hope was not yet over.  He was a fellow of some birth; his\nfather had been king’s pantler; his sister, probably married to some one\nabout the Court, was in the family way, and her health would be\nendangered if the execution was proceeded with.  So down comes Charles\nthe Seventh with letters of mercy, commuting the penalty to a year in a\ndungeon on bread and water, and a pilgrimage to the shrine of St. James\nin Galicia.  Alas! the document was incomplete; it did not contain the\nfull tale of Montigny’s enormities; it did not recite that he had been\ndenied benefit of clergy, and it said nothing about Thevenin Pensete.\nMontigny’s hour was at hand.  Benefit of clergy, honourable descent from\nking’s pantler, sister in the family way, royal letters of\ncommutation—all were of no avail.  He had been in prison in Rouen, in\nTours, in Bordeaux, and four times already in Paris; and out of all these\nhe had come scatheless; but now he must make a little excursion as far as\nMontfaucon with Henry Cousin, executor of high justice.  There let him\nswing among the carrion crows.\n\nAbout a year later, in July 1458, the police laid hands on Tabary.\nBefore the ecclesiastical commissary he was twice examined, and, on the\nlatter occasion, put to the question ordinary and extraordinary.  What a\ndismal change from pleasant suppers at the Mule, where he sat in triumph\nwith expert operators and great wits!  He is at the lees of life, poor\nrogue; and those fingers which once transcribed improper romances are now\nagonisingly stretched upon the rack.  We have no sure knowledge, but we\nmay have a shrewd guess of the conclusion.  Tabary, the admirer, would go\nthe same way as those whom he admired.\n\nThe last we hear of is Colin de Cayeux.  He was caught in autumn 1460, in\nthe great Church of St. Leu d’Esserens, which makes so fine a figure in\nthe pleasant Oise valley between Creil and Beaumont.  He was reclaimed by\nno less than two bishops; but the Procureur for the Provost held fast by\nincorrigible Colin.  1460 was an ill-starred year: for justice was making\na clean sweep of “poor and indigent persons, thieves, cheats, and\nlockpickers,” in the neighbourhood of Paris; {220a} and Colin de Cayeux,\nwith many others, was condemned to death and hanged. {220b}\n\n\n\nVILLON AND THE GALLOWS.\n\n\nVillon was still absent on the Angers expedition when the Prior of Paray\nsent such a bombshell among his accomplices; and the dates of his return\nand arrest remain undiscoverable.  M. Campaux plausibly enough opined for\nthe autumn of 1457, which would make him closely follow on Montigny, and\nthe first of those denounced by the Prior to fall into the toils.  We may\nsuppose, at least, that it was not long thereafter; we may suppose him\ncompeted for between lay and clerical Courts; and we may suppose him\nalternately pert and impudent, humble and fawning, in his defence.  But\nat the end of all supposing, we come upon some nuggets of fact.  For\nfirst, he was put to the question by water.  He who had tossed off so\nmany cups of white Baigneux or red Beaune, now drank water through linen\nfolds, until his bowels were flooded and his heart stood still.  After so\nmuch raising of the elbow, so much outcry of fictitious thirst, here at\nlast was enough drinking for a lifetime.  Truly, of our pleasant vices,\nthe gods make whips to scourge us.  And secondly he was condemned to be\nhanged.  A man may have been expecting a catastrophe for years, and yet\nfind himself unprepared when it arrives.  Certainly, Villon found, in\nthis legitimate issue of his career, a very staggering and grave\nconsideration.  Every beast, as he says, clings bitterly to a whole skin.\nIf everything is lost, and even honour, life still remains; nay, and it\nbecomes, like the ewe lamb in Nathan’s parable, as dear as all the rest.\n“Do you fancy,” he asks, in a lively ballad, “that I had not enough\nphilosophy under my hood to cry out: ‘I appeal’?  If I had made any bones\nabout the matter, I should have been planted upright in the fields, by\nthe St. Denis Road”—Montfaucon being on the way to St. Denis.  An appeal\nto Parliament, as we saw in the case of Colin de Cayeux, did not\nnecessarily lead to an acquittal or a commutation; and while the matter\nwas pending, our poet had ample opportunity to reflect on his position.\nHanging is a sharp argument, and to swing with many others on the gibbet\nadds a horrible corollary for the imagination.  With the aspect of\nMontfaucon he was well acquainted; indeed, as the neighbourhood appears\nto have been sacred to junketing and nocturnal picnics of wild young men\nand women, he had probably studied it under all varieties of hour and\nweather.  And now, as he lay in prison waiting the mortal push, these\ndifferent aspects crowded back on his imagination with a new and\nstartling significance; and he wrote a ballad, by way of epitaph for\nhimself and his companions, which remains unique in the annals of\nmankind.  It is, in the highest sense, a piece of his biography:—\n\n    “La pluye nous a debuez et lavez,\n    Et le soleil dessechez et noirciz;\n    Pies, corbeaulx, nous ont les yeux cavez,\n    Et arrachez la barbe et les sourcilz.\n    Jamais, nul temps, nous ne sommes rassis;\n    Puis ça, puis là, comme le vent varie,\n    A son plaisir sans cesser nous charie,\n    Plus becquetez d’oiscaulx que dez à couldre.\n    Ne soyez donc de nostre confrairie,\n    Mais priez Dieu que tous nous vueille absouldre.”\n\nHere is some genuine thieves’ literature after so much that was spurious;\nsharp as an etching, written with a shuddering soul.  There is an\nintensity of consideration in the piece that shows it to be the\ntranscript of familiar thoughts.  It is the quintessence of many a\ndoleful nightmare on the straw, when he felt himself swing helpless in\nthe wind, and saw the birds turn about him, screaming and menacing his\neyes.\n\nAnd, after all, the Parliament changed his sentence into one of\nbanishment; and to Roussillon, in Dauphiny, our poet must carry his woes\nwithout delay.  Travellers between Lyons and Marseilles may remember a\nstation on the line, some way below Vienne, where the Rhone fleets\nseaward between vine-clad hills.  This was Villon’s Siberia.  It would be\na little warm in summer perhaps, and a little cold in winter in that\ndraughty valley between two great mountain fields; but what with the\nhills, and the racing river, and the fiery Rhone wines, he was little to\nbe pitied on the conditions of his exile.  Villon, in a remarkably bad\nballad, written in a breath, heartily thanked and fulsomely belauded the\nParliament; the _envoi_, like the proverbial postscript of a lady’s\nletter, containing the pith of his performance in a request for three\ndays’ delay to settle his affairs and bid his friends farewell.  He was\nprobably not followed out of Paris, like Antoine Fradin, the popular\npreacher, another exile of a few years later, by weeping multitudes;\n{224} but I daresay one or two rogues of his acquaintance would keep him\ncompany for a mile or so on the south road, and drink a bottle with him\nbefore they turned.  For banished people, in those days, seem to have set\nout on their own responsibility, in their own guard, and at their own\nexpense.  It was no joke to make one’s way from Paris to Roussillon alone\nand penniless in the fifteenth century.  Villon says he left a rag of his\ntails on every bush.  Indeed, he must have had many a weary tramp, many a\nslender meal, and many a to-do with blustering captains of the\nOrdonnance.  But with one of his light fingers, we may fancy that he took\nas good as he gave; for every rag of his tail, he would manage to\nindemnify himself upon the population in the shape of food, or wine, or\nringing money; and his route would be traceable across France and\nBurgundy by housewives and inn-keepers lamenting over petty thefts, like\nthe track of a single human locust.  A strange figure he must have cut in\nthe eyes of the good country people: this ragged, blackguard city poet,\nwith a smack of the Paris student, and a smack of the Paris street arab,\nposting along the highways, in rain or sun, among the green fields and\nvineyards.  For himself, he had no taste for rural loveliness; green\nfields and vineyards would be mighty indifferent to Master Francis; but\nhe would often have his tongue in his cheek at the simplicity of rustic\ndupes, and often, at city gates, he might stop to contemplate the gibbet\nwith its swinging bodies, and hug himself on his escape.\n\nHow long he stayed at Roussillon, how far he became the protégé of the\nBourbons, to whom that town belonged, or when it was that he took part,\nunder the auspices of Charles of Orleans, in a rhyming tournament to be\nreferred to once again in the pages of the present volume, are matters\nthat still remain in darkness, in spite of M. Longnon’s diligent\nrummaging among archives.  When we next find him, in summer 1461, alas!\nhe is once more in durance: this time at Méun-sur-Loire, in the prisons\nof Thibault d’Aussigny, Bishop of Orleans.  He had been lowered in a\nbasket into a noisome pit, where he lay, all summer, gnawing hard crusts\nand railing upon fate.  His teeth, he says, were like the teeth of a\nrake: a touch of haggard portraiture all the more real for being\nexcessive and burlesque, and all the more proper to the man for being a\ncaricature of his own misery.  His eyes were “bandaged with thick walls.”\nIt might blow hurricanes overhead; the lightning might leap in high\nheaven; but no word of all this reached him in his noisome pit.  “Il\nn’entre, ou gist, n’escler ni tourbillon.”  Above all, he was fevered\nwith envy and anger at the freedom of others; and his heart flowed over\ninto curses as he thought of Thibault d’Aussigny, walking the streets in\nGod’s sunlight, and blessing people with extended fingers.  So much we\nfind sharply lined in his own poems.  Why he was cast again into\nprison—how he had again managed to shave the gallows—this we know not,\nnor, from the destruction of authorities, are we ever likely to learn.\nBut on October 2d, 1461, or some day immediately preceding, the new King,\nLouis Eleventh, made his joyous entry into Méun.  Now it was a part of\nthe formality on such occasions for the new King to liberate certain\nprisoners; and so the basket was let down into Villon’s pit, and hastily\ndid Master Francis scramble in, and was most joyfully hauled up, and shot\nout, blinking and tottering, but once more a free man, into the blessed\nsun and wind.  Now or never is the time for verses!  Such a happy\nrevolution would turn the head of a stocking-weaver, and set him jingling\nrhymes.  And so—after a voyage to Paris, where he finds Montigny and De\nCayeux clattering, their bones upon the gibbet, and his three pupils\nroystering in Paris streets, “with their thumbs under their\ngirdles,”—down sits Master Francis to write his _Large Testament_, and\nperpetuate his name in a sort of glorious ignominy.\n\n\n\nTHE _LARGE TESTAMENT_.\n\n\nOf this capital achievement and, with it, of Villon’s style in general,\nit is here the place to speak.  The _Large Testament_ is a hurly-burly of\ncynical and sentimental reflections about life, jesting legacies to\nfriends and enemies, and, interspersed among these many admirable\nballades, both serious and absurd.  With so free a design, no thought\nthat occurred to him would need to be dismissed without expression; and\nhe could draw at full length the portrait of his own bedevilled soul, and\nof the bleak and blackguardly world which was the theatre of his exploits\nand sufferings.  If the reader can conceive something between the\nslap-dash inconsequence of Byron’s _Don Juan_ and the racy humorous\ngravity and brief noble touches that distinguish the vernacular poems of\nBurns, he will have formed some idea of Villon’s style.  To the latter\nwriter—except in the ballades, which are quite his own, and can be\nparalleled from no other language known to me—he bears a particular\nresemblance.  In common with Burns he has a certain rugged compression, a\nbrutal vivacity of epithet, a homely vigour, a delight in local\npersonalities, and an interest in many sides of life, that are often\ndespised and passed over by more effete and cultured poets.  Both also,\nin their strong, easy colloquial way, tend to become difficult and\nobscure; the obscurity in the case of Villon passing at times into the\nabsolute darkness of cant language.  They are perhaps the only two great\nmasters of expression who keep sending their readers to a glossary.\n\n“Shall we not dare to say of a thief,” asks Montaigne, “that he has a\nhandsome leg?”  It is a far more serious claim that we have to put\nforward in behalf of Villon.  Beside that of his contemporaries, his\nwriting, so full of colour, so eloquent, so picturesque, stands out in an\nalmost miraculous isolation.  If only one or two of the chroniclers could\nhave taken a leaf out of his book, history would have been a pastime, and\nthe fifteenth century as present to our minds as the age of Charles\nSecond.  This gallows-bird was the one great writer of his age and\ncountry, and initiated modern literature for France.  Boileau, long ago,\nin the period of perukes and snuff-boxes, recognised him as the first\narticulate poet in the language; and if we measure him, not by priority\nof merit, but living duration of influence, not on a comparison with\nobscure forerunners, but with great and famous successors, we shall\ninstal this ragged and disreputable figure in a far higher niche in\nglory’s temple than was ever dreamed of by the critic.  It is, in itself,\na memorable fact that, before 1542, in the very dawn of printing, and\nwhile modern France was in the making, the works of Villon ran through\nseven different editions.  Out of him flows much of Rabelais; and through\nRabelais, directly and indirectly, a deep, permanent, and growing\ninspiration.  Not only his style, but his callous pertinent way of\nlooking upon the sordid and ugly sides of life, becomes every day a more\nspecific feature in the literature of France.  And only the other year, a\nwork of some power appeared in Paris, and appeared with infinite scandal,\nwhich owed its whole inner significance and much of its outward form to\nthe study of our rhyming thief.\n\nThe world to which he introduces us is, as before said, blackguardly and\nbleak.  Paris swarms before us, full of famine, shame, and death; monks\nand the servants of great lords hold high wassail upon cakes and pastry;\nthe poor man licks his lips before the baker’s window; people with\npatched eyes sprawl all night under the stalls; chuckling Tabary\ntranscribes an improper romance; bare-bosomed lasses and ruffling\nstudents swagger in the streets; the drunkard goes stumbling homewards;\nthe graveyard is full of bones; and away on Montfaucon, Colin de Cayeux\nand Montigny hang draggled in the rain.  Is there nothing better to be\nseen than sordid misery and worthless joys?  Only where the poor old\nmother of the poet kneels in church below painted windows, and makes\ntremulous supplication to the Mother of God.\n\nIn our mixed world, full of green fields and happy lovers, where not long\nbefore, Joan of Arc had led one of the highest and noblest lives in the\nwhole story of mankind, this was all worth chronicling that our poet\ncould perceive.  His eyes were indeed sealed with his own filth.  He\ndwelt all his life in a pit more noisome than the dungeon at Méun.  In\nthe moral world, also, there are large phenomena not cognisable out of\nholes and corners.  Loud winds blow, speeding home deep-laden ships and\nsweeping rubbish from the earth; the lightning leaps and cleans the face\nof heaven; high purposes and brave passions shake and sublimate men’s\nspirits; and meanwhile, in the narrow dungeon of his soul, Villon is\nmumbling crusts and picking vermin.\n\nAlong with this deadly gloom of outlook, we must take another\ncharacteristic of his work: its unrivalled insincerity.  I can give no\nbetter similitude of this quality than I have given already: that he\ncomes up with a whine, and runs away with a whoop and his finger to his\nnose.  His pathos is that of a professional mendicant who should happen\nto be a man of genius; his levity that of a bitter street arab, full of\nbread.  On a first reading, the pathetic passages preoccupy the reader,\nand he is cheated out of an alms in the shape of sympathy.  But when the\nthing is studied the illusion fades away: in the transitions, above all,\nwe can detect the evil, ironical temper of the man; and instead of a\nflighty work, where many crude but genuine feelings tumble together for\nthe mastery as in the lists of tournament, we are tempted to think of the\n_Large Testament_ as of one long-drawn epical grimace, pulled by a\nmerry-andrew, who has found a certain despicable eminence over human\nrespect and human affections by perching himself astride upon the\ngallows.  Between these two views, at best, all temperate judgments will\nbe found to fall; and rather, as I imagine, towards the last.\n\nThere were two things on which he felt with perfect and, in one case,\neven threatening sincerity.\n\nThe first of these was an undisguised envy of those richer than himself.\nHe was for ever drawing a parallel, already exemplified from his own\nwords, between the happy life of the well-to-do and the miseries of the\npoor.  Burns, too proud and honest not to work, continued through all\nreverses to sing of poverty with a light, defiant note.  Béranger waited\ntill he was himself beyond the reach of want, before writing the _Old\nVagabond_ or _Jacques_.  Samuel Johnson, although he was very sorry to be\npoor, “was a great arguer for the advantages of poverty” in his ill days.\nThus it is that brave men carry their crosses, and smile with the fox\nburrowing in their vitals.  But Villon, who had not the courage to be\npoor with honesty, now whiningly implores our sympathy, now shows his\nteeth upon the dung-heap with an ugly snarl.  He envies bitterly, envies\npassionately.  Poverty, he protests, drives men to steal, as hunger makes\nthe wolf sally from the forest.  The poor, he goes on, will always have a\ncarping word to say, or, if that outlet be denied, nourish rebellious\nthoughts.  It is a calumny on the noble army of the poor.  Thousands in a\nsmall way of life, ay, and even in the smallest, go through life with\ntenfold as much honour and dignity and peace of mind, as the rich\ngluttons whose dainties and state-beds awakened Villon’s covetous temper.\nAnd every morning’s sun sees thousands who pass whistling to their toil.\nBut Villon was the “mauvais pauvre” defined by Victor Hugo, and, in its\nEnglish expression, so admirably stereotyped by Dickens.  He was the\nfirst wicked sansculotte.  He is the man of genius with the moleskin cap.\nHe is mighty pathetic and beseeching here in the street, but I would not\ngo down a dark road with him for a large consideration.\n\nThe second of the points on which he was genuine and emphatic was common\nto the middle ages; a deep and somewhat snivelling conviction of the\ntransitory nature of this life and the pity and horror of death.  Old age\nand the grave, with some dark and yet half-sceptical terror of an\nafter-world—these were ideas that clung about his bones like a disease.\nAn old ape, as he says, may play all the tricks in its repertory, and\nnone of them will tickle an audience into good humour.  “Tousjours vieil\nsynge est desplaisant.”  It is not the old jester who receives most\nrecognition at a tavern party, but the young fellow, fresh and handsome,\nwho knows the new slang, and carries off his vice with a certain air.  Of\nthis, as a tavern jester himself, he would be pointedly conscious.  As\nfor the women with whom he was best acquainted, his reflections on their\nold age, in all their harrowing pathos, shall remain in the original for\nme.  Horace has disgraced himself to something the same tune; but what\nHorace throws out with an ill-favoured laugh, Villon dwells on with an\nalmost maudlin whimper.\n\nIt is in death that he finds his truest inspiration in the swift and\nsorrowful change that overtakes beauty; in the strange revolution by\nwhich great fortunes and renowns are diminished to a handful of\nchurchyard dust; and in the utter passing away of what was once lovable\nand mighty.  It is in this that the mixed texture of his thought enables\nhim to reach such poignant and terrible effects, and to enchance pity\nwith ridicule, like a man cutting capers to a funeral march.  It is in\nthis, also, that he rises out of himself into the higher spheres of art.\nSo, in the ballade by which he is best known, he rings the changes on\nnames that once stood for beautiful and queenly women, and are now no\nmore than letters and a legend.  “Where are the snows of yester year?”\nruns the burden.  And so, in another not so famous, he passes in review\nthe different degrees of bygone men, from the holy Apostles and the\ngolden Emperor of the East, down to the heralds, pursuivants, and\ntrumpeters, who also bore their part in the world’s pageantries and ate\ngreedily at great folks’ tables: all this to the refrain of “So much\ncarry the winds away!”  Probably, there was some melancholy in his mind\nfor a yet lower grade, and Montigny and Colin de Cayeux clattering their\nbones on Paris gibbet.  Alas, and with so pitiful an experience of life,\nVillon can offer us nothing but terror and lamentation about death!  No\none has ever more skilfully communicated his own disenchantment; no one\never blown a more ear-piercing note of sadness.  This unrepentant thief\ncan attain neither to Christian confidence, nor to the spirit of the\nbright Greek saying, that whom the gods love die early.  It is a poor\nheart, and a poorer age, that cannot accept the conditions of life with\nsome heroic readiness.\n\n                                * * * * *\n\nThe date of the _Large Testament_ is the last date in the poet’s\nbiography.  After having achieved that admirable and despicable\nperformance, he disappears into the night from whence he came.  How or\nwhen he died, whether decently in bed or trussed up to a gallows, remains\na riddle for foolhardy commentators.  It appears his health had suffered\nin the pit at Méun; he was thirty years of age and quite bald; with the\nnotch in his under lip where Sermaise had struck him with the sword, and\nwhat wrinkles the reader may imagine.  In default of portraits, this is\nall I have been able to piece together, and perhaps even the baldness\nshould be taken as a figure of his destitution.  A sinister dog, in all\nlikelihood, but with a look in his eye, and the loose flexile mouth that\ngoes with wit and an overweening sensual temperament.  Certainly the\nsorriest figure on the rolls of fame.\n\n\n\n\nCHARLES OF ORLEANS.\n\n\nFOR one who was no great politician, nor (as men go) especially wise,\ncapable or virtuous, Charles of Orleans is more than usually enviable to\nall who love that better sort of fame which consists in being known not\nwidely, but intimately.  “To be content that time to come should know\nthere was such a man, not caring whether they knew more of him, or to\nsubsist under naked denominations, without deserts or noble acts,” is,\nsays Sir Thomas Browne, a frigid ambition.  It is to some more specific\nmemory that youth looks forward in its vigils.  Old kings are sometimes\ndisinterred in all the emphasis of life, the hands untainted by decay,\nthe beard that had so often wagged in camp or senate still spread upon\nthe royal bosom; and in busts and pictures, some similitude of the great\nand beautiful of former days is handed down.  In this way, public\ncuriosity may be gratified, but hardly any private aspiration after fame.\nIt is not likely that posterity will fall in love with us, but not\nimpossible that it may respect or sympathise; and so a man would rather\nleave behind him the portrait of his spirit than a portrait of his face,\n_figura animi magis quam corporis_. Of those who have thus survived\nthemselves most completely, left a sort of personal seduction behind them\nin the world, and retained, after death, the art of making friends,\nMontaigne and Samuel Johnson certainly stand first.  But we have\nportraits of all sorts of men, from august Cæsar to the king’s dwarf; and\nall sorts of portraits, from a Titian treasured in the Louvre to a\nprofile over the grocer’s chimney shelf.  And so in a less degree, but no\nless truly, than the spirit of Montaigne lives on in the delightful\nEssays, that of Charles of Orleans survives in a few old songs and old\naccount-books; and it is still in the choice of the reader to make this\nduke’s acquaintance, and, if their humours suit, become his friend.\n\n\n\nI.\n\n\nHis birth—if we are to argue from a man’s parents—was above his merit.\nIt is not merely that he was the grandson of one king, the father of\nanother, and the uncle of a third; but something more specious was to be\nlooked for from the son of his father, Louis de Valois, Duke of Orleans,\nbrother to the mad king Charles VI., lover of Queen Isabel, and the\nleading patron of art and one of the leading politicians in France.  And\nthe poet might have inherited yet higher virtues from his mother,\nValentina of Milan, a very pathetic figure of the age, the faithful wife\nof an unfaithful husband, and the friend of a most unhappy king.  The\nfather, beautiful, eloquent, and accomplished, exercised a strange\nfascination over his contemporaries; and among those who dip nowadays\ninto the annals of the time there are not many—and these few are little\nto be envied—who can resist the fascination of the mother.  All mankind\nowe her a debt of gratitude because she brought some comfort into the\nlife of the poor madman who wore the crown of France.\n\nBorn (May 1391) of such a noble stock, Charles was to know from the first\nall favours of nature and art.  His father’s gardens were the admiration\nof his contemporaries; his castles were situated in the most agreeable\nparts of France, and sumptuously adorned.  We have preserved, in an\ninventory of 1403, the description of tapestried rooms where Charles may\nhave played in childhood. {238}  “A green room, with the ceiling full of\nangels, and the _dossier_ of shepherds and shepherdesses seeming\n(_faisant contenance_) to eat nuts and cherries.  A room of gold, silk\nand worsted, with a device of little children in a river, and the sky\nfull of birds.  A room of green tapestry, showing a knight and lady at\nchess in a pavilion.  Another green room, with shepherdesses in a\ntrellised garden worked in gold and silk.  A carpet representing\ncherry-trees, where there is a fountain, and a lady gathering cherries in\na basin.”  These were some of the pictures over which his fancy might\nbusy itself of an afternoon, or at morning as he lay awake in bed.  With\nour deeper and more logical sense of life, we can have no idea how large\na space in the attention of mediæval men might be occupied by such\nfigured hangings on the wall.  There was something timid and purblind in\nthe view they had of the world.  Morally, they saw nothing outside of\ntraditional axioms; and little of the physical aspect of things entered\nvividly into their mind, beyond what was to be seen on church windows and\nthe walls and floors of palaces.  The reader will remember how Villon’s\nmother conceived of heaven and hell and took all her scanty stock of\ntheology from the stained glass that threw its light upon her as she\nprayed.  And there is scarcely a detail of external effect in the\nchronicles and romances of the time, but might have been borrowed at\nsecond hand from a piece of tapestry.  It was a stage in the history of\nmankind which we may see paralleled, to some extent, in the first infant\nschool, where the representations of lions and elephants alternate round\nthe wall with moral verses and trite presentments of the lesser virtues.\nSo that to live in a house of many pictures was tantamount, for the time,\nto a liberal education in itself.\n\nAt Charles’s birth an order of knighthood was inaugurated in his honour.\nAt nine years old, he was a squire; at eleven, he had the escort of a\nchaplain and a schoolmaster; at twelve, his uncle the king made him a\npension of twelve thousand livres d’or. {240a}  He saw the most brilliant\nand the most learned persons of France, in his father’s Court; and would\nnot fail to notice that these brilliant and learned persons were one and\nall engaged in rhyming.  Indeed, if it is difficult to realise the part\nplayed by pictures, it is perhaps even more difficult to realise that\nplayed by verses in the polite and active history of the age.  At the\nsiege of Pontoise, English and French exchanged defiant ballades over the\nwalls. {240b}  If a scandal happened, as in the loathsome thirty-third\nstory of the _Cent Nouvelles Nouvelles_, all the wits must make rondels\nand chansonettes, which they would hand from one to another with an\nunmanly sneer.  Ladies carried their favourite’s ballades in their\ngirdles. {241a}   Margaret of Scotland, all the world knows already,\nkissed Alain Chartier’s lips in honour of the many virtuous thoughts and\ngolden sayings they had uttered; but it is not so well known, that this\nprincess was herself the most industrious of poetasters, that she is\nsupposed to have hastened her death by her literary vigils, and sometimes\nwrote as many as twelve rondels in the day. {241b}  It was in rhyme,\neven, that the young Charles should learn his lessons.  He might get all\nmanner of instruction in the truly noble art of the chase, not without a\nsmack of ethics by the way, from the compendious didactic poem of Gace de\nla Bigne.  Nay, and it was in rhyme that he should learn rhyming: in the\nverses of his father’s Maître d’Hôtel, Eustache Deschamps, which treated\nof “l’art de dictier et de faire chançons, ballades, virelais et\nrondeaux,” along with many other matters worth attention, from the courts\nof Heaven to the misgovernment of France. {241c}  At this rate, all\nknowledge is to be had in a goody, and the end of it is an old song.  We\nneed not wonder when we hear from Monstrelet that Charles was a very well\neducated person.  He could string Latin texts together by the hour, and\nmake ballades and rondels better than Eustache Deschamps himself.  He had\nseen a mad king who would not change his clothes, and a drunken emperor\nwho could not keep his hand from the wine-cup.  He had spoken a great\ndeal with jesters and fiddlers, and with the profligate lords who helped\nhis father to waste the revenues of France.  He had seen ladies dance on\ninto broad daylight, and much burning of torches and waste of dainties\nand good wine. {242a}  And when all is said, it was no very helpful\npreparation for the battle of life.  “I believe Louis XI.,” writes\nComines, “would not have saved himself, if he had not been very\ndifferently brought up from such other lords as I have seen educated in\nthis country; for these were taught nothing but to play the jackanapes\nwith finery and fine words.” {242b}  I am afraid Charles took such\nlessons to heart, and conceived of life as a season principally for\njunketing and war.  His view of the whole duty of man, so empty, vain,\nand wearisome to us, was yet sincerely and consistently held.  When he\ncame in his ripe years to compare the glory of two kingdoms, England and\nFrance, it was on three points only,—pleasures, valour, and riches,—that\nhe cared to measure them; and in the very outset of that tract he speaks\nof the life of the great as passed, “whether in arms, as in assaults,\nbattles, and sieges, or in jousts and tournaments, in high and stately\nfestivities and in funeral solemnities.” {243}\n\nWhen he was no more than thirteen, his father had him affianced to\nIsabella, virgin-widow of our Richard II. and daughter of his uncle\nCharles VI.; and, two years after (June 29, 1406), the cousins were\nmarried at Compiègne, he fifteen, she seventeen years of age.  It was in\nevery way a most desirable match.  The bride brought five hundred\nthousand francs of dowry.  The ceremony was of the utmost magnificence,\nLouis of Orleans figuring in crimson velvet, adorned with no less than\nseven hundred and ninety-five pearls, gathered together expressly for\nthis occasion.  And no doubt it must have been very gratifying for a\nyoung gentleman of fifteen, to play the chief part in a pageant so gaily\nput upon the stage.  Only, the bridegroom might have been a little older;\nand, as ill-luck would have it, the bride herself was of this way of\nthinking, and would not be consoled for the loss of her title as queen,\nor the contemptible age of her new husband.  _Pleuroit fort ladite\nIsabeau_; the said Isabella wept copiously. {244}  It is fairly debatable\nwhether Charles was much to be pitied when, three years later (September\n1409), this odd marriage was dissolved by death.  Short as it was,\nhowever, this connection left a lasting stamp upon his mind; and we find\nthat, in the last decade of his life, and after he had remarried for\nperhaps the second time, he had not yet forgotten or forgiven the violent\ndeath of Richard II.  “Ce mauvais cas”—that ugly business, he writes, has\nyet to be avenged.\n\nThe marriage festivity was on the threshold of evil days.  The great\nrivalry between Louis of Orleans and John the Fearless, Duke of Burgundy,\nhad been forsworn with the most reverend solemnities.  But the feud was\nonly in abeyance, and John of Burgundy still conspired in secret.  On\nNovember 23, 1407—in that black winter when the frost lasted\nsix-and-sixty days on end—a summons from the king reached Louis of\nOrleans at the Hôtel Barbette, where he had been supping with Queen\nIsabel.  It was seven or eight in the evening, and the inhabitants of the\nquarter were abed.  He set forth in haste, accompanied by two squires\nriding on one horse, a page, and a few varlets running with torches.  As\nhe rode, he hummed to himself and trifled with his glove.  And so riding,\nhe was beset by the bravoes of his enemy and slain.  My lord of Burgundy\nset an ill precedent in this deed, as he found some years after on the\nbridge of Montereau; and even in the meantime he did not profit quietly\nby his rival’s death.  The horror of the other princes seems to have\nperturbed himself; he avowed his guilt in the council, tried to brazen it\nout, finally lost heart and fled at full gallop, cutting bridges behind\nhim, towards Bapaume and Lille.  And so there we have the head of one\nfaction, who had just made himself the most formidable man in France,\nengaged in a remarkably hurried journey, with black care on the pillion.\nAnd meantime, on the other side, the widowed duchess came to Paris in\nappropriate mourning, to demand justice for her husband’s death.  Charles\nVI., who was then in a lucid interval, did probably all that he could,\nwhen he raised up the kneeling suppliant with kisses and smooth words.\nThings were at a dead-lock.  The criminal might be in the sorriest\nfright, but he was still the greatest of vassals.  Justice was easy to\nask and not difficult to promise; how it was to be executed was another\nquestion.  No one in France was strong enough to punish John of Burgundy;\nand perhaps no one, except the widow, very sincere in wishing to punish\nhim.\n\nShe, indeed, was eaten up of zeal; but the intensity of her eagerness\nwore her out; and she died about a year after the murder, of grief and\nindignation, unrequited love and unsatisfied resentment.  It was during\nthe last months of her life that this fiery and generous woman, seeing\nthe soft hearts of her own children, looked with envy on a certain\nnatural son of her husband’s destined to become famous in the sequel as\nthe Bastard of Orleans, or the brave Dunois.  “_You were stolen from\nme_,” she said; “it is you who are fit to avenge your father.”  These are\nnot the words of ordinary mourning, or of an ordinary woman.  It is a\nsaying, over which Balzac would have rubbed his episcopal hands.  That\nthe child who was to avenge her husband had not been born out of her\nbody, was a thing intolerable to Valentina of Milan; and the expression\nof this singular and tragic jealousy is preserved to us by a rare chance,\nin such straightforward and vivid words as we are accustomed to hear only\non the stress of actual life, or in the theatre.  In history—where we see\nthings as in a glass darkly, and the fashion of former times is brought\nbefore us, deplorably adulterated and defaced, fitted to very vague and\npompous words, and strained through many men’s minds of everything\npersonal or precise—this speech of the widowed duchess startles a reader,\nsomewhat as the footprint startled Robinson Crusoe.  A human voice breaks\nin upon the silence of the study, and the student is aware of a\nfellow-creature in his world of documents.  With such a clue in hand, one\nmay imagine how this wounded lioness would spur and exasperate the\nresentment of her children, and what would be the last words of counsel\nand command she left behind her.\n\nWith these instancies of his dying mother—almost a voice from the\ntomb—still tingling in his ears, the position of young Charles of\nOrleans, when he was left at the head of that great house, was curiously\nsimilar to that of Shakspeare’s Hamlet.  The times were out of joint;\nhere was a murdered father to avenge on a powerful murderer; and here, in\nboth cases, a lad of inactive disposition born to set these matters\nright.  Valentina’s commendation of Dunois involved a judgment on\nCharles, and that judgment was exactly correct.  Whoever might be,\nCharles was not the man to avenge his father.  Like Hamlet, this son of a\ndear father murdered was sincerely grieved at heart.  Like Hamlet, too,\nhe could unpack his heart with words, and wrote a most eloquent letter to\nthe king, complaining that what was denied to him would not be denied “to\nthe lowest born and poorest man on earth.”  Even in his private hours he\nstrove to preserve a lively recollection of his injury, and keep up the\nnative hue of resolution.  He had gems engraved with appropriate legends,\nhortatory or threatening: “_Dieu le scet_,” God knows it; or\n“_Souvenez-vous de_ —” Remember! {248}  It is only towards the end that\nthe two stories begin to differ; and in some points the historical\nversion is the more tragic.  Hamlet only stabbed a silly old councillor\nbehind the arras; Charles of Orleans trampled France for five years under\nthe hoofs of his banditti.  The miscarriage of Hamlet’s vengeance was\nconfined, at widest, to the palace; the ruin wrought by Charles of\nOrleans was as broad as France.\n\nYet the first act of the young duke is worthy of honourable mention.\nProdigal Louis had made enormous debts; and there is a story extant, to\nillustrate how lightly he himself regarded these commercial obligations.\nIt appears that Louis, after a narrow escape he made in a thunder-storm,\nhad a smart access of penitence, and announced he would pay his debts on\nthe following Sunday.  More than eight hundred creditors presented\nthemselves, but by that time the devil was well again, and they were\nshown the door with more gaiety than politeness.  A time when such\ncynical dishonesty was possible for a man of culture is not, it will be\ngranted, a fortunate epoch for creditors.  When the original debtor was\nso lax, we may imagine how an heir would deal with the incumbrances of\nhis inheritance.  On the death of Philip the Forward, father of that John\nthe Fearless whom we have seen at work, the widow went through the\nceremony of a public renunciation of goods; taking off her purse and\ngirdle, she left them on the grave, and thus, by one notable act,\ncancelled her husband’s debts and defamed his honour.  The conduct of\nyoung Charles of Orleans was very different.  To meet the joint\nliabilities of his father and mother (for Valentina also was lavish), he\nhad to sell or pledge a quantity of jewels; and yet he would not take\nadvantage of a pretext, even legally valid, to diminish the amount.\nThus, one Godefroi Lefèvre, having disbursed many odd sums for the late\nduke, and received or kept no vouchers, Charles ordered that he should be\nbelieved upon his oath. {249}  To a modern mind this seems as honourable\nto his father’s memory as if John the Fearless had been hanged as high as\nHaman.  And as things fell out, except a recantation from the University\nof Paris, which had justified the murder out of party feeling, and\nvarious other purely paper reparations, this was about the outside of\nwhat Charles was to effect in that direction.  He lived five years, and\ngrew up from sixteen to twenty-one, in the midst of the most horrible\ncivil war, or series of civil wars, that ever devastated France; and from\nfirst to last his wars were ill-starred, or else his victories useless.\nTwo years after the murder (March 1409), John the Fearless having the\nupper hand for the moment, a shameful and useless reconciliation took\nplace, by the king’s command, in the church of Our Lady at Chartres.  The\nadvocate of the Duke of Burgundy stated that Louis of Orleans had been\nkilled “for the good of the king’s person and realm.”  Charles and his\nbrothers, with tears of shame, under protest, _pour ne pas desobéir au\nroi_, forgave their father’s murderer and swore peace upon the missal.\nIt was, as I say, a shameful and useless ceremony; the very greffier,\nentering it in his register, wrote in the margin, “_Pax_, _pax_, _inquit\nPropheta_, _et non est Pax_.” {250}  Charles was soon after allied with\nthe abominable Bernard d’Armagnac, even betrothed or married to a\ndaughter of his, called by a name that sounds like a contradiction in\nterms, Bonne d’Armagnac.  From that time forth, throughout all this\nmonstrous period—a very nightmare in the history of France—he is no more\nthan a stalking-horse for the ambitious Gascon.  Sometimes the smoke\nlifts, and you can see him for the twinkling of an eye, a very pale\nfigure; at one moment there is a rumour he will be crowned king; at\nanother, when the uproar has subsided, he will be heard still crying out\nfor justice; and the next (1412), he is showing himself to the applauding\npopulace on the same horse with John of Burgundy.  But these are\nexceptional seasons, and, for the most part, he merely rides at the\nGascon’s bridle over devastated France.  His very party go, not by the\nname of Orleans, but by the name of Armagnac.  Paris is in the hands of\nthe butchers: the peasants have taken to the woods.  Alliances are made\nand broken as if in a country dance; the English called in, now by this\none, now by the other.  Poor people sing in church, with white faces and\nlamentable music: “_Domine Jesu_, _parce populo tuo_, _dirige in viam\npacis principes_.”  And the end and upshot of the whole affair for\nCharles of Orleans is another peace with John the Fearless.  France is\nonce more tranquil, with the tranquillity of ruin; he may ride home again\nto Blois, and look, with what countenance he may, on those gems he had\ngot engraved in the early days of his resentment, “_Souvenez-vous de_ —”\nRemember!  He has killed Polonius, to be sure; but the king is never a\npenny the worse.\n\n\n\nII.\n\n\nFrom the battle of Agincourt (Oct. 1415) dates the second period of\nCharles’s life.  The English reader will remember the name of Orleans in\nthe play of _Henry V._; and it is at least odd that we can trace a\nresemblance between the puppet and the original.  The interjection, “I\nhave heard a sonnet begin so to one’s mistress” (Act iii. scene 7), may\nvery well indicate one who was already an expert in that sort of trifle;\nand the game of proverbs he plays with the Constable in the same scene,\nwould be quite in character for a man who spent many years of his life\ncapping verses with his courtiers.  Certainly, Charles was in the great\nbattle with five hundred lances (say, three thousand men), and there he\nwas made prisoner as he led the van.  According to one story, some ragged\nEnglish archer shot him down; and some diligent English Pistol, hunting\nransoms on the field of battle, extracted him from under a heap of bodies\nand retailed him to our King Henry.  He was the most important capture of\nthe day, and used with all consideration.  On the way to Calais, Henry\nsent him a present of bread and wine (and bread, you will remember, was\nan article of luxury in the English camp), but Charles would neither eat\nnor drink.  Thereupon, Henry came to visit him in his quarters.  “Noble\ncousin,” said he, “how are you?”  Charles replied that he was well.\n“Why, then, do you neither eat nor drink?”  And then with some asperity,\nas I imagine, the young duke told him that “truly he had no inclination\nfor food.”  And our Henry improved the occasion with something of a\nsnuffle, assuring his prisoner that God had fought against the French on\naccount of their manifold sins and transgressions.  Upon this there\nsupervened the agonies of a rough sea passage; and many French lords,\nCharles, certainly, among the number, declared they would rather endure\nsuch another defeat than such another sore trial on shipboard.  Charles,\nindeed, never forgot his sufferings.  Long afterwards, he declared his\nhatred to a seafaring life, and willingly yielded to England the empire\nof the seas, “because there is danger and loss of life, and God knows\nwhat pity when it storms; and sea-sickness is for many people hard to\nbear; and the rough life that must be led is little suitable for the\nnobility:” {253} which, of all babyish utterances that ever fell from any\npublic man, may surely bear the bell.  Scarcely disembarked, he followed\nhis victor, with such wry face as we may fancy, through the streets of\nholiday London.  And then the doors closed upon his last day of garish\nlife for more than a quarter of a century.  After a boyhood passed in the\ndissipations of a luxurious court or in the camp of war, his ears still\nstunned and his cheeks still burning from his enemies’ jubilations; out\nof all this ringing of English bells and singing of English anthems, from\namong all these shouting citizens in scarlet cloaks, and beautiful\nvirgins attired in white, he passed into the silence and solitude of a\npolitical prison. {254}\n\nHis captivity was not without alleviations.  He was allowed to go\nhawking, and he found England an admirable country for the sport; he was\na favourite with English ladies, and admired their beauty; and he did not\nlack for money, wine, or books; he was honourably imprisoned in the\nstrongholds of great nobles, in Windsor Castle and the Tower of London.\nBut when all is said, he was a prisoner for five-and-twenty years.  For\nfive-and-twenty years he could not go where he would, or do what he\nliked, or speak with any but his gaolers.  We may talk very wisely of\nalleviations; there is only one alleviation for which the man would thank\nyou: he would thank you to open the door.  With what regret Scottish\nJames I. bethought him (in the next room perhaps to Charles) of the time\nwhen he rose “as early as the day.”  What would he not have given to wet\nhis boots once more with morning dew, and follow his vagrant fancy among\nthe meadows?  The only alleviation to the misery of constraint lies in\nthe disposition of the prisoner.  To each one this place of discipline\nbrings his own lesson.  It stirs Latude or Baron Trenck into heroic\naction; it is a hermitage for pious and conformable spirits.  Béranger\ntells us he found prison life, with its regular hours and long evenings,\nboth pleasant and profitable.  _The Pilgrim’s Progress_ and _Don Quixote_\nwere begun in prison.  It was after they were become (to use the words of\none of them), “Oh, worst imprisonment—the dungeon of themselves!” that\nHomer and Milton worked so hard and so well for the profit of mankind.\nIn the year 1415 Henry V. had two distinguished prisoners, French Charles\nof Orleans and Scottish James I., who whiled away the hours of their\ncaptivity with rhyming.  Indeed, there can be no better pastime for a\nlonely man than the mechanical exercise of verse.  Such intricate forms\nas Charles had been used to from childhood, the ballade with its scanty\nrhymes; the rondel, with the recurrence first of the whole, then of half\nthe burthen, in thirteen verses, seem to have been invented for the\nprison and the sick bed.  The common Scotch saying, on the sight of\nanything operose and finical, “he must have had little to do that made\nthat!” might be put as epigraph on all the song books of old France.\nMaking such sorts of verse belongs to the same class of pleasures as\nguessing acrostics or “burying proverbs.”  It is almost purely formal,\nalmost purely verbal.  It must be done gently and gingerly.  It keeps the\nmind occupied a long time, and never so intently as to be distressing;\nfor anything like strain is against the very nature of the craft.\nSometimes things go easily, the refrains fall into their place as if of\ntheir own accord, and it becomes something of the nature of an\nintellectual tennis; you must make your poem as the rhymes will go, just\nas you must strike your ball as your adversary played it.  So that these\nforms are suitable rather for those who wish to make verses, than for\nthose who wish to express opinions.  Sometimes, on the other hand,\ndifficulties arise: rival verses come into a man’s head, and fugitive\nwords elude his memory.  Then it is that he enjoys at the same time the\ndeliberate pleasures of a connoisseur comparing wines, and the ardour of\nthe chase.  He may have been sitting all day long in prison with folded\nhands; but when he goes to bed, the retrospect will seem animated and\neventful.\n\nBesides confirming himself as an habitual maker of verses, Charles\nacquired some new opinions during his captivity.  He was perpetually\nreminded of the change that had befallen him.  He found the climate of\nEngland cold and “prejudicial to the human frame;” he had a great\ncontempt for English fruit and English beer; even the coal fires were\nunpleasing in his eyes. {257a}  He was rooted up from among his friends\nand customs and the places that had known him.  And so in this strange\nland he began to learn the love of his own.  Sad people all the world\nover are like to be moved when the wind is in some particular quarter.\nSo Burns preferred when it was in the west, and blew to him from his\nmistress; so the girl in the ballade, looking south to Yarrow, thought it\nmight carry a kiss betwixt her and her gallant; and so we find Charles\nsinging of the “pleasant wind that comes from France.” {257b}  One day,\nat “Dover-on-the-Sea,” he looked across the straits, and saw the\nsandhills about Calais.  And it happened to him, he tells us in a\nballade, to remember his happiness over there in the past; and he was\nboth sad and merry at the recollection, and could not have his fill of\ngazing on the shores of France. {257c}  Although guilty of unpatriotic\nacts, he had never been exactly unpatriotic in feeling.  But his sojourn\nin England gave, for the time at least, some consistency to what had been\na very weak and ineffectual prejudice.  He must have been under the\ninfluence of more than usually solemn considerations, when he proceeded\nto turn Henry’s puritanical homily after Agincourt into a ballade, and\nreproach France, and himself by implication, with pride, gluttony,\nidleness, unbridled covetousness, and sensuality. {258a}  For the moment,\nhe must really have been thinking more of France than of Charles of\nOrleans.\n\nAnd another lesson he learned.  He who was only to be released in case of\npeace, begins to think upon the disadvantages of war.  “Pray for peace,”\nis his refrain: a strange enough subject for the ally of Bernard\nd’Armagnac. {258b}  But this lesson was plain and practical; it had one\nside in particular that was specially attractive for Charles; and he did\nnot hesitate to explain it in so many words. “Everybody,” he writes—I\ntranslate roughly—“everybody should be much inclined to peace, for\neverybody has a deal to gain by it.” {258c}\n\nCharles made laudable endeavours to acquire English, and even learned to\nwrite a rondel in that tongue of quite average mediocrity. {259a}  He was\nfor some time billeted on the unhappy Suffolk, who received fourteen\nshillings and fourpence a day for his expenses; and from the fact that\nSuffolk afterwards visited Charles in France while he was negotiating the\nmarriage of Henry VI., as well as the terms of that nobleman’s\nimpeachment, we may believe there was some not unkindly intercourse\nbetween the prisoner and his gaoler: a fact of considerable interest when\nwe remember that Suffolk’s wife was the granddaughter of the poet\nGeoffrey Chaucer. {259b}  Apart from this, and a mere catalogue of dates\nand places, only one thing seems evident in the story of Charles’s\ncaptivity.  It seems evident that, as these five-and-twenty years drew\non, he became less and less resigned.  Circumstances were against the\ngrowth of such a feeling.  One after another of his fellow-prisoners was\nransomed and went home.  More than once he was himself permitted to visit\nFrance; where he worked on abortive treaties and showed himself more\neager for his own deliverance than for the profit of his native land.\nResignation may follow after a reasonable time upon despair; but if a man\nis persecuted by a series of brief and irritating hopes, his mind no more\nattains to a settled frame of resolution, than his eye would grow\nfamiliar with a night of thunder and lightning.  Years after, when he was\nspeaking at the trial of that Duke of Alençon, who began life so\nhopefully as the boyish favourite of Joan of Arc, he sought to prove that\ncaptivity was a harder punishment than death.  “For I have had experience\nmyself,” he said; “and in my prison of England, for the weariness,\ndanger, and displeasure in which I then lay, I have many a time wished I\nhad been slain at the battle where they took me.” {260}  This is a\nflourish, if you will, but it is something more.  His spirit would\nsometimes rise up in a fine anger against the petty desires and\ncontrarieties of life.  He would compare his own condition with the quiet\nand dignified estate of the dead; and aspire to lie among his comrades on\nthe field of Agincourt, as the Psalmist prayed to have the wings of a\ndove and dwell in the uttermost parts of the sea.  But such high thoughts\ncame to Charles only in a flash.\n\nJohn the Fearless had been murdered in his turn on the bridge of\nMontereau so far back as 1419.  His son, Philip the Good—partly to\nextinguish the feud, partly that he might do a popular action, and\npartly, in view of his ambitious schemes, to detach another great vassal\nfrom the throne of France—had taken up the cause of Charles of Orleans,\nand negotiated diligently for his release.  In 1433 a Burgundian embassy\nwas admitted to an interview with the captive duke, in the presence of\nSuffolk.  Charles shook hands most affectionately with the ambassadors.\nThey asked after his health.  “I am well enough in body,” he replied,\n“but far from well in mind.  I am dying of grief at having to pass the\nbest days of my life in prison, with none to sympathise.”  The talk\nfalling on the chances of peace, Charles referred to Suffolk if he were\nnot sincere and constant in his endeavours to bring it about.  “If peace\ndepended on me,” he said, “I should procure it gladly, were it to cost me\nmy life seven days after.”  We may take this as showing what a large\nprice he set, not so much on peace, as on seven days of freedom.  Seven\ndays!—he would make them seven years in the employment.  Finally, he\nassured the ambassadors of his good will to Philip of Burgundy; squeezed\none of them by the hand and nipped him twice in the arm to signify things\nunspeakable before Suffolk; and two days after sent them Suffolk’s\nbarber, one Jean Carnet, a native of Lille, to testify more freely of his\nsentiments.  “As I speak French,” said this emissary, “the Duke of\nOrleans is more familiar with me than with any other of the household;\nand I can bear witness he never said anything against Duke Philip.”\n{262a}  It will be remembered that this person, with whom he was so\nanxious to stand well, was no other than his hereditary enemy, the son of\nhis father’s murderer.  But the honest fellow bore no malice, indeed not\nhe.  He began exchanging ballades with Philip, whom he apostrophises as\nhis companion, his cousin, and his brother.  He assures him that, soul\nand body, he is altogether Burgundian; and protests that he has given his\nheart in pledge to him.  Regarded as the history of a vendetta, it must\nbe owned that Charles’s life has points of some originality.  And yet\nthere is an engaging frankness about these ballades which disarms\ncriticism. {262b}  You see Charles throwing himself headforemost into the\ntrap; you hear Burgundy, in his answers begin to inspire him with his own\nprejudices, and draw melancholy pictures of the misgovernment of France.\nBut Charles’s own spirits are so high and so amiable, and he is so\nthoroughly convinced his cousin is a fine fellow, that one’s scruples are\ncarried away in the torrent of his happiness and gratitude.  And his\nwould be a sordid spirit who would not clap hands at the consummation\n(Nov. 1440); when Charles, after having sworn on the Sacrament that he\nwould never again bear arms against England, and pledged himself body and\nsoul to the unpatriotic faction in his own country, set out from London\nwith a light heart and a damaged integrity.\n\nIn the magnificent copy of Charles’s poems, given by our Henry VII. to\nElizabeth of York on the occasion of their marriage, a large illumination\nfigures at the head of one of the pages, which, in chronological\nperspective, is almost a history of his imprisonment.  It gives a view of\nLondon with all its spires, the river passing through the old bridge and\nbusy with boats.  One side of the White Tower has been taken out, and we\ncan see, as under a sort of shrine, the paved room where the duke sits\nwriting.  He occupies a high-backed bench in front of a great chimney;\nred and black ink are before him; and the upper end of the apartment is\nguarded by many halberdiers, with the red cross of England on their\nbreast.  On the next side of the tower he appears again, leaning out of\nwindow and gazing on the river; doubtless there blows just then “a\npleasant wind from out the land of France,” and some ship comes up the\nriver: “the ship of good news.”  At the door we find him yet again; this\ntime embracing a messenger, while a groom stands by holding two saddled\nhorses.  And yet further to the left, a cavalcade defiles out of the\ntower; the duke is on his way at last towards “the sunshine of France.”\n\n\n\nIII.\n\n\nDuring the five-and-twenty years of his captivity, Charles had not lost\nin the esteem of his fellow-countrymen.  For so young a man, the head of\nso great a house, and so numerous a party, to be taken prisoner as he\nrode in the vanguard of France, and stereotyped for all men in this\nheroic attitude, was to taste untimeously the honours of the grave.  Of\nhim, as of the dead, it would be ungenerous to speak evil; what little\nenergy he had displayed would be remembered with piety, when all that he\nhad done amiss was courteously forgotten.  As English folk looked for\nArthur; as Danes awaited the coming of Ogier; as Somersetshire peasants\nor sergeants of the Old Guard expected the return of Monmouth or\nNapoleon; the countrymen of Charles of Orleans looked over the straits\ntowards his English prison with desire and confidence.  Events had so\nfallen out while he was rhyming ballades, that he had become the type of\nall that was most truly patriotic.  The remnants of his old party had\nbeen the chief defenders of the unity of France.  His enemies of Burgundy\nhad been notoriously favourers and furtherers of English domination.\nPeople forgot that his brother still lay by the heels for an unpatriotic\ntreaty with England, because Charles himself had been taken prisoner\npatriotically fighting against it.  That Henry V. had left special orders\nagainst his liberation, served to increase the wistful pity with which he\nwas regarded.  And when, in defiance of all contemporary virtue, and\nagainst express pledges, the English carried war into their prisoner’s\nfief, not only France, but all thinking men in Christendom, were roused\nto indignation against the oppressors, and sympathy with the victim.  It\nwas little wonder if he came to bulk somewhat largely in the imagination\nof the best of those at home.  Charles le Boutteillier, when (as the\nstory goes) he slew Clarence at Beaugé, was only seeking an exchange for\nCharles of Orleans. {265a}  It was one of Joan of Arc’s declared\nintentions to deliver the captive duke.  If there was no other way, she\nmeant to cross the seas and bring him home by force.  And she professed\nbefore her judges a sure knowledge that Charles of Orleans was beloved of\nGod. {265b}\n\nAlas! it was not at all as a deliverer that Charles returned to France.\nHe was nearly fifty years old.  Many changes had been accomplished since,\nat twenty-three, he was taken on the field of Agincourt.  But of all\nthese he was profoundly ignorant, or had only heard of them in the\ndiscoloured reports of Philip of Burgundy.  He had the ideas of a former\ngeneration, and sought to correct them by the scandal of a factious\nparty.  With such qualifications he came back eager for the domination,\nthe pleasures, and the display that befitted his princely birth.  A long\ndisuse of all political activity combined with the flatteries of his new\nfriends to fill him with an overweening conceit of his own capacity and\ninfluence.  If aught had gone wrong in his absence, it seemed quite\nnatural men should look to him for its redress.  Was not King Arthur come\nagain?\n\nThe Duke of Burgundy received him with politic honours.  He took his\nguest by his foible for pageantry, all the easier as it was a foible of\nhis own; and Charles walked right out of prison into much the same\natmosphere of trumpeting and bell-ringing as he had left behind when he\nwent in.  Fifteen days after his deliverance he was married to Mary of\nCleves, at St. Omer.  The marriage was celebrated with the usual pomp of\nthe Burgundian court; there were joustings, and illuminations, and\nanimals that spouted wine; and many nobles dined together, _comme en\nbrigade_, and were served abundantly with many rich and curious dishes.\n{267a}  It must have reminded Charles not a little of his first marriage\nat Compiègne; only then he was two years the junior of his bride, and\nthis time he was five-and-thirty years her senior.  It will be a fine\nquestion which marriage promises more: for a boy of fifteen to lead off\nwith a lass of seventeen, or a man of fifty to make a match of it with a\nchild of fifteen.  But there was something bitter in both.  The\nlamentations of Isabella will not have been forgotten.  As for Mary, she\ntook up with one Jaquet de la Lain, a sort of muscular Methody of the\nperiod, with a huge appetite for tournaments, and a habit of confessing\nhimself the last thing before he went to bed. {267b}  With such a hero,\nthe young duchess’s amours were most likely innocent; and in all other\nways she was a suitable partner for the duke, and well fitted to enter\ninto his pleasures.\n\nWhen the festivities at Saint Omer had come to an end, Charles and his\nwife set forth by Ghent and Tournay.  The towns gave him offerings of\nmoney as he passed through, to help in the payment of his ransom.  From\nall sides, ladies and gentlemen thronged to offer him their services;\nsome gave him their sons for pages, some archers for a bodyguard; and by\nthe time he reached Tournay, he had a following of 300 horse.  Everywhere\nhe was received as though he had been the King of France. {268}  If he\ndid not come to imagine himself something of the sort, he certainly\nforgot the existence of any one with a better claim to the title.  He\nconducted himself on the hypothesis that Charles VII. was another Charles\nVI.  He signed with enthusiasm that treaty of Arras, which left France\nalmost at the discretion of Burgundy.  On December 18 he was still no\nfarther than Bruges, where he entered into a private treaty with Philip;\nand it was not until January 14, ten weeks after he disembarked in\nFrance, and attended by a ruck of Burgundian gentlemen, that he arrived\nin Paris and offered to present himself before Charles VII.  The king\nsent word that he might come, if he would, with a small retinue, but not\nwith his present following; and the duke, who was mightily on his high\nhorse after all the ovations he had received, took the king’s attitude\namiss, and turned aside into Touraine, to receive more welcome and more\npresents, and be convoyed by torchlight into faithful cities.\n\nAnd so you see, here was King Arthur home again, and matters nowise\nmended in consequence.  The best we can say is, that this last stage of\nCharles’s public life was of no long duration.  His confidence was soon\nknocked out of him in the contact with others.  He began to find he was\nan earthen vessel among many vessels of brass; he began to be shrewdly\naware that he was no King Arthur.  In 1442, at Limoges, he made himself\nthe spokesman of the malcontent nobility.  The king showed himself\nhumiliatingly indifferent to his counsels, and humiliatingly generous\ntowards his necessities.  And there, with some blushes, he may be said to\nhave taken farewell of the political stage.  A feeble attempt on the\ncounty of Asti is scarce worth the name of exception.  Thenceforward let\nAmbition wile whom she may into the turmoil of events, our duke will walk\ncannily in his well-ordered garden, or sit by the fire to touch the\nslender reed. {269}\n\n\n\nIV.\n\n\nIf it were given each of us to transplant his life wherever he pleased in\ntime or space, with all the ages and all the countries of the world to\nchoose from, there would be quite an instructive diversity of taste.  A\ncertain sedentary majority would prefer to remain where they were.  Many\nwould choose the Renaissance; many some stately and simple period of\nGrecian life; and still more elect to pass a few years wandering among\nthe villages of Palestine with an inspired conductor.  For some of our\nquaintly vicious contemporaries, we have the decline of the Roman Empire\nand the reign of Henry III. of France.  But there are others not quite so\nvicious, who yet cannot look upon the world with perfect gravity, who\nhave never taken the categorical imperative to wife, and have more taste\nfor what is comfortable than for what is magnanimous and high; and I can\nimagine some of these casting their lot in the Court of Blois during the\nlast twenty years of the life of Charles of Orleans.\n\nThe duke and duchess, their staff of officers and ladies, and the\nhigh-born and learned persons who were attracted to Blois on a visit,\nformed a society for killing time and perfecting each other in various\nelegant accomplishments, such as we might imagine for an ideal\nwatering-place in the Delectable Mountains.  The company hunted and went\non pleasure-parties; they played chess, tables, and many other games.\nWhat we now call the history of the period passed, I imagine, over the\nheads of these good people much as it passes over our own.  News reached\nthem, indeed, of great and joyful import.  William Peel received eight\nlivres and five sous from the duchess, when he brought the first tidings\nthat Rouen was recaptured from the English. {271a}  A little later and\nthe duke sang, in a truly patriotic vein, the deliverance of Guyenne and\nNormandy. {271b}  They were liberal of rhymes and largesse, and welcomed\nthe prosperity of their country much as they welcomed the coming of\nspring, and with no more thought of collaborating towards the event.\nReligion was not forgotten in the Court of Blois.  Pilgrimages were\nagreeable and picturesque excursions.  In those days a well-served chapel\nwas something like a good vinery in our own, an opportunity for display\nand the source of mild enjoyments.  There was probably something of his\nrooted delight in pageantry, as well as a good deal of gentle piety, in\nthe feelings with which Charles gave dinner every Friday to thirteen poor\npeople, served them himself, and washed their feet with his own hands.\n{271c}  Solemn affairs would interest Charles and his courtiers from\ntheir trivial side.  The duke perhaps cared less for the deliverance of\nGuyenne and Normandy than for his own verses on the occasion; just as Dr.\nRussell’s correspondence in _The Times_ was among the most material parts\nof the Crimean War for that talented correspondent.  And I think it\nscarcely cynical to suppose that religion as well as patriotism was\nprincipally cultivated as a means of filling up the day.\n\nIt was not only messengers fiery red with haste and charged with the\ndestiny of nations, who were made welcome at the gates of Blois.  If any\nman of accomplishment came that way, he was sure of an audience, and\nsomething for his pocket.  The courtiers would have received Ben Jonson\nlike Drummond of Hawthornden, and a good pugilist like Captain Barclay.\nThey were catholic, as none but the entirely idle can be catholic.  It\nmight be Pierre, called Dieu d’amours, the juggler; or it might be three\nhigh English minstrels; or the two men, players of ghitterns, from the\nkingdom of Scotland, who sang the destruction of the Turks; or again\nJehan Rognelet, player of instruments of music, who played and danced\nwith his wife and two children; they would each be called into the castle\nto give a taste of his proficiency before my lord the duke. {272}\nSometimes the performance was of a more personal interest, and produced\nmuch the same sensations as are felt on an English green on the arrival\nof a professional cricketer, or round an English billiard table during a\nmatch between Roberts and Cooke.  This was when Jehan Nègre, the Lombard,\ncame to Blois and played chess against all these chess-players, and won\nmuch money from my lord and his intimates; or when Baudet Harenc of\nChalons made ballades before all these ballade-makers. {273}\n\nIt will not surprise the reader to learn they were all makers of ballades\nand rondels.  To write verses for May day, seems to have been as much a\nmatter of course, as to ride out with the cavalcade that went to gather\nhawthorn.  The choice of Valentines was a standing challenge, and the\ncourtiers pelted each other with humorous and sentimental verses as in a\nliterary carnival.  If an indecorous adventure befell our friend Maistre\nEstienne le Gout, my lord the duke would turn it into the funniest of\nrondels, all the rhymes being the names of the cases of nouns or the\nmoods of verbs; and Maistre Estienne would make reply in similar fashion,\nseeking to prune the story of its more humiliating episodes.  If Frédet\nwas too long away from Court, a rondel went to upbraid him; and it was in\na rondel that Frédet would excuse himself.  Sometimes two or three, or as\nmany as a dozen, would set to work on the same refrain, the same idea, or\nin the same macaronic jargon.  Some of the poetasters were heavy enough;\nothers were not wanting in address; and the duchess herself was among\nthose who most excelled.  On one occasion eleven competitors made a\nballade on the idea,\n\n    “I die of thirst beside the fountain’s edge”\n\n    (Je meurs de soif emprès de la fontaine).\n\nThese eleven ballades still exist; and one of them arrests the attention\nrather from the name of the author than from any special merit in itself.\nIt purports to be the work of François Villon; and so far as a foreigner\ncan judge (which is indeed a small way), it may very well be his.  Nay,\nand if any one thing is more probable than another, in the great _tabula\nrasa_, or unknown land, which we are fain to call the biography of\nVillon, it seems probable enough that he may have gone upon a visit to\nCharles of Orleans.  Where Master Baudet Harenc, of Chalons, found a\nsympathetic, or perhaps a derisive audience (for who can tell nowadays\nthe degree of Baudet’s excellence in his art?), favour would not be\nwanting for the greatest ballade-maker of all time.  Great as would seem\nthe incongruity, it may have pleased Charles to own a sort of kinship\nwith ragged singers, and whimsically regard himself as one of the\nconfraternity of poets.  And he would have other grounds of intimacy with\nVillon.  A room looking upon Windsor gardens is a different matter from\nVillon’s dungeon at Méun; yet each in his own degree had been tried in\nprison.  Each in his own way also, loved the good things of this life and\nthe service of the Muses.  But the same gulf that separated Burns from\nhis Edinburgh patrons would separate the singer of Bohemia from the\nrhyming duke.  And it is hard to imagine that Villon’s training amongst\nthieves, loose women, and vagabond students, had fitted him to move in a\nsociety of any dignity and courtliness.  Ballades are very admirable\nthings; and a poet is doubtless a most interesting visitor.  But among\nthe courtiers of Charles, there would be considerable regard for the\nproprieties of etiquette; and even a duke will sometimes have an eye to\nhis teaspoons.  Moreover, as a poet, I can conceive he may have\ndisappointed expectation.  It need surprise nobody if Villon’s ballade on\nthe theme,\n\n    “I die of thirst beside the fountain’s edge,”\n\nwas but a poor performance.  He would make better verses on the lee-side\nof a flagon at the sign of the Pomme du Pin, than in a cushioned settle\nin the halls of Blois.\n\nCharles liked change of place.  He was often not so much travelling as\nmaking a progress; now to join the king for some great tournament; now to\nvisit King René, at Tarascon, where he had a study of his own and saw all\nmanner of interesting things—oriental curios, King René painting birds,\nand, what particularly pleased him, Triboulet, the dwarf jester, whose\nskull-cap was no bigger than an orange. {276a}  Sometimes the journeys\nwere set about on horseback in a large party, with the _fourriers_ sent\nforward to prepare a lodging at the next stage.  We find almost\nGargantuan details of the provision made by these officers against the\nduke’s arrival, of eggs and butter and bread, cheese and peas and\nchickens, pike and bream and barbel, and wine both white and red. {276b}\nSometimes he went by water in a barge, playing chess or tables with a\nfriend in the pavilion, or watching other vessels as they went before the\nwind. {276c}  Children ran along the bank, as they do to this day on the\nCrinan Canal; and when Charles threw in money, they would dive and bring\nit up. {276d}  As he looked on at their exploits, I wonder whether that\nroom of gold and silk and worsted came back into his memory, with the\ndevice of little children in a river, and the sky full of birds?\n\nHe was a bit of a book-fancier, and had vied with his brother Angoulême\nin bringing back the library of their grandfather Charles V., when\nBedford put it up for sale in London. {277a}  The duchess had a library\nof her own; and we hear of her borrowing romances from ladies in\nattendance on the blue-stocking Margaret of Scotland. {277b}  Not only\nwere books collected, but new books were written at the court of Blois.\nThe widow of one Jean Fougère, a bookbinder, seems to have done a number\nof odd commissions for the bibliophilous count.  She it was who received\nthree vellum-skins to bind the duchess’s Book of Hours, and who was\nemployed to prepare parchment for the use of the duke’s scribes.  And she\nit was who bound in vermilion leather the great manuscript of Charles’s\nown poems, which was presented to him by his secretary, Anthony Astesan,\nwith the text in one column, and Astesan’s Latin version in the other.\n{277c}\n\nSuch tastes, with the coming of years, would doubtless take the place of\nmany others.  We find in Charles’s verse much semi-ironical regret for\nother days, and resignation to growing infirmities.  He who had been\n“nourished in the schools of love,” now sees nothing either to please or\ndisplease him.  Old age has imprisoned him within doors, where he means\nto take his ease, and let younger fellows bestir themselves in life.  He\nhad written (in earlier days, we may presume) a bright and defiant little\npoem in praise of solitude.  If they would but leave him alone with his\nown thoughts and happy recollections, he declared it was beyond the power\nof melancholy to affect him.  But now, when his animal strength has so\nmuch declined that he sings the discomforts of winter instead of the\ninspirations of spring, and he has no longer any appetite for life, he\nconfesses he is wretched when alone, and, to keep his mind from grievous\nthoughts, he must have many people around him, laughing, talking, and\nsinging. {278}\n\nWhile Charles was thus falling into years, the order of things, of which\nhe was the outcome and ornament, was growing old along with him.  The\nsemi-royalty of the princes of the blood was already a thing of the past;\nand when Charles VII. was gathered to his fathers, a new king reigned in\nFrance, who seemed every way the opposite of royal.  Louis XI. had aims\nthat were incomprehensible, and virtues that were inconceivable to his\ncontemporaries.  But his contemporaries were able enough to appreciate\nhis sordid exterior, and his cruel and treacherous spirit.  To the whole\nnobility of France he was a fatal and unreasonable phenomenon.  All such\ncourts as that of Charles at Blois, or his friend René’s in Provence,\nwould soon be made impossible; interference was the order of the day;\nhunting was already abolished; and who should say what was to go next?\nLouis, in fact, must have appeared to Charles primarily in the light of a\nkill-joy.  I take it, when missionaries land in South Sea Islands and lay\nstrange embargo on the simplest things in life, the islanders will not be\nmuch more puzzled and irritated than Charles of Orleans at the policy of\nthe Eleventh Louis.  There was one thing, I seem to apprehend, that had\nalways particularly moved him; and that was, any proposal to punish a\nperson of his acquaintance.  No matter what treason he may have made or\nmeddled with, an Alençon or an Armagnac was sure to find Charles reappear\nfrom private life, and do his best to get him pardoned.  He knew them\nquite well.  He had made rondels with them.  They were charming people in\nevery way.  There must certainly be some mistake.  Had not he himself\nmade anti-national treaties almost before he was out of his nonage?  And\nfor the matter of that, had not every one else done the like?  Such are\nsome of the thoughts by which he might explain to himself his aversion to\nsuch extremities; but it was on a deeper basis that the feeling probably\nreposed.  A man of his temper could not fail to be impressed at the\nthought of disastrous revolutions in the fortunes of those he knew.  He\nwould feel painfully the tragic contrast, when those who had everything\nto make life valuable were deprived of life itself.  And it was shocking\nto the clemency of his spirit, that sinners should be hurried before\ntheir judge without a fitting interval for penitence and satisfaction.\nIt was this feeling which brought him at last, a poor, purblind\nblue-bottle of the later autumn, into collision with “the universal\nspider,” Louis XI.  He took up the defence of the Duke of Brittany at\nTours.  But Louis was then in no humour to hear Charles’s texts and Latin\nsentiments; he had his back to the wall, the future of France was at\nstake; and if all the old men in the world had crossed his path, they\nwould have had the rough side of his tongue like Charles of Orleans.  I\nhave found nowhere what he said, but it seems it was monstrously to the\npoint, and so rudely conceived that the old duke never recovered the\nindignity.  He got home as far as Amboise, sickened, and died two days\nafter (Jan. 4, 1465), in the seventy-fourth year of his age.  And so a\nwhiff of pungent prose stopped the issue of melodious rondels to the end\nof time.\n\n\n\nV.\n\n\nThe futility of Charles’s public life was of a piece throughout.  He\nnever succeeded in any single purpose he set before him; for his\ndeliverance from England, after twenty-five years of failure and at the\ncost of dignity and consistency, it would be ridiculously hyperbolical to\ntreat as a success.  During the first part of his life he was the\nstalking horse of Bernard d’Armagnac; during the second, he was the\npassive instrument of English diplomatists; and before he was well\nentered on the third, he hastened to become the dupe and catspaw of\nBurgundian treason.  On each of these occasions, a strong and not\ndishonourable personal motive determined his behaviour.  In 1407 and the\nfollowing years, he had his father’s murder uppermost in his mind.\nDuring his English captivity, that thought was displaced by a more\nimmediate desire for his own liberation.  In 1440 a sentiment of\ngratitude to Philip of Burgundy blinded him to all else, and led him to\nbreak with the tradition of his party and his own former life.  He was\nborn a great vassal, and he conducted himself like a private gentleman.\nHe began life in a showy and brilliant enough fashion, by the light of a\npetty personal chivalry.  He was not without some tincture of patriotism;\nbut it was resolvable into two parts: a preference for life among his\nfellow-countrymen, and a barren point of honour.  In England, he could\ncomfort himself by the reflection that “he had been taken while loyally\ndoing his devoir,” without any misgiving as to his conduct in the\nprevious years, when he had prepared the disaster of Agincourt by\nwasteful feud.  This unconsciousness of the larger interests is perhaps\nmost happily exampled out of his own mouth.  When Alençon stood accused\nof betraying Normandy into the hands of the English, Charles made a\nspeech in his defence, from which I have already quoted more than once.\nAlençon, he said, had professed a great love and trust towards him; “yet\ndid he give no great proof thereof, when he sought to betray Normandy;\nwhereby he would have made me lose an estate of 10,000 livres a year, and\nmight have occasioned the destruction of the kingdom and of all us\nFrenchmen.”  These are the words of one, mark you, against whom\nGloucester warned the English Council because of his “great subtility and\ncautelous disposition.”  It is not hard to excuse the impatience of Louis\nXI., if such stuff was foisted on him by way of political deliberation.\n\nThis incapacity to see things with any greatness, this obscure and narrow\nview was fundamentally characteristic of the man as well as of the epoch.\nIt is not even so striking in his public life, where he failed, as in his\npoems, where he notably succeeded.  For wherever we might expect a poet\nto be unintelligent, it certainly would not be in his poetry.  And\nCharles is unintelligent even there.  Of all authors whom a modern may\nstill read and read over again with pleasure, he has perhaps the least to\nsay.  His poems seem to bear testimony rather to the fashion of rhyming,\nwhich distinguished the age, than to any special vocation in the man\nhimself.  Some of them are drawing-room exercises and the rest seem made\nby habit.  Great writers are struck with something in nature or society,\nwith which they become pregnant and longing; they are possessed with an\nidea, and cannot be at peace until they have put it outside of them in\nsome distinct embodiment.  But with Charles literature was an object\nrather than a mean; he was one who loved bandying words for its own sake;\nthe rigidity of intricate metrical forms stood him in lieu of precise\nthought; instead of communicating truth, he observed the laws of a game;\nand when he had no one to challenge at chess or rackets, he made verses\nin a wager against himself.  From the very idleness of the man’s mind,\nand not from intensity of feeling, it happens that all his poems are more\nor less autobiographical.  But they form an autobiography singularly bald\nand uneventful.  Little is therein recorded beside sentiments.  Thoughts,\nin any true sense, he had none to record.  And if we can gather that he\nhad been a prisoner in England, that he had lived in the Orleannese, and\nthat he hunted and went in parties of pleasure, I believe it is about as\nmuch definite experience as is to be found in all these five hundred\npages of autobiographical verse.  Doubtless, we find here and there a\ncomplaint on the progress of the infirmities of age.  Doubtless, he feels\nthe great change of the year, and distinguishes winter from spring;\nwinter as the time of snow and the fireside; spring as the return of\ngrass and flowers, the time of St. Valentine’s day and a beating heart.\nAnd he feels love after a fashion.  Again and again, we learn that\nCharles of Orleans is in love, and hear him ring the changes through the\nwhole gamut of dainty and tender sentiment.  But there is never a spark\nof passion; and heaven alone knows whether there was any real woman in\nthe matter, or the whole thing was an exercise in fancy.  If these poems\nwere indeed inspired by some living mistress, one would think he had\nnever seen, never heard, and never touched her.  There is nothing in any\none of these so numerous love-songs to indicate who or what the lady was.\nWas she dark or fair, passionate or gentle like himself, witty or simple?\nWas it always one woman? or are there a dozen here immortalised in cold\nindistinction?  The old English translator mentions gray eyes in his\nversion of one of the amorous rondels; so far as I remember, he was\ndriven by some emergency of the verse; but in the absence of all sharp\nlines of character and anything specific, we feel for the moment a sort\nof surprise, as though the epithet were singularly happy and unusual, or\nas though we had made our escape from cloudland into something tangible\nand sure.  The measure of Charles’s indifference to all that now\npreoccupies and excites a poet, is best given by a positive example.  If,\nbesides the coming of spring, any one external circumstance may be said\nto have struck his imagination, it was the despatch of _fourriers_, while\non a journey, to prepare the night’s lodging.  This seems to be his\nfavourite image; it reappears like the upas-tree in the early work of\nColeridge: we may judge with what childish eyes he looked upon the world,\nif one of the sights which most impressed him was that of a man going to\norder dinner.\n\nAlthough they are not inspired by any deeper motive than the common run\nof contemporaneous drawing-room verses, those of Charles of Orleans are\nexecuted with inimitable lightness and delicacy of touch.  They deal with\nfloating and colourless sentiments, and the writer is never greatly\nmoved, but he seems always genuine.  He makes no attempt to set off thin\nconceptions with a multiplicity of phrases.  His ballades are generally\nthin and scanty of import; for the ballade presented too large a canvas,\nand he was preoccupied by technical requirements.  But in the rondel he\nhas put himself before all competitors by a happy knack and a prevailing\ndistinction of manner.  He is very much more of a duke in his verses than\nin his absurd and inconsequential career as a statesman; and how he shows\nhimself a duke is precisely by the absence of all pretension, turgidity,\nor emphasis.  He turns verses, as he would have come into the king’s\npresence, with a quiet accomplishment of grace.\n\nThéodore de Banville, the youngest poet of a famous generation now nearly\nextinct, and himself a sure and finished artist, knocked off, in his\nhappiest vein, a few experiments in imitation of Charles of Orleans.  I\nwould recommend these modern rondels to all who care about the old duke,\nnot only because they are delightful in themselves, but because they\nserve as a contrast to throw into relief the peculiarities of their\nmodel.  When de Banville revives a forgotten form of verse—and he has\nalready had the honour of reviving the ballade—he does it in the spirit\nof a workman choosing a good tool wherever he can find one, and not at\nall in that of the dilettante, who seeks to renew bygone forms of thought\nand make historic forgeries.  With the ballade this seemed natural\nenough; for in connection with ballades the mind recurs to Villon, and\nVillon was almost more of a modern than de Banville himself.  But in the\ncase of the rondel, a comparison is challenged with Charles of Orleans,\nand the difference between two ages and two literatures is illustrated in\na few poems of thirteen lines.  Something, certainly, has been retained\nof the old movement; the refrain falls in time like a well-played bass;\nand the very brevity of the thing, by hampering and restraining the\ngreater fecundity of the modern mind, assists the imitation.  But de\nBanville’s poems are full of form and colour; they smack racily of modern\nlife, and own small kindred with the verse of other days, when it seems\nas if men walked by twilight, seeing little, and that with distracted\neyes, and instead of blood, some thin and spectral fluid circulated in\ntheir veins.  They might gird themselves for battle, make love, eat and\ndrink, and acquit themselves manfully in all the external parts of life;\nbut of the life that is within, and those processes by which we render\nourselves an intelligent account of what we feel and do, and so represent\nexperience that we for the first time make it ours, they had only a loose\nand troubled possession.  They beheld or took part in great events, but\nthere was no answerable commotion in their reflective being; and they\npassed throughout turbulent epochs in a sort of ghostly quiet and\nabstraction.  Feeling seems to have been strangely disproportioned to the\noccasion, and words were laughably trivial and scanty to set forth the\nfeeling even such as it was.  Juvenal des Ursins chronicles calamity\nafter calamity, with but one comment for them all: that “it was great\npity.”  Perhaps, after too much of our florid literature, we find an\nadventitious charm in what is so different; and while the big drums are\nbeaten every day by perspiring editors over the loss of a cock-boat or\nthe rejection of a clause, and nothing is heard that is not proclaimed\nwith sound of trumpet, it is not wonderful if we retire with pleasure\ninto old books, and listen to authors who speak small and clear, as if in\na private conversation.  Truly this is so with Charles of Orleans.  We\nare pleased to find a small man without the buskin, and obvious\nsentiments stated without affectation.  If the sentiments are obvious,\nthere is all the more chance we may have experienced the like.  As we\nturn over the leaves, we may find ourselves in sympathy with some one or\nother of these staid joys and smiling sorrows.  If we do we shall be\nstrangely pleased, for there is a genuine pathos in these simple words,\nand the lines go with a lilt, and sing themselves to music of their own.\n\n\n\n\nSAMUEL PEPYS.\n\n\nIN two books a fresh light has recently been thrown on the character and\nposition of Samuel Pepys.  Mr. Mynors Bright has given us a new\ntranscription of the Diary, increasing it in bulk by near a third,\ncorrecting many errors, and completing our knowledge of the man in some\ncurious and important points.  We can only regret that he has taken\nliberties with the author and the public.  It is no part of the duties of\nthe editor of an established classic to decide what may or may not be\n“tedious to the reader.”  The book is either an historical document or\nnot, and in condemning Lord Braybrooke Mr. Bright condemns himself.  As\nfor the time-honoured phrase, “unfit for publication,” without being\ncynical, we may regard it as the sign of a precaution more or less\ncommercial; and we may think, without being sordid, that when we purchase\nsix huge and distressingly expensive volumes, we are entitled to be\ntreated rather more like scholars and rather less like children.  But Mr.\nBright may rest assured: while we complain, we are still grateful.  Mr.\nWheatley, to divide our obligation, brings together, clearly and with no\nlost words, a body of illustrative material.  Sometimes we might ask a\nlittle more; never, I think, less.  And as a matter of fact, a great part\nof Mr. Wheatley’s volume might be transferred, by a good editor of Pepys,\nto the margin of the text, for it is precisely what the reader wants.\n\nIn the light of these two books, at least, we have now to read our\nauthor.  Between them they contain all we can expect to learn for, it may\nbe, many years.  Now, if ever we should be able to form some notion of\nthat unparalleled figure in the annals of mankind—unparalleled for three\ngood reasons: first, because he was a man known to his contemporaries in\na halo of almost historical pomp, and to his remote descendants with an\nindecent familiarity, like a tap-room comrade; second, because he has\noutstripped all competitors in the art or virtue of a conscious honesty\nabout oneself; and, third, because, being in many ways a very ordinary\nperson, he has yet placed himself before the public eye with such a\nfulness and such an intimacy of detail as might be envied by a genius\nlike Montaigne.  Not then for his own sake only, but as a character in a\nunique position, endowed with a unique talent, and shedding a unique\nlight upon the lives of the mass of mankind, he is surely worthy of\nprolonged and patient study.\n\n\n\nTHE DIARY.\n\n\nThat there should be such a book as Pepys’s Diary is incomparably\nstrange.  Pepys, in a corrupt and idle period, played the man in public\nemployments, toiling hard and keeping his honour bright.  Much of the\nlittle good that is set down to James the Second comes by right to Pepys;\nand if it were little for a king, it is much for a subordinate.  To his\nclear, capable head was owing somewhat of the greatness of England on the\nseas.  In the exploits of Hawke, Rodney, or Nelson, this dead Mr. Pepys\nof the Navy Office had some considerable share.  He stood well by his\nbusiness in the appalling plague of 1666.  He was loved and respected by\nsome of the best and wisest men in England.  He was President of the\nRoyal Society; and when he came to die, people said of his conduct in\nthat solemn hour—thinking it needless to say more—that it was answerable\nto the greatness of his life.  Thus he walked in dignity, guards of\nsoldiers sometimes attending him in his walks, subalterns bowing before\nhis periwig; and when he uttered his thoughts they were suitable to his\nstate and services.  On February 8, 1668, we find him writing to Evelyn,\nhis mind bitterly occupied with the late Dutch war, and some thoughts of\nthe different story of the repulse of the Great Armada: “Sir, you will\nnot wonder at the backwardness of my thanks for the present you made me,\nso many days since, of the Prospect of the Medway, while the Hollander\nrode master in it, when I have told you that the sight of it hath led me\nto such reflections on my particular interest, by my employment, in the\nreproach due to that miscarriage, as have given me little less disquiet\nthan he is fancied to have who found his face in Michael Angelo’s hell.\nThe same should serve me also in excuse for my silence in celebrating\nyour mastery shown in the design and draught, did not indignation rather\nthan courtship urge me so far to commend them, as to wish the furniture\nof our House of Lords changed from the story of ’88 to that of ’67 (of\nEvelyn’s designing), till the pravity of this were reformed to the temper\nof that age, wherein God Almighty found his blessings more operative\nthan, I fear, he doth in ours his judgments.”\n\nThis is a letter honourable to the writer, where the meaning rather than\nthe words is eloquent.  Such was the account he gave of himself to his\ncontemporaries; such thoughts he chose to utter, and in such language:\ngiving himself out for a grave and patriotic public servant.  We turn to\nthe same date in the Diary by which he is known, after two centuries, to\nhis descendants.  The entry begins in the same key with the letter,\nblaming the “madness of the House of Commons” and “the base proceedings,\njust the epitome of all our public proceedings in this age, of the House\nof Lords;” and then, without the least transition, this is how our\ndiarist proceeds: “To the Strand, to my bookseller’s, and there bought an\nidle, rogueish French book, _L’escholle des Filles_, which I have bought\nin plain binding, avoiding the buying of it better bound, because I\nresolve, as soon as I have read it, to burn it, that it may not stand in\nthe list of books, nor among them, to disgrace them, if it should be\nfound.”  Even in our day, when responsibility is so much more clearly\napprehended, the man who wrote the letter would be notable; but what\nabout the man, I do not say who bought a roguish book, but who was\nashamed of doing so, yet did it, and recorded both the doing and the\nshame in the pages of his daily journal?\n\nWe all, whether we write or speak, must somewhat drape ourselves when we\naddress our fellows; at a given moment we apprehend our character and\nacts by some particular side; we are merry with one, grave with another,\nas befits the nature and demands of the relation.  Pepys’s letter to\nEvelyn would have little in common with that other one to Mrs. Knipp\nwhich he signed by the pseudonym of _Dapper Dicky_; yet each would be\nsuitable to the character of his correspondent.  There is no untruth in\nthis, for man, being a Protean animal, swiftly shares and changes with\nhis company and surroundings; and these changes are the better part of\nhis education in the world.  To strike a posture once for all, and to\nmarch through life like a drum-major, is to be highly disagreeable to\nothers and a fool for oneself into the bargain.  To Evelyn and to Knipp\nwe understand the double facing; but to whom was he posing in the Diary,\nand what, in the name of astonishment, was the nature of the pose?  Had\nhe suppressed all mention of the book, or had he bought it, gloried in\nthe act, and cheerfully recorded his glorification, in either case we\nshould have made him out.  But no; he is full of precautions to conceal\nthe “disgrace” of the purchase, and yet speeds to chronicle the whole\naffair in pen and ink.  It is a sort of anomaly in human action, which we\ncan exactly parallel from another part of the Diary.\n\nMrs. Pepys had written a paper of her too just complaints against her\nhusband, and written it in plain and very pungent English.  Pepys, in an\nagony lest the world should come to see it, brutally seizes and destroys\nthe tell-tale document; and then—you disbelieve your eyes—down goes the\nwhole story with unsparing truth and in the cruellest detail.  It seems\nhe has no design but to appear respectable, and here he keeps a private\nbook to prove he was not.  You are at first faintly reminded of some of\nthe vagaries of the morbid religious diarist; but at a moment’s thought\nthe resemblance disappears.  The design of Pepys is not at all to edify;\nit is not from repentance that he chronicles his peccadilloes, for he\ntells us when he does repent, and, to be just to him, there often follows\nsome improvement.  Again, the sins of the religious diarist are of a very\nformal pattern, and are told with an elaborate whine.  But in Pepys you\ncome upon good, substantive misdemeanours; beams in his eye of which he\nalone remains unconscious; healthy outbreaks of the animal nature, and\nlaughable subterfuges to himself that always command belief and often\nengage the sympathies.\n\nPepys was a young man for his age, came slowly to himself in the world,\nsowed his wild oats late, took late to industry, and preserved till\nnearly forty the headlong gusto of a boy.  So, to come rightly at the\nspirit in which the Diary was written, we must recall a class of\nsentiments which with most of us are over and done before the age of\ntwelve.  In our tender years we still preserve a freshness of surprise at\nour prolonged existence; events make an impression out of all proportion\nto their consequence; we are unspeakably touched by our own past\nadventures, and look forward to our future personality with sentimental\ninterest.  It was something of this, I think, that clung to Pepys.\nAlthough not sentimental in the abstract, he was sweetly sentimental\nabout himself.  His own past clung about his heart, an evergreen.  He was\nthe slave of an association.  He could not pass by Islington, where his\nfather used to carry him to cakes and ale, but he must light at the\n“King’s Head” and eat and drink “for remembrance of the old house sake.”\nHe counted it good fortune to lie a night at Epsom to renew his old\nwalks, “where Mrs. Hely and I did use to walk and talk, with whom I had\nthe first sentiments of love and pleasure in a woman’s company, discourse\nand taking her by the hand, she being a pretty woman.”  He goes about\nweighing up the _Assurance_, which lay near Woolwich underwater, and\ncries in a parenthesis, “Poor ship, that I have been twice merry in, in\nCaptain Holland’s time;” and after revisiting the _Naseby_, now changed\ninto the _Charles_, he confesses “it was a great pleasure to myself to\nsee the ship that I began my good fortune in.”  The stone that he was cut\nfor he preserved in a case; and to the Turners he kept alive such\ngratitude for their assistance that for years, and after he had begun to\nmount himself into higher zones, he continued to have that family to\ndinner on the anniversary of the operation.  Not Hazlitt nor Rousseau had\na more romantic passion for their past, although at times they might\nexpress it more romantically; and if Pepys shared with them this childish\nfondness, did not Rousseau, who left behind him the _Confessions_, or\nHazlitt, who wrote the _Liber Amoris_, and loaded his essays with loving\npersonal detail, share with Pepys in his unwearied egotism?  For the two\nthings go hand in hand; or, to be more exact, it is the first that makes\nthe second either possible or pleasing.\n\nBut, to be quite in sympathy with Pepys, we must return once more to the\nexperience of children.  I can remember to have written, in the fly-leaf\nof more than one book, the date and the place where I then was—if, for\ninstance, I was ill in bed or sitting in a certain garden; these were\njottings for my future self; if I should chance on such a note in after\nyears, I thought it would cause me a particular thrill to recognise\nmyself across the intervening distance.  Indeed, I might come upon them\nnow, and not be moved one tittle—which shows that I have comparatively\nfailed in life, and grown older than Samuel Pepys.  For in the Diary we\ncan find more than one such note of perfect childish egotism; as when he\nexplains that his candle is going out, “which makes me write thus\nslobberingly;” or as in this incredible particularity, “To my study,\nwhere I only wrote thus much of this day’s passages to this *, and so out\nagain;” or lastly, as here, with more of circumstance: “I staid up till\nthe bellman came by with his bell under my window, _as I was writing of\nthis very line_, and cried, ‘Past one of the clock, and a cold, frosty,\nwindy morning.’”  Such passages are not to be misunderstood.  The appeal\nto Samuel Pepys years hence is unmistakable.  He desires that dear,\nthough unknown, gentleman keenly to realise his predecessor; to remember\nwhy a passage was uncleanly written; to recall (let us fancy, with a\nsigh) the tones of the bellman, the chill of the early, windy morning,\nand the very line his own romantic self was scribing at the moment.  The\nman, you will perceive, was making reminiscences—a sort of pleasure by\nricochet, which comforts many in distress, and turns some others into\nsentimental libertines: and the whole book, if you will but look at it in\nthat way, is seen to be a work of art to Pepys’s own address.\n\nHere, then, we have the key to that remarkable attitude preserved by him\nthroughout his Diary, to that unflinching—I had almost said, that\nunintelligent—sincerity which makes it a miracle among human books.  He\nwas not unconscious of his errors—far from it; he was often startled into\nshame, often reformed, often made and broke his vows of change.  But\nwhether he did ill or well, he was still his own unequalled self; still\nthat entrancing _ego_ of whom alone he cared to write; and still sure of\nhis own affectionate indulgence, when the parts should be changed, and\nthe Writer come to read what he had written.  Whatever he did, or said,\nor thought, or suffered, it was still a trait of Pepys, a character of\nhis career; and as, to himself, he was more interesting than Moses or\nthan Alexander, so all should be faithfully set down.  I have called his\nDiary a work of art.  Now when the artist has found something, word or\ndeed, exactly proper to a favourite character in play or novel, he will\nneither suppress nor diminish it, though the remark be silly or the act\nmean.  The hesitation of Hamlet, the credulity of Othello, the baseness\nof Emma Bovary, or the irregularities of Mr. Swiveller, caused neither\ndisappointment nor disgust to their creators.  And so with Pepys and his\nadored protagonist: adored not blindly, but with trenchant insight and\nenduring, human toleration.  I have gone over and over the greater part\nof the Diary; and the points where, to the most suspicious scrutiny, he\nhas seemed not perfectly sincere, are so few, so doubtful, and so petty,\nthat I am ashamed to name them.  It may be said that we all of us write\nsuch a diary in airy characters upon our brain; but I fear there is a\ndistinction to be made; I fear that as we render to our consciousness an\naccount of our daily fortunes and behaviour, we too often weave a tissue\nof romantic compliments and dull excuses; and even if Pepys were the ass\nand coward that men call him, we must take rank as sillier and more\ncowardly than he.  The bald truth about oneself, what we are all too\ntimid to admit when we are not too dull to see it, that was what he saw\nclearly and set down unsparingly.\n\nIt is improbable that the Diary can have been carried on in the same\nsingle spirit in which it was begun.  Pepys was not such an ass, but he\nmust have perceived, as he went on, the extraordinary nature of the work\nhe was producing.  He was a great reader, and he knew what other books\nwere like.  It must, at least, have crossed his mind that some one might\nultimately decipher the manuscript, and he himself, with all his pains\nand pleasures, be resuscitated in some later day; and the thought,\nalthough discouraged, must have warmed his heart.  He was not such an\nass, besides, but he must have been conscious of the deadly explosives,\nthe gun-cotton and the giant powder, he was hoarding in his drawer.  Let\nsome contemporary light upon the journal, and Pepys was plunged for ever\nin social and political disgrace.  We can trace the growth of his terrors\nby two facts.  In 1660, while the Diary was still in its youth, he tells\nabout it, as a matter of course, to a lieutenant in the navy; but in\n1669, when it was already near an end, he could have bitten his tongue\nout, as the saying is, because he had let slip his secret to one so grave\nand friendly as Sir William Coventry.  And from two other facts I think\nwe may infer that he had entertained, even if he had not acquiesced in,\nthe thought of a far-distant publicity.  The first is of capital\nimportance: the Diary was not destroyed.  The second—that he took unusual\nprecautions to confound the cipher in “rogueish” passages—proves, beyond\nquestion, that he was thinking of some other reader besides himself.\nPerhaps while his friends were admiring the “greatness of his behaviour”\nat the approach of death, he may have had a twinkling hope of\nimmortality.  _Mens cujusque is est quisque_, said his chosen motto; and,\nas he had stamped his mind with every crook and foible in the pages of\nthe Diary, he might feel that what he left behind him was indeed himself.\nThere is perhaps no other instance so remarkable of the desire of man for\npublicity and an enduring name.  The greatness of his life was open, yet\nhe longed to communicate its smallness also; and, while contemporaries\nbowed before him, he must buttonhole posterity with the news that his\nperiwig was once alive with nits.  But this thought, although I cannot\ndoubt he had it, was neither his first nor his deepest; it did not colour\none word that he wrote; and the Diary, for as long as he kept it,\nremained what it was when he began, a private pleasure for himself.  It\nwas his bosom secret; it added a zest to all his pleasures; he lived in\nand for it, and might well write these solemn words, when he closed that\nconfidant for ever: “And so I betake myself to that course which is\nalmost as much as to see myself go into the grave; for which, and all the\ndiscomforts that will accompany my being blind, the good God prepare me.”\n\n\n\nA LIBERAL GENIUS.\n\n\nPepys spent part of a certain winter Sunday, when he had taken physic,\ncomposing “a song in praise of a liberal genius (such as I take my own to\nbe) to all studies and pleasures.”  The song was unsuccessful, but the\nDiary is, in a sense, the very song that he was seeking; and his portrait\nby Hales, so admirably reproduced in Mynors Bright’s edition, is a\nconfirmation of the Diary.  Hales, it would appear, had known his\nbusiness; and though he put his sitter to a deal of trouble, almost\nbreaking his neck “to have the portrait full of shadows,” and draping him\nin an Indian gown hired expressly for the purpose, he was preoccupied\nabout no merely picturesque effects, but to portray the essence of the\nman.  Whether we read the picture by the Diary or the Diary by the\npicture, we shall at least agree that Hales was among the number of those\nwho can “surprise the manners in the face.”  Here we have a mouth\npouting, moist with desires; eyes greedy, protuberant, and yet apt for\nweeping too; a nose great alike in character and dimensions; and\naltogether a most fleshly, melting countenance.  The face is attractive\nby its promise of reciprocity.  I have used the word _greedy_, but the\nreader must not suppose that he can change it for that closely kindred\none of _hungry_, for there is here no aspiration, no waiting for better\nthings, but an animal joy in all that comes.  It could never be the face\nof an artist; it is the face of a _viveur_—kindly, pleased and pleasing,\nprotected from excess and upheld in contentment by the shifting\nversatility of his desires.  For a single desire is more rightly to be\ncalled a lust; but there is health in a variety, where one may balance\nand control another.\n\nThe whole world, town or country, was to Pepys a garden of Armida.\nWherever he went, his steps were winged with the most eager expectation;\nwhatever he did, it was done with the most lively pleasure.  An\ninsatiable curiosity in all the shows of the world and all the secrets of\nknowledge, filled him brimful of the longing to travel, and supported him\nin the toils of study.  Rome was the dream of his life; he was never\nhappier than when he read or talked of the Eternal City.  When he was in\nHolland, he was “with child” to see any strange thing.  Meeting some\nfriends and singing with them in a palace near the Hague, his pen fails\nhim to express his passion of delight, “the more so because in a heaven\nof pleasure and in a strange country.”  He must go to see all famous\nexecutions.  He must needs visit the body of a murdered man, defaced\n“with a broad wound,” he says, “that makes my hand now shake to write of\nit.”  He learned to dance, and was “like to make a dancer.”  He learned\nto sing, and walked about Gray’s Inn Fields “humming to myself (which is\nnow my constant practice) the trillo.”  He learned to play the lute, the\nflute, the flageolet, and the theorbo, and it was not the fault of his\nintention if he did not learn the harpsichord or the spinet.  He learned\nto compose songs, and burned to give forth “a scheme and theory of music\nnot yet ever made in the world.”  When he heard “a fellow whistle like a\nbird exceeding well,” he promised to return another day and give an angel\nfor a lesson in the art.  Once, he writes, “I took the Bezan back with\nme, and with a brave gale and tide reached up that night to the Hope,\ntaking great pleasure in learning the seamen’s manner of singing when\nthey sound the depths.”  If he found himself rusty in his Latin grammar,\nhe must fall to it like a schoolboy.  He was a member of Harrington’s\nClub till its dissolution, and of the Royal Society before it had\nreceived the name.  Boyle’s _Hydrostatics_ was “of infinite delight” to\nhim, walking in Barnes Elms.  We find him comparing Bible concordances, a\ncaptious judge of sermons, deep in Descartes and Aristotle.  We find him,\nin a single year, studying timber and the measurement of timber; tar and\noil, hemp, and the process of preparing cordage; mathematics and\naccounting; the hull and the rigging of ships from a model; and “looking\nand improving himself of the (naval) stores with”—hark to the\nfellow!—“great delight.”  His familiar spirit of delight was not the same\nwith Shelley’s; but how true it was to him through life!  He is only\ncopying something, and behold, he “takes great pleasure to rule the\nlines, and have the capital words wrote with red ink;” he has only had\nhis coal-cellar emptied and cleaned, and behold, “it do please him\nexceedingly.”  A hog’s harslett is “a piece of meat he loves.”  He cannot\nride home in my Lord Sandwich’s coach, but he must exclaim, with\nbreathless gusto, “his noble, rich coach.”  When he is bound for a supper\nparty, he anticipates a “glut of pleasure.”  When he has a new watch, “to\nsee my childishness,” says he, “I could not forbear carrying it in my\nhand and seeing what o’clock it was an hundred times.”  To go to\nVauxhall, he says, and “to hear the nightingales and other birds, hear\nfiddles, and there a harp and here a Jew’s trump, and here laughing, and\nthere fine people walking, is mighty divertising.”  And the nightingales,\nI take it, were particularly dear to him; and it was again “with great\npleasure” that he paused to hear them as he walked to Woolwich, while the\nfog was rising and the April sun broke through.\n\nHe must always be doing something agreeable, and, by preference, two\nagreeable things at once.  In his house he had a box of carpenter’s\ntools, two dogs, an eagle, a canary, and a blackbird that whistled tunes,\nlest, even in that full life, he should chance upon an empty moment.  If\nhe had to wait for a dish of poached eggs, he must put in the time by\nplaying on the flageolet; if a sermon were dull, he must read in the book\nof Tobit or divert his mind with sly advances on the nearest women.  When\nhe walked, it must be with a book in his pocket to beguile the way in\ncase the nightingales were silent; and even along the streets of London,\nwith so many pretty faces to be spied for and dignitaries to be saluted,\nhis trail was marked by little debts “for wine, pictures, etc.,” the true\nheadmark of a life intolerant of any joyless passage.  He had a kind of\nidealism in pleasure; like the princess in the fairy story, he was\nconscious of a rose-leaf out of place.  Dearly as he loved to talk, he\ncould not enjoy nor shine in a conversation when he thought himself\nunsuitably dressed.  Dearly as he loved eating, he “knew not how to eat\nalone;” pleasure for him must heighten pleasure; and the eye and ear must\nbe flattered like the palate ere he avow himself content.  He had no zest\nin a good dinner when it fell to be eaten “in a bad street and in a\nperiwig-maker’s house;” and a collation was spoiled for him by\nindifferent music.  His body was indefatigable, doing him yeoman’s\nservice in this breathless chase of pleasures.  On April 11, 1662, he\nmentions that he went to bed “weary, _which I seldom am_;” and already\nover thirty, he would sit up all night cheerfully to see a comet.  But it\nis never pleasure that exhausts the pleasure-seeker; for in that career,\nas in all others, it is failure that kills.  The man who enjoys so wholly\nand bears so impatiently the slightest widowhood from joy, is just the\nman to lose a night’s rest over some paltry question of his right to\nfiddle on the leads, or to be “vexed to the blood” by a solecism in his\nwife’s attire; and we find in consequence that he was always peevish when\nhe was hungry, and that his head “aked mightily” after a dispute.  But\nnothing could divert him from his aim in life; his remedy in care was the\nsame as his delight in prosperity; it was with pleasure, and with\npleasure only, that he sought to drive out sorrow; and, whether he was\njealous of his wife or skulking from a bailiff, he would equally take\nrefuge in the theatre.  There, if the house be full and the company\nnoble, if the songs be tunable, the actors perfect, and the play\ndiverting, this odd hero of the secret Diary, this private self-adorer,\nwill speedily be healed of his distresses.\n\nEqually pleased with a watch, a coach, a piece of meat, a tune upon the\nfiddle, or a fact in hydrostatics, Pepys was pleased yet more by the\nbeauty, the worth, the mirth, or the mere scenic attitude in life of his\nfellow-creatures.  He shows himself throughout a sterling humanist.\nIndeed, he who loves himself, not in idle vanity, but with a plenitude of\nknowledge, is the best equipped of all to love his neighbours.  And\nperhaps it is in this sense that charity may be most properly said to\nbegin at home.  It does not matter what quality a person has: Pepys can\nappreciate and love him for it.  He “fills his eyes” with the beauty of\nLady Castlemaine; indeed, he may be said to dote upon the thought of her\nfor years; if a woman be good-looking and not painted, he will walk miles\nto have another sight of her; and even when a lady by a mischance spat\nupon his clothes, he was immediately consoled when he had observed that\nshe was pretty.  But, on the other hand, he is delighted to see Mrs. Pett\nupon her knees, and speaks thus of his Aunt James: “a poor, religious,\nwell-meaning, good soul, talking of nothing but God Almighty, and that\nwith so much innocence that mightily pleased me.”  He is taken with Pen’s\nmerriment and loose songs, but not less taken with the sterling worth of\nCoventry.  He is jolly with a drunken sailor, but listens with interest\nand patience, as he rides the Essex roads, to the story of a Quaker’s\nspiritual trials and convictions.  He lends a critical ear to the\ndiscourse of kings and royal dukes.  He spends an evening at Vauxhall\nwith “Killigrew and young Newport—loose company,” says he, “but worth a\nman’s being in for once, to know the nature of it, and their manner of\ntalk and lives.”  And when a rag-boy lights him home, he examines him\nabout his business and other ways of livelihood for destitute children.\nThis is almost half-way to the beginning of philanthropy; had it only\nbeen the fashion, as it is at present, Pepys had perhaps been a man\nfamous for good deeds.  And it is through this quality that he rises, at\ntimes, superior to his surprising egotism; his interest in the love\naffairs of others is, indeed, impersonal; he is filled with concern for\nmy Lady Castlemaine, whom he only knows by sight, shares in her very\njealousies, joys with her in her successes; and it is not untrue, however\nstrange it seems in his abrupt presentment, that he loved his maid Jane\nbecause she was in love with his man Tom.\n\nLet us hear him, for once, at length: “So the women and W. Hewer and I\nwalked upon the Downes, where a flock of sheep was; and the most pleasant\nand innocent sight that ever I saw in my life.  We found a shepherd and\nhis little boy reading, far from any houses or sight of people, the Bible\nto him; so I made the boy read to me, which he did with the forced tone\nthat children do usually read, that was mighty pretty; and then I did\ngive him something, and went to the father, and talked with him.  He did\ncontent himself mightily in my liking his boy’s reading, and did bless\nGod for him, the most like one of the old patriarchs that ever I saw in\nmy life, and it brought those thoughts of the old age of the world in my\nmind for two or three days after.  We took notice of his woolen knit\nstockings of two colours mixed, and of his shoes shod with iron, both at\nthe toe and heels, and with great nails in the soles of his feet, which\nwas mighty pretty; and taking notice of them, ‘Why,’ says the poor man,\n‘the downes, you see, are full of stones, and we are faine to shoe\nourselves thus; and these,’ says he, ‘will make the stones fly till they\nring before me.’  I did give the poor man something, for which he was\nmighty thankful, and I tried to cast stones with his horne crooke.  He\nvalues his dog mightily, that would turn a sheep any way which he would\nhave him, when he goes to fold them; told me there was about eighteen\nscore sheep in his flock, and that he hath four shillings a week the year\nround for keeping of them; and Mrs. Turner, in the common fields here,\ndid gather one of the prettiest nosegays that ever I saw in my life.”\n\nAnd so the story rambles on to the end of that day’s pleasuring; with\ncups of milk, and glowworms, and people walking at sundown with their\nwives and children, and all the way home Pepys still dreaming “of the old\nage of the world” and the early innocence of man.  This was how he walked\nthrough life, his eyes and ears wide open, and his hand, you will\nobserve, not shut; and thus he observed the lives, the speech, and the\nmanners of his fellow-men, with prose fidelity of detail and yet a\nlingering glamour of romance.\n\nIt was “two or three days after” that he extended this passage in the\npages of his journal, and the style has thus the benefit of some\nreflection.  It is generally supposed that, as a writer, Pepys must rank\nat the bottom of the scale of merit.  But a style which is indefatigably\nlively, telling, and picturesque through six large volumes of everyday\nexperience, which deals with the whole matter of a life, and yet is\nrarely wearisome, which condescends to the most fastidious particulars,\nand yet sweeps all away in the forthright current of the narrative,—such\na style may be ungrammatical, it may be inelegant, it may be one tissue\nof mistakes, but it can never be devoid of merit.  The first and the true\nfunction of the writer has been thoroughly performed throughout; and\nthough the manner of his utterance may be childishly awkward, the matter\nhas been transformed and assimilated by his unfeigned interest and\ndelight.  The gusto of the man speaks out fierily after all these years.\nFor the difference between Pepys and Shelley, to return to that\nhalf-whimsical approximation, is one of quality but not one of degree; in\nhis sphere, Pepys felt as keenly, and his is the true prose of\npoetry—prose because the spirit of the man was narrow and earthly, but\npoetry because he was delightedly alive.  Hence, in such a passage as\nthis about the Epsom shepherd, the result upon the reader’s mind is\nentire conviction and unmingled pleasure.  So, you feel, the thing fell\nout, not otherwise; and you would no more change it than you would change\na sublimity of Shakespeare’s, a homely touch of Bunyan’s, or a favoured\nreminiscence of your own.\n\nThere never was a man nearer being an artist, who yet was not one.  The\ntang was in the family; while he was writing the journal for our\nenjoyment in his comely house in Navy Gardens, no fewer than two of his\ncousins were tramping the fens, kit under arm, to make music to the\ncountry girls.  But he himself, though he could play so many instruments\nand pass judgment in so many fields of art, remained an amateur.  It is\nnot given to any one so keenly to enjoy, without some greater power to\nunderstand.  That he did not like Shakespeare as an artist for the stage\nmay be a fault, but it is not without either parallel or excuse.  He\ncertainly admired him as a poet; he was the first beyond mere actors on\nthe rolls of that innumerable army who have got “To be or not to be” by\nheart.  Nor was he content with that; it haunted his mind; he quoted it\nto himself in the pages of the Diary, and, rushing in where angels fear\nto tread, he set it to music.  Nothing, indeed, is more notable than the\nheroic quality of the verses that our little sensualist in a periwig\nchose out to marry with his own mortal strains.  Some gust from brave\nElizabethan times must have warmed his spirit, as he sat tuning his\nsublime theorbo.  “To be or not to be.  Whether ’tis nobler”—“Beauty\nretire, thou dost my pity move”—“It is decreed, nor shall thy fate, O\nRome;”—open and dignified in the sound, various and majestic in the\nsentiment, it was no inapt, as it was certainly no timid, spirit that\nselected such a range of themes.  Of “Gaze not on Swans,” I know no more\nthan these four words; yet that also seems to promise well.  It was,\nhowever, on a probable suspicion, the work of his master, Mr.\nBerkenshaw—as the drawings that figure at the breaking up of a young\nladies’ seminary are the work of the professor attached to the\nestablishment.  Mr. Berkenshaw was not altogether happy in his pupil.\nThe amateur cannot usually rise into the artist, some leaven of the world\nstill clogging him; and we find Pepys behaving like a pickthank to the\nman who taught him composition.  In relation to the stage, which he so\nwarmly loved and understood, he was not only more hearty, but more\ngenerous to others.  Thus he encounters Colonel Reames, “a man,” says he,\n“who understands and loves a play as well as I, and I love him for it.”\nAnd again, when he and his wife had seen a most ridiculous insipid piece,\n“Glad we were,” he writes, “that Betterton had no part in it.”  It is by\nsuch a zeal and loyalty to those who labour for his delight that the\namateur grows worthy of the artist.  And it should be kept in mind that,\nnot only in art, but in morals, Pepys rejoiced to recognise his betters.\nThere was not one speck of envy in the whole human-hearted egotist.\n\n\n\nRESPECTABILITY.\n\n\nWhen writers inveigh against respectability, in the present degraded\nmeaning of the word, they are usually suspected of a taste for clay pipes\nand beer cellars; and their performances are thought to hail from the\n_Owl’s Nest_ of the comedy.  They have something more, however, in their\neye than the dulness of a round million dinner parties that sit down\nyearly in old England.  For to do anything because others do it, and not\nbecause the thing is good, or kind, or honest in its own right, is to\nresign all moral control and captaincy upon yourself, and go post-haste\nto the devil with the greater number.  We smile over the ascendency of\npriests; but I had rather follow a priest than what they call the leaders\nof society.  No life can better than that of Pepys illustrate the dangers\nof this respectable theory of living.  For what can be more untoward than\nthe occurrence, at a critical period and while the habits are still\npliable, of such a sweeping transformation as the return of Charles the\nSecond?  Round went the whole fleet of England on the other tack; and\nwhile a few tall pintas, Milton or Pen, still sailed a lonely course by\nthe stars and their own private compass, the cock-boat, Pepys, must go\nabout with the majority among “the stupid starers and the loud huzzas.”\n\nThe respectable are not led so much by any desire of applause as by a\npositive need for countenance.  The weaker and the tamer the man, the\nmore will he require this support; and any positive quality relieves him,\nby just so much, of this dependence.  In a dozen ways, Pepys was quite\nstrong enough to please himself without regard for others; but his\npositive qualities were not co-extensive with the field of conduct; and\nin many parts of life he followed, with gleeful precision, in the\nfootprints of the contemporary Mrs. Grundy.  In morals, particularly, he\nlived by the countenance of others; felt a slight from another more\nkeenly than a meanness in himself; and then first repented when he was\nfound out.  You could talk of religion or morality to such a man; and by\nthe artist side of him, by his lively sympathy and apprehension, he could\nrise, as it were dramatically, to the significance of what you said.  All\nthat matter in religion which has been nicknamed other-worldliness was\nstrictly in his gamut; but a rule of life that should make a man rudely\nvirtuous, following right in good report and ill report, was foolishness\nand a stumbling-block to Pepys.  He was much thrown across the Friends;\nand nothing can be more instructive than his attitude towards these most\ninteresting people of that age.  I have mentioned how he conversed with\none as he rode; when he saw some brought from a meeting under arrest, “I\nwould to God,” said he, “they would either conform, or be more wise and\nnot be catched;” and to a Quaker in his own office he extended a timid\nthough effectual protection.  Meanwhile there was growing up next door to\nhim that beautiful nature William Pen.  It is odd that Pepys condemned\nhim for a fop; odd, though natural enough when you see Pen’s portrait,\nthat Pepys was jealous of him with his wife.  But the cream of the story\nis when Pen publishes his _Sandy Foundation Shaken_, and Pepys has it\nread aloud by his wife.  “I find it,” he says, “so well writ as, I think,\nit is too good for him ever to have writ it; and it is a serious sort of\nbook, and _not fit for everybody to read_.”  Nothing is more galling to\nthe merely respectable than to be brought in contact with religious\nardour.  Pepys had his own foundation, sandy enough, but dear to him from\npractical considerations, and he would read the book with true uneasiness\nof spirit; for conceive the blow if, by some plaguy accident, this Pen\nwere to convert him!  It was a different kind of doctrine that he judged\nprofitable for himself and others.  “A good sermon of Mr. Gifford’s at\nour church, upon ‘Seek ye first the kingdom of heaven.’  A very excellent\nand persuasive, good and moral sermon.  He showed, like a wise man, that\nrighteousness is a surer moral way of being rich than sin and villainy.”\nIt is thus that respectable people desire to have their Greathearts\naddress them, telling, in mild accents, how you may make the best of both\nworlds, and be a moral hero without courage, kindness, or troublesome\nreflection; and thus the Gospel, cleared of Eastern metaphor, becomes a\nmanual of worldly prudence, and a handybook for Pepys and the successful\nmerchant.\n\nThe respectability of Pepys was deeply grained.  He has no idea of truth\nexcept for the Diary.  He has no care that a thing shall be, if it but\nappear; gives out that he has inherited a good estate, when he has\nseemingly got nothing but a lawsuit; and is pleased to be thought liberal\nwhen he knows he has been mean.  He is conscientiously ostentatious.  I\nsay conscientiously, with reason.  He could never have been taken for a\nfop, like Pen, but arrayed himself in a manner nicely suitable to his\nposition.  For long he hesitated to assume the famous periwig; for a\npublic man should travel gravely with the fashions not foppishly before,\nnor dowdily behind, the central movement of his age.  For long he durst\nnot keep a carriage; that, in his circumstances would have been improper;\nbut a time comes, with the growth of his fortune, when the impropriety\nhas shifted to the other side, and he is “ashamed to be seen in a\nhackney.”  Pepys talked about being “a Quaker or some very melancholy\nthing;” for my part, I can imagine nothing so melancholy, because nothing\nhalf so silly, as to be concerned about such problems.  But so\nrespectability and the duties of society haunt and burden their poor\ndevotees; and what seems at first the very primrose path of life, proves\ndifficult and thorny like the rest.  And the time comes to Pepys, as to\nall the merely respectable, when he must not only order his pleasures,\nbut even clip his virtuous movements, to the public pattern of the age.\nThere was some juggling among officials to avoid direct taxation; and\nPepys, with a noble impulse, growing ashamed of this dishonesty, designed\nto charge himself with £1000; but finding none to set him an example,\n“nobody of our ablest merchants” with this moderate liking for clean\nhands, he judged it “not decent;” he feared it would “be thought vain\nglory;” and, rather than appear singular, cheerfully remained a thief.\nOne able merchant’s countenance, and Pepys had dared to do an honest act!\nHad he found one brave spirit, properly recognised by society, he might\nhave gone far as a disciple.  Mrs. Turner, it is true, can fill him full\nof sordid scandal, and make him believe, against the testimony of his\nsenses, that Pen’s venison pasty stank like the devil; but, on the other\nhand, Sir William Coventry can raise him by a word into another being.\nPepys, when he is with Coventry, talks in the vein of an old Roman.  What\ndoes he care for office or emolument?  “Thank God, I have enough of my\nown,” says he, “to buy me a good book and a good fiddle, and I have a\ngood wife.”  And again, we find this pair projecting an old age when an\nungrateful country shall have dismissed them from the field of public\nservice; Coventry living retired in a fine house, and Pepys dropping in,\n“it may be, to read a chapter of Seneca.”\n\nUnder this influence, the only good one in his life, Pepys continued\nzealous and, for the period, pure in his employment.  He would not be\n“bribed to be unjust,” he says, though he was “not so squeamish as to\nrefuse a present after,” suppose the king to have received no wrong.  His\nnew arrangement for the victualling of Tangier he tells us with honest\ncomplacency, will save the king a thousand and gain Pepys three hundred\npounds a year,—a statement which exactly fixes the degree of the age’s\nenlightenment.  But for his industry and capacity no praise can be too\nhigh.  It was an unending struggle for the man to stick to his business\nin such a garden of Armida as he found this life; and the story of his\noaths, so often broken, so courageously renewed, is worthy rather of\nadmiration that the contempt it has received.\n\nElsewhere, and beyond the sphere of Coventry’s influence, we find him\nlosing scruples and daily complying further with the age.  When he began\nthe journal, he was a trifle prim and puritanic; merry enough, to be\nsure, over his private cups, and still remembering Magdalene ale and his\nacquaintance with Mrs. Ainsworth of Cambridge.  But youth is a hot season\nwith all; when a man smells April and May he is apt at times to stumble;\nand in spite of a disordered practice, Pepys’s theory, the better things\nthat he approved and followed after, we may even say were strict.  Where\nthere was “tag, rag, and bobtail, dancing, singing, and drinking,” he\nfelt “ashamed, and went away;” and when he slept in church, he prayed God\nforgive him.  In but a little while we find him with some ladies keeping\neach other awake “from spite,” as though not to sleep in church were an\nobvious hardship; and yet later he calmly passes the time of service,\nlooking about him, with a perspective glass, on all the pretty women.\nHis favourite ejaculation, “Lord!” occurs but once that I have observed\nin 1660, never in ’61, twice in ’62, and at least five times in ’63;\nafter which the “Lords” may be said to pullulate like herrings, with here\nand there a solitary “damned,” as it were a whale among the shoal.  He\nand his wife, once filled with dudgeon by some innocent freedoms at a\nmarriage, are soon content to go pleasuring with my Lord Brouncker’s\nmistress, who was not even, by his own account, the most discreet of\nmistresses.  Tag, rag, and bobtail, dancing, singing, and drinking,\nbecome his natural element; actors and actresses and drunken, roaring\ncourtiers are to be found in his society; until the man grew so involved\nwith Saturnalian manners and companions that he was shot almost\nunconsciously into the grand domestic crash of 1668.\n\nThat was the legitimate issue and punishment of years of staggering walk\nand conversation.  The man who has smoked his pipe for half a century in\na powder magazine finds himself at last the author and the victim of a\nhideous disaster.  So with our pleasant-minded Pepys and his\npeccadilloes.  All of a sudden, as he still trips dexterously enough\namong the dangers of a double-faced career, thinking no great evil,\nhumming to himself the trillo, Fate takes the further conduct of that\nmatter from his hands, and brings him face to face with the consequences\nof his acts.  For a man still, after so many years, the lover, although\nnot the constant lover, of his wife,—for a man, besides, who was so\ngreatly careful of appearances,—the revelation of his infidelities was a\ncrushing blow.  The tears that he shed, the indignities that he endured,\nare not to be measured.  A vulgar woman, and now justly incensed, Mrs.\nPepys spared him no detail of suffering.  She was violent, threatening\nhim with the tongs; she was careless of his honour, driving him to insult\nthe mistress whom she had driven him to betray and to discard; worst of\nall, she was hopelessly inconsequent, in word and thought and deed, now\nlulling him with reconciliations, and anon flaming forth again with the\noriginal anger.  Pepys had not used his wife well; he had wearied her\nwith jealousies, even while himself unfaithful; he had grudged her\nclothes and pleasures, while lavishing both upon himself; he had abused\nher in words; he had bent his fist at her in anger; he had once blacked\nher eye; and it is one of the oddest particulars in that odd Diary of\nhis, that, while the injury is referred to once in passing, there is no\nhint as to the occasion or the manner of the blow.  But now, when he is\nin the wrong, nothing can exceed the long-suffering affection of this\nimpatient husband.  While he was still sinning and still undiscovered, he\nseems not to have known a touch of penitence stronger than what might\nlead him to take his wife to the theatre, or for an airing, or to give\nher a new dress, by way of compensation.  Once found out, however, and he\nseems to himself to have lost all claim to decent usage.  It is perhaps\nthe strongest instance of his externality.  His wife may do what she\npleases, and though he may groan, it will never occur to him to blame\nher; he has no weapon left but tears and the most abject submission.  We\nshould perhaps have respected him more had he not given way so\nutterly—above all, had he refused to write, under his wife’s dictation,\nan insulting letter to his unhappy fellow-culprit, Miss Willet; but\nsomehow I believe we like him better as he was.\n\nThe death of his wife, following so shortly after, must have stamped the\nimpression of this episode upon his mind.  For the remaining years of his\nlong life we have no Diary to help us, and we have seen already how\nlittle stress is to be laid upon the tenor of his correspondence; but\nwhat with the recollection of the catastrophe of his married life, what\nwith the natural influence of his advancing years and reputation, it\nseems not unlikely that the period of gallantry was at an end for Pepys;\nand it is beyond a doubt that he sat down at last to an honoured and\nagreeable old age among his books and music, the correspondent of Sir\nIsaac Newton, and, in one instance at least the poetical counsellor of\nDryden.  Through all this period, that Diary which contained the secret\nmemoirs of his life, with all its inconsistencies and escapades, had been\nreligiously preserved; nor, when he came to die, does he appear to have\nprovided for its destruction.  So we may conceive him faithful to the end\nto all his dear and early memories; still mindful of Mrs. Hely in the\nwoods at Epsom; still lighting at Islington for a cup of kindness to the\ndead; still, if he heard again that air that once so much disturbed him,\nthrilling at the recollection of the love that bound him to his wife.\n\n\n\n\nJOHN KNOX AND HIS RELATIONS TO WOMEN.\n\n\nI.—THE CONTROVERSY ABOUT FEMALE RULE.\n\n\nWHEN first the idea became widely spread among men that the Word of God,\ninstead of being truly the foundation of all existing institutions, was\nrather a stone which the builders had rejected, it was but natural that\nthe consequent havoc among received opinions should be accompanied by the\ngeneration of many new and lively hopes for the future.  Somewhat as in\nthe early days of the French Revolution, men must have looked for an\nimmediate and universal improvement in their condition.  Christianity, up\nto that time, had been somewhat of a failure politically.  The reason was\nnow obvious, the capital flaw was detected, the sickness of the body\npolitic traced at last to its efficient cause.  It was only necessary to\nput the Bible thoroughly into practice, to set themselves strenuously to\nrealise in life the Holy Commonwealth, and all abuses and iniquities\nwould surely pass away.  Thus, in a pageant played at Geneva in the year\n1523, the world was represented as a sick man at the end of his wits for\nhelp, to whom his doctor recommends Lutheran specifics. {329}  The\nReformers themselves had set their affections in a different world, and\nprofessed to look for the finished result of their endeavours on the\nother side of death.  They took no interest in politics as such; they\neven condemned political action as Antichristian: notably, Luther in the\ncase of the Peasants’ War.  And yet, as the purely religious question was\ninseparably complicated with political difficulties, and they had to make\nopposition, from day to day, against principalities and powers, they were\nled, one after another, and again and again, to leave the sphere which\nwas more strictly their own, and meddle, for good and evil, with the\naffairs of State.  Not much was to be expected from interference in such\na spirit.  Whenever a minister found himself galled or hindered, he would\nbe inclined to suppose some contravention of the Bible.  Whenever\nChristian liberty was restrained (and Christian liberty for each\nindividual would be about coextensive with what he wished to do), it was\nobvious that the State was Antichristian.  The great thing, and the one\nthing, was to push the Gospel and the Reformers’ own interpretation of\nit.  Whatever helped was good; whatever hindered was evil; and if this\nsimple classification proved inapplicable over the whole field, it was no\nbusiness of his to stop and reconcile incongruities.  He had more\npressing concerns on hand; he had to save souls; he had to be about his\nFather’s business.  This short-sighted view resulted in a doctrine that\nwas actually Jesuitical in application.  They had no serious ideas upon\npolitics, and they were ready, nay, they seemed almost bound, to adopt\nand support whichever ensured for the moment the greatest benefit to the\nsouls of their fellow-men.  They were dishonest in all sincerity.  Thus\nLabitte, in the introduction to a book {330a} in which he exposes the\nhypocritical democracy of the Catholics under the League, steps aside for\na moment to stigmatise the hypocritical democracy of the Protestants.\nAnd nowhere was this expediency in political questions more apparent than\nabout the question of female sovereignty.  So much was this the case that\none James Thomasius, of Leipsic, wrote a little paper {330b} about the\nreligious partialities of those who took part in the controversy, in\nwhich some of these learned disputants cut a very sorry figure.\n\nNow Knox has been from the first a man well hated; and it is somewhat\ncharacteristic of his luck that he figures here in the very forefront of\nthe list of partial scribes who trimmed their doctrine with the wind in\nall good conscience, and were political weathercocks out of conviction.\nNot only has Thomasius mentioned him, but Bayle has taken the hint from\nThomasius, and dedicated a long note to the matter at the end of his\narticle on the Scotch Reformer.  This is a little less than fair.  If any\none among the evangelists of that period showed more serious political\nsense than another, it was assuredly Knox; and even in this very matter\nof female rule, although I do not suppose any one nowadays will feel\ninclined to endorse his sentiments, I confess I can make great allowance\nfor his conduct.  The controversy, besides, has an interest of its own,\nin view of later controversies.\n\nJohn Knox, from 1556 to 1559, was resident in Geneva, as minister,\njointly with Goodman, of a little church of English refugees.  He and his\ncongregation were banished from England by one woman, Mary Tudor, and\nproscribed in Scotland by another, the Regent Mary of Guise.  The\ncoincidence was tempting: here were many abuses centring about one abuse;\nhere was Christ’s Gospel persecuted in the two kingdoms by one anomalous\npower.  He had not far to go to find the idea that female government was\nanomalous.  It was an age, indeed, in which women, capable and incapable,\nplayed a conspicuous part upon the stage of European history; and yet\ntheir rule, whatever may have been the opinion of here and there a wise\nman or enthusiast, was regarded as an anomaly by the great bulk of their\ncontemporaries.  It was defended as an anomaly.  It, and all that\naccompanied and sanctioned it, was set aside as a single exception; and\nno one thought of reasoning down from queens and extending their\nprivileges to ordinary women.  Great ladies, as we know, had the\nprivilege of entering into monasteries and cloisters, otherwise forbidden\nto their sex.  As with one thing, so with another.  Thus, Margaret of\nNavarre wrote books with great acclamation, and no one, seemingly, saw\nfit to call her conduct in question; but Mademoiselle de Gournay,\nMontaigne’s adopted daughter, was in a controversy with the world as to\nwhether a woman might be an author without incongruity.  Thus, too, we\nhave Théodore Agrippa d’Aubigné writing to his daughters about the\nlearned women of his century, and cautioning them, in conclusion, that\nthe study of letters was unsuited to ladies of a middling station, and\nshould be reserved for princesses. {333a}  And once more, if we desire to\nsee the same principle carried to ludicrous extreme, we shall find that\nReverend Father in God the Abbot of Brantôme, claiming, on the authority\nof some lord of his acquaintance, a privilege, or rather a duty, of free\nlove for great princesses, and carefully excluding other ladies from the\nsame gallant dispensation. {333b}  One sees the spirit in which these\nimmunities were granted; and how they were but the natural consequence of\nthat awe for courts and kings that made the last writer tell us, with\nsimple wonder, how Catherine de Medici would “laugh her fill just like\nanother” over the humours of pantaloons and zanies.  And such servility\nwas, of all things, what would touch most nearly the republican spirit of\nKnox.  It was not difficult for him to set aside this weak scruple of\nloyalty.  The lantern of his analysis did not always shine with a very\nserviceable light; but he had the virtue, at least, to carry it into many\nplaces of fictitious holiness, and was not abashed by the tinsel divinity\nthat hedged kings and queens from his contemporaries.  And so he could\nput the proposition in the form already mentioned: there was Christ’s\nGospel persecuted in the two kingdoms by one anomalous power plainly,\nthen, the “regiment of women” was Antichristian.  Early in 1558 he\ncommunicated this discovery to the world, by publishing at Geneva his\nnotorious book—_The First Blast of the Trumpet against the Monstrous\nRegiment of Women_. {334}\n\nAs a whole, it is a dull performance; but the preface, as is usual with\nKnox, is both interesting and morally fine.  Knox was not one of those\nwho are humble in the hour of triumph; he was aggressive even when things\nwere at their worst.  He had a grim reliance in himself, or rather in his\nmission; if he were not sure that he was a great man, he was at least\nsure that he was one set apart to do great things.  And he judged simply\nthat whatever passed in his mind, whatever moved him to flee from\npersecution instead of constantly facing it out, or, as here, to publish\nand withhold his name from the title-page of a critical work, would not\nfail to be of interest, perhaps of benefit, to the world.  There may be\nsomething more finely sensitive in the modern humour, that tends more and\nmore to withdraw a man’s personality from the lessons he inculcates or\nthe cause that he has espoused; but there is a loss herewith of wholesome\nresponsibility; and when we find in the works of Knox, as in the Epistles\nof Paul, the man himself standing nakedly forward, courting and\nanticipating criticism, putting his character, as it were, in pledge for\nthe sincerity of his doctrine, we had best waive the question of\ndelicacy, and make our acknowledgments for a lesson of courage, not\nunnecessary in these days of anonymous criticism, and much light,\notherwise unattainable, on the spirit in which great movements were\ninitiated and carried forward.  Knox’s personal revelations are always\ninteresting; and, in the case of the “First Blast,” as I have said, there\nis no exception to the rule.  He begins by stating the solemn\nresponsibility of all who are watchmen over God’s flock; and all are\nwatchmen (he goes on to explain, with that fine breadth of spirit that\ncharacterises him even when, as here, he shows himself most narrow), all\nare watchmen “whose eyes God doth open, and whose conscience he pricketh\nto admonish the ungodly.”  And with the full consciousness of this great\nduty before him, he sets himself to answer the scruples of timorous or\nworldly-minded people.  How can a man repent, he asks, unless the nature\nof his transgression is made plain to him?  “And therefore I say,” he\ncontinues, “that of necessity it is that this monstriferous empire of\nwomen (which among all enormities that this day do abound upon the face\nof the whole earth, is most detestable and damnable) be openly and\nplainly declared to the world, to the end that some may repent and be\nsaved.”  To those who think the doctrine useless, because it cannot be\nexpected to amend those princes whom it would dispossess if once\naccepted, he makes answer in a strain that shows him at his greatest.\nAfter having instanced how the rumour of Christ’s censures found its way\nto Herod in his own court, “even so,” he continues, “may the sound of our\nweak trumpet, by the support of some wind (blow it from the south, or\nblow it from the north, it is of no matter), come to the ears of the\nchief offenders.  _But whether it do or not_, _yet dare we not cease to\nblow as God will give strength_.  _For we are debtors to more than to\nprinces_, _to wit_, _to the great multitude of our brethren_, of whom, no\ndoubt, a great number have heretofore offended by error and ignorance.”\n\nIt is for the multitude, then, he writes; he does not greatly hope that\nhis trumpet will be audible in palaces, or that crowned women will\nsubmissively discrown themselves at his appeal; what he does hope, in\nplain English, is to encourage and justify rebellion; and we shall see,\nbefore we have done, that he can put his purpose into words as roundly as\nI can put it for him.  This he sees to be a matter of much hazard; he is\nnot “altogether so brutish and insensible, but that he has laid his\naccount what the finishing of the work may cost.”  He knows that he will\nfind many adversaries, since “to the most part of men, lawful and godly\nappeareth whatsoever antiquity hath received.”  He looks for opposition,\n“not only of the ignorant multitude, but of the wise, politic, and quiet\nspirits of the earth.”  He will be called foolish, curious, despiteful,\nand a sower of sedition; and one day, perhaps, for all he is now\nnameless, he may be attainted of treason.  Yet he has “determined to obey\nGod, notwithstanding that the world shall rage thereat.”  Finally, he\nmakes some excuse for the anonymous appearance of this first instalment:\nit is his purpose thrice to blow the trumpet in this matter, if God so\npermit; twice he intends to do it without name; but at the last blast to\ntake the odium upon himself, that all others may be purged.\n\nThus he ends the preface, and enters upon his argument with a secondary\ntitle: “The First Blast to awake Women degenerate.”  We are in the land\nof assertion without delay.  That a woman should bear rule, superiority,\ndominion or empire over any realm, nation, or city, he tells us, is\nrepugnant to nature, contumely to God, and a subversion of good order.\nWomen are weak, frail, impatient, feeble, and foolish.  God has denied to\nwoman wisdom to consider, or providence to foresee, what is profitable to\na commonwealth.  Women have been ever lightly esteemed; they have been\ndenied the tutory of their own sons, and subjected to the unquestionable\nsway of their husbands; and surely it is irrational to give the greater\nwhere the less has been withheld, and suffer a woman to reign supreme\nover a great kingdom who would be allowed no authority by her own\nfireside.  He appeals to the Bible; but though he makes much of the first\ntransgression and certain strong texts in Genesis and Paul’s Epistles, he\ndoes not appeal with entire success.  The cases of Deborah and Huldah can\nbe brought into no sort of harmony with his thesis.  Indeed, I may say\nthat, logically, he left his bones there; and that it is but the phantom\nof an argument that he parades thenceforward to the end.  Well was it for\nKnox that he succeeded no better; it is under this very ambiguity about\nDeborah that we shall find him fain to creep for shelter before he is\ndone with the regiment of women.  After having thus exhausted Scripture,\nand formulated its teaching in the somewhat blasphemous maxim that the\nman is placed above the woman, even as God above the angels, he goes on\ntriumphantly to adduce the testimonies of Tertullian, Augustine, Ambrose,\nBasil, Chrysostom, and the Pandects; and having gathered this little\ncloud of witnesses about him, like pursuivants about a herald, he\nsolemnly proclaims all reigning women to be traitoresses and rebels\nagainst God; discharges all men thenceforward from holding any office\nunder such monstrous regiment, and calls upon all the lieges with one\nconsent to “_study to repress the inordinate pride and tyranny_” _of\nqueens_.  If this is not treasonable teaching, one would be glad to know\nwhat is; and yet, as if he feared he had not made the case plain enough\nagainst himself, he goes on to deduce the startling corollary that all\noaths of allegiance must be incontinently broken.  If it was sin thus to\nhave sworn even in ignorance, it were obstinate sin to continue to\nrespect them after fuller knowledge.  Then comes the peroration, in which\nhe cries aloud against the cruelties of that cursed Jezebel of\nEngland—that horrible monster Jezebel of England; and after having\npredicted sudden destruction to her rule and to the rule of all crowned\nwomen, and warned all men that if they presume to defend the same when\nany “noble heart” shall be raised up to vindicate the liberty of his\ncountry, they shall not fail to perish themselves in the ruin, he\nconcludes with a last rhetorical flourish: “And therefore let all men be\nadvertised, for THE TRUMPET HATH ONCE BLOWN.”\n\nThe capitals are his own.  In writing, he probably felt the want of some\nsuch reverberation of the pulpit under strong hands as he was wont to\nemphasise his spoken utterances withal; there would seem to him a want of\npassion in the orderly lines of type; and I suppose we may take the\ncapitals as a mere substitute for the great voice with which he would\nhave given it forth, had we heard it from his own lips.  Indeed, as it\nis, in this little strain of rhetoric about the trumpet, this current\nallusion to the fall of Jericho, that alone distinguishes his bitter and\nhasty production, he was probably right, according to all artistic canon,\nthus to support and accentuate in conclusion the sustained metaphor of a\nhostile proclamation.  It is curious, by the way, to note how favourite\nan image the trumpet was with the Reformer.  He returns to it again and\nagain; it is the Alpha and Omega of his rhetoric; it is to him what a\nship is to the stage sailor; and one would almost fancy he had begun the\nworld as a trumpeter’s apprentice.  The partiality is surely\ncharacteristic.  All his life long he was blowing summonses before\nvarious Jerichos, some of which fell duly, but not all.  Wherever he\nappears in history his speech is loud, angry, and hostile; there is no\npeace in his life, and little tenderness; he is always sounding hopefully\nto the front for some rough enterprise.\n\nAnd as his voice had something of the trumpet’s hardness, it had\nsomething also of the trumpet’s warlike inspiration.  So Randolph,\npossibly fresh from the sound of the Reformer’s preaching, writes of him\nto Cecil:—“Where your honour exhorteth us to stoutness, I assure you the\nvoice of one man is able, in an hour, to put more life in us than six\nhundred trumpets continually blustering in our ears.” {341}\n\nThus was the proclamation made.  Nor was it long in wakening all the\nechoes of Europe.  What success might have attended it, had the question\ndecided been a purely abstract question, it is difficult to say.  As it\nwas, it was to stand or fall, not by logic, but by political needs and\nsympathies.  Thus, in France, his doctrine was to have some future,\nbecause Protestants suffered there under the feeble and treacherous\nregency of Catherine de Medici; and thus it was to have no future\nanywhere else, because the Protestant interest was bound up with the\nprosperity of Queen Elizabeth.  This stumbling-block lay at the very\nthreshold of the matter; and Knox, in the text of the “First Blast,” had\nset everybody the wrong example and gone to the ground himself.  He finds\noccasion to regret “the blood of innocent Lady Jane Dudley.”  But Lady\nJane Dudley, or Lady Jane Grey, as we call her, was a would-be traitoress\nand rebel against God, to use his own expressions.  If, therefore,\npolitical and religious sympathy led Knox himself into so grave a\npartiality, what was he to expect from his disciples?\n\nIf the trumpet gave so ambiguous a sound, who could heartily prepare\nhimself for the battle?  The question whether Lady Jane Dudley was an\ninnocent martyr, or a traitoress against God, whose inordinate pride and\ntyranny had been effectually repressed, was thus left altogether in the\nwind; and it was not, perhaps, wonderful if many of Knox’s readers\nconcluded that all right and wrong in the matter turned upon the degree\nof the sovereign’s orthodoxy and possible helpfulness to the Reformation.\nHe should have been the more careful of such an ambiguity of meaning, as\nhe must have known well the lukewarm indifference and dishonesty of his\nfellow-reformers in political matters.  He had already, in 1556 or 1557,\ntalked the matter over with his great master, Calvin, in “a private\nconversation;” and the interview {342} must have been truly distasteful\nto both parties.  Calvin, indeed, went a far way with him in theory, and\nowned that the “government of women was a deviation from the original and\nproper order of nature, to be ranked, no less than slavery, among the\npunishments consequent upon the fall of man.”  But, in practice, their\ntwo roads separated.  For the Man of Geneva saw difficulties in the way\nof the Scripture proof in the cases of Deborah and Huldah, and in the\nprophecy of Isaiah that queens should be the nursing mothers of the\nChurch.  And as the Bible was not decisive, he thought the subject should\nbe let alone, because, “by custom and public consent and long practice,\nit has been established that realms and principalities may descend to\nfemales by hereditary right, and it would not be lawful to unsettle\ngovernments which are ordained by the peculiar providence of God.”  I\nimagine Knox’s ears must have burned during this interview.  Think of him\nlistening dutifully to all this—how it would not do to meddle with\nanointed kings—how there was a peculiar providence in these great\naffairs; and then think of his own peroration, and the “noble heart” whom\nhe looks for “to vindicate the liberty of his country;” or his answer to\nQueen Mary, when she asked him who he was, to interfere in the affairs of\nScotland:—“Madam, a subject born within the same!”  Indeed, the two\ndoctors who differed at this private conversation represented, at the\nmoment, two principles of enormous import in the subsequent history of\nEurope.  In Calvin we have represented that passive obedience, that\ntoleration of injustice and absurdity, that holding back of the hand from\npolitical affairs as from something unclean, which lost France, if we are\nto believe M. Michelet, for the Reformation; a spirit necessarily fatal\nin the long run to the existence of any sect that may profess it; a\nsuicidal doctrine that survives among us to this day in narrow views of\npersonal duty, and the low political morality of many virtuous men.  In\nKnox, on the other hand, we see foreshadowed the whole Puritan Revolution\nand the scaffold of Charles I.\n\nThere is little doubt in my mind that this interview was what caused Knox\nto print his book without a name. {344}  It was a dangerous thing to\ncontradict the Man of Geneva, and doubly so, surely, when one had had the\nadvantage of correction from him in a private conversation; and Knox had\nhis little flock of English refugees to consider.  If they had fallen\ninto bad odour at Geneva, where else was there left to flee to?  It was\nprinted, as I said, in 1558; and, by a singular _mal-à-propos_, in that\nsame year Mary died, and Elizabeth succeeded to the throne of England.\nAnd just as the accession of Catholic Queen Mary had condemned female\nrule in the eyes of Knox, the accession of Protestant Queen Elizabeth\njustified it in the eyes of his colleagues.  Female rule ceases to be an\nanomaly, not because Elizabeth can “reply to eight ambassadors in one day\nin their different languages,” but because she represents for the moment\nthe political future of the Reformation.  The exiles troop back to\nEngland with songs of praise in their mouths.  The bright occidental\nstar, of which we have all read in the Preface to the Bible, has risen\nover the darkness of Europe.  There is a thrill of hope through the\npersecuted Churches of the Continent.  Calvin writes to Cecil, washing\nhis hands of Knox and his political heresies.  The sale of the “First\nBlast” is prohibited in Geneva; and along with it the bold book of Knox’s\ncolleague, Goodman—a book dear to Milton—where female rule was briefly\ncharacterised as a “monster in nature and disorder among men.” {345a}\nAny who may ever have doubted, or been for a moment led away by Knox or\nGoodman, or their own wicked imaginations, are now more than convinced.\nThey have seen the occidental star.  Aylmer, with his eye set greedily on\na possible bishopric, and “the better to obtain the favour of the new\nQueen,” {345b} sharpens his pen to confound Knox by logic.  What need?\nHe has been confounded by facts.  “Thus what had been to the refugees of\nGeneva as the very word of God, no sooner were they back in England than,\nbehold! it was the word of the devil.” {346a}\n\nNow, what of the real sentiments of these loyal subjects of Elizabeth?\nThey professed a holy horror for Knox’s position: let us see if their own\nwould please a modern audience any better, or was, in substance, greatly\ndifferent.\n\nJohn Aylmer, afterwards Bishop of London, published an answer to Knox,\nunder the title of _An Harbour for Faithful and true Subjects against the\nlate Blown Blast_, _concerning the government of Women_. {346b}  And\ncertainly he was a thought more acute, a thought less precipitate and\nsimple, than his adversary.  He is not to be led away by such captious\nterms as _natural and unnatural_.  It is obvious to him that a woman’s\ndisability to rule is not natural in the same sense in which it is\nnatural for a stone to fall or fire to burn.  He is doubtful, on the\nwhole, whether this disability be natural at all; nay, when he is laying\nit down that a woman should not be a priest, he shows some elementary\nconception of what many of us now hold to be the truth of the matter.\n“The bringing-up of women,” he says, “is commonly such” that they cannot\nhave the necessary qualifications, “for they are not brought up in\nlearning in schools, nor trained in disputation.”  And even so, he can\nask, “Are there not in England women, think you, that for learning and\nwisdom could tell their household and neighbours as good a tale as any\nSir John there?”  For all that, his advocacy is weak.  If women’s rule is\nnot unnatural in a sense preclusive of its very existence, it is neither\nso convenient nor so profitable as the government of men.  He holds\nEngland to be specially suitable for the government of women, because\nthere the governor is more limited and restrained by the other members of\nthe constitution than in other places; and this argument has kept his\nbook from being altogether forgotten.  It is only in hereditary\nmonarchies that he will offer any defence of the anomaly.  “If rulers\nwere to be chosen by lot or suffrage, he would not that any women should\nstand in the election, but men only.”  The law of succession of crowns\nwas a law to him, in the same sense as the law of evolution is a law to\nMr. Herbert Spencer; and the one and the other counsels his readers, in a\nspirit suggestively alike, not to kick against the pricks or seek to be\nmore wise than He who made them. {348}  If God has put a female child\ninto the direct line of inheritance, it is God’s affair.  His strength\nwill be perfected in her weakness.  He makes the Creator address the\nobjectors in this not very flattering vein:—“I, that could make Daniel, a\nsucking babe, to judge better than the wisest lawyers; a brute beast to\nreprehend the folly of a prophet; and poor fishers to confound the great\nclerks of the world—cannot I make a woman to be a good ruler over you?”\nThis is the last word of his reasoning.  Although he was not altogether\nwithout Puritanic leaven, shown particularly in what he says of the\nincomes of Bishops, yet it was rather loyalty to the old order of things\nthan any generous belief in the capacity of women, that raised up for\nthem this clerical champion.  His courtly spirit contrasts singularly\nwith the rude, bracing republicanism of Knox.  “Thy knee shall bow,” he\nsays, “thy cap shall off, thy tongue shall speak reverently of thy\nsovereign.”  For himself, his tongue is even more than reverent.  Nothing\ncan stay the issue of his eloquent adulation.  Again and again, “the\nremembrance of Elizabeth’s virtues” carries him away; and he has to hark\nback again to find the scent of his argument.  He is repressing his\nvehement adoration throughout, until, when the end comes, and he feels\nhis business at an end, he can indulge himself to his heart’s content in\nindiscriminate laudation of his royal mistress.  It is humorous to think\nthat this illustrious lady, whom he here praises, among many other\nexcellences, for the simplicity of her attire and the “marvellous\nmeekness of her stomach,” threatened him, years after, in no very meek\nterms, for a sermon against female vanity in dress, which she held as a\nreflection on herself. {349}\n\nWhatever was wanting here in respect for women generally, there was no\nwant of respect for the Queen; and one cannot very greatly wonder if\nthese devoted servants looked askance, not upon Knox only, but on his\nlittle flock, as they came back to England tainted with disloyal\ndoctrine.  For them, as for him, the occidental star rose somewhat red\nand angry.  As for poor Knox, his position was the saddest of all.  For\nthe juncture seemed to him of the highest importance; it was the nick of\ntime, the flood-water of opportunity.  Not only was there an opening for\nhim in Scotland, a smouldering brand of civil liberty and religious\nenthusiasm which it should be for him to kindle into flame with his\npowerful breath but he had his eye seemingly on an object of even higher\nworth.  For now, when religious sympathy ran so high that it could be set\nagainst national aversion, he wished to begin the fusion together of\nEngland and Scotland, and to begin it at the sore place.  If once the\nopen wound were closed at the Border, the work would be half done.\nMinisters placed at Berwick and such places might seek their converts\nequally on either side of the march; old enemies would sit together to\nhear the gospel of peace, and forget the inherited jealousies of many\ngenerations in the enthusiasm of a common faith; or—let us say better—a\ncommon heresy.  For people are not most conscious of brotherhood when\nthey continue languidly together in one creed, but when, with some doubt,\nwith some danger perhaps, and certainly not without some reluctance, they\nviolently break with the tradition of the past, and go forth from the\nsanctuary of their fathers to worship under the bare heaven.  A new\ncreed, like a new country, is an unhomely place of sojourn; but it makes\nmen lean on one another and join hands.  It was on this that Knox relied\nto begin the union of the English and the Scotch.  And he had, perhaps,\nbetter means of judging than any even of his contemporaries.  He knew the\ntemper of both nations; and already during his two years’ chaplaincy at\nBerwick, he had seen his scheme put to the proof.  But whether\npracticable or not, the proposal does him much honour.  That he should\nthus have sought to make a love-match of it between the two peoples, and\ntried to win their inclination towards a union instead of simply\ntransferring them, like so many sheep, by a marriage, or testament, or\nprivate treaty, is thoroughly characteristic of what is best in the man.\nNor was this all.  He had, besides, to assure himself of English support,\nsecret or avowed, for the reformation party in Scotland; a delicate\naffair, trenching upon treason.  And so he had plenty to say to Cecil,\nplenty that he did not care to “commit to paper neither yet to the\nknowledge of many.”  But his miserable publication had shut the doors of\nEngland in his face.  Summoned to Edinburgh by the confederate lords, he\nwaited at Dieppe, anxiously praying for leave to journey through England.\nThe most dispiriting tidings reach him.  His messengers, coming from so\nobnoxious a quarter, narrowly escape imprisonment.  His old congregation\nare coldly received, and even begin to look back again to their place of\nexile with regret.  “My First Blast,” he writes ruefully, “has blown from\nme all my friends of England.”  And then he adds, with a snarl, “The\nSecond Blast, I fear, shall sound somewhat more sharp, except men be more\nmoderate than I hear they are.” {352a}  But the threat is empty; there\nwill never be a second blast—he has had enough of that trumpet.  Nay, he\nbegins to feel uneasily that, unless he is to be rendered useless for the\nrest of his life, unless he is to lose his right arm and go about his\ngreat work maimed and impotent, he must find some way of making his peace\nwith England and the indignant Queen.  The letter just quoted was written\non the 6th of April 1559; and on the 10th, after he had cooled his heels\nfor four days more about the streets of Dieppe, he gave in altogether,\nand writes a letter of capitulation to Cecil.  In this letter, {352b}\nwhich he kept back until the 22d, still hoping that things would come\nright of themselves, he censures the great secretary for having “followed\nthe world in the way of perdition,” characterises him as “worthy of\nhell,” and threatens him, if he be not found simple, sincere, and fervent\nin the cause of Christ’s gospel, that he shall “taste of the same cup\nthat politic heads have drunken in before him.”  This is all, I take it,\nout of respect for the Reformer’s own position; if he is going to be\nhumiliated, let others be humiliated first; like a child who will not\ntake his medicine until he has made his nurse and his mother drink of it\nbefore him.  “But I have, say you, written a treasonable book against the\nregiment and empire of women. . . . The writing of that book I will not\ndeny; but to prove it treasonable I think it shall be hard. . . . It is\nhinted that my book shall be written against.  If so be, sir, I greatly\ndoubt they shall rather hurt nor (than) mend the matter.”  And here come\nthe terms of capitulation; for he does not surrender unconditionally,\neven in this sore strait: “And yet if any,” he goes on, “think me enemy\nto the person, or yet to the regiment, of her whom God hath now promoted,\nthey are utterly deceived in me, _for the miraculous work of God_,\n_comforting His afflicted by means of an infirm vessel_, _I do\nacknowledge_, _and the power of His most potent hand I will obey_.  _More\nplainly to speak_, _if Queen Elizabeth shall confess_, _that the\nextraordinary dispensation of God’s great mercy maketh that lawful unto\nher which both nature and God’s law do deny to all women_, then shall\nnone in England be more willing to maintain her lawful authority than I\nshall be.  But if (God’s wondrous work set aside) she ground (as God\nforbid) the justness of her title upon consuetude, laws, or ordinances of\nmen, then”—Then Knox will denounce her?  Not so; he is more politic\nnowadays—then, he “greatly fears” that her ingratitude to God will not go\nlong without punishment.\n\nHis letter to Elizabeth, written some few months later, was a mere\namplification of the sentences quoted above.  She must base her title\nentirely upon the extraordinary providence of God; but if she does this,\n“if thus, in God’s presence, she humbles herself, so will he with tongue\nand pen justify her authority, as the Holy Ghost hath justified the same\nin Deborah, that blessed mother in Israel.” {354}  And so, you see, his\nconsistency is preserved; he is merely applying the doctrine of the\n“First Blast.”  The argument goes thus: The regiment of women is, as\nbefore noted in our work, repugnant to nature, contumely to God, and a\nsubversion of good order.  It has nevertheless pleased God to raise up,\nas exceptions to this law, first Deborah, and afterward Elizabeth\nTudor—whose regiment we shall proceed to celebrate.\n\nThere is no evidence as to how the Reformer’s explanations were received,\nand indeed it is most probable that the letter was never shown to\nElizabeth at all.  For it was sent under cover of another to Cecil, and\nas it was not of a very courtly conception throughout, and was, of all\nthings, what would most excite the Queen’s uneasy jealousy about her\ntitle, it is like enough that the secretary exercised his discretion (he\nhad Knox’s leave in this case, and did not always wait for that, it is\nreputed) to put the letter harmlessly away beside other valueless or\nunpresentable State Papers.  I wonder very much if he did the same with\nanother, {355} written two years later, after Mary had come into\nScotland, in which Knox almost seeks to make Elizabeth an accomplice with\nhim in the matter of the “First Blast.”  The Queen of Scotland is going\nto have that work refuted, he tells her; and “though it were but\nfoolishness in him to prescribe unto her Majesty what is to be done,” he\nwould yet remind her that Mary is neither so much alarmed about her own\nsecurity, nor so generously interested in Elizabeth’s, “that she would\ntake such pains, _unless her crafty counsel in so doing shot at a further\nmark_.”  There is something really ingenious in this letter; it showed\nKnox in the double capacity of the author of the “First Blast” and the\nfaithful friend of Elizabeth; and he combines them there so naturally,\nthat one would scarcely imagine the two to be incongruous.\n\nTwenty days later he was defending his intemperate publication to another\nqueen—his own queen, Mary Stuart.  This was on the first of those three\ninterviews which he has preserved for us with so much dramatic vigour in\nthe picturesque pages of his history.  After he had avowed the authorship\nin his usual haughty style, Mary asked: “You think, then, that I have no\njust authority?”  The question was evaded.  “Please your Majesty,” he\nanswered, “that learned men in all ages have had their judgments free,\nand most commonly disagreeing from the common judgment of the world; such\nalso have they published by pen and tongue; and yet notwithstanding they\nthemselves have lived in the common society with others, and have borne\npatiently with the errors and imperfections which they could not amend.”\nThus did “Plato the philosopher:” thus will do John Knox.  “I have\ncommunicated my judgment to the world: if the realm finds no\ninconvenience from the regiment of a woman, that which they approve,\nshall I not further disallow than within my own breast; but shall be as\nwell content to live under your Grace, as Paul was to live under Nero.\nAnd my hope is, that so long as ye defile not your hands with the blood\nof the saints of God, neither I nor my book shall hurt either you or your\nauthority.”  All this is admirable in wisdom and moderation, and, except\nthat he might have hit upon a comparison less offensive than that with\nPaul and Nero, hardly to be bettered.  Having said thus much, he feels he\nneeds say no more; and so, when he is further pressed, he closes that\npart of the discussion with an astonishing sally.  If he has been content\nto let this matter sleep, he would recommend her Grace to follow his\nexample with thankfulness of heart; it is grimly to be understood which\nof them has most to fear if the question should be reawakened.  So the\ntalk wandered to other subjects.  Only, when the Queen was summoned at\nlast to dinner (“for it was afternoon”) Knox made his salutation in this\nform of words: “I pray God, Madam, that you may be as much blessed within\nthe Commonwealth of Scotland, if it be the pleasure of God, as ever\nDeborah was in the Commonwealth of Israel.” {357}  Deborah again.\n\nBut he was not yet done with the echoes of his own “First Blast.”  In\n1571, when he was already near his end, the old controversy was taken up\nin one of a series of anonymous libels against the Reformer affixed,\nSunday after Sunday, to the church door.  The dilemma was fairly enough\nstated.  Either his doctrine is false, in which case he is a “false\ndoctor” and seditious; or, if it be true, why does he “avow and approve\nthe contrare, I mean that regiment in the Queen of England’s person;\nwhich he avoweth and approveth, not only praying for the maintenance of\nher estate, but also procuring her aid and support against his own native\ncountry?”  Knox answered the libel, as his wont was, next Sunday, from\nthe pulpit.  He justified the “First Blast” with all the old arrogance;\nthere is no drawing back there.  The regiment of women is repugnant to\nnature, contumely to God, and a subversion of good order, as before.\nWhen he prays for the maintenance of Elizabeth’s estate, he is only\nfollowing the example of those prophets of God who warned and comforted\nthe wicked kings of Israel; or of Jeremiah, who bade the Jews pray for\nthe prosperity of Nebuchadnezzar.  As for the Queen’s aid, there is no\nharm in that: _quia_ (these are his own words) _quia omnia munda mundis_:\nbecause to the pure all things are pure.  One thing, in conclusion, he\n“may not pretermit” to give the lie in the throat to his accuser, where\nhe charges him with seeking support against his native country.  “What I\nhave been to my country,” said the old Reformer, “What I have been to my\ncountry, albeit this unthankful age will not know, yet the ages to come\nwill be compelled to bear witness to the truth.  And thus I cease,\nrequiring of all men that have anything to oppone against me, that he may\n(they may) do it so plainly, as that I may make myself and all my doings\nmanifest to the world.  For to me it seemeth a thing unreasonable, that,\nin this my decrepit age, I shall be compelled to fight against shadows,\nand howlets that dare not abide the light.” {359}\n\nNow, in this, which may be called his _Last Blast_, there is as sharp\nspeaking as any in the “First Blast” itself.  He is of the same opinion\nto the end, you see, although he has been obliged to cloak and garble\nthat opinion for political ends.  He has been tacking indeed, and he has\nindeed been seeking the favour of a queen; but what man ever sought a\nqueen’s favour with a more virtuous purpose, or with as little courtly\npolicy?  The question of consistency is delicate, and must be made plain.\nKnox never changed his opinion about female rule, but lived to regret\nthat he had published that opinion.  Doubtless he had many thoughts so\nfar out of the range of public sympathy, that he could only keep them to\nhimself, and, in his own words, bear patiently with the errors and\nimperfections that he could not amend.  For example, I make no doubt\nmyself that, in his own heart, he did hold the shocking dogma attributed\nto him by more than one calumniator; and that, had the time been ripe,\nhad there been aught to gain by it, instead of all to lose, he would have\nbeen the first to assert that Scotland was elective instead of\nhereditary—“elective as in the days of paganism,” as one Thevet says in\nholy horror. {360}  And yet, because the time was not ripe, I find no\nhint of such an idea in his collected works.  Now, the regiment of women\nwas another matter that he should have kept to himself; right or wrong,\nhis opinion did not fit the moment; right or wrong, as Aylmer puts it,\n“the _Blast_ was blown out of season.”  And this it was that he began to\nperceive after the accession of Elizabeth; not that he had been wrong,\nand that female rule was a good thing, for he had said from the first\nthat “the felicity of some women in their empires” could not change the\nlaw of God and the nature of created things; not this, but that the\nregiment of women was one of those imperfections of society which must be\nborne with because yet they cannot be remedied.  The thing had seemed so\nobvious to him, in his sense of unspeakable masculine superiority, and\nhis fine contempt for what is only sanctioned by antiquity and common\nconsent, he had imagined that, at the first hint, men would arise and\nshake off the debasing tyranny.  He found himself wrong, and he showed\nthat he could be moderate in his own fashion, and understood the spirit\nof true compromise.  He came round to Calvin’s position, in fact, but by\na different way.  And it derogates nothing from the merit of this wise\nattitude that it was the consequence of a change of interest.  We are all\ntaught by interest; and if the interest be not merely selfish, there is\nno wiser preceptor under heaven, and perhaps no sterner.\n\nSuch is the history of John Knox’s connection with the controversy about\nfemale rule.  In itself, this is obviously an incomplete study; not fully\nto be understood, without a knowledge of his private relations with the\nother sex, and what he thought of their position in domestic life.  This\nshall be dealt with in another paper.\n\n\n\nII.—PRIVATE LIFE.\n\n\nTO those who know Knox by hearsay only, I believe the matter of this\npaper will be somewhat astonishing.  For the hard energy of the man in\nall public matters has possessed the imagination of the world; he remains\nfor posterity in certain traditional phrases, browbeating Queen Mary, or\nbreaking beautiful carved work in abbeys and cathedrals, that had long\nsmoked themselves out and were no more than sorry ruins, while he was\nstill quietly teaching children in a country gentleman’s family.  It does\nnot consist with the common acceptation of his character to fancy him\nmuch moved, except with anger.  And yet the language of passion came to\nhis pen as readily, whether it was a passion of denunciation against some\nof the abuses that vexed his righteous spirit, or of yearning for the\nsociety of an absent friend.  He was vehement in affection, as in\ndoctrine.  I will not deny that there may have been, along with his\nvehemence, something shifty, and for the moment only; that, like many\nmen, and many Scotchmen, he saw the world and his own heart, not so much\nunder any very steady, equable light, as by extreme flashes of passion,\ntrue for the moment, but not true in the long run.  There does seem to me\nto be something of this traceable in the Reformer’s utterances:\nprecipitation and repentance, hardy speech and action somewhat\ncircumspect, a strong tendency to see himself in a heroic light and to\nplace a ready belief in the disposition of the moment.  Withal he had\nconsiderable confidence in himself, and in the uprightness of his own\ndisciplined emotions, underlying much sincere aspiration after spiritual\nhumility.  And it is this confidence that makes his intercourse with\nwomen so interesting to a modern.  It would be easy, of course, to make\nfun of the whole affair, to picture him strutting vaingloriously among\nthese inferior creatures, or compare a religious friendship in the\nsixteenth century with what was called, I think, a literary friendship in\nthe eighteenth.  But it is more just and profitable to recognise what\nthere is sterling and human underneath all his theoretical affectations\nof superiority.  Women, he has said in his “First Blast,” are, “weak,\nfrail, impatient, feeble, and foolish;” and yet it does not appear that\nhe was himself any less dependent than other men upon the sympathy and\naffection of these weak, frail, impatient, feeble, and foolish creatures;\nit seems even as if he had been rather more dependent than most.\n\nOf those who are to act influentially on their fellows, we should expect\nalways something large and public in their way of life, something more or\nless urbane and comprehensive in their sentiment for others.  We should\nnot expect to see them spend their sympathy in idyls, however beautiful.\nWe should not seek them among those who, if they have but a wife to their\nbosom, ask no more of womankind, just as they ask no more of their own\nsex, if they can find a friend or two for their immediate need.  They\nwill be quick to feel all the pleasures of our association—not the great\nones alone, but all.  They will know not love only, but all those other\nways in which man and woman mutually make each other happy—by sympathy,\nby admiration, by the atmosphere they bear about them—down to the mere\nimpersonal pleasure of passing happy faces in the street.  For, through\nall this gradation, the difference of sex makes itself pleasurably felt.\nDown to the most lukewarm courtesies of life, there is a special chivalry\ndue and a special pleasure received, when the two sexes are brought ever\nso lightly into contact.  We love our mothers otherwise than we love our\nfathers; a sister is not as a brother to us; and friendship between man\nand woman, be it never so unalloyed and innocent, is not the same as\nfriendship between man and man.  Such friendship is not even possible for\nall.  To conjoin tenderness for a woman that is not far short of\npassionate with such disinterestedness and beautiful gratuity of\naffection as there is between friends of the same sex, requires no\nordinary disposition in the man.  For either it would presuppose quite\nwomanly delicacy of perception, and, as it were, a curiosity in shades of\ndiffering sentiment; or it would mean that he had accepted the large,\nsimple divisions of society: a strong and positive spirit robustly\nvirtuous, who has chosen a better part coarsely, and holds to it\nsteadfastly, with all its consequences of pain to himself and others; as\none who should go straight before him on a journey, neither tempted by\nwayside flowers nor very scrupulous of small lives under foot.  It was in\nvirtue of this latter disposition that Knox was capable of those\nintimacies with women that embellished his life; and we find him\npreserved for us in old letters as a man of many women friends; a man of\nsome expansion toward the other sex; a man ever ready to comfort weeping\nwomen, and to weep along with them.\n\nOf such scraps and fragments of evidence as to his private life and more\nintimate thoughts as have survived to us from all the perils that environ\nwritten paper, an astonishingly large proportion is in the shape of\nletters to women of his familiarity.  He was twice married, but that is\nnot greatly to the purpose; for the Turk, who thinks even more meanly of\nwomen than John Knox, is none the less given to marrying.  What is really\nsignificant is quite apart from marriage.  For the man Knox was a true\nman, and woman, the _ewig-weibliche_, was as necessary to him, in spite\nof all low theories, as ever she was to Goethe.  He came to her in a\ncertain halo of his own, as the minister of truth, just as Goethe came to\nher in a glory of art; he made himself necessary to troubled hearts and\nminds exercised in the painful complications that naturally result from\nall changes in the world’s way of thinking; and those whom he had thus\nhelped became dear to him, and were made the chosen companions of his\nleisure if they were at hand, or encouraged and comforted by letter if\nthey were afar.\n\nIt must not be forgotten that Knox had been a presbyter of the old\nChurch, and that the many women whom we shall see gathering around him,\nas he goes through life, had probably been accustomed, while still in the\ncommunion of Rome, to rely much upon some chosen spiritual director, so\nthat the intimacies of which I propose to offer some account, while\ntestifying to a good heart in the Reformer, testify also to a certain\nsurvival of the spirit of the confessional in the Reformed Church, and\nare not properly to be judged without this idea.  There is no friendship\nso noble, but it is the product of the time; and a world of little\nfinical observances, and little frail proprieties and fashions of the\nhour, go to make or to mar, to stint or to perfect, the union of spirits\nthe most loving and the most intolerant of such interference.  The trick\nof the country and the age steps in even between the mother and her\nchild, counts out their caresses upon niggardly fingers, and says, in the\nvoice of authority, that this one thing shall be a matter of confidence\nbetween them, and this other thing shall not.  And thus it is that we\nmust take into reckoning whatever tended to modify the social atmosphere\nin which Knox and his women friends met, and loved and trusted each\nother.  To the man who had been their priest and was now their minister,\nwomen would be able to speak with a confidence quite impossible in these\nlatter days; the women would be able to speak, and the man to hear.  It\nwas a beaten road just then; and I daresay we should be no less\nscandalised at their plain speech than they, if they could come back to\nearth, would be offended at our waltzes and worldly fashions.  This,\nthen, was the footing on which Knox stood with his many women friends.\nThe reader will see, as he goes on, how much of warmth, of interest, and\nof that happy mutual dependence which is the very gist of friendship, he\ncontrived to ingraft upon this somewhat dry relationship of penitent and\nconfessor.\n\nIt must be understood that we know nothing of his intercourse with women\n(as indeed we know little at all about his life) until he came to Berwick\nin 1549, when he was already in the forty-fifth year of his age.  At the\nsame time it is just possible that some of a little group at Edinburgh,\nwith whom he corresponded during his last absence, may have been friends\nof an older standing.  Certainly they were, of all his female\ncorrespondents, the least personally favoured.  He treats them throughout\nin a comprehensive sort of spirit that must at times have been a little\nwounding.  Thus, he remits one of them to his former letters, “which I\ntrust be common betwixt you and the rest of our sisters, for to me ye are\nall equal in Christ.” {368}  Another letter is a gem in this way.\n“Albeit” it begins, “albeit I have no particular matter to write unto\nyou, beloved sister, yet I could not refrain to write these few lines to\nyou in declaration of my remembrance of you.  True it is that I have many\nwhom I bear in equal remembrance before God with you, to whom at present\nI write nothing, either for that I esteem them stronger than you, and\ntherefore they need the less my rude labours, or else because they have\nnot provoked me by their writing to recompense their remembrance.” {369a}\nHis “sisters in Edinburgh” had evidently to “provoke” his attention\npretty constantly; nearly all his letters are, on the face of them,\nanswers to questions, and the answers are given with a certain crudity\nthat I do not find repeated when he writes to those he really cares for.\nSo when they consult him about women’s apparel (a subject on which his\nopinion may be pretty correctly imagined by the ingenious reader for\nhimself) he takes occasion to anticipate some of the most offensive\nmatter of the “First Blast” in a style of real brutality. {369b}  It is\nnot merely that he tells them “the garments of women do declare their\nweakness and inability to execute the office of man,” though that in\nitself is neither very wise nor very opportune in such a correspondence\none would think; but if the reader will take the trouble to wade through\nthe long, tedious sermon for himself, he will see proof enough that Knox\nneither loved, nor very deeply respected, the women he was then\naddressing.  In very truth, I believe these Edinburgh sisters simply\nbored him.  He had a certain interest in them as his children in the\nLord; they were continually “provoking him by their writing;” and, if\nthey handed his letters about, writing to them was as good a form of\npublication as was then open to him in Scotland.  There is one letter,\nhowever, in this budget, addressed to the wife of Clerk-Register Mackgil,\nwhich is worthy of some further mention.  The Clerk-Register had not\nopened his heart, it would appear, to the preaching of the Gospel, and\nMrs. Mackgil has written, seeking the Reformer’s prayers in his behalf.\n“Your husband,” he answers, “is dear to me for that he is a man indued\nwith some good gifts, but more dear for that he is your husband.  Charity\nmoveth me to thirst his illumination, both for his comfort and for the\ntrouble which you sustain by his coldness, which justly may be called\ninfidelity.”  He wishes her, however, not to hope too much; he can\npromise that his prayers will be earnest, but not that they will be\neffectual; it is possible that this is to be her “cross” in life; that\n“her head, appointed by God for her comfort, should be her enemy.”  And\nif this be so, well, there is nothing for it; “with patience she must\nabide God’s merciful deliverance,” taking heed only that she does not\n“obey manifest iniquity for the pleasure of any mortal man.” {371a}  I\nconceive this epistle would have given a very modified sort of pleasure\nto the Clerk-Register, had it chanced to fall into his hands.  Compare\nits tenor—the dry resignation not without a hope of merciful deliverance\ntherein recommended—with these words from another letter, written but the\nyear before to two married women of London: “Call first for grace by\nJesus, and thereafter communicate with your faithful husbands, and then\nshall God, I doubt not, conduct your footsteps, and direct your counsels\nto His glory.” {371b}  Here the husbands are put in a very high place; we\ncan recognise here the same hand that has written for our instruction how\nthe man is set above the woman, even as God above the angels.  But the\npoint of the distinction is plain.  For Clerk-Register Mackgil was not a\nfaithful husband; displayed, indeed, towards religion a “coldness which\njustly might be called infidelity.”  We shall see in more notable\ninstances how much Knox’s conception of the duty of wives varies\naccording to the zeal and orthodoxy of the husband.\n\nAs I have said, he may possibly have made the acquaintance of Mrs.\nMackgil, Mrs. Guthrie, or some other, or all, of these Edinburgh friends\nwhile he was still Douglas of Longniddry’s private tutor.  But our\ncertain knowledge begins in 1549.  He was then but newly escaped from his\ncaptivity in France, after pulling an oar for nineteen months on the\nbenches of the galley _Nostre Dame_; now up the rivers, holding stealthy\nintercourse with other Scottish prisoners in the castle of Rouen; now out\nin the North Sea, raising his sick head to catch a glimpse of the far-off\nsteeples of St. Andrews.  And now he was sent down by the English Privy\nCouncil as a preacher to Berwick-upon-Tweed; somewhat shaken in health by\nall his hardships, full of pains and agues, and tormented by gravel, that\nsorrow of great men; altogether, what with his romantic story, his weak\nhealth, and his great faculty of eloquence, a very natural object for the\nsympathy of devout women.  At this happy juncture he fell into the\ncompany of a Mrs. Elizabeth Bowes, wife of Richard Bowes, of Aske, in\nYorkshire, to whom she had borne twelve children.  She was a religious\nhypochondriac, a very weariful woman, full of doubts and scruples, and\ngiving no rest on earth either to herself or to those whom she honoured\nwith her confidence.  From the first time she heard Knox preach she\nformed a high opinion of him, and was solicitous ever after of his\nsociety. {373a}  Nor was Knox unresponsive. “I have always delighted in\nyour company,” he writes, “and when labours would permit, you know I have\nnot spared hours to talk and commune with you.”  Often when they had met\nin depression he reminds her, “God hath sent great comfort unto both.”\n{373b}  We can gather from such letters as are yet extant how close and\ncontinuous was their intercourse.  “I think it best you remain till the\nmorrow,” he writes once, “and so shall we commune at large at afternoon.\nThis day you know to be the day of my study and prayer unto God; yet if\nyour trouble be intolerable, or, if you think my presence may release\nyour pain, do as the Spirit shall move you. . . . Your messenger found me\nin bed, after a sore trouble and most dolorous night, and so dolour may\ncomplain to dolour when we two meet. . . . And this is more plain than\never I spoke, to let you know you have a companion in trouble.” {373c}\nOnce we have the curtain raised for a moment, and can look at the two\ntogether for the length of a phrase.  “After the writing of this\npreceding,” writes Knox, “your brother and mine, Harrie Wycliffe, did\nadvertise me by writing, that your adversary (the devil) took occasion to\ntrouble you because that _I did start back from you rehearsing your\ninfirmities_.  _I remember myself so to have done_, _and that is my\ncommon on consuetude when anything pierceth or toucheth my heart_.  _Call\nto your mind what I did standing at the cupboard at Alnwick_.  In very\ndeed I thought that no creature had been tempted as I was; and when I\nheard proceed from your mouth the very same words that he troubles me\nwith, I did wonder and from my heart lament your sore trouble, knowing in\nmyself the dolour thereof.” {374a}  Now intercourse of so very close a\ndescription, whether it be religious intercourse or not, is apt to\ndisplease and disquiet a husband; and we know incidentally from Knox\nhimself that there was some little scandal about his intimacy with Mrs.\nBowes.  “The slander and fear of men,” he writes, “has impeded me to\nexercise my pen so oft as I would;_ yea_, _very shame hath holden me from\nyour company_, _when I was most surely persuaded that God had appointed\nme at that time to comfort and feed your hungry and afflicted soul_.\n_God in His infinite mercy_,” he goes on, “_remove not only from me all\nfear that tendeth not to godliness_, _but from others suspicion to judge\nof me otherwise than it becometh one member to judge of another_.” {374b}\nAnd the scandal, such as it was, would not be allayed by the dissension\nin which Mrs. Bowes seems to have lived with her family upon the matter\nof religion, and the countenance shown by Knox to her resistance.\nTalking of these conflicts, and her courage against “her own flesh and\nmost inward affections, yea, against some of her most natural friends,”\nhe writes it, “to the praise of God, he has wondered at the bold\nconstancy which he has found in her when his own heart was faint.” {375a}\n\nNow, perhaps in order to stop scandalous mouths, perhaps out of a desire\nto bind the much-loved evangelist nearer to her in the only manner\npossible, Mrs. Bowes conceived the scheme of marrying him to her fifth\ndaughter, Marjorie; and the Reformer seems to have fallen in with it\nreadily enough.  It seems to have been believed in the family that the\nwhole matter had been originally made up between these two, with no very\nspontaneous inclination on the part of the bride. {375b}  Knox’s idea of\nmarriage, as I have said, was not the same for all men; but on the whole,\nit was not lofty.  We have a curious letter of his, written at the\nrequest of Queen Mary, to the Earl of Argyle, on very delicate household\nmatters; which, as he tells us, “was not well accepted of the said Earl.”\n{375c}  We may suppose, however, that his own home was regulated in a\nsimilar spirit.  I can fancy that for such a man, emotional, and with a\nneed, now and again, to exercise parsimony in emotions not strictly\nneedful, something a little mechanical, something hard and fast and\nclearly understood, would enter into his ideal of a home.  There were\nstorms enough without, and equability was to be desired at the fireside\neven at a sacrifice of deeper pleasures.  So, from a wife, of all women,\nhe would not ask much.  One letter to her which has come down to us is, I\nhad almost said, conspicuous for coldness. {376}  He calls her, as he\ncalled other female correspondents, “dearly beloved sister;” the epistle\nis doctrinal, and nearly the half of it bears, not upon her own case, but\nupon that of her mother.  However, we know what Heine wrote in his wife’s\nalbum; and there is, after all, one passage that may be held to intimate\nsome tenderness, although even that admits of an amusingly opposite\nconstruction.  “I think,” he says, “I _think_ this be the first letter I\never wrote to you.”  This, if we are to take it literally, may pair off\nwith the “two _or three_ children” whom Montaigne mentions having lost at\nnurse; the one is as eccentric in a lover as the other in a parent.\nNevertheless, he displayed more energy in the course of his troubled\nwooing than might have been expected.  The whole Bowes family, angry\nenough already at the influence he had obtained over the mother, set\ntheir faces obdurately against the match.  And I daresay the opposition\nquickened his inclination.  I find him writing to Mrs. Bowes that she\nneed no further trouble herself about the marriage; it should now be his\nbusiness altogether; it behoved him now to jeopard his life “for the\ncomfort of his own flesh, both fear and friendship of all earthly\ncreature laid aside.” {377}  This is a wonderfully chivalrous utterance\nfor a Reformer forty-eight years old; and it compares well with the\nleaden coquetries of Calvin, not much over thirty, taking this and that\ninto consideration, weighing together dowries and religious\nqualifications and the instancy of friends, and exhibiting what M.\nBungener calls “an honourable and Christian difficulty” of choice, in\nfrigid indecisions and insincere proposals.  But Knox’s next letter is in\na humbler tone; he has not found the negotiation so easy as he fancied;\nhe despairs of the marriage altogether, and talks of leaving\nEngland,—regards not “what country consumes his wicked carcass.”  “You\nshall understand,” he says, “that this sixth of November, I spoke with\nSir Robert Bowes” (the head of the family, his bride’s uncle) “in the\nmatter you know, according to your request; whose disdainful, yea,\ndespiteful, words hath so pierced my heart that my life is bitter to me.\nI bear a good countenance with a sore troubled heart, because he that\nought to consider matters with a deep judgment is become not only a\ndespiser, but also a taunter of God’s messengers—God be merciful unto\nhim!  Amongst others his most unpleasing words, while that I was about to\nhave declared my heart in the whole matter, he said, ‘Away with your\nrhetorical reasons! for I will not be persuaded with them.’  God knows I\ndid use no rhetoric nor coloured speech; but would have spoken the truth,\nand that in most simple manner.  I am not a good orator in my own cause;\nbut what he would not be content to hear of me, God shall declare to him\none day to his displeasure, unless he repent.” {378}  Poor Knox, you see,\nis quite commoved.  It has been a very unpleasant interview.  And as it\nis the only sample that we have of how things went with him during his\ncourtship, we may infer that the period was not as agreeable for Knox as\nit has been for some others.\n\nHowever, when once they were married, I imagine he and Marjorie Bowes hit\nit off together comfortably enough.  The little we know of it may be\nbrought together in a very short space.  She bore him two sons.  He seems\nto have kept her pretty busy, and depended on her to some degree in his\nwork; so that when she fell ill, his papers got at once into disorder.\n{379a}  Certainly she sometimes wrote to his dictation; and, in this\ncapacity, he calls her “his left hand.” {379b}  In June 1559, at the\nheadiest moment of the Reformation in Scotland, he writes regretting the\nabsence of his helpful colleague, Goodman, “whose presence” (this is the\nnot very grammatical form of his lament) “whose presence I more thirst,\nthan she that is my own flesh.” {379c}  And this, considering the source\nand the circumstances, may be held as evidence of a very tender\nsentiment.  He tells us himself in his history, on the occasion of a\ncertain meeting at the Kirk of Field, that “he was in no small heaviness\nby reason of the late death of his dear bed-fellow, Marjorie Bowes.”\n{379d}  Calvin, condoling with him, speaks of her as “a wife whose like\nis not to be found everywhere” (that is very like Calvin), and again, as\n“the most delightful of wives.”  We know what Calvin thought desirable in\na wife, “good humour, chastity, thrift, patience, and solicitude for her\nhusband’s health,” and so we may suppose that the first Mrs. Knox fell\nnot far short of this ideal.\n\nThe actual date of the marriage is uncertain but by September 1566, at\nthe latest, the Reformer was settled in Geneva with his wife.  There is\nno fear either that he will be dull; even if the chaste, thrifty, patient\nMarjorie should not altogether occupy his mind, he need not go out of the\nhouse to seek more female sympathy; for behold!  Mrs. Bowes is duly\ndomesticated with the young couple.  Dr. M‘Crie imagined that Richard\nBowes was now dead, and his widow, consequently, free to live where she\nwould; and where could she go more naturally than to the house of a\nmarried daughter?  This, however, is not the case.  Richard Bowes did not\ndie till at least two years later.  It is impossible to believe that he\napproved of his wife’s desertion, after so many years of marriage, after\ntwelve children had been born to them; and accordingly we find in his\nwill, dated 1558, no mention either of her or of Knox’s wife. {380}  This\nis plain sailing.  It is easy enough to understand the anger of Bowes\nagainst this interloper, who had come into a quiet family, married the\ndaughter in spite of the father’s opposition, alienated the wife from the\nhusband and the husband’s religion, supported her in a long course of\nresistance and rebellion, and, after years of intimacy, already too close\nand tender for any jealous spirit to behold without resentment, carried\nher away with him at last into a foreign land.  But it is not quite easy\nto understand how, except out of sheer weariness and disgust, he was ever\nbrought to agree to the arrangement.  Nor is it easy to square the\nReformer’s conduct with his public teaching.  We have, for instance, a\nletter by him, Craig, and Spottiswood, to the Archbishops of Canterbury\nand York, anent “a wicked and rebellious woman,” one Anne Good, spouse to\n“John Barron, a minister of Christ Jesus his evangel,” who, “after great\nrebellion shown unto him, and divers admonitions given, as well by\nhimself as by others in his name, that she should in no wise depart from\nthis realm, nor from his house without his license, hath not the less\nstubbornly and rebelliously departed, separated herself from his society,\nleft his house, and withdrawn herself from this realm.” {381}  Perhaps\nsome sort of license was extorted, as I have said, from Richard Bowes,\nweary with years of domestic dissension; but setting that aside, the\nwords employed with so much righteous indignation by Knox, Craig, and\nSpottiswood, to describe the conduct of that wicked and rebellious woman,\nMrs. Barron, would describe nearly as exactly the conduct of the\nreligious Mrs. Bowes.  It is a little bewildering, until we recollect the\ndistinction between faithful and unfaithful husbands; for Barron was “a\nminister of Christ Jesus his evangel,” while Richard Bowes, besides being\nown brother to a despiser and taunter of God’s messengers, is shrewdly\nsuspected to have been “a bigoted adherent of the Roman Catholic faith,”\nor, as Knox himself would have expressed it, “a rotten Papist.”\n\nYou would have thought that Knox was now pretty well supplied with female\nsociety.  But we are not yet at the end of the roll.  The last year of\nhis sojourn in England had been spent principally in London, where he was\nresident as one of the chaplains of Edward the Sixth; and here he boasts,\nalthough a stranger, he had, by God’s grace, found favour before many.\n{382a}  The godly women of the metropolis made much of him; once he\nwrites to Mrs. Bowes that her last letter had found him closeted with\nthree, and he and the three women were all in tears. {382b}  Out of all,\nhowever, he had chosen two. “_God_,” he writes to them, “_brought us in\nsuch familiar acquaintance_, _that your hearts were incensed and kindled\nwith a special care over me_, _as a mother useth to be over her natural\nchild_; and my heart was opened and compelled in your presence to be more\nplain than ever I was to any.” {382c}  And out of the two even he had\nchosen one, Mrs. Anne Locke, wife to Mr. Harry Locke, merchant, nigh to\nBow Kirk, Cheapside, in London, as the address runs.  If one may venture\nto judge upon such imperfect evidence, this was the woman he loved best.\nI have a difficulty in quite forming to myself an idea of her character.\nShe may have been one of the three tearful visitors before alluded to;\nshe may even have been that one of them who was so profoundly moved by\nsome passages of Mrs. Bowes’s letter, which the Reformer opened, and read\naloud to them before they went.  “O would to God,” cried this\nimpressionable matron, “would to God that I might speak with that person,\nfor I perceive there are more tempted than I.” {383}  This may have been\nMrs. Locke, as I say; but even if it were, we must not conclude from this\none fact that she was such another as Mrs. Bowes.  All the evidence tends\nthe other way.  She was a woman of understanding, plainly, who followed\npolitical events with interest, and to whom Knox thought it worth while\nto write, in detail, the history of his trials and successes.  She was\nreligious, but without that morbid perversity of spirit that made\nreligion so heavy a burden for the poor-hearted Mrs. Bowes.  More of her\nI do not find, save testimony to the profound affection that united her\nto the Reformer.  So we find him writing to her from Geneva, in such\nterms as these:—“You write that your desire is earnest to see me.  _Dear\nsister_, _if I should express the thirst and languor which I have had for\nyour presence_, _I should appear to pass measure_. . . _Yea_, _I weep and\nrejoice in remembrance of you_; but that would evanish by the comfort of\nyour presence, which I assure you is so dear to me, that if the charge of\nthis little flock here, gathered together in Christ’s name, did not\nimpede me, my coming should prevent my letter.” {384}  I say that this\nwas written from Geneva; and yet you will observe that it is no\nconsideration for his wife or mother-in-law, only the charge of his\nlittle flock, that keeps him from setting out forthwith for London, to\ncomfort himself with the dear presence of Mrs. Locke.  Remember that was\na certain plausible enough pretext for Mrs. Locke to come to Geneva—“the\nmost perfect school of Christ that ever was on earth since the days of\nthe Apostles”—for we are now under the reign of that “horrible monster\nJezebel of England,” when a lady of good orthodox sentiments was better\nout of London.  It was doubtful, however, whether this was to be.  She\nwas detained in England, partly by circumstances unknown, “partly by\nempire of her head,” Mr. Harry Locke, the Cheapside merchant.  It is\nsomewhat humorous to see Knox struggling for resignation, now that he has\nto do with a faithful husband (for Mr. Harry Locke was faithful).  Had it\nbeen otherwise, “in my heart,” he says, “I could have wished—yea,” here\nhe breaks out, “yea, and cannot cease to wish—that God would guide you to\nthis place.” {385}  And after all, he had not long to wait, for, whether\nMr. Harry Locke died in the interval, or was wearied, he too, into giving\npermission, five months after the date of the letter last quoted, “Mrs.\nAnne Locke, Harry her son, and Anne her daughter, and Katharine her\nmaid,” arrived in that perfect school of Christ, the Presbyterian\nparadise, Geneva.  So now, and for the next two years, the cup of Knox’s\nhappiness was surely full.  Of an afternoon, when the bells rang out for\nthe sermon, the shops closed, and the good folk gathered to the churches,\npsalm-book in hand, we can imagine him drawing near to the English chapel\nin quite patriarchal fashion, with Mrs. Knox and Mrs. Bowes and Mrs.\nLocke, James his servant, Patrick his pupil, and a due following of\nchildren and maids.  He might be alone at work all morning in his study,\nfor he wrote much during these two years; but at night, you may be sure\nthere was a circle of admiring women, eager to hear the new paragraph,\nand not sparing of applause.  And what work, among others, was he\nelaborating at this time, but the notorious “First Blast”?  So that he\nmay have rolled out in his big pulpit voice, how women were weak, frail,\nimpatient, feeble, foolish, inconstant, variable, cruel, and lacking the\nspirit of counsel, and how men were above them, even as God is above the\nangels, in the ears of his own wife, and the two dearest friends he had\non earth.  But he had lost the sense of incongruity, and continued to\ndespise in theory the sex he honoured so much in practice, of whom he\nchose his most intimate associates, and whose courage he was compelled to\nwonder at, when his own heart was faint.\n\nWe may say that such a man was not worthy of his fortune; and so, as he\nwould not learn, he was taken away from that agreeable school, and his\nfellowship of women was broken up, not to be reunited.  Called into\nScotland to take at last that strange position in history which is his\nbest claim to commemoration, he was followed thither by his wife and his\nmother-in-law.  The wife soon died.  The death of her daughter did not\naltogether separate Mrs. Bowes from Knox, but she seems to have come and\ngone between his house and England.  In 1562, however, we find him\ncharacterised as “a sole man by reason of the absence of his\nmother-in-law, Mrs. Bowes,” and a passport is got for her, her man, a\nmaid, and “three horses, whereof two shall return,” as well as liberty to\ntake all her own money with her into Scotland.  This looks like a\ndefinite arrangement; but whether she died at Edinburgh, or went back to\nEngland yet again, I cannot find.\n\nWith that great family of hers, unless in leaving her husband she had\nquarrelled with them all, there must have been frequent occasion for her\npresence, one would think.  Knox at least survived her; and we possess\nhis epigraph to their long intimacy, given to the world by him in an\nappendix to his latest publication.  I have said in a former paper that\nKnox was not shy of personal revelations in his published works.  And the\ntrick seems to have grown on him.  To this last tract, a controversial\nonslaught on a Scottish Jesuit, he prefixed a prayer, not very pertinent\nto the matter in hand, and containing references to his family which were\nthe occasion of some wit in his adversary’s answer; and appended what\nseems equally irrelevant, one of his devout letters to Mrs. Bowes, with\nan explanatory preface.  To say truth, I believe he had always felt\nuneasily that the circumstances of this intimacy were very capable of\nmisconstruction; and now, when he was an old man, taking “his good night\nof all the faithful in both realms,” and only desirous “that without any\nnotable sclander to the evangel of Jesus Christ, he might end his battle;\nfor as the world was weary of him, so was he of it;”—in such a spirit it\nwas not, perhaps, unnatural that he should return to this old story, and\nseek to put it right in the eyes of all men, ere he died.  “Because that\nGod,” he says, “because that God now in His mercy hath put an end to the\nbattle of my dear mother, Mistress Elizabeth Bowes, before that He put an\nend to my wretched life, I could not cease but declare to the world what\nwas the cause of our great familiarity and long acquaintance; which was\nneither flesh nor blood, but a troubled conscience upon her part, which\nnever suffered her to rest but when she was in the company of the\nfaithful, of whom (from the first hearing of the word at my mouth) she\njudged me to be one. . . . Her company to me was comfortable (yea,\nhonourable and profitable, for she was to me and mine a mother), but yet\nit was not without some cross; for besides trouble and fashery of body\nsustained for her, my mind was seldom quiet, for doing somewhat for the\ncomfort of her troubled conscience.” {388}  He had written to her years\nbefore, from his first exile in Dieppe, that “only God’s hand” could\nwithhold him from once more speaking with her face to face; and now, when\nGod’s hand has indeed interposed, when there lies between them, instead\nof the voyageable straits, that great gulf over which no man can pass,\nthis is the spirit in which he can look back upon their long\nacquaintance.  She was a religious hypochondriac, it appears, whom, not\nwithout some cross and fashery of mind and body, he was good enough to\ntend.  He might have given a truer character of their friendship, had he\nthought less of his own standing in public estimation, and more of the\ndead woman.  But he was in all things, as Burke said of his son in that\never memorable passage, a public creature.  He wished that even into this\nprivate place of his affections posterity should follow him with a\ncomplete approval; and he was willing, in order that this might be so, to\nexhibit the defects of his lost friend, and tell the world what weariness\nhe had sustained through her unhappy disposition.  There is something\nhere that reminds one of Rousseau.\n\nI do not think he ever saw Mrs. Locke after he left Geneva; but his\ncorrespondence with her continued for three years.  It may have continued\nlonger, of course, but I think the last letters we possess read like the\nlast that would be written.  Perhaps Mrs. Locke was then remarried, for\nthere is much obscurity over her subsequent history.  For as long as\ntheir intimacy was kept up, at least, the human element remains in the\nReformer’s life.  Here is one passage, for example, the most likable\nutterance of Knox’s that I can quote:—Mrs. Locke has been upbraiding him\nas a bad correspondent.  “My remembrance of you,” he answers, “is not so\ndead, but I trust it shall be fresh enough, albeit it be renewed by no\noutward token for one year.  _Of nature_, _I am churlish_; _yet one thing\nI ashame not to affirm_, _that familiarity once thoroughly contracted was\nnever yet broken on my default_.  _The cause may be that I have rather\nneed of all_, _than that any have need of me_.  However it (_that_) be,\nit cannot be, as I say, the corporal absence of one year or two that can\nquench in my heart that familiar acquaintance in Christ Jesus, which half\na year did engender, and almost two years did nourish and confirm.  And\ntherefore, whether I write or no, be assuredly persuaded that I have you\nin such memory as becometh the faithful to have of the faithful.” {390}\nThis is the truest touch of personal humility that I can remember to have\nseen in all the five volumes of the Reformer’s collected works: it is no\nsmall honour to Mrs. Locke that his affection for her should have brought\nhome to him this unwonted feeling of dependence upon others.  Everything\nelse in the course of the correspondence testifies to a good, sound,\ndown-right sort of friendship between the two, less ecstatic than it was\nat first, perhaps, but serviceable and very equal.  He gives her ample\ndetails as to the progress of the work of reformation; sends her the\nsheets of the _Confession of Faith_, “in quairs,” as he calls it; asks\nher to assist him with her prayers, to collect money for the good cause\nin Scotland, and to send him books for himself—books by Calvin\nespecially, one on Isaiah, and a new revised edition of the “Institutes.”\n“I must be bold on your liberality,” he writes, “not only in that, but in\ngreater things as I shall need.” {391a}  On her part she applies to him\nfor spiritual advice, not after the manner of the drooping Mrs. Bowes,\nbut in a more positive spirit,—advice as to practical points, advice as\nto the Church of England, for instance, whose ritual he condemns as a\n“mingle-mangle.” {391b}  Just at the end she ceases to write, sends him\n“a token, without writing.”  “I understand your impediment,” he answers,\n“and therefore I cannot complain.  Yet if you understood the variety of\nmy temptations, I doubt not but you would have written somewhat.” {391c}\nOne letter more, and then silence.\n\nAnd I think the best of the Reformer died out with that correspondence.\nIt is after this, of course, that he wrote that ungenerous description of\nhis intercourse with Mrs. Bowes.  It is after this, also, that we come to\nthe unlovely episode of his second marriage.  He had been left a widower\nat the age of fifty-five.  Three years after, it occurred apparently to\nyet another pious parent to sacrifice a child upon the altar of his\nrespect for the Reformer.  In January 1563, Randolph writes to Cecil:\n“Your Honour will take it for a great wonder when I shall write unto you\nthat Mr. Knox shall marry a very near kinswoman of the Duke’s, a Lord’s\ndaughter, a young lass not above sixteen years of age.” {392}  He adds\nthat he fears he will be laughed at for reporting so mad a story.  And\nyet it was true; and on Palm Sunday, 1564, Margaret Stewart, daughter of\nAndrew Lord Stewart of Ochiltree, aged seventeen, was duly united to John\nKnox, Minister of St. Giles’s Kirk, Edinburgh, aged fifty-nine,—to the\ngreat disgust of Queen Mary from family pride, and I would fain hope of\nmany others for more humane considerations.  “In this,” as Randolph says,\n“I wish he had done otherwise.”  The Consistory of Geneva, “that most\nperfect school of Christ that ever was on earth since the days of the\nApostles,” were wont to forbid marriages on the ground of too great a\ndisproportion in age.  I cannot help wondering whether the old Reformer’s\nconscience did not uneasily remind him, now and again, of this good\ncustom of his religious metropolis, as he thought of the two-and-forty\nyears that separated him from his poor bride.  Fitly enough, we hear\nnothing of the second Mrs. Knox until she appears at her husband’s\ndeathbed, eight years after.  She bore him three daughters in the\ninterval; and I suppose the poor child’s martyrdom was made as easy for\nher as might be.  She was “extremely attentive to him” at the end, we\nread and he seems to have spoken to her with some confidence.  Moreover,\nand this is very characteristic, he had copied out for her use a little\nvolume of his own devotional letters to other women.\n\nThis is the end of the roll, unless we add to it Mrs. Adamson, who had\ndelighted much in his company “by reason that she had a troubled\nconscience,” and whose deathbed is commemorated at some length in the\npages of his history. {393}\n\nAnd now, looking back, it cannot be said that Knox’s intercourse with\nwomen was quite of the highest sort.  It is characteristic that we find\nhim more alarmed for his own reputation than for the reputation of the\nwomen with whom he was familiar.  There was a fatal preponderance of self\nin all his intimacies: many women came to learn from him, but he never\ncondescended to become a learner in his turn.  And so there is not\nanything idyllic in these intimacies of his; and they were never so\nrenovating to his spirit as they might have been.  But I believe they\nwere good enough for the women.  I fancy the women knew what they were\nabout when so many of them followed after Knox.  It is not simply because\na man is always fully persuaded that he knows the right from the wrong\nand sees his way plainly through the maze of life, great qualities as\nthese are, that people will love and follow him, and write him letters\nfull of their “earnest desire for him” when he is absent.  It is not over\na man, whose one characteristic is grim fixity of purpose, that the\nhearts of women are “incensed and kindled with a special care,” as it\nwere over their natural children.  In the strong quiet patience of all\nhis letters to the weariful Mrs. Bowes, we may perhaps see one cause of\nthe fascination he possessed for these religious women.  Here was one\nwhom you could besiege all the year round with inconsistent scruples and\ncomplaints; you might write to him on Thursday that you were so elated it\nwas plain the devil was deceiving you, and again on Friday that you were\nso depressed it was plain God had cast you off for ever; and he would\nread all this patiently and sympathetically, and give you an answer in\nthe most reassuring polysyllables, and all divided into heads—who\nknows?—like a treatise on divinity.  And then, those easy tears of his.\nThere are some women who like to see men crying; and here was this\ngreat-voiced, bearded man of God, who might be seen beating the solid\npulpit every Sunday, and casting abroad his clamorous denunciations to\nthe terror of all, and who on the Monday would sit in their parlours by\nthe hour, and weep with them over their manifold trials and temptations.\nNowadays, he would have to drink a dish of tea with all these penitents.\n. . . It sounds a little vulgar, as the past will do, if we look into it\ntoo closely.  We could not let these great folk of old into our\ndrawing-rooms.  Queen Elizabeth would positively not be eligible for a\nhousemaid.  The old manners and the old customs go sinking from grade to\ngrade, until, if some mighty emperor revisited the glimpses of the moon,\nhe would not find any one of his way of thinking, any one he could strike\nhands with and talk to freely and without offence, save perhaps the\nporter at the end of the street, or the fellow with his elbows out who\nloafs all day before the public-house.  So that this little note of\nvulgarity is not a thing to be dwelt upon; it is to be put away from us,\nas we recall the fashion of these old intimacies; so that we may only\nremember Knox as one who was very long-suffering with women, kind to them\nin his own way, loving them in his own way—and that not the worst way, if\nit was not the best—and once at least, if not twice, moved to his heart\nof hearts by a woman, and giving expression to the yearning he had for\nher society in words that none of us need be ashamed to borrow.\n\nAnd let us bear in mind always that the period I have gone over in this\nessay begins when the Reformer was already beyond the middle age, and\nalready broken in bodily health: it has been the story of an old man’s\nfriendships.  This it is that makes Knox enviable.  Unknown until past\nforty, he had then before him five-and-thirty years of splendid and\ninfluential life, passed through uncommon hardships to an uncommon degree\nof power, lived in his own country as a sort of king, and did what he\nwould with the sound of his voice out of the pulpit.  And besides all\nthis, such a following of faithful women!  One would take the first forty\nyears gladly, if one could be sure of the last thirty.  Most of us, even\nif, by reason of great strength and the dignity of gray hairs, we retain\nsome degree of public respect in the latter days of our existence, will\nfind a falling away of friends, and a solitude making itself round about\nus day by day, until we are left alone with the hired sick-nurse.  For\nthe attraction of a man’s character is apt to be outlived, like the\nattraction of his body; and the power to love grows feeble in its turn,\nas well as the power to inspire love in others.  It is only with a few\nrare natures that friendship is added to friendship, love to love, and\nthe man keeps growing richer in affection—richer, I mean, as a bank may\nbe said to grow richer, both giving and receiving more—after his head is\nwhite and his back weary, and he prepares to go down into the dust of\ndeath.\n\n                                * * * * *\n\n                                 THE END.\n\n                                * * * * *\n\n            _Printed by_ R. & R.
