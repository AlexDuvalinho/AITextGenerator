Here, the ceiling is made of plexiglass.\n\nAlthough more women are allowed in the classrooms and even into\nthe board rooms, decisions are still made in the men's rooms.\n\nMore women obtain advanced degrees and achieve faculty positions,\nbut few are allowed into the highest administrative positions.\nRather, they are found in greatest numbers in the lower paying,\nmost labor intensive positions.\n\nCivil Rights laws connecting compliance with federal grants are\nblatantly ignored or creatively circumvented by many institutes\nof higher learning.  The courts and the EEOC, weakened to the point\nof extinction by the regressive administrations of the eighties,\nare about as effective as warm spit in enforcing compliance.\n\n\nUsing the double edged sword of coercion and harassment,\nthese institutions of \"higher learning\" continue to maintain their\nstatus quo.  This book portrays a few of the artifices they employ.\nCharacters, descriptions and locations are fictional, created from\nthe right side of the author's brain.\n\n\n\n\nDEDICATION\n\n\n\n\nIn fondest memory of\n\n\nLEAH RUTH DENTON,\n\n\nthis book is dedicated to all\n\n\nWOMANKIND AND HER SUPPORTERS\n\n\nwho refuse to accept the definitions and limitations\n\nimposed by ancient conquerors.\n\n\n\n\n\nABOUT THE AUTHOR\n\n\n\nRuth M. Sprague, Ph.D., a native Vermonter known to hundreds\nof her former students as Dr. Ruth, is retired after many years\nteaching nursing and medical students.\n\n\nShe has published several scientific papers, teaching tutorials\nand one novel, VERMONT TALES FOR FOOLS AND OTHER LOVERS.\n\n\n\n\n\"Revenge is a kind of wild justice.\" --Francis Bacon\n\n\n\n\n\nWILD JUSTICE\n\nby\n\nRuth M. Sprague\n\n\n\n\nForeplay\n\n\n\"You can't be serious,\" exclaimed Diana Trenchant,\nleaning toward the man sitting behind the desk.  \"Incredible!\nWhy on earth would I want to fill out and turn in student feedback\nforms in my own course?  All of my semester student evaluations\nhave been excellent.\"\n\nDr. Lyle Stone, Chairman of the Nutrition, Embryology and\nRadiology Department, relished the power of his position\nas fervently as he detested the acronym, NERD, that had been\nirreparably attached to it.  He passed a small pile of forms\nacross his desk to Diana.  \"Obviously you wanted to cause harm\nto the two other instructors in the course,\" he replied smugly.\nHis expression and demeanor suggested a small boy torturing a bug\nand extracting the utmost enjoyment out of it.\n\n\"Harm them?\"  Dr. Trenchant laughed scornfully and sat back\nin her chair scanning the evaluation forms.  \"You claim I wrote\nthese five which are derogatory toward them and the course.  Five!\nOver two years and hundreds of feedback forms?  How could there be\nany harm attributed to these particular forms when you know that\nboth of those instructors have consistently received derogatory\nevaluations from the students since they started teaching the course?\"\nDiana held the offending papers out in demonstration toward Lyle,\nindignation rampant in her gesture.  Lyle ignored her question\nand picked up two other papers from his desk which he handed\nto Diana saying accusingly, \"Besides those five, here are copies\nof two you also wrote concerning the nutrition course.  Together,\nthese constitute repeated acts of dishonesty which are grounds for\ntermination for cause.  \"However. . .\" Lyle tried for a kindly expression\nand failed, \"we are prepared to forget these charges if you resign.\"\n\n\"Oh, that's the game, is it?  No way.  I'm going to talk to\nthe faculty ombudsman about this and find out what steps to take,\"\nreturned Diana, hotly, rising from her chair and starting toward the door.\n\n\"You can't.\"  As Diana turned back to look at him, Lyle continued\nwith some desperation, \"You have no recourse, no appeal.\nThe entire academic council have met and decided already\non this course of action.  If you do not resign on your own,\nyou will be terminated.\"\n\n\"But not without a hearing certainly--according to the faculty handbook.\nOr are you suspending those rights along with my access to the ombudsman?\"\nGrabbing up the copies of the forms, Diana left the room.\n\nAs the door closed behind her, Lyle reached for the phone\nand dialed with considerable agitation.  \"Henry, she won't resign.\nShe's gone to see Jonathan and intends to make a public mess of it,\"\nhe babbled hysterically.\n\n\"Calm yourself, Lyle.  I've already spoken to Jonathan and if it\ncomes to a hearing, well--don't forget, I select the hearing panel\nand chair it.  Her public mess be damned, all our hearings are closed\nto the public.  Get a grip and stop blubbering.\"\n\n\n\n\nGIVE THE DEVIL HER DUE\n\n\nChapter 1\n\n\nIt was going to be a perfect June day.  Already a cloudless, azure sky,\npromising no hint of rain, arched over a shimmering campus.\nAll shades of green were represented and so was every color\nin the flowers that lined the walks and burst forth from the beds.\nIn perfect compliment, the lovely old brick and stone buildings\nsat around the campus, complaisant and secure, full of pride and tradition.\n\nThe library building, squat and solid, redolent with the collected tomes\nof the ages, stood as a testament to humanity's progress.  Works of ancient\npoets and philosophers, sinners and saints filled the shelves co-mingling\nwith the more recent and modern books.  Here were the records of man's\nhighest achievements and his inhumanity to man but as yet, this building\ncataloged few, if any, records of woman's highest achievements and man's\nin-humanity to woman.  The former being seldom recorded or remembered;\nthe latter too usual and customary to remark upon.\n\nWhistling softly to himself, Jonathan Bambridge, Professor,\nPh.D, Faculty Ombudsman left the sidewalk and entered the\nadministration building.  He proceeded directly to the Vice\nPresident's office and entered through a door already open.\n\n\"Jonathan, good of you to come on such short notice,\" greeted\nthe Academic VP, waving Jonathan toward the inner office.\n\nOne wall of the office was devoted to `art'.  The entire grouping\nreminded Jonathan of different aspects of the same road-kill.\n\n\"On a day like this, it is a pleasure, Henry.  Looks like\nthe weather is cooperating for graduation this year.\"\n\n\"Well, it's about time.  Two years in a row we've been\nrained out.  Drop your bag, grab a cup of coffee and sit down.\"\n\nHenry Tarbuck, Academic Vice President picked up his own cup\nfrom his desk and went to the conference chairs arranged for\nconversation in the office alcove.  From here he eyed Jonathan\nreflectively.  Good man, he thought.  Saved us a batch of trouble\nby coming to me right off.\n\nTarbuck adjusted his six foot two, rather heavy-set frame\nmore comfortably in the chair.  Young for his position, barely\nin his thirties, he directed seasoned professors twice his age\nand experience.  This along with his imposing height and bulk\nhad caused some resentment but Henry just ignored it.\n\nAs first assistant to the president of Belmont University,\nhe reveled in power and position and firmly believed that those\nthat can, do (like him) and those that can't, teach (like faculty).\n\nHe covered this attitude with a hearty, down-to-earth,\nback slapping manner that fooled no one but himself.\n\nBambridge joined him in the alcove, holding his coffee cup out\nahead of him like an offering.  \"Damn good coffee, Henry.\nMust have made it yourself.\"\n\nAt fifty-five, Henry Bambridge figured he'd seen it all and\nmost of the fight had gone out of him.  Physically, he was the\nopposite of Tarbuck, slight in build and not quite five ten but\nlooked shorter.  His features were finely drawn, almost feminine\nin contrast to the dark, craggy, nearly simian countenance of Tarbuck.\n\n\"Let's get down to it.\"  Henry Tarbuck radiated impatience as visible\nas the steam rising from newly deposited excrement on a frosty day.\nFor a time, the men went over the schedule of events slated for the hearing.\n\n\"Everything seems to be in order,\" Jonathan suggested.\n\n\"Right, it's a go.  I want to tell you, Jonathan, you've done\na damn fine job so far.\"  Henry gestured expansively.  \"By advising\nDiana Trenchant to attend her termination hearing without an attorney,\nyou saved us all a great deal of trouble.\"\n\nThe ombudsman acknowledged the compliment with a nod.\nJonathan knew his job was to provide just such a service to\nthe administration.  He understood that the ombudsman's function\nwas ostensibly created to provide the faculty with a neutral source\nto handle complaints.  Most times the illusion of impartiality\nwas well maintained, but the reality of the position was otherwise--\nit was the administration's ear and eye on the faculty.\n\n\"Just followed your suggestion,\" Jonathan replied, preening\nself-consciously.  Feeling himself in the good graces of the VP,\nhe continued.  \"What's the story here, Henry?  Why is this being\nhandled so harshly?  Her transgression is fairly innocuous and I'm\nsurprised it's even coming to a hearing panel.  Why not slap her\ndown or suspend her?  Hell, it would be less trouble to retire her,\nshe's been here nearly twenty-five years!\"\n\nHenry twitched with ill-concealed indignation for an instant\nthen answered calmly but with some passion, \"Between you and me,\nJonathan, the bitch needs a taking down.  You know how we've\nadjusted to federal and state mandates that women be accepted,\neven encouraged to work and matriculate here.\n\n\"All in all, it hasn't been a bad deal for us.  Sure, we've had to\nraise some salaries but, well, give the devil her due, most women\ndo seem to work hard and get a lot accomplished.  They are usually\nfairly easy to control.  Most are scared stupid of being called\na lesbian and petrified at the thought that this accusation might\nbe spread around among people they know.  Or, if they are married\nand obviously straight, plant the suggestion that it might get around\nthat they are promiscuous.  It turns them to jelly every time.\"\n\nHenry laughed delightedly as he stood up and assumed a lecturer's pose,\nunwittingly mimicking the profession he disparaged.  As he warmed to his\nsubject, he walked back and forth across the office, adding punctuation\nto his lecture with his body.  Jonathan watched him intently.\n\n\"Then there are the most enjoyable ones.  They're on the make\nfor any man who is looking for an easy lay.  They trade their\nass for any glory that may fall their way through association.\nAs workers, most aren't worth shit but they do as they're told.\nHave to watch them though because if someone higher than you in the\npecking, or ha ha, pecker order, comes along, they leave you cold.\n\n\"Now, so-called liberated professionals, feminists, may become a focus\nfor women's groups on campus.  They get a name for being champions\nof women's causes.  However, jerk their chain and they are a hodgepodge\nof insecurities.  They have worked so hard to attain their position\nand the prestige and power that goes with it, that they are our best\nallies against women's movements and demands for equal wages, in short,\nany kind of problem we may encounter.\"\n\n\"How can that be, Henry?\"  Jonathan was finding the impromptu lecture\nnot only informative, but very interesting.\n\n\"We just put them on committees or hearing panels such as the one\ncoming up.  In appearance, we are being fair by having women represented,\nnot just women, but women who are vocal regarding their movement.\nActually, because they want so much for themselves, they are easy\nas hell to buy.  We provide perks that make them feel important.\nThey get invited to presidential teas, trustee cocktail parties--\nanything that puffs them up, makes them feel good--that's the carrot.\n\n\"The committee chair lets them know how to vote and how well pleased\ntheir dean will be with them and voila!  Believe me, they well know\nhow bad it can get if they fall out of favor with the boss.\nIf this isn't convincing, just indicate to them that they can be\nmade to appear mentally unstable or morally deviant--that's the stick.\n\n\"Very few women fight back or quit a committee even if they become\nuncomfortable with what it is doing.  Most just keep their heads down\nand hope nobody finds out how they voted.  I've appointed three women\nto the Trenchant hearing panel.  Two of them are younger women hot\nto trot up the academic success ladder which I just happen to be holding.\"\nHenry paused, preening himself with obvious relish.\n\nEager for more of this fascinating information, Jonathan queried,\n\"What about Diana Trenchant?  She doesn't appear concerned that\neveryone would know she committed a crime.  She refused to quietly\nresign claiming that the accusations are false and apparently\nis going to put on a defense at the hearing.\"\n\n\"Defense!  Ha!  It won't amount to bug dust.  I chose the panel\nand I shall chair the panel and the panel will vote to terminate her.\"\nHenry was becoming very agitated.  His pacing was now fast and choppy.\n\n\"She's one of those trouble makers who do so well in their\njob that it's hard to find a reason to get rid of them.\nIt is vital that we hold this hearing and terminate her.\nWe must provide an example.\"  Turning back toward the table,\nHenry started to shuffle the papers busily.  \"We've gone over\nmost everything in the handbook on procedure and as far as I can see,\neverything is proper.  What do you think?\"\n\nJonathan, who was holding a copy of the faculty handbook and\nstudying the tip of his left shoe, shook his head in agreement.\n\"It all appears to be absolutely correct so far.\"\n\n\"Fine.  Now I'll expect you to be available during the hearing\nin the waiting room.  This is just for appearance, for extra insurance.\nThings have a way of getting screwed up where she's concerned.\"\n\nHoping to reopen the informative flood gates with a  smattering\nof devil's advocate, Jonathan observed slyly, \"You know, Henry,\nher personnel file was rather impressive.  She appeared to have been\nan capable technician, an excellent teacher and received high\nperformance evaluations.  No complaints for being late or absent\nfrom work, no reports of drink or drugs. . .\"\n\nAgain the VP became agitated.  This time he grabbed his cup\nand went to the coffee maker.   \"She gets people stirred up.\nThat's where problems arise from--those unexpected, unknown\nsources.  No administrator can prepare for those kind of events.\nFor instance, a few years ago a student under her influence\nembarrassed Jimbo Jones--he was NERD chair before Lyle--and put\nthe department in an uproar. . .\"\n\n\nJimbo Jones, chairman, six NERD faculty members\nand two graduate student Teaching Assistants occupied\nthe conference room at the weekly departmental meeting.\n\nOver the general murmuring and grumbling of a discontented faculty,\nPeter, the departmental mouth said, \"We ought to get a higher\npercentage raise, Jimbo.  Every year you tell us the same thing.\nTimes are tough, the legislature won't spring for a decent appropriation.\nThe dean can't. . .\"\n\n\"I know that and I've been thinking how I could cut the\nroster and have a little more to share among the rest of us.\nIf you agree, I think it's time we let Diana Trenchant go.\nLast year I had to give her a whopping raise while the rest of us\nhad to settle for the usual 3%, and Ted at the Affirmative Action Office\nsays we've got to give her more again this year and then still more\nuntil she catches up to or surpasses Fred's paycheck.\n\n\"Of course, it means that you will have to share Fred, our only\nother technician, do your own research or get a grant and hire\nyour own technician.\"\n\nMost of the people in the room moved uncomfortably in\ntheir chairs looking down at the floor or out the window.\nLooking anywhere but at each other or Jimbo.\n\n\"It's settled then, we let her go?\"  Jimbo broke the silence.\n\"No one opposes? All right then, it's. . .\n\n\"I don't know too much about these things,\" came a hesitant\nvoice from the back of the group.  Everyone turned around to look\nat the young graduate student, Holly Preston, who had spoken.\n\nIn a voice getting stronger all the time, she continued,\n\"As I say, I don't know much about this, but I thought when\nsomeone was fired that there had to be cause.  That is, that they\nwere not doing their job properly or whatever.\n\n\"Since I've been in the department, I have been impressed\nwith Diana Trenchant's hard work and knowledge.  I've gone\nto her often for help.  What reason will you give for firing her,\nDr. Jones?\"\n\nA taut silence descended upon the room like a malignant fog.\nThen, an angry, red-faced Jimbo Jones glared at Holly, declared the\naction tabled and adjourned the meeting.  The NERD faculty Judas goats\nshuffled out sheepishly, having been well and truly sheared by a lamb.\n\n\n\n\nChapter 2\n\n\nVP Henry Tarbuck closed the file folder then shifted his bulk\nto place it on a nearby table.  His expensive chair started to\ngroan in protest then as if remembering how much it cost,\nonly murmured quietly.  \"We must be careful that this hearing gives\nall the appearances of being completely fair, especially after\nthe disaster in Lyle's office.\"\n\nJonathan leaned forward and deposited his now empty cup on the\nstand beside him.  \"Yes, I heard about Lyle bungling that one.\nFirst he yelled at her so loudly that the secretaries in the outer\noffice left in embarrassment and then was stupid enough to tell her\nin front of witnesses that the hearing panel was only a formality\nand that she would be terminated anyway.\"\n\nThe VP shrugged, obviously irritated.  \"Admittedly, he pushed\ntoo hard.  It came as a shock to him that she would refuse his\ndemand that she resign.  He lost his cool and tried to bully her\ninto it.  He's new to this, taking over as he did such a relatively\nshort time ago from Jimbo.\"\n\n\"Well it does appear that he had problems with her.  I do see\nthat she appears to have a propensity for causing discomfort,\nbut other women, and men too for that matter, have been troublesome.\nWhy the excessive anger toward her?\"\n\n\"First off, Jonathan, the anger is not excessive, it is justified,\"\nHenry retorted testily.  \"Yes, we've had critics, annoying critics,\nbut when we offered them some redress, they were grateful.  She,\non the other hand, considered every concession we made as\n`a day late and a dollar short'--utterly maddening!\nAnd what really frosts everyone's ass is that she is just\nas recalcitrant when she argues on behalf of someone else.\nWho the hell is she to care if someone feels unfairly treated by us?\"\n\n\"Well, of course I'm still using the only frame of reference\nthat I have which is her personnel file and from what I can see she\nwas as much `sinned against as sinner'.\"\n\n\"That might have some validity up to the point where she openly\nand publicly challenged the president of this university,\"\nretorted Henry waving the file he was holding in Jonathan's\nface for emphasis, \"but not anymore.\"\n\n\"You mean she picked on The Pope, Henry?\"\n\n\n\n\nChapter 3\n\n\nJohn T. Pope had been president of Belmont University for\nnearly twelve years.  Because of his belief in his own\ninfallibility, he soon became referred to as The Pope.\nHe greatly increased the senior administrative staff\nwhich now occupied one whole wing of the administration building.\nThis wing was known as the Vatican and when a person spoke of\nkissing the Pope's ring, it was well understood what part\nof the Pope's anatomy they were referring to.  The slew\nof vice presidents, associate vp's and assistant vp's\naround the president were soon called the Vee's.  Most people\nbelieved Vee was short for vice president but insiders knew\nit really stood for vestigial virgins.\n\nHe located the personnel office close by the Vatican.  It was\nthe administration's muscle and the buffer between it and the\nso-called support staff.  Patterned after the military, it was\ndirected by, and key positions held by former military men.\nThe military analogy persists throughout the university structure.\nUpper administration and faculty are designated as officers.\n\nIn order to insure staff cooperation, President Pope\nhad created a company union called the Staff Association.\nTo keep tabs on the members, he appointed the director\nof personnel an ex-officio member.  The current director,\nGreg Harrison, attended every meeting, answered questions,\ndirected staff activities and channeled them into acceptable areas.\n\n\n\"Yes, I do,\" Henry continued glowering.  \"A year after Trenchant\ngot on the Staff Association, she was elected its chair and that body\nturned from being a very convenient rubber stamp into a cohesive,\nconfrontational group of people.  She was reelected unanimously\nfor a second term and during those two years she managed to upset\nnearly everybody in the Vatican--especially, The Pope.  It seems,\nfrom what I was told when I was appointed academic vp, that during\nthis time a great deal of energy was directed toward damage control.\n\n\"Nothing worked with her.  All the tried and true methods of threat\nor blandishment had no affect.  She didn't seem to notice\nor understand that if she played ball she would become more\nimportant than the staff she represented.\n\n\"She and the Staff Association encouraged the rest of the\nstaff to bring problems to their office.  We had almost daily calls\nfrom the Attorney General's Office because she advised women to\nmake complaints if they were discriminated against or harassed.\nShe even boxed in Mark, the university attorney, and just four\nyears ago, she made a shambles of personnel by kicking Greg,\nthe director, out of the Staff Association.\n\n\"And that's not all.  Under her direction, the Staff Association\nstarted to by-pass personnel altogether.  They investigated several\ngrievances and represented the grievers they felt were abused by the system.\n\n\"They started a staff newsletter to inform everyone about their rights--\nespecially concerning sex discrimination and sexual harassment.\nThe staff was told to stay away from the affirmative action office,\nwhich was described as a tool of the personnel department,\nand take their complaints directly to the Attorney General--\nthey even printed her phone number, for Christ's sake. . . .\n\"Trenchant and a committee met with a federal EEOC investigator.\nHe was presented with a list of staff and faculty positions\nwith a notation of the total number and how many were held by women.\nThe investigator was here to make sure the university was in compliance\nfor a million dollar federal research grant.\"\n\nSurprise suffused Jonathan's face.  \"How did she get that information, Henry?\nI thought that was one of our better kept secrets.\"\n\nThe Vee exploded.  \"We were exceedingly careful never to publish\nanything like that.  Members of the Staff Association went through\nthe campus directory to compile the list.  Took a lot of time,\nbut they kept at it.\"\n\n\"Sonofabitch!\"\n\n\"Yeah,\" agreed Henry.  Lyle gave her a faculty appointment to get\nher out of staff politics.  He had her teaching every semester with\nthe hope that she'd be too busy to cause anymore trouble.\nNext thing we know, she's threatening to sue the NERD for plagiarism.\nYou know the rest and we have just time enough to get ready.\nUse the facilities if you need to.\"  He pointed in the direction\nof an adjoining washroom, then opened a closet door and removed his cap\nand gown which he laid across the table.  Jonathan opened the case\nhe had brought with him.\n\nAs both men donned their robes, Jonathan asked, \"why is the\nTrenchant hearing being held so soon after graduation?\"\n\n\"We wanted to wait until the students left, of course.\nThey've been pestering us with petitions in support of her and we\nsure don't want them around during her hearing.  Also everyone\nwants to leave as soon as possible for summer vacations, Jonathan.\nWe want this mess cleaned up before we leave.\"\n\n\"Well, my station for the grand march is west campus.  Yours?\"\nFully garbed in medieval academic splendor, Jonathan paused by the open door.\n\n\"My department forms up in front of the library.  See you next week.\"\n\n\"Right.\"\n\nThe two men left the office together then separated at the\nfounder's statue to reach their appointed destinations.\n\nWhat a farce, ruminated Jonathan as he made his way between\nthe colorful plantings bordering the walk.  Shakespeare would\nhave loved it.  Much ado about nothing and a tempest in a teapot.\nWhat a hoot, making all this fuss about seven student feedback forms.\nNobody ever pays any attention to them yet suddenly they are so important.\n\nHard to figure a valid reason for such violent reactions from the Vee.\nJust a couple of years ago, Professor Beand was convicted of child molestation.\nHe was suspended for a few months but they took him right back with no loss\nof pay or position.\n\nAnd then there was that dean in the History Department who\naltered faculty promotion papers.  Nothing happened to him.\nI remember one of the Vee's saying at that time that he shouldn't\nbe disciplined for it because other faculty had done far worse things\nand were not punished.  That's sure true. I remember several incidents\ninvolving students, alcohol, drugs. . .all swept quietly under the rug.\n\nIt's obvious what is going on here.  Lyle needs to pull the\nchestnuts out of the fire for those two new faculty he took on so\nthey can be reappointed and tenured.  If he can pin some of their\nnegative critiques on Diana Trenchant, he can argue that all the\nyears of bad critiques are suspect and nullify them.\n\nAnd, of course, Henry and the rest are going along with it\nout of revenge--they are just plain pissed off because they\ncouldn't win her over with snob appeal.  She scorned them,\ntheir exalted positions and their offerings.  That's it, I bet\nanything that's it.  Silently apologizing to William Congrave,\nJonathan paraphrased, \"Heaven has no rage like love to hatred turned\nnor Hell more fury than a good 'ol boy scorned.\"  The medical student\nthat wrote the open letter to The Pope was right--this hearing is\nan administrative gang bang.\n\nJonathan was soon joined by others in brightly colored or\nrichly black gowns.  Peacocked with the educational badge each\nhad attained and crowned with a mortar board which got its name\nfrom a board used by masons to hold cement.  How appropriate that\nit is worn on the head.\n\nCommencement--a colorful, glorious grouping traditioned by time.\nAll nicely covering the decay and tarnish of some of its stewards.\n\n\n\n\n\nTHE HEARING - DAY 1\n\n\n\nChapter 4\n\n\n\"The hearing?  Oh yes, that is being held in this room right\nhere,\" advised Lorraine Debeau, head custodian of Howard Hall.\n\nDiana Trenchant and her witnesses had arrived early.  One of\nthe witnesses asked Lorraine where the group might wait.\n\n\"There are two rooms I was told to open.  This is the best one\nright opposite the hearing room,\" she offered, walking ahead of them\ninto the room, proud as a general leading the troops to battle.\nI'll give you guys the best one since you are here first\nand because of what you are doing.\"\n\nAs she turned to leave the room, she put her hand on Trenchant's shoulder.\n\"Hey, good luck.  You know, you are the only person that ever tried to help\nus custodians get a fair shake.  When you were head of the Staff Association,\nyou made those guys in administration treat us decent.\"\n\nThe six witnesses and Trenchant spread themselves out comfortably\non the plush sofas and soft rug as individual preference dictated.\nGood feelings washed over them, mixed with pride and determination.\nIt was as if their cause, their righteous quest, had been anointed\nby a high priestess.\n\n\"It's nice to have friends in high places,\" commented Andrea,\nlooking around appreciatively.  They were in a large, rectangular\nroom outfitted as a lounge.  At the front facing the entrance hall,\nthe walls gave way to glass, so it was something like being in a fish bowl.\nSomeone suggested shutting the curtains but Helen objected.\n\n\"No, don't.  I want to watch for them to come in.  I'm going to\ntake their pictures.\"\n\nThere was general laughter at this and Andrea slapped her on the back,\n\"go gittum, Helen.\"\n\nRoz advised the other witnesses not to be intimidated by the panel.\n\"Hey, I've known most of them for years and they are no better than we are.\"\nShe had held a full time job at Belmont for nearly two years.  Roz had been\naround and was no spring chicken so the group nodded and took comfort from her.\n\nShe, like some of the other witnesses, was also taking courses in\nthe nursing school.  One of these courses was taught by Diana Trenchant.\n\n\"Look, here they come now,\"  Helen yelled as a group\nof men came into the hall through the open front door.\nShe grabbed her camera and shot out of the room.\n\nOne of the men broke from the group and came into the witness room\nsaying loudly, \"Who are you and what are you doing in here?\nThis room is reserved.\"\n\n\"We were told this was a witness room and we are witnesses,\"\nsaid Roz, flatly.  \"Who are you?\"\n\nGlaring at Roz and throwing his entire body into an intimidating pose,\nthe man said angrily, \"I am the Academic Vice President, Henry Tarbuck,\nand I reserved this room for the university witnesses.\"\n\n\"That's OK then,\" said Roz cheerfully and completely\nunimpressed.  \"We are university witnesses.\n\nDiana stepped forward.  \"Is there a problem?\"\n\n\"Oh, it's you.  You were supposed to go to a room upstairs.\"\n\n\"We asked and we were directed here,\" interjected Roz.\nSmiling up at Henry innocently, she continued in a child's\nsing-song voice, \"finders, keepers.\"\n\n\"Well. We'll see about that,\" was the disgruntled, graceless retort.\n\nAs he turned to leave Trenchant stopped him.  \"I have requested\nan open hearing which you have denied me.  I again ask that\nthe hearing be open.\"\n\n\"No, absolutely not.  The hearing is closed.\"\n\n\"A closed hearing is to protect the rights of the accused.\nAs the accused, I waive that consideration and again request\nthat the hearing be open and that any person who wishes may attend.\"\n\n\"No.\"  The Vee closed the door of the witness room behind him\nwith a indignant slam.\n\n\"Now there's a sweetheart,\" murmured Roz.  \"Hey, did you guys\nnotice we got our own phone in here?\n\nAn obviously annoyed Henry Tarbuck sought out the custodian,\nLorraine.  \"I ordered that downstairs room to be held for the\nuniversity's witnesses,\" he barked at her.\n\n\"Not me, you didn't.  I was told to open two rooms for the\nhearing witnesses.  That's all.\"  Lorraine, all four feet of her\nbristling, stood up on her toes and duplicated the Vee's tone,\njaw to jaw.\n\nAlways outmatched when encountering any female who did not\nsmile, cringe, grovel or otherwise conform to his `typing',\nHenry turned away from her and fumed his way to the hall phone booth.\n\nReaching his secretary, his tone took on the whine of a young boy.\n\"Lynn, something terrible has happened.  That woman took the good room,\nthe one with the good chairs and the telephone.  I'm using the booth\nin the hall!  How could this happen?\"\n\n\"I don't know, Henry.  I told the custodian over there to reserve\nthe two rooms as you directed me.  I don't recall that you gave me specific\ninstructions as to which room was for which group.\"\n\n\"I assumed th. . .\"\n\nHenry broke off as he caught sight of the dean and two medical school\nfaculty coming in the door.  \"I'll get back to you and get this\nstraightened out.  Got to go.\n\n\"Right this way, gentlemen.  We've had a slight mix up in\nthe waiting rooms and I apologize in advance for any inconvenience\nit may cause.  I'm going to have a phone put in soonest and some\ndecent chairs!\"  Still talking, Henry led the men upstairs.\n\nDownstairs, Helen returned from a self appointed scouting mission,\nbreathless and amused.  \"Oh,\" she panted, \"you should see the room they have.\nIt's a lecture hall--hard chairs and blackboards all around.\nWe sure lucked out by getting here first.\"\n\n\"We sure did but our luck was in having Lorraine as\ncustodian in charge.  Obviously, we were supposed to get\nthe upstairs one and I'll bet you dollars to donuts that\nit's been bugged,\" asserted Roz.\n\nHelen had recovered her breath by now and readily agreed.\n\"Yeah, I bet.  You know that Vee, Jimbo, was so threatening.\nI took his picture and he came right up to me and demanded\nto know my name and what I was doing there and. . .\"\n\n\"Oh, he's a pain in the ass all the time,\" Roz interrupted.\n\"He was bad enough when he was chair of NERD but now that they\nkicked him up to a Vee, he's insufferable.  Drinks like a fish.\nDid you tell him?\"\n\nHelen laughed.  \"No, I just yelled, `Press', at him and got\nthe hell out of there.\n\n\"Just a moment ago, outside, I got a good shot of three guys\nthat were just coming in.  I think one of them was Dean Broadhurst.\nOne of the guys with him saw me and covered his face--\njust like you see the crooks do on TV when they're taken to court.\"\n\nJames, the one male witness, came in with Jean and Andrea.\nThey were laden with Dunkin' Donut bags, coffee cups, milk and soda.\n\nIt was well past the time set for the commencement of the\nhearing and the six women and one man good naturedly sat down\nto await the pleasure of the Vee.  Noblesse oblige never had\nfunctioned at Belmont and they didn't expect it to start now.\n\nUpstairs, things were gradually getting sorted out.  Harried custodians\nhad removed or stacked most of the student chairs and brought in\nplush seats.  A phone had been located trailing a long,\nsnake-like extension cord that stretched out the door and back\nalong the hall to the office it had been liberated from.\n\nThe university caterers had brought in a coffee, tea and Danish\nservice which was in the process of being depleted by the\nadministration's witnesses.  Henry Tarbuck worked the room,\nspreading ersatz charm like a bee pollinating from flower to flower.\n\n\n\n\nChapter 5\n\n\nThe door to the hallway opened suddenly and Henry strode in.\nHe looked at Diana Trenchant and gestured toward the hearing room.\n\"We're ready for you now,\" he announced with all the smarmy triumph\nof an interrogator leading the way to the torture chamber.\n\nThe accused stood up.  In silence, the seven witnesses\ngrouped around hugging her and each other.  The Vee watched,\ndisgust thick as mildew around a neglected sauna, covering his face.\n\nDisengaging, Trenchant started for the door.\n\n\"Here, take this with you just in case you lose your\nperspective and need to find it,\" urged James.  He shoved\nan 8 x 10 inch piece of white cardboard into her hand.\n\nOn it, printed in large letters, was the legend:\nBEAM ME UP SCOTTY.  THERE'S NO INTELLIGENT LIFE DOWN HERE!\n\nThe hearing room was about 30 feet square with no outside windows.\nThe front, facing the hallway contained the door.  The rest of\nthe front wall was glass, similar to the neighboring witness room,\nbut here the curtains were tightly closed as if the room was ashamed\nto reveal what was to take place inside.\n\nA large table nearly filled the room, and seated along the\nfar side of it, nearest the front of the room, sat four members\nof the hearing panel.  At the head of the table, with his back\nto the blinded glass wall, Henry had enthroned himself.\n\nDiana was curtly directed to a seat also on the far side\nof the table at the back of the room.  There were several\nchairs between her and the panel.\n\nAcross the table from the panel sat Janet Parks, the court reporter,\nwith her back to the door.  She was accessorized with a recording machine\nbeside her and a backup tape recorder on the table.\n\nJanet, as her profession demanded, tended to fade into the woodwork.\nDress and manner were subdued to the point where she became\nnearly invisible--but not to Diana.  She saw kindly eyes surrounded\nby a round face that wanted to be jolly and laughing.  She saw a possible\nrelief from the dominant accusing eyes.  Not an advocate perhaps,\nbut at least neutrality.\n\nAn empty chair sat drawn up to the table beside Janet and there\nwas another empty chair further down the table opposite Trenchant.\n\nThe entire setup of the room was intentionally\nchoreographed to promote psychological terrorism.\nDiana Trenchant and her witnesses would be interrogated\nby the panel while sitting in the chair beside\nthe court stenographer directly across from the panel.\n\nThe administration's accusers would sit in the chair\nwhich was directly across the table from Diana Trenchant.\nExcept for when she would be testifying, Diana was seated\nat the place most distant from the door.\n\nAlone.\n\nDiana Trenchant sat down in the assigned seat and arranged\nher note pad and documents for easy access.  For the moment,\nthe panel was huddled together whispering so she took the time\nto organize her thoughts and chill out the mounting apprehension.\n\nHere she was, sixty years old, twenty five of those working\nat Belmont, with never even as much as a traffic ticket citation,\nfacing a university hearing panel.  Here she was--accused of forging\nseven student feedback forms.  The lump in her stomach and the one\nin her throat were trying to join together and drag the rest of her\ndown into a black, empty tunnel of fear.   Resisting the pull,\nshe looked around the hearing room and met the eyes of the stenographer\nwho smiled at her encouragingly.\n\nJanet Parks had attended many hearings.  Her job was to\nfaithfully record every spoken word on her transcription machine.\nMost of the time, she plied her trade in the courts but\noccasionally she was called out into the private sector.\nShe had seen a lot of people on trial and her observant eyes\ntook in every detail.\n\nThe configuration of the hearing room had not been lost on\nher so when she met the eyes of the accused, Diana Trenchant,\nshe felt a tug of sympathy.  She noted Diana's pale, drawn features\nand erect bearing.  Here was a woman, thought Janet, who would\nnever use makeup or any other cover up.  She has such a direct,\nhonest look it's hard to believe that she is the one in trouble\nhere.  As Diana's eyes returned to her notes, Janet looked at her\nmore closely.  Not terribly well groomed, she thought, noting the\nslacks with casual blouse and jacket.  Janet recalled that Diana\nwas wearing jogging shoes when she walked in.  Obviously, she\nwore her cloths for comfort, not for adornment.  Janet continued\nher inventory: mousy brown hair--no style, blue eyes.\nTired blue eyes.  Lots of wrinkles, those badges that life\nawarded to survivors.  Must be pushing along into the sixties.\nWonder what she sounds like.  Hope she's not one of those squeaky kind.\nOh, oh, the head cheese is about to start--get ready.\n\nHenry Tarbuck consulting his notes then stated that the dean had accused\nDiana Trenchant of creating and submitting fictitious student feedback forms.\n\n\"Responding to the dean's charge, this committee was formed\nand I will now introduce them.  On the end is Mr. Frank Anuse,\ndirector of the Informational Studies Unit.\"\n\nThe Vee looked fondly at Frank who nodded his bald head in acknowledgement.\nA tall gangling bean-pole of a man.  His head, devoid of any sort of\ndemarcation between face and pate, appeared to float above his body\nlike some sort of alien spacecraft.\n\nThey had gotten together over drinks the day before and decided\nthat they would play good cop, bad cop at the hearing.  He,\nas chair, would affect neutrality while Frank could go after\nDiana and her witnesses hammer and tongs.\n\nIf anyone on this hearing panel was more anxious than himself\nto smash this woman, it was Frank, mused Henry.  He had good reason.\nIt was about three years ago that. . .\n\nAffirmative Action Officer, Kevin Goodman, sat in his office\nreading a letter that had just come in the campus mail.\n\nKevin, a black, realized that he had been awarded this\nposition because of his permanent tan.  He had thought when\nhe agreed to take the office that he truly would be allowed\nto enforce federal mandates.\n\nNow, two years into it, the bubble had long since burst.\nHis office was there, it appeared, only to satisfy the law that\nsuch an office be maintained.  However, deans and directors of\ndepartments seldom did as he directed and if he went to the Pope,\nwell, he found out pretty quickly that did no good.\n\nHe was actively seeking another appointment at a more enlightened\nand humane university.  Enough was enough, but while he was still here,\nhe would do the best he could or was allowed to do.\n\nHe smoothed the pages of the letter flat and reached for the phone.\n\n\"Professor Anuse?  Kevin Goodman here.  Affirmative Action Office.\"\n\n\"Yes.  What can I do for you?\"\n\n\"I have a complaint regarding your hiring process that I'd\nlike to discuss with you at your earliest convenience.\"\n\n\"Now's fine.  What's the problem?\"\n\n\"It's alleged that you will not interview or otherwise consider\nmales for positions in your division,\" Kevin said, carefully.\n\n\"Can't interview or consider anyone who doesn't apply for a position, can I.\nShit!  Men just aren't interested in the jobs in my unit.\"\n\nKevin blinked and cleared his throat. \"Ah, well, I called\nthe personnel office and they informed me that they had sent\nyou a file of a male for the last two positions you posted.\nI was told that you did not interview him.\"\n\n\"Could be, I suppose.  Probably he didn't qualify.\"\n\n\"Personnel says that he is very well qualified.\"\n\nFrank Anuse made a face at the telephone.  The supercilious\nbastard, he thought.  Who is he to check up on my hiring?\n\n\"They do, huh.\"\n\nFrank's predilection for hiring only women, preferably young,\nwas well known throughout Belmont.  He laughingly referred to himself\nas the sheik and the girls as his harem in conversations\nwith his male colleagues.  His girls referred to him as Jack the Ripper.\nTurnover in his department, in all senses of the word, was active.\n\n\"Yes,\" Kevin continued.  \"In light of this complaint, my office will have to\nreview the records of all of your hiring for the past two years.  Would you\nplease have this material ready for my assistant to pick up tomorrow?\"\nKevin spoke firmly, looking down at his crossed fingers.\n\n\"All those files?  Christ, you think I've got nothing better to do than. . .\nWho in the hell made this complaint, anyway?\"\n\n\"The letter came from the chair of the Staff Association,\nDiana Trenchant.  Evidently several complaints have been\nbrought to her attention.\"\n\n\"She can go to Hell and you too, for that matter.\nWhat business is it of yours who I hire?\"\n\n\"Federal law prohibits discriminatory hiring practices.\nThis university has to comply to receive federal grants.\nMy job is to see that the university is in compliance.\"\n\n\"Bull, everyone knows that just applies to women and\nspa. . ., er, minorities.\"\n\n\"That is incorrect, Mr. Anuse.  Anti-discrimination laws apply\nto anyone who is being discriminated against.  Please have those\nfiles ready for pick-up,\" said Kevin and firmly hung up the phone.\n\nFrank looked at the phone for a beat and then walloped it\nto get a dial tone.  He punched in the number for Mark Rogers,\nthe university attorney.\n\nReaching his party, he said, \"Mark, what do you know about\nthe bitch chairing the Staff Association?\"\n\n\n\n\nChapter 6\n\n\n. . .\"and sitting next to Ed is Esther Rondell, agriculture.\"\n\nFrank beamed at Esther who simpered in return.  A large woman,\nEsther wore her white hair in an old fashioned pug at the back.\nShe had been at Belmont longer than anyone could remember.\nShe dressed conservatively and was always on university committees.\n\nEsther was at the forefront of every woman's movement on campus.\nShe was quick to rush to any woman's defense and agree that yes,\nthey were badly treated.  This allowed her a podium to broadcast\nhow badly she was used by the university.  With all her experience,\nwith all her hard work, she was shafted at every turn, was her cry.\n\nAny serious group of women who might band together to effect change\nwere usually derailed by her and the administration loved it.\nAn unsuspecting woman who confided in her thinking she was a fellow\nsufferer found to her sorrow that Esther was only out for Esther.\nAny confidence given her was nearly always violated.  This queen bee\njust shrugged and stung them to death.\n\nA cinch, thought Henry.\n\n\"Then Professor Jane Astori, physical therapy.\"\n\nBeside Esther, tiny Jane appeared almost doll-like,\neven though she was only a little shorter than average.\nHer blond hair was worn long and fastened with a barrette at the back.\nIt swished like a horse's tail whenever she moved her head.\n\nAt 42, she had attained her goal of becoming a professor\nand now had her sights on the department chair.  She was\nadept at playing the system.  A political pro.\n\n\"Last, but not least, here beside me, is Annette Pringle,\nzoology,\" finished Henry.\n\nAnnette nodded in recognition of the introduction and then\nturned her eyes again to the stack of papers in front of her.\nShe was scared.  It was her first committee assignment since\nher appointment as assistant professor at Belmont and she didn't\nwant to be here.  Everything was wrong about this hearing.\nIt was plain as could be that Trenchant was being railroaded.\nNobody at Belmont ever considered student feedback forms\nanything more than an exercise in futility.\n\nWhat a nothing, inconsequential charge--yet here she was with\nthe rest of the panel who all appeared to think this was the\nmost serious crime since the Holocaust.\n\nAnnette hadn't dared to refuse Henry's request after the\nway the Vee had questioned her.  He had come unannounced to her\noffice to ask her to serve on this hearing panel.  He explained\nto her how important serving on university committees could be\nand how they beefed up a curriculum vita.\n\nThen, right out of the blue, apropos of nothing he had said,\n\"I understand you and your friend, Joan, live together.\"\nIt could have been just an innocent remark, but Annette,\nwith years of suspicion and threats to remember, didn't think so.\nHe knows, she thought and the thought stuck in her throat and choked\nher with fear.  Her weak protests that she really didn't think\nshe had experience enough yet to qualify for the panel had been\nswept aside and here she was.\n\nHenry's thoughts were similar.  He smiled in triumph.\nIt really paid to check people out carefully.  You could find out\nthe damndest things.  Things people were afraid of getting out.\nThings Henry could used to control them.\n\nStill smiling, he turned to the papers before him and in rapid order,\nintroduced into evidence, Medical School Dean Broadhurst's letter of charges,\na memo from the Chairman of NERD, Dr. Lyle Stone, and the two files containing\nthe material sent out from Belmont to the document examiners.\n\n\"These are the items,\" the Academic Vice President and Chair\nof the hearing panel committee asserted, holding up the files,\n\"that the hearing is about.\"\n\n\"We will commence by having the university's witnesses sworn\nin by the court stenographer.  The committee will then examine\neach of the witness, then the accused may cross examine them.\n\n\"After all our witnesses have testified, Trenchant may\nexamine her witnesses and the committee will cross.\nAre there any questions?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"  Diana said firmly.  \"You have said that the witness\nare to be sworn by the court stenographer and I have no\nobjection to that.  However, I want it in the record that I was\ntold both by the ombudsman and by you, Mr. Chairperson, that this\nwould be a typical administrative hearing and that witnesses are\ngenerally not sworn.  When they are, it is done by one of the\nhearing committee.\n\n\"I was further told that recording of the hearing would be by\ntape recorder.  I find that neither of these two things are true.\n\n\"In addition, I want it recorded that I have requested several\ntimes that this hearing be open, and the chair has refused.\nThe Attorney General's Office has asked to be allowed to send\nan observer to this hearing.  Their request was denied,\nbut they were promised a complete transcript of it.\"\n\n\"OK,\" Henry brushed aside Diana's observations as if they were\nof no import, and continued, \"we'll call our first witness.\"\nHenry rose and went to get the Lyle Stone, chair of the\nNutrition, Embryology and Radiology Department--NERD.\n\nLyle was seated directly opposite Trenchant and was sworn\nby the stenographer.  Under questioning from the committee,\nhe gave his name and position.\n\nDr. Lyle Stone was a man totally driven by ambition.\nHe treated people on two levels.  If he needed something from you,\nhe was most decent, even kindly; if not, he ignored you.\n\nQuick to anger, he rarely checked facts.  He took good care\nof himself, and at the age of 58, he regularly worked out\nat the gym and was seldom sick.\n\nHe was, however, short.  Shorter than the average man, he tried\nto make up the height with bluster.  This gave him not only a Banty\nrooster approach to life but also may have been why he resembled one.\n\n\"How did you become aware of the issue that this panel is investigating?\"\nHenry continued.\n\nLyle testified that two years previously, Dr. Randy Fecesi\nhad come to him with two medical student feedback forms which he\nhad found.  \"Students are required to fill out and bring to the\nNERD office a questionnaire type form that critiqued each of the\nfaculty in each course and the course itself,\" he explained. . .\n\n\nStudent Feedback Forms were initiated at Belmont in the\nmiddle sixties.  They were designed to allow the students to\nevaluate faculty and courses in response to student demand\nthat they have a voice in their education.  Although the professors\nof each course at Belmont routinely handed the forms out and\ncollected them, they were never taken seriously by any department\nor dean unless they were uniformly derogatory to a course\nor professor and sometimes, even then, they were ignored.\n\nMostly, they were treated as a joke by the departments and\na lost cause by the students who never saw any changes made as\na result of their suggestions.  The joke was propagated further\nwhen some wag arbitrarily added MUR between the S and FF,\ncreating the adjusted acronym, SmurFF, from Student Feedback\nForm.  From that time on, the forms were printed on blue paper.\n\n\n\". . .Randy said that he had found a SmurFF for the radiology\ncourse this year and one from last year that didn't look right\nto him.  He and Dr. Heathson, who teach the course, wanted me\nto send them for handwriting analysis because he thought they\nhad been written by Trenchant.\"\n\nLyle went on to explain at some length that Dr. Randy Fecesi\nand Dr. Ian Heathson were young faculty who were trying very hard\nto make the radiology course more modern and sophisticated.\nThese efforts, he asserted, were thwarted by Trenchant and there\nwas controversy and conflict because of her. . .\n\n\nWhen Lyle Stone succeeded Jimbo Jones as head of NERD, he brought\nhis post doc, Ian Heathson with him.  No one on the NERD faculty\nwas consulted and all of them were very upset that they were given\nno voice in a faculty selection.  They soon learned that Ian was\na special friend of their chairperson and quickly discovered\nthat it was not wise to criticize him in any way.\n\nIan was a real nice, friendly fellow, fairly adept at his\nresearch specialty, nutrition (which was also Lyle's) but\nlacking knowledge and understanding of radiology.\n\nLyle put him in charge of the radiology course given to the\nfreshmen medical students.  This act was similar to throwing a\nchild into the water and expecting it to learn to swim.\n\nDiana had taught the lab portion of this course for several years.\nIan didn't learn very quickly.  He tried, you have to give him that,\nbut he was way out of his depth.  The students, as kindly as possible,\nturned thumbs down on him.  Not only that, but on their SMurFF's,\nthey were highly critical of the lecture portion of the course,\nwhich Ian conducted, while praising Trenchant and the laboratory,\nespecially the laboratory manual which she had written.\n\nThe manual had been written out of desperation by Trenchant\non her home computer.  Over the years, the radiology lab manual\nhad degenerated into such a mess that it was difficult to use\nand impossible to understand--especially when most of the pages\nwere unreadable.  This was before the department obtained\na copying machine and still used the old fashioned stencils.\n\nSo Diana wrote and illustrated an entirely new manual and\nshe registered the copyright on it.  She offered this finished\nmanual to Ian at no charge for use in the course and he grabbed\nit like the drowning man he was.  The students had made their\ndisgust well known to him and he realized that he did not have\nthe knowledge or experience to produce an adequate laboratory\nmanual in Radiology.\n\nThings got better in the course.  Ian was improving in his\nknowledge and lecturing.  There was excellent cooperation between\nhim and Trenchant.  That is, until Randy Fecesi was brought in.\n\nRandy came with perhaps even less ability in radiology than Ian,\nbut where the students were sympathetic toward Ian, they were\npissed off by Randy.  The SmurFFs they wrote concerning him were not kind.\nMany reprimanded him for things he had said in lectures which were contrary\nto what the students read in textbooks.  Hurt, angry and unable to get at\nthe students, he turned on Trenchant.  At first, Ian tried to stay neutral\nbut eventually, Randy convinced him that the course must be reorganized\nand they had to start by redoing the laboratory manual.\n\nHis solution was to change the only part of the course that really worked!\n\n\n\n\nChapter 7\n\n\n\"Now what did you do with these SmurFFs that Dr Fecesi brought you?\"\nquestioned Henry.\n\n\"At first, I just thought about them.  Then I took them to\nJimbo Jones who was chair of the department before me.\n\n\"I thought he might have some idea of what should be done\nand he, of course, knew Trenchant since she had been\nin the department during his tenure as chair.\"\n\nLyle continued, shifting in his chair so he appeared taller.\n\"Jimbo immediately took them to Mark Rogers who is the\nuniversity attorney and Mark sent them out for analysis.\n\n\"I looked through other SmurFFs and picked out a couple\nthat seemed strange, that didn't seem to me to be what students\nwould write, and Jimbo found a couple in the nursing course\nand all those were sent out to the examiner.\n\n\"The document examiners reported that, to the best of their knowledge,\nTrenchant had written the SmurFFs we had sent them so I went to you,\nHenry, to the administration, and it was decided that I meet with her\nand give her an opportunity to resign.  When she refused, I wrote\nthe dean and he initiated the termination for cause action.\"\n\nHenry appeared pleased, consulted his notes and asked if Lyle\ncould explain Trenchant's conduct.\n\nCertainly, Lyle would be happy to.  His eagerness to answer this\nquestion lent strength to a skeletal system already overtaxed\nwith maintaining a taller posture.\n\n\"It had to do with the problems in the radiology course.\nIan and Randy were trying to make the course better.  She fought\nthem on everything and finally she quit the course--said it was\ntoo much along with her other teaching responsibilities.\nIt was about a year ago that. . .\"\n\n\nRandy called another meeting to discuss the Radiology course changes.\nIan attended reluctantly.  He was not convinced but Randy swept him along\nand Randy had Lyle's approval.  All Ian had was a poor track record\nteaching the course.\n\nRandy delineated the changes he was going to make in the manual.\nThe first one was that Trenchant's name would not appear on it.\nInstead, it would be the product of the course directors, Ian and Randy.\n\nHe was quietly and firmly told by Trenchant that he did not have\nher permission to make any changes.  The manual was copyrighted\nby her and would stay that way.  He had the option to either\nuse it or not, but he could not change it as he was indicating.\nAs for legitimate suggestions or ideas, she would certainly,\nas always, welcome constructive criticism and make the necessary\nchanges herself.\n\nThis was not an arbitrary determination by Trenchant.  Her manual was\nwritten expressly to teach a circumscribed area of the course.\nIt did not pretend to be otherwise.  Even though more emphasis\nwas to be given to recent developments in the field, the radiology\ncourse must still devote a great deal of time to the basics.\nThis was because the students had to be prepared for the courses to follow.\n\nRandy announced that he would use what he wanted, as he wanted\nand the meeting broke up.\n\nThe accused was busy in her office when Lyle burst through the door\nin his customary manner of no manners.\n\n\"What do you mean telling Randy and Ian that they could\nnot use the manual and make the changes they want in it?\"\nHe yelled at her, continuing with threats of what would\nor might happen if she didn't do as she was directed.\n\nWhen Trenchant was finally given a chance to answer, she told him\nsimply that the manual was copyrighted and that she had told\nIan and Randy that they were free to use it or not as they chose.\nThey were not to edit it or change the authorship, however.\n\nWhen his browbeating failed to move her, he left.\nWithin the hour, Jimbo accosted her in much the same manner.\n\nBecoming a Vee had not changed Jimbo.  He was still unable\nor unwilling to govern his temper.\n\n\"You cannot claim copyright to the radiology manual because it\nis illegal and the university will sue you and put you in jail.\"\n\nAfter he had stopped yelling, Trenchant told him the same\nthing she had told the others.\n\nHe left and went into Lyle's office where they were joined\nby Ian and Randy.\n\nIt was decided that they would retype the radiology manual\nusing as much of it as they wanted.  \"To hell with that\ntrouble-making broad,\" was the decision of the assistant vice\npresident for academic affairs of Belmont University.\nThis was done.  Without permission, they used large portions\nof the manual in the fall radiology course, giving no credit\nto its author.\n\nDiana was not the only author so honored.  In the manual,\nand in other material that these men put together to teach\nthe radiology course, complete excerpts were taken verbatim\nfrom four standard radiology texts.  No source was cited.\nNo author was credited.  Also, an entire atlas on radiology\nwas photographed.  Several copies of these photographs\nwere made and put out in the lab with absolutely no credit\ngiven to its authors or publisher.\n\nAt least one medical student was incensed by this.\nHe or she wrote to the publisher anonymously.\n\nThe accused learned through the student grapevine\nthat the department got into serious trouble\nbecause of this and that Dean Broadhurst was furious.\n\nLyle blamed Trenchant for blowing the whistle, conveniently\nforgetting that it was a student who had written the letters.\n\n\n\n\nChapter 8\n\n\nLyle droned on and on with a litany of sins attributed to\nDiana Trenchant, carefully circling the truth.  \"Whatever problem\nthe department had, she was usually responsible,\" he asserted.\nThe folds of paper falling from the court stenographer's machine\nstacked higher and higher.  Janet was beginning to look very tired.\n\nThe `suspect SmurFFs' were introduced and Lyle identified them.\n\"Yes,\" he intoned, \"When I spoke to Trenchant and told her she had\nthe option to resign and nothing further would be said or done to her,\nI gave her all of the handwriting evidence, all of these SmurFFs,\nat that time.\"\n\nNow, Henry allowed questions from the rest of the committee\nwho started to slowly wake up after enduring Lyle's long and\nrepetitious testimony.  Nearly 20 minutes was spent answering\ntheir inane questions regarding how many courses were involved\nand who found the `suspect' critiques.  Most of their questions\nhad been answered previously in the material given them--\nthe dean's letter and Lyle's memo.\n\nEsther, however, alertly noticed that some of the SmurFFs\nin question had no dates and inquired how these could be said\nto come from a certain year.\n\nThe answer given was a model of obfuscation.  Lyle replied,\n\"The critiques from those two years came in a packet to me from\nRandy and Ian.  Those were the years that Trenchant was indeed\ninvolved in teaching this course.\"\n\nSatisfied with the answer apparently, Esther questioned\nwhy one of the suspect SmurFFs had a note stapled to it.\n\nDiana sat up in her chair.  This was a question she wanted answered.\n\nLyle replied that it was a note from Trenchant and that he had stapled it\nto the evaluation prior to sending it off to the handwriting analyst.\n\nNone of them questioned why a note in Trenchant's handwriting was made\na part of the document that the analysts were to analyze for authorship.\n\nAnnette wondered if she understood correctly.  Did Lyle\nsay that he kept all of the critiques in his office?\n\nWhen Lyle answered yes, she asked how it would be\npossible for Diana to submit falsified ones.\n\nThe silence in the room was deafening.  Janet, lifting her\nhands from the keys, massaged her fingers, the suggestion\nof a smile floated mischievously over her face.\n\nPanel member Anuse finally came to the rescue with a cuing\nquestion and a long discussion ensued as to how SmurFFs were\nhandled in the department and what happened to them.\n\nMany of the answers give by Lyle were false.  Diana made a note of these.\n\nThe chair now looked expectantly at Professor Jane Astori.\nSo far things had gone very well.  Everyone had been on cue\nand except for those two surprise questions. . .well, they were\nfielded quite adeptly.  His chest expanded with pride in his ability\nto bring this thing to a smooth conclusion.  Now it was time for\nJane to ask the questions that would delineate the magnitude\nof this crime.  That would certainly figure in the Attorney\nGeneral's evaluation of the hearing.\n\n\"Since all of the comments on the suspect SmurFFs refer to Randy,\"\nJane began, \"I'd like the details of how this could impact on Ian.\"\n\nWell, Jane had come through all right.  A little too direct\nfor comfort but then, she hadn't the gift of subtlety that he,\nHenry, had acquired.  At any rate, Lyle was well prepared and\nthe gates opened and the Ian story poured forth.  How hard he\nhad worked at the course.  What it had cost him in research\ntime and time away from loved ones.\n\nIn answer to further questions from Jane, he covered everything.\nAll the trips to the dean's office in Ian's behalf.  He emphasized\nthat the disparaging student critiques suddenly got better when Trenchant\nwas no longer in the course.\n\nOver and over, he stressed that it was all the faultfinding\nSmurFFs that were coming in that were the problem.  What was\nthe reason for it?\n\nHe, Lyle, felt that Ian was doing a fine job.  Well, the situation\nhad caused them many a sleepless night.  And on and on. . .\n\nSeveral times Jane tried with her questions to bring Lyle back\nto saying how the SmurFFs in question, the ones he thought Diana\nhad written, hurt Ian.  Henry had impressed on her that it was\nimportant that Lyle be given the opportunity to link the harm\ncaused by Trenchant to Ian as well as Randy.\n\nWhatever the reason, Lyle was acting awfully dense, she thought,\nor else he thinks it's vital to get all this other stuff in first.\nI've certainly given him the question often enough, let someone else try.\nShe put down her notes, leaned back in her chair and nodded to Henry\nthat she was finished.\n\nFrank Anuse took over the questioning.  He wanted to know the reason\nthat Ian's SmurFFs got better when Trenchant was not in the course.\n\n\"Well, you see, these suspect SmurFFs in those packets there,\nthese few are just the tip of the iceberg.  Diana Trenchant,\nduring the years she was in the course, influenced the students\nto write bad evaluations about Randy and Ian.\"\n\nThere it was.  Stark and real.  Diana was not just accused\nof creating SmurFFs--she was accused of witchcraft.\n\nJane jerked upright in her chair and stared at Lyle aghast.\nWas he really accusing Diana of that level of control over\nmedical students?  Preposterous--one woman, all by herself,\nhad influenced hundreds of medical students over a period of years\nto do as she dictated.  There's more to this than I've been told. . .\nthis isn't about forging seven SmurFFs.  What on earth is going on here,\nshe pondered. . .\n\nFinally, Henry noticed Janet who had been trying to get his\nattention for some time.  \"We'll take a ten minute recess\nand when we come back, Trenchant may cross examine Dr. Stone.\nYou may leave the room.  I'll summon you when we are ready,\"\nhe ordered, taking in Janet and Diana with the same disdainful glance.\n\nThe committee huddled and Lyle Stone joined them.  So much for impartiality.\n\nJanet and Diana left, both breathing an audible sigh of relief\nas the door shut behind them.  Stopping at the soft drink dispenser,\nthe court reporter glanced around carefully then said sotto voce,\n\"What a farce.  Unbelievable.\"\n\n\n\n\nChapter 9\n\n\nThe ten-minute break had stretched to twenty before Henry\nand the panel finished going over their notes to make sure they\nhad brought out everything that Mark, the university attorney,\nhad advised.\n\nDiana and Janet were called back and Diana began the\ncross examination of her department chair, Lyle Stone.\n\nShe asked him first to confirm a sentence written in his\nmemo to the dean and which he had testified to before the break.\n\n\"Yes,\" Lyle answered, \"I did write in the memo to the dean\nand also testified that I gave you all of the documents used\nin the handwriting analysis.\"\n\nDiana held up several sheets of paper from the evidence packet\non the table.  \"I have found documents dated nearly twenty years ago\nin this material the committee has introduced as that sent to the document\nexaminers.  These were not in the material that you gave me.\nSo your assertion that I was given all of the documents is incorrect.\"\n\nHenry searched quickly through his copy of the evidence\nthat had been sent to the document examiners as standards.\nGood God, he thought.  What is this creature doing?\nCome on Lyle, don't let her get the best of you.\n\nAh, much better, Henry observed happily to himself as Lyle\nstarted tap dancing around her question.  Instead of yes or no,\nhe would repeat at length some of his previous testimony with\nadded embellishments and avoid answering.\n\nBy persistent questioning, Diana established that he had stapled\nher brief note to one of the `suspect' SmurFFs before it was sent\nout for analysis.  But it was like pulling teeth.  He kept reiterating\nthat it was stapled to a `suspect' evaluation, so it would not get lost.\n\nPatiently, she repeated her question, finally wearing him down.\n\"Were the document examiners given this evaluation with the note\nstapled on it as one of the `fictitious' critiques?\"\n\n\"Yes, they identified that critique as having been written by you.\"\n\n\"No distinction between the note and the critique was given them--\naccording to their report, is that correct?\"\n\n\"I guess so, yes.\"\n\nUsing a sketch of the NERD office, Trenchant ran Lyle back\nthrough his previous testimony of how the blank critiques,\nthe SmurFFs, were given out, how they were collected\nand what happened to them afterwards.\n\nFrom her intimate knowledge of the operation, she was able to\nreveal most of the lies he had told of this process when the\ncommittee was questioning him.\n\nJane was listening carefully.  Slowly, there evolved the information\nthat this whole evaluation process was sloppy and unreliable.\nThat it had indeed, been this way for years.  Given that,\nshe thought, how could he claim that such a high reliance\nwas put on SmurFFs when assessing faculty for reappointment?\n\nLyle admitted that students had scant desire to complete SmurFFs.\nThey considered it a useless effort since little or no attention\nhad been paid in the past to their comments.\n\n\"To force compliance,\" he explained, \"students were told\nthat unless their name had been checked off on a list in\nthe secretaries' office, they could not receive their grade\nfor the course from the dean's office.  Most students bring\nin completed evaluation forms, place them in the box provided\nand check off their names.  Some merely come in and check off\ntheir names, eschewing the forms,\" he finally admitted\nwith obvious reluctance.\n\n\nThis certainly puts a different light on things, Jane noted\nas she jotted down the information being squeezed out of Lyle\nby Diana.  She carefully registered in neat script:\n\n    1. That the blank SmurFFs were left out in the open for days,\n    sometimes weeks so any body could have had access to them\n\n    2. That the completed SmurFFs left in the box, supposedly by\n    radiology students, were separated and given to each instructor;\n    the course critiques went to Ian and Randy\n\n    3. No tabulation of the number of critiques was carried out\n\n    4. Anyone could come in (etc.)\n\n    5. Since the critique form  (etc.)\n\n    6. Most of the submitted critiques were not dated\n\n\nThe accused was left out of course planning meetings when\nIan and Randy met with Lyle, contrary to what he had just\ntold the committee.\n\nNone of the documents he had sent to the analysts contained\nanything detrimental to Ian Heathson, as claimed in his memo\nto the dean.  She re-read what he'd written in the memo,\n\"These fictitious student critiques were very detrimental\nand personally injurious to two junior faculty members.\"\n\nUnder Trenchant's quietly relentless cross examination, Lyle\nbecame flustered.  First he claimed that perhaps his language had\nnot been perfect in that phrase but what he meant was that,\n\"manipulation of critiques in general would be detrimental\nto any faculty member.\"\n\nTrying to bring him to the point, Trenchant read from\na signed, dated student critique that had not been deemed\n`suspicious' by Lyle.  It had been submitted during the same\nperiod as the `questioned' critiques.\n\n\"Quote:  `I think Randy needs to be more than one page ahead\nof the class in understanding the material.  How can you teach\nwhat you do not know?  I was also offended by the so-called\nanthropological function' (he gave) `of the female breasts.\nI am familiar with some of the literature which support the\nstatement in the handouts,' (in a lecture, Randy had emphasized\nthat the primary function of the female breast was to attract a\nmate) `but was not aware that THE NAKED APE, PENTHOUSE MAGAZINE,\nPLAYBOY MAGAZINE and so forth were regarded as competent medical\nschool publications.  The underlying tragedy of this incident\nis that it demonstrates the ease with which non-scientific\nhypothesis are disseminated without any thought.  This, I think,\nis a poor reflection on the department and the faculty.'  Unquote.\"\n\nDiana continued, \"This is what I would call personally\ninjurious but I do not see this student critique among\nthe `suspicious' ones--the ones sent out for analysis.\"\n\nHenry started to sweat along with Lyle who was becoming\nincreasingly uncomfortable, his tone hostile.  He dodged\nand refused to answer directly a question asking if he always\nsent suspicious critiques for handwriting analysis, claiming\nthat in this case, one of his junior faculty had asked him to.\n\nJane picked up on an item of special importance, and extremely\nrelevant, underlining it several times on her note pad.\nBecause of the negligent handling of the critique process,\nthere was no authentic chain of custody maintained!  In addition,\nneither the SmurFFs alluded to as `suspicious' nor the so-called\nhandwriting standards were ever authenticated.\n\nAccording to the testimony she had just heard, each  of the\nso-called `suspicious' critiques had been discovered when the\nfinder was alone.  Furthermore, Lyle could give no proof that\nany of the `suspicious' SmurFFs he claimed were found,\nhad ever been placed in the return box provided for the students.\nIn fact, except for the few critiques that were signed,\nthere was no evidence that any of the nearly two hundred\nuncontested critiques relating to the radiology course were\neven submitted by the radiology students!\n\nJane was simply astounded.  In all of Lyle's testimony, he had\noffered no witnesses or evidence that could confirm his testimony\nthat students had been manipulated by the accused.  Witchcraft\nwas insinuated, but never proven.\n\nHenry was rapidly becoming unglued.  Noting Lyle's declining control\nand fearing an incipient outburst, Henry interrupted and declared\nthat they would now take a lunch break.  How could that idiot sit there\nand let himself give away that kind of detail on how SmurFFs were handled\nin his department?  Henry knew that this was having a deleterious effect\non the panel and he knew that he'd better set things straight while\nthere was still a chance to cover up.\n\n\n\n\nChapter 10\n\n\nLunch was catered in the upstairs witness room as the prosecution,\nHenry and the panel, huddled to socialize and discuss the morning events.\n\nHenry and Frank Anuse excused themselves after the meal and adjourned\nto the men's room to plan strategy.  \"We can't say too much to the women\nnow with the other witnesses around but when we get back, you take Esther\nout somewhere and I'll handle Jane.  Annette's no threat, we'll forget her.\nAnyhow, explain how all that bullshit about the chain of custody doesn't have\nany bearing at all.  Everything rests on the document examiner's evidence.\nNothing else counts.  Got it?\"\n\n\"No problem, Henry.  I'll set her straight,\"  Anuse said reassuringly.\n\"Christ, Diana really stuck it to Lyle, didn't she?\"\n\nThe defense huddled too.  They went as a group to the nearby cafeteria.\nEveryone took the trouble to keep the conversation light and encouraging.\nThey were convulsed at the reaction of the court stenographer which Diana\nrelated to them.\n\n\"She's probably attended a great many hearings,\" offered Helen.\n\"What happens in the cloistered halls of Belmont U. would be a bit\nforeign to her.\"\n\nEven though it was practically certain by now that\nthey would not be needed to testify until the next day,\nthey all elected to stay.  \"Hey,\" Roz insisted, \"we want\nto be here for you and each other.  It's bad enough\nthat you have to face them alone in that hearing room.\"\n\n\"You guys are the best, you know that?\"  Diana said, fondly.\n\"After the hours spent in that room its such a relief to hear\nhuman voices again.\"\n\n\nWhen the hearing resumed, Henry cautioned Diana about taking\ntoo much time and to stick to the issues.  We are only here\nto listen to information directly concerning whether you forged\nthose SmurFFs in question.  You have wasted too much of our\nvaluable time talking about non-related issues.\"\n\nAnd you, you pompous old windbag, encouraged that witness,\nLyle Stone to go on and on for hours on unrelated issues\nyourself, thought Janet, sneaking a quick, compassionate look at\nDiana and flexing her fingers in preparation for the next words.\n\nDiana almost snorted aloud at Henry's admonition.  Composing herself,\nshe said, \"I'm finished with my cross examination of Lyle.\"\n\nFrank Anuse immediately asked, \"Lyle, if it is demonstrated\nthat a faculty member falsified information concerning another\nfaculty member using SmurFFs, do you consider that to be amoral\nand unprofessional?\"\n\n\"Yes.  We are assuming that honesty must prevail among peers\nand co-workers.\"\n\n\"That's all for now.\"\n\n\"I have just a couple of questions on recross,\" corrected Trenchant.\n\nHenry, caught with his mouth open about to hastily dismiss Lyle\nglared malevolently at her.\n\nShe smiled back at him then turned to Lyle and asked if\nhe insisted that all faculty be honest.\n\nHe avoided a direct answer.  \"Well, no one thinks dishonesty\nis a good thing, at least I don't think anybody does.\"\n\n\"I just wondered why you didn't take similar action,\nthat is report to the vice president and bring charges,\nwhen the recent blatant plagiarism of Ian and Randy\nwas brought to your attention,\" Diana said.\n\nHenry, forgetting his assumed role as neutral, quickly snapped off,\n\"we really must keep the testimony on the issue.\"\n\nDiana smiled grimly.  \"Thank you.  I'm finished.\"\n\nHenry quickly excused Lyle and announced that the next witness\nwould be the document examiner and rose to get her.\n\nAfter the door closed behind him, the room was quiet.\nIts occupants sitting in silent contemplation.\n\n\n\n\nChapter 11\n\n\nSomething had to be done.  The group gathered in the\nconference room were all in agreement on that--but what?\nThe problem was two-fold: what to do about the possibility that\nTrenchant would bring a plagiarism suit against the department,\nand how to wipe out years of bad SmurFFs for Ian and Randy.\n\n\"You realize that we could just get rid of her by invoking\nthe clause in her contract that designates she's first in\nthe department fired if the department has financial problems?\"\n\n\"That wouldn't help much, she could still sue for plagiarism.\nIf we fired her, even justifiably, the papers would play\nthe plagiarism stuff up.\"\n\n\"There is another way--by discrediting her first and making\nthe student evaluations invalid.\"\n\n\"How!\"\n\n\"During my last trip to New York, I heard about some special\nservices that were available.\"\n\n\"Special services?  You mean a hit man?  That wouldn't help\nthe evaluations.\"\n\n\"No.  Something else, entirely.  Give me a few weeks and then\nfollow through with what you are presented with.  It may be expensive,\nthough.  Can I count on some help in that direction?\"\n\n\"No problem.  You come through on this and we'll give you\nall the help you want.\"\n\nThe others present nodded in agreement and the meeting ended.\n\nHe could hear the phone ringing in Anderson's office.  Ah,\nthere he was.  \"Andy, no names, please.  I'm on the office phone.\nYou recognize my voice?\n\n\"Yeah, sure.  How they hanging?\"\n\n\"Remember our conversation where you told me about the special services guy?\n\n\"Yeah.\"\n\n\"Can you put me in touch with him?\"\n\n\"Yeah.\"\n\n\"Thanks, later.\"\n\n\nHe got to the appointed restaurant early and asked for\nthe booth reserved for Smith as he had been instructed.\nIt was amazing how those New York City taxi drivers knew\na hole in the wall place like this.\n\nSoon, he was joined by a well dressed, obviously well\neducated man who ordered drinks for both of them.\n\n\"I understand that you have need of our services.\nHow may we be of help?\"\n\n\"I need to have some papers forged.  It has to be a foolproof\nforgery that will not be exposed if the papers are examined\nby a handwriting analyst.\"\n\n\"That will be expensive, but not impossible.  We charge by\nthe number of words and the number of papers or documents\nyou need.\"  The price of each was then given.\n\n\"Whew, that is steep.\"\n\n\"Yes it is.  But you want foolproof.  Ordinary forgers\nare a dime a dozen, but we employ only the most expert.\nThese are people who are trained in document examination.\nThey know what a document examiner looks for and what tips\nthem off to call something a forgery.  For example,\nif a person is trying to disguise his or her handwriting,\nthey make it bigger, wider, smaller or larger.\n\n\"Our forgers, as trained document examiners, look for unique\nor individualistic handwriting characteristics and make sure\nthese are included in their forgeries.  They first find all the\ncharacteristics, even the microscopic ones, of the individual's\nhandwriting just as a document examiner does.  Then they utilize\nthis knowledge in making a foolproof forgery.\n\n\"All this takes time, of course.\"\n\n\"How do you recruit these people?  I should think it would\nbe difficult since they work fairly exclusively for attorneys\nor police, don't they?\"\n\n\"Well, I certainly can't share our methods but I will remind\nyou that money talks.  These people are paid very well for what\nthey do and they know they are protected.  I hope you are not\nso naive that you believe all lawyers and cops are honest!\n\n\"They are easy to recruit because they may have worked for years\nfor very little.  That's why to get the best, you have to pay for it.\"\n\n\"OK, here's what I need.  I was hoping to have a dozen or\nso of the following messages copied onto these blue forms,\nbut I'm going to have to settle for these three short ones.\n\"I understand from the man that introduced us that this will\nnever be traced back to me?\"\n\n\"Correct.  I am only a broker.  I do nothing criminal--you do\nnothing criminal.  The forger never sees either you or me.\nSomeone else takes the material to her or him.  That's another\nthing that makes our service so excellent.  I will use a former\ndocument examiner who is the same sex and about the same age\nas the person you want blamed for these documents.\n\n\"Now, the first thing we need is as many examples of this\nindividual's handwriting and printing that you can get your hands on.\nWe want originals, not copies.  However, be sure you make copies\nsince you will not get the originals back.  They will be,\n`consumed' perhaps is the best word for it, in the forgery process.\nMost commercial document examiners will accept copies of\nstandards to work from and this is to our, and your, advantage.\nYou might get one sharp enough to be suspicious if given enough\noriginal standards to compare with our forgeries.\"\n\nThe waiter never came back to bother them.  They sat in the\nsecluded booth and planned out the three documents to be.\n\n\nA few weeks later. . .\"Mr. Smith?  Yes, thank you for returning\nmy call so promptly.  Yes, the merchandise was as you represented.\nThe professionals have authenticated it.\"  He listened briefly,\nthen said, \"We are going to need two more.  I neglected dates\non the previous order and we have to show repetition of this practice.\n\n\"All right.  I'll meet you there in one hour with the accessories\nand balance of payment for the previous order.\"\n\nAfter hanging up the phone, he opened his briefcase and extracted\na small packet of bright blue, Belmont Student Feedback Forms\nand a sheet with the typewritten messages that had been created\nto be forged onto them.  He looked to see that the rest of the\ncontents were in place, then returned everything to the briefcase\nand left the room carrying it.\n\n\nThe document examiner was seated, sworn and proceeded to give\nher qualifications which were concerned with her training,\nthe number of years in the profession and clients.\n\nAlice Stebbins was quite short.  Her features gave her age\nas around fifty and holding.  She dressed severely, in browns\nand blacks which made her look perky and birdlike.  Peering at\nthe hearing panel over her half glasses enhanced the bird image,\nbut it was destroyed when she opened her mouth.\n\nHer voice, far from a peep-peep one might expect, was deep\nand strong.  She had learned well that when one was giving\nexpert testimony, one presented a confident, assured bearing.\n\nFurther questions from the chair led her through the\nevidence and she readily identified all but two of the\nseven `suspicious' critiques as being written by Trenchant.\nHer language was laced with the correctness of one accustomed\nto giving court appearances.  She prefaced much of her\ntestimony with the caveat, `in my opinion'.  Her attitude\nof selfassuredness belied this qualification.\n\n\"Also, in my opinion, those two most probably were written by her.\nCertainty was not possible since they contained printing and I was\nnot given enough or recent enough exemplars of Dr. Trenchant's printing.\"\n\nUsing two large easels, she demonstrated various letters\nand combination of letters photographed and enlarged from\nthe standards or exemplars and from the `suspect' documents.\n\nThis kind of testimony was familiar to Janet.  She faithfully\nrecorded the words being spoken and knew that standards or\nexemplars are writing and printing that are authenticated.\nThat is, that are definitely established to be written or\nprinted by the person in question.  Customarily, they are\ntaken in the presence of the document examiner so the\nexaminer can swear to their authenticity.\n\nUsing these visual aids, the document examiner pointed out\nthe similarities existing in the way the letters were\nformed--making her case that the documents in question,\nthe `suspect' SmurFFs, had indeed been written by Trenchant.\n\nClearly, her presentation was well done and the panel was\nmost engrossed and fascinated by the process she delineated.\n\nThe panel was eager to question her further.  Like most professionals,\nthey were deeply interested in a discipline they knew very little about.\n\n\"Is handwriting analysis reliable?\"  Anuse knew what her answer would be\nand wanted to pin this down first, but the question backfired on him.\n\n\"Yes,\" she answered confidently.\n\nThe panel hassled her for specifics.  These were researchers\nwho were consistently challenged to prove or disprove their own\ntheories and then defend them.  Statistics were their life.\n\n\"How have you measured your success rate, what percent of\nthe time have you been right?\"  They questioned.\n\n\"In other words, have the courts accepted my qualifications?\"\n\n\"No, not qualifications--evaluations.  How many times are\nyou right and how many times are you wrong?\"\n\n\"It isn't looked at that way.  The judge or jury\nlook at the whole case, not just your presentation.\"\n\n\"I understand that the courts allow your testimony.\nI want to know the percentage of error in your analysis,\"\nasked Jane Astori, leaning forward.\n\n\"None.\"\n\n\"None?  Has this ever been calculated?\" demanded Esther Rondell.\n\n\"No.  But there is research going on.\"\n\nJane and Esther looked at each other in blank astonishment\nand then back at the document examiner, disdain and disbelief\nfighting each other for expression on their faces.\n\nAttempting to save the situation, Anuse asked if the courts\naccepted handwriting analysis to be as accurate as fingerprints.\n\nHer answer dripped confidence.  \"Yes.\"\n\nJanet sensed that the women on the panel were not about to let\nthis polite exchange continue.  The very forces at work over\nthe eons that compelled women to defer to men, rewarded them\nfor fearlessly attacking other women.  The confident, assertive\ndemeanor manifested by the analyst would not have been questioned\ncoming from a man, but they would not let a woman get away with it.\n\nShe knew from countless demonstrations she had witnessed\nthat women may band together at times with the force of a mob\nto attack another woman.  This behavior was and is still produced\nby the same motivation.  Men in power foster it and reward it.\n\nEsther began the attack.  \"There are many letters on the display\nyou have shown that are very different from the standards.\nThe T's look very different.\"\n\n\"What T?\"\n\n\"Those.\" Pointing, \"those T's have a straight. . .\"\n\n\"Certainly some letters will be different, but with my training,\nI am able to see similarities you are missing,\" Alice Stebbins replied,\nconfident of her own superiority.  \"If there is a large sample of writing\nyou may be able to see differences in each letter.  The samples given me\nwere so small that this was not the case, however, I did have enough\nmaterial to compare with the unique handwriting characteristics shown\nin Dr. Trenchant's standards to make a positive identification.\"\n\n\"How consistently do other document examiners agree with you\nor agree with one another?\"  This from Annette.\n\n\"I don't know.\"\n\n\"Do handwriting examiners oppose each other in court?\"\n\n\"I don't know that.  I suppose you could find anyone to do anything.\nAssuming that there are two document examiners, it would depend upon\nwhich one makes the most persuasive argument.\"\n\n\"I see,\" Jane's smile was victorious.  \"It's not a question of being\ncorrect in your analysis as much as your ability to make a jury think so.\"\n\nHenry hurriedly asked loudly, \"I understand you are court qualified.\nWhat do you mean by that?\"\n\n\"Every time I have gone into court, my qualifications have been\naccepted by the court.  I have never been denied.  That is what is meant.\"\n\nThe chair indicated to Trenchant that she might ask questions\nof the document examiner.\n\nFirst, Trenchant confirmed all of the documents given the examiner\nand again made the point that many of these had not been given her\nbefore the hearing as had been sworn to by Lyle and also written\nin a letter to her by the chair.\n\nShe next established that all of the exemplars that the analyst\nworked from were copies.  Continuing her questioning of the witness,\nshe asked, \"You must be aware that people in your profession\npretty much insist on seeing original standards?\"\n\nAlice dodged adroitly.  \"I saw the originals of the questioned documents.\"\n\nTrenchant pursued.  \"But only copies of the standards.\"\n\nAlice allowed, \"correct,\" to escape between clenched teeth.\n\n\"You have been testifying throughout saying that I wrote\nthe standards you used.  I put it to you.  Is this something\nyou were told, or do you know of your own knowledge that I wrote\nthose standards you used to compare with `suspect' SmurFFs?\"\n\n\"What was that?\"  Anuse interrupted.\n\n\"I'll ask the question again.  Please let the witness answer.\nSpecifically, did I write those standards in front of you so\nyou know positively that they were written by me.\"\n\n\"No.  I assumed that the exemplars that I was given were\nauthentic exemplars or standards of your own writing.\"\n\n\"Just as you assumed that I wrote the questioned documents?\"\n\nDiana paused just long enough for that to sink in, then asked,\n\"It has been pointed out that some of us see many dissimilarities\nin the exhibit you have shown us.  Don't these carry any weight?\"\n\n\"If, in my opinion, the similarities outweigh the dissimilarities,\nor vice-versa, that would be the basis for my opinion,\"  Alice answered,\nthen forcefully added, \"my opinion is based on training, not assumptions.\"\n\n\"Thank you very much, Ms Stebbins.  I'm glad that we clarified\nthat the standards were assumptions.\"\n\nAnuse promptly went into a damage control frenzy trying to\ndestroy the point made that the exemplars were not authenticated.\nHe would probably have succeeded had not the examiner been so haughty,\nso confident.  At least three of the panel were not convinced by her testimony.\n\nJanet chuckled to herself.  She didn't particularly like the fact\nthat many women never figured out their intolerance of their own sex,\nbut she was delighted to see anything working in Diana's favor.\nEvidence was evidence and courts made it clear that you couldn't\nmanufacture it.  Evidence had to be proven authentic.  She knew\nthat a judge would throw this case against Diana right out\non the testimony of this document examiner.\n\nThere was a delay while Alice Stebbins was escorted out.\nDuring this time, Janet rested her fingers and recanted her\nprevious thought.  Actually, she amended, it would never have\ngotten this far.  It would have stopped back when it became\nobvious that there was no chain of custody established for the\nseven `suspect' SmurFFs.\n\n\n\n\nChapter 12\n\n\nHenry called the dean of the medical school, Sam Broadhurst, MD,\nand asked him to identify himself and his position at Belmont\nfor the record, as the witness before him had done.\n\nThe dean was a swarthy complected, strongly built individual.\nAt 52, his reputation as a ruthless administrator was well known.\nJust as well known was his reputation for fairness.  Where he\nwas faulted was the way he backed up, no matter what,\nthe medical school chairmen (there were no women)\nwho along with him were called `The Boy's Club'\nby the rest of the medical school faculty.\n\nThe Boy's Club often went on retreat.  At these meetings,\nheld in luxurious surroundings, policies and plans were decided\nand everyone fell into line, or else.  There were those among\nthe faculty that believed that Sam Broadhurst demanded from\nthe chairs, and took himself, an oath in blood.  This was because\nthey invariably backed each other up publicly even though privately,\nthey didn't.\n\nHenry knew that the dean was not happy with the way the\nTrenchant situation had been handled.  The dean was royally\npissed that Lyle had gone over his head to Mark and himself\ninstead of keeping the matter in the medical school and dealing\nwith it there.  He was further incensed that they had decided to\ncharge Diana and terminate her before he was even apprised that\nthe situation existed.  By the time he was brought into the process,\nit was to late for him to do anything but go along with it.\n\nSo Henry wasn't surprised when the dean made it quite clear\nthat he was not consulted until the central administration had\nalready decided to terminate Diana.  This was so obvious that\neveryone in the room realized that he was just doing his job\nwithin the system but that didn't mean that he liked it.\n\nHaving thus vented his spleen about the way the affair had\nbeen handled, Dean Broadhurst clearly and forcibly added his\nopinion to that of Lyle's in almost a carbon copy of Lyle's\nrelevant testimony.  Clearly and succinctly without the wandering,\nself serving side trips taken by Lyle, the dean cast the party line\nwith all the skill of the accomplished angler he was.\n\nAll right.  Well done, thought Henry, with transparent relief.\nAt least things were going all right thus far with this witness.\n\nEsther took over the questioning and asked, \"Would five or six\nSmurFF critiques out of around 200 have enough weight to influence\nyour process of evaluating faculty performance in a course?\"\n\nThe dean sidestepped, \"The ones in question were pretty damning comments.\"\n\nEsther persisted, \"Have you seen the other evaluations?  I mean the ones\nthat are believed to be authentic student feedbacks?\"\n\nHere Dean Broadhurst intentionally contradicted Lyle's testimony.\n\"No.  The student comments are summarized by the department secretaries\nand I see the summaries.  There is also a summary of the positive\nand negative comments and a summary of the numerical evaluation.\"\n\nJane looked at Henry to see his reaction.  She remembered that Lyle had\ntestified that all the SmurFFs were given to, and reviewed by, the dean.\n\nPerhaps, Sam Broadhurst thought to himself, it is all I can do for her.\nThe panel has the information, if they choose to hear it.  If there was\nmanipulation of the evaluation process, it wasn't a product of five\n`suspicious' ones out of some two hundred that were considered valid.\n\nStatistically, the evidence stunk and he knew it.  He also\nknew a lot more.  Two of his children had gone through the\nmedical school when Diana taught in the radiology laboratory.\nThe dean remembered the many occasions he had seen fit to\ncompliment Trenchant on her teaching, saying that he was giving\nher this critique first-hand from one or the other of his children.\n\nPerhaps, thought the dean, if witchcraft was the real charge,\nthe panel would insist that it be proven.\n\nOr maybe not.  The administration appeared to be out for blood\nand he was sure that Lyle was still licking the wounds\nof a few short months ago. . .\n\nHe had Lyle on the carpet.  He had summarily called him down\nto his office to read him the riot act.\n\n\"Here are the letters I've received from three top publishers\nof medical texts.  Each one of them protests the plagiarism\nthat a medical student told them your people have committed\nin preparing course material.\n\n\"I went to the radiology lab after I received the first\nletter and talked to some students.  Although no one wanted\nto admit to contacting the publishers, they did show me the areas\nin their manual and notes that had been copied directly from\ndifferent texts without citation.\n\n\"They also showed me the notebooks filled with diagrams that\nhad been copied from a published atlas.  Again, nowhere in the\nbook was there any mention of, or credit given, to the source.\nHell, your guys didn't even get permission to photograph the material!\"\n\nThe dean continued telling Lyle that quite a sum of money would\nhave to change hands with the publishers to keep this thing quiet.\n\n\"It must be her,\" Lyle whined when he could get a word in.\n\"She must have put the students up to writing the publishers.\"\nThe dean knew who he meant.  Lyle was a chronic complainer.\n\"Did Trenchant put your boys up to plagiarism too?\" ridiculed\nthe dean.  \"I understood from you that she was no longer\nin the radiology course.\"\n\n\"She's not, but the students from previous years have told\nthis year's students about her and they all go to her when\nthey don't understand something.\n\n\"She's really a menace to Randy and Ian.  One day she even\ngot a classroom and held a review just before an exam.\nI got wind of it and sent Ann Biggot to audit.  Ann said that most\nof the radiology class showed up.  The students told Ann afterwards\nthat they had been the ones to ask for the review.\n\n\"Now you know how that must have hurt Ian's feelings.  His reviews were\nonly attended by a handful of the students and no one came to Randy's.\"\n\n\"You should be able to handle a situation like that.\nTell her to stop it if you think it undermines your faculty.\"\n\nLyle was not a happy camper.  He left, enraged.  As soon as\nhe reached his office, he called for Ian.\n\n\"Ian, I know you've got a lecture in a few minutes so I'll\nbe brief.  After the lecture, I want you to tell the students\nthat they must not consult Diana anymore because she is not\ninvolved in teaching radiology and is much too busy to be bothered.\n\nAlso, you lay it on the line about your job.  You tell them that\nunless your critiques improve, you are out.  Work on their feelings.\nMost of the students like you and would hate to have you lose your job\non account of them.\n\n\"After you finish that, you and Randy get in here.  I want\nto talk to you both about that lab material you plagiarized.\"\n\n\nWhen the panel had finished its brief examination of the dean,\nDiana simply said, \"I have no questions.\"  She understood the\nconstraints he was under and appreciated how much he had tried,\nin spite of them, to help.  He had given the panel some\nvital information.  The question was, did they hear it?\nDean Broadhurst was excused and the next witness was called.\n\n\n\n\nChapter 13\n\n\nRandy Fecesi sat in the witness chair and raised his hand\nfor the oath with alacrity.  He was going to enjoy this.\n\nA wispy, rather nondescript person, his main aim in life\napparently was to live up to his name.  He sported a crew cut\nwhich bristled, much like his ever present bad temper,\nabove bright beady eyes which were forever darting around\nundressing every female in sight.\n\nAlthough he had some talent in research, having received\na sizable grant, his conceit and arrogance got in the way\nof establishing a rapport with students.  It also prevented him\nfrom really understanding how very little he knew about radiology.\n\nHenry had spent a great deal of time with Randy preparing him\nfor today.  It had been a harrowing ordeal.  Perhaps the actual\ntestifying would be more harrowing, Henry thought as he nervously\nreviewed to himself what he had learned about Randy from Lyle.\n\nRandy had come to Belmont from a college in Ohio having\nsufficiently outstayed his welcome there.  As is true in most\ncollege administrations, faculty sexual misconduct was\nconsidered mere professorial peccadillo and was studiously\noverlooked.  If a woman student appeared to be on the verge\nof making a fuss, administrators had a remedy called\n`The Grievance Procedure'.  Administrative personnel talked to\nthe woman and were able to subtly or directly lead her to understand\nthat problems would arise in her matriculation if she persisted\nwith charges of sexual harassment or rape.\n\nIf this didn't work, a brief investigation identified her\nfriends and she was appraised of situations that might\naffect them should she remain recalcitrant.  Most didn't.\n\nThis was all done under the aegis of Academic Freedom, mused Henry.\nThe principle of academic freedom evolved years ago.  It sheltered\nserious scholars from the whims and avarice of the shifting politicians\nand their politics.  Now it was made better use of.  We administrators\nuse it as a tool to circumvent trouble.  Nearly all institutions, battling\nthe emergence of women and other minorities into the collegiate arena,\nuse it to maintain the status quo and rightfully so, Henry decided.\nAcademic freedom was used to shield the many ways we avoid compliance\nwith both federal and state laws.  If we opened ourself to public scrutiny,\nwe'd never get anything done.\n\nUniversities are, were and should be a law unto themselves.\nThey can tolerate only those who are willing to make sometimes\npainful compromises.  Those who could not, and were compelled to\nfight for so-called human rights and the original meaning of\nAcademic Freedom, soon left or were not reappointed.\n\nRandy Fecesi was, despite his foibles, a prime commodity.\nHe was funded.  This made him much sought after since colleges\nwere looking to capture research dollars.  There was good reason\nfor this, Henry noted.  Because it paid better, colleges and\nuniversities had stopped putting the emphasis on teaching\nand instead, looked for research potential.  This meant that\ncandidates for a tenure-track position were not looked at\nfor their teaching experience but for their ability to\nbring in research dollars.\n\nCompetition was fierce among these institutes of higher\nlearning and much was done to attract suitable candidates.\nHeadhunting became a profitable business in academia.\n\nFor the last ten years, teaching had taken a back seat at Belmont.\nCrowded classrooms attested to the lack of adequate teaching space.\nMuch of the space formerly assigned as classrooms had been rebuilt\ninto laboratories.  At the medical school, prospective recruits\nwere lured by promises of plenty of laboratory space, unremitting\nstroking and very light teaching duties.\n\nThe reality was that once the entrant was hired, adulation ceased.\nFor Randy, this was a problem.  In addition, he hadn't even tried to clean\nup his act and Lyle did nothing except encourage him to be pond scum,\nthought Henry.  Randy expected the medical students to worship him\nand instead they found him appalling because of his lack of expertise\nin the subject he taught and for his repeated, haughty demonstration of it.\n\nHaving his way with women took a beating too.  Usually, he ignored\nany female who didn't fit his image of perfect enough for him to notice.\nHowever, if he needed something, he would approach these females\nin a sexual manner and was usually rebuffed.\n\nSince Lyle had already established Trenchant as the whipping girl\nof the department, Randy readily fell in with this designation\nand laid all his problems at her door.  When she refused to photograph\nthe pictures in a radiology atlas, he was furious.  He ran to Lyle\nand claimed that she was obstructing his efforts to modernize the course.\nHe neglected to tell Lyle that she had said she would be willing to do it\nif the publisher gave written permission.\n\nLyle, of course, encouraged him to proceed with his innovations\nand just ignore her.  Randy took this to mean that he had carte blanche\nand it led to his plagiarizing her laboratory manual as well as\nthe published texts and atlas of other authors.\n\nHenry brought his attention back to the hearing just as Jane was\nasking Randy to explain how he had found the `suspicious' critiques.\n\nHe answered, leaning forward toward her in his eagerness and excitement,\n\"In looking through the student critiques I found these that didn't seem\nto be right.  That is, the comments were not expressed the way\na medical student would.\n\n\"I also saw that the handwriting was different.  Not the way\nstudents write but like the handwriting of old people.\nSo then I went back and looked through other years\nfor similar handwriting.\"   He explained that he, Randy,\nhad found all three SmurFFs which he had brought to Lyle\nand asked that they be sent to a document examiner\nbecause he thought these were written by Trenchant.\n\nResponding to a very leading question from Anuse, Randy agreed,\n\"Yes, these evaluations had been very harmful to me in that\nthey tended to undermine my confidence in my ability to teach\nradiology and could affect my reappointment.\"\n\nEsther broke in, \"Five evaluations out of nearly 200?\"\n\n\"Well most of the 200 were pretty bad.\"  Suddenly realizing\nhow this sounded, he quickly amended, \"You see, it was the kind\nof comments that tipped me off that they were not real student\nfeedbacks.  They didn't sound the same.  She was making these\nkinds of comments to the students--exerting influence on them\nto write the derogatory remarks.  That's what was undermining\nmy confidence.\"\n\nAnuse brought him sharply back out of harm's way by asking\nif there had been trouble between him and Trenchant.\n\nThis opened a floodgate of accusation and crocodillian remorse.\nHe had no idea why she would be so resentful of him since\nhe had gone out of his way to be nice to her.  \"Once, I even\ncomplimented her on the cute sweater she was wearing.\nInstead of acting normally, she complimented me on my cute shirt.\nGo figure!\"\n\nPressed to answer what he thought might be her reason to\nsabotage him with fictitious student evaluations, he lost it.\nAlthough he had been carefully coached by both the chairman of NERD\nand the university attorney, all that training went out the window.\nThe mask slipped and his answer was pure, vitriolic, undiluted,\nvintage Randy.\n\nPerhaps it was because he sensed a kindred spirit in Frank Anuse.\n\"Well,\" sneered Randy, \"you know broads, they get crazier than ever\nat that age and. . .\"\n\nOh, God, thought Henry and nearly shouted, \"It's getting late,\"\nover the rest of what Randy was about to say.  \"This would be\na good time to adjourn for the day.  All right?\"\n\nHe glanced around quickly, stood up and was halfway to the door\nbefore anyone could disagree.  Damned idiot, he thought to himself.\nHe'd see to it that this boy got a talking to and had his priorities\nstraight as well as his head before he came back the next day.\n\n\nHenry kept his bad mood at bay with difficulty during the drive home\nby thinking only of his comfortable chair and a huge drink. . .or two\nbefore dinner.  He had just entered the door and placed his briefcase\non the hall table when his wife's voice floated down the stairs,\njarring the hell out of him.\n\n\"That you, Henry?  Hurry up now and get dressed,\nwe're due at the Bakers in half an hour.\"\n\nHenry groaned.  \"Not tonight, shit!\"  Then almost immediately,\nhe recollected that the Bakers were giving a party and it was\nmost important that he be present.  No help for it, he'd have to\nbite the bullet.  Casting a fond look at his Lazy Boy as he passed\nthe entrance to the living room, he ascended the stairs feeling like\na doomed man mounting a scaffold.\n\n\"You look like death warmed over,\" his wife, Kate, announced caustically,\nas she met him at the top of the stairs.\n\nYou're no raving beauty yourself, Henry thought.  Kate was\nan athletic, slender woman of forty-two.  She neither thought\nherself beautiful or required that others did.  Henry often\nlamented the fact that with all the money they had, she could\nafford to go to one of the many body shops and get some or all\nof her sagging flesh lifted, but Kate opted to live naturally and\nage gracefully.  He was continually after her to at least wear\nmakeup but she adamantly refused.\n\nWhen they were married, Henry didn't mind the over a decade\nage difference between them.  Kate was an exciting woman--\nan exciting, rich woman.  Her money had been the deciding factor\nin asking her to marry him and it was one reason he stayed married\nto her.  The other was that he basked in the prestige her place\nin society lavished on him.\n\n\"Go on in and get your shower and hurry up.  We're going to\nbe late as it is.\"\n\n\"Oh, hell, it doesn't matter if we're a bit late for this.\nEveryone understands that I'm really busy with this damned hearing,\"\nHenry grumbled as he made his way to the ornate bathroom.\n\nWhen he entered his bedroom a few minutes later wrapped in\na towel, Kate called through the connecting door from her room\nto ask how the hearing was going.  Her innocent question brought\nthe whole disgusting mess back, along with the foul humor that\nwent along with it.\n\nHenry set down heavily on his bed.  \"What a day.  You wouldn't believe\nthe absolute stupidity of that NERD chairman and his little boy bad, Fecesi.\nYou'd think after all the trouble they took to have this hearing take place\nthat they would at least be prepared.  But no, Lyle couldn't even remember\nhow many Smurffs were involved--two or three.  As if that wasn't bad enough,\nhe let that damned woman, Trenchant, tie him up in knots on cross examination.\n\n\"Then Fecesi testified.  He's the guy that actually found these\nsuspicious SmurFFs and I was told that he'd been well coached.\nMark and Lyle both had gone over and over his testimony with him.\nThe trouble is, the guy is the pits.  A horny, crass bastard\nif I ever saw one.  He put on a world class demonstration\nof constipation of the brain and diarrhea of the mouth.\nIf I hadn't adjourned the hearing when I did, there's no telling\nwhat else would have come out of that foul throat of his.\n\n\"Now, add to all of that, those stupid broads on the panel\ngot teed-off at the document examiner and apparently aren't\nconvinced now that Trenchant wrote those evaluations at all.\nThe only one I can depend on is Frank Anuse.\"  Henry buried\nhis head in his lap and massaged it with both hands.\n\nKate looked at him without pity.  \"Serves you right. You and the rest\nof those sanctimonious bastards trying to railroad that woman.\nSeven SmurFFs, for God's sake--it's a greater crime to spit on the grass.\n\n\"As for Fecesi, he's got his brains in his crotch just like\nthe rest of you.  The only difference is that he doesn't\npretend otherwise--he's a little too direct for you, isn't he?\n\n\"Since this whole thing started, I've had more people ask\nme what the real reason is for going after Diana Trenchant\nbecause they just can't believe the SmurFF crap.\nEveryone on campus knows the SmurFFs are a joke.\nNobody, but nobody takes them seriously.\"\n\nHenry defended himself vigorously.  \"Well, it is serious and\nthe SmurFF thing is not all there is to it.  That woman has been\nusing her influence over the past three or four years to injure\nthe other faculty in the radiology course,\"  Henry defended\nhimself vigorously.\n\n\"Influence?  A lecturer with influence?  Who did she influence,\nthe dean?  The Pope?\"\n\n\"No.  The students.  That's why these guys in the course\nwere so hurt by all this.  Their yearly evaluation by the\nstudents--nearly all the student feedback for them,\nand the course they directed, were really bad.\nAnd, it's her fault.  She manipulated the students\nto write those bad critiques.\"\n\n\"Pshaw.  She manipulated medical students?  Since when?\nYou know, Henry, you can't have it both ways.  You claim that\nyour witnesses are stupid and loathsome, then blame Trenchant\nwhen the medical students agree with you.\"\n\n\"You just don't understand.  She had a chance to resign\nand didn't take it.  Now I'm the one in charge of giving her\na fair hearing and I'm not getting any cooperation from\nthe very people who want to get rid of her.\"\n\n\"Fair hearing, Henry?  At Belmont, that's a contradiction\nin terms and you know it.  Hurry up and get dressed.\nI'll get the car and meet you out front.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nTHE HEARING - DAY 2\n\n\n\nChapter 14\n\n\nAll of her witnesses were waiting in a high state of\nexcitement when Diana reached Howard Hall the next morning.\n\n\"Roz came in early,\" she was told.  \"She wanted to be sure\nwe got this room again today.\"\n\nRoz brushed aside the praise, \"Hey teach, I've got some\ngreat news.  The rest of the class is kicking in to make up\nfor what we lose in wages by attending the hearing.\"\n\nDiana was delighted.  The fact that many of her witnesses\nwere losing time at work to help her had caused a nagging\npain of remorse.  Already, most of them had lost a day's pay\njust sitting around waiting to testify yesterday.\nWhile her witnesses occupied themselves in various ways--\nstudying, reading or conversing quietly, Diana sat down on the couch,\nclosed her eyes and sought to compose herself.  Even though the panel\nhad instructed her to be there at nine with all her witnesses,\none never knew when the hearing would reconvene.\n\nGood news indeed.  What great people these were, she thought.\nWhen the whole mess happened, this class of some two hundred\nnutrition students had rounded up hundreds of signatures for\npetitions sent to Lyle, Sam and the Pope.  Many of the students\nhad gone to them in person to plead for justice.\n\nAlthough most of the students were in the nursing school,\nsome came from the colleges of agriculture, arts and science\nand special education.  Collectively, they had filled out\nand filed more nominations for me to be named Teacher Of The Year\nthan had ever been received before for one teacher.  They were\ndevastated when the committee receiving these nominations\nthrew them in the wastebasket, following the instructions\nof Henry Tarbuck.\n\nThen there were some that went as a group to beg help from\nthe `Minority VP'--Dan Field.  Dan talks a good game against\ndiscrimination and even pretends to speak for the black community.\nHe's a brilliant, fascinating lecturer, a perennial favorite\nwith the students.  They considered him to be the most impartial,\nopen-minded administrator they had ever known.  His feet of clay\nsurprisingly revealed when he washed his hands of the students pleas\nand sided with the administration, telling the students who\npetitioned him for help that I am a criminal.  At least the blacks\non campus weren't surprised by this.  They had long ago discovered\nhe was not only a smart cookie, he was an oreo.\n\nBut, Diana mused on gratefully, Dan was the exception.  Many pleaded\non my behalf.  Someone once said that all it takes to stop evil\nis for one good man to speak up and many good men, and women, did just that.\nThey spoke up for justice and fair play.  They argued with administration\nofficials, citing example after example of male faculty misconduct\nover the years that had gone nearly unnoticed and never punished.\n\nThey asserted that a witch hunt would hurt the Belmont image\nand reflect badly on all who worked there.  They all knew what\na farce the SmurFFs had always been and all this fuss over seven?\nSure, evaluations were used at times by administrators as justification\nfor not reappointing a faculty member, but even then, there had to be\na preponderance of negative evaluations.\n\nIt was of no avail.  The administration was adamant.  So much for wise\nsayings but the fact that some people did try was heartwarming, Diana thought.\n\nRoz broke her revere, gently.  \"It's time, Diana.\"\n\n\nWas it her imagination or was the panel friendlier this morning,\nDiana mused as she entered the room and took her seat.\nI do believe besides saying good morning, most of them smiled at me.\nMaybe things are looking up.\n\nA chastised Randy returned to the witness chair.  He looks\nridden hard and put away wet, thought Diana with amusement.\n\nResponding to a question from Annette, he avowed that,\n\"The year that Trenchant didn't teach, we rewrote the lab manual.\nWe didn't use any material from the manual written by Trenchant.\"\n\nWhen all on the panel had indicated that they had no more\nquestions to ask him, Henry asked Diana if she wished to question\nthe witness.  To himself, he added, God help us if the little\ntwerp doesn't do what he's been told.  Mark had assured him that\nhe and Lyle had a good long session with Randy and felt that\nhe had now seen the light and would behave properly.\n\n\"Yes, please.  I'm confused, Randy.  You have said that you\nsaw one evaluation that appeared to be more directed toward\none year than both years.  You answered that this was one\nof the reasons why you thought it was suspicious.\n\n\"Now these evaluations have no dates on them.  Is it\nnot possible that both are from the same year?\"\n\n\"No.\"\n\n\"How do you know that?\"\n\n\"Because I don't remember which one was from which year,\nbut these are from two separate years.\"\n\n\"Did you mark them.\"\n\n\"No.  I picked one out of each year's evaluations.\"\n\n\"But you don't know the specific year each came from?\"\n\n\"No.\"\n\nWith further questions, Diana established that from the time\nthe evaluations had been given to Randy, they had not been\nsafeguarded in any fashion.  Sometimes they were in a file cabinet,\nsometimes on a bench or table in his lab.\n\nAt least twice, they had left his possession when the secretaries\nhad called for them to use in tabulating the synopsis for the dean.\n\nIt appeared that there was some confusion as to when he took\nthe `suspicious' documents to Lyle.  \"I don't know the exact date.\nCertainly after the second year I was in the course--January or February.\"\n\n\"Lyle said it was a year later than that.  He said it was last year,\"\npressed Diana.\n\nInterrupting imperiously, Anuse jumped in to lead him with\ncareful questions in a direction away from that subject.\n\nWhen he finished, Diana summed up his testimony.  \"The `suspect'\nevaluations were not dated.   You testified that you didn't know\nwhich one came from which year.  You have no idea if all or any\nof the remaining evaluations are authentic, is this all correct?\"\n\nRandy nodded glumly.\n\nWhen Diana again referred to Lyle's testimony that Randy had\nbrought the critiques to him last year, Anuse again interrupted.\nThis time Trenchant held her ground and forcefully turned toward him saying,\n\"Excuse me.  I believe this is my time to examine this witness!\"\n\n\"Now, Randy, you have stated that none of the material in\nmy laboratory manual was used by you to create the manual you\nused last year when I was not in the course.  Do you want to\nchange that answer?\"\n\n\"No.\"\n\nThe accused held up two large manila envelopes, thick with\ntheir contents, saying, \"I have here a copy of my manual\nand the one you prepared.  Clearly marked are the parts\nin your manual that have been lifted verbatim from mine.\n\n\"In addition, I have given the references of whole paragraphs\nthat you have copied from published radiology text books\nand used without citation in your manual.\n\n\"I am prepared to offer this to the panel as evidence that\nyou are not telling the truth.\"\n\n\"This has nothing to do with the Termination For Cause\naction that this hearing is all about,\" interrupted Henry.\n\"You must keep to the subject.\"  How did I ever get into this fix,\nhe thought.  Aloud, he continued, \"Since this material does not\nbear directly on the matter at hand, it cannot be allowed\ninto evidence.  Please continue.\"\n\n\"I have no further questions.\"\n\nWhew, she gave up.  Henry wiped his brow.  That was close,\nI figured she'd keep picking at him until he blew up and spat-\ntered all over the room.  Hurriedly he said, \"You're excused,\nRandy.  Please tell Ian to come in before you leave.\"\n\nRandy shared in the relief felt by the chair of the panel.\nHe ran lightly up the stairs to the witness room.  \"You're on\nnext, Ian.\"  He was surprised when Ian fairly catapulted out of\nthe room, grabbing his arm as he passed and nearly hurled them\nboth down the stairs. \"What in hell is the damned hurry?\"\n\nSafely away from the second floor, Ian steered Randy into\nan alcove from where he could see the stairs.  \"That Mark!\nHonestly, Randy, he's been driving me crazy.  Talks a blue streak\nall the time.  Ask him the date and he'll discourse for hours on\nend before he gets to the point.  Holding any kind of a conversation\nwith him is as impossible as stopping a hurricane by shouting at it.\n\n\"I kept trying to get away.  Once, I said I had to take a piss\nand the son of a bitch came along with me, whizzing away in the next urinal,\nwithout missing a word.  I tell you, the man should be muzzled.\"\n\n\"Well, it looks as if he isn't going to follow you into the\nhearing room, Ian.  Calm down.  They're waiting for you in there.\"\n\n\"Yeah, in a minute.  Tell me first, Randy, how was it?\nAnything I should watch out for?\"\n\n\"Nada.\"  Randy had regained his usual swagger.  \"Not a thing, old bean.\nBetween us, we'll give the bitch the old one two. . .\"\n\n\"We're waiting for you, Ian.\"  Henry said from the doorway\nof the hearing room.\n\n\"Oh, right.  I'm coming right along.  Just had to get things\nstraight about who takes the review session today since I could\nbe tied up here, \" blubbered Ian, apologetically.  As he reached\nthe door, he turned and looked back up the stairs apprehensively.\nSeeing no one, he breathed a sigh of relief and entered the hearing room.\n\nIan Heathson was of average height.  His most striking features\nwere his mop of blond hair and pale blue eyes which flitted about,\nexamining the room, looking everywhere except at Diana.\n\nWhen asked to substantiate the testimony of Lyle that he and Randy\nhad found `suspicious' SmurFFs, Ian told a slightly different story.\n\nHe hadn't found any himself.  Randy had found them.  \"He showed\nthem to me and I was flabbergasted.  I had no reason to suspect\nthat something like that would happen.\"\n\nHaving said that, he reversed course and said, \"I always thought\nthere was some kind of manipulative action going on with the students,\nbecause we used to get critiques that were totally inconsistent\nwith what we were doing in the course.  So we always felt there\nwas something going on.\"\n\nWhen Henry asked what he did next, he stated that Randy had\nbrought the `suspect' SmurFFs to Lyle and, \"indicated our concern.\"\n\nGiven the packet of SmurFFs that had been sent to the\ndocument examiners and asked to identify them as the ones found,\nhe said, \"I can't remember, I didn't memorize them.\"\n\nWhen asked how he got along with Diana, he admitted that,\n\"they got along fine until the year Randy. . .\"  Stopping\nabruptly. . . \"Well, I noticed problems all along.\"\n\nEsther, who had apparently read the complete set of student\nevaluations for the years in question, entered as evidence\nby Diana, suggested that his evaluations had become more positive\neach year before Randy came into the course.\n\nHe professed to not knowing for sure, but thought, \"The first year\nI taught was not good, the second year, considerably better\nand the third, a hair better, not much.\n\n\"The fourth year, well. . .\"\n\nEasy now, Ian, thought Henry, that was the year that Randy\nstarted teaching.\n\nAs if he had heard Henry's silent coaching, Ian testified\nas if his life depended upon it--his professional life did.\nHe told a long heart-wrenching tale of the terrible student\nevaluations he received in the radiology course.  He had very nearly\nnot been reappointed a couple of times but Lyle had fought for him.\n\nOver and over again, at every opportunity, he came back to\nthe years of deleterious critiques passed in by the students.\nObviously, this had to be because Trenchant manipulated the students.\n\n\"Some of the things commonly written on the critiques were,\n`Why isn't she lecturing?' `Course is totally disorganized'\nand this is wrong because I am not a disorganized individual;\nthe course is very well organized.\"\n\n\"Did you ever have her lecture to see what the students'\nreaction would be?\" asked Jane.\n\n\"We'd talked about it,\" he replied.\n\nIan continued, \"Along with the many comments to have her lecture,\nthe students wrote how she was the only one who knew anything about\nradiology and that Randy and I should get out of the course\nand let her teach it.  As I looked through the SmurFFs\nthese comments just jumped out at me.  When I was a student,\nI never wrote such things about my professors.\"\n\nThere was, however, a change in the critiques the year the accused\nwas not teaching the course.  \"A complete flip-flop, Ian asserted.\n\"The students liked the course and the people who taught it.\"\n\nHenry ducked his head and smiled grimly thinking that these\n`flip-flop' SmurFFs would damn well not be seen by the panel,\nI'll see to that.  Ian is really stretching the truth here since\nthose SmurFFs he's talking about are more flop than flip.  True,\nthe students didn't lambaste Ian and Randy that year as they\nhad in the past, however, in a way, they were just as bad.\nNearly every critique carried the name of the student and the date.\nThe few comments they contained were bland almost to the point\nof being insulting.  Most of them contained no comments, as the\nstudent just checked off the `average' number for each category\nunder evaluation.  Those that contained comments were all typed.\nWell, if the panel or Diana asked to see them he would simply say\nthat they had no bearing on the issue.\n\nHenry returned from his reverie just as Ian was saying\n\". . .there were even some SmurFFs submitted by the students\nfor Diana, which I couldn't figure out why since she wasn't\neven teaching the course this year.\"\n\nIan carefully did not mentioned how this year, as Lyle had\ndirected, he had begged and implored the students to write\nfavorable reviews on their evaluation forms since his job\ndepended on it. . .\n\n\nIt was time to do course evaluations again.  A great many\nof the radiology students were unhappy that they had been told\nto avoid contact with Diana who had helped them a great deal\nduring the past few months.  They were told she was accused of\ndoing some terrible thing but that it would be forgotten and\nforgiven if they as a class returned positive critiques for the course.\n\nThey also heard Ian's sad tale of imminent loss of job\nand how he had just bought a new home ad nauseam.\n\nThe class officers discussed the situation and offered the following\nadvice to their classmates at a hastily called meeting just prior to exams.\n\n\"Don't write your radiology critique out of anger, even if\nyou feel angry.  We don't want to cause her any more problems.\n\n\"Write anything positive you can think of and leave it at that.\nIan has tried hard and none of us want to hurt him.  Also, use\na typewriter and keep a copy.  None of us wants to hear Randy\nfabricate results to his advantage.\n\n\"As most of you have heard, no medical student will be allowed\nto testify for her, or for that matter, even attend the hearing.\nSince many of you have indicated you want to do something,\njust remember that we've been officially told to cool it.\nThe reality is that our future could depend on not rocking\nthe boat too much.\n\n\"Peter is starting a collection to be given to her anonymously.\nAt this point, it's all we can do.  I'm sure she has additional\nexpenses because of all this.  I wish we could tell you this is fair\nand courageous.  We can't.  She is going down the drain, but it won't\nhelp if we go down with her.\"\n\nSusan Anders stood up.  \"I hear what you're saying and agree\nfor the most part.  However, as one individual, I just had to\ndo something--this is such a vicious attack on her.  I have\nwritten and mailed a letter to the Pope which I signed and am\nsolely responsible for.  In other words, none of you\nare involved if there is any reprisal because of it.\nIn it, I expressed my displeasure and labeled the\nprosecution of Diana an administrative gang bang.\"\n\nThe class applauded.\n\n\n\n\nChapter 15\n\n\nNow it was Diana's turn to ask questions of Ian.\n\n\"You told us that when you examined your SmurFF critiques\nthat some just `jumped out at you'.  It would seem that had it\nbeen up to you, quite a few SmurFFs would have been sent away\nfor analysis.\"\n\n\"No.  All kinds of things were written that made me think that\nsomething was wrong.  I couldn't understand it but I didn't\ngo back through the old critiques and try to pick them out.\"\n\n\"But Randy did.  Is that correct?\"\n\n\"Yes.  He told me he had found three SmurFFs among the\nradiology critiques that he thought were in your handwriting.\"\nSuddenly going from sober to smirk, Ian finished slyly,\n\"and he was right.\"\n\nIgnoring the obvious baiting attempt, Diana continued.\n\"When you were referring to the critiques that jumped out at you,\nI take it you meant all the SmurFFs--not just the ones in\nevidence called `suspicious' critiques?\"  She indicated\nthe folders containing the material that had been sent to the\ndocument examiners.\n\n\"I mean the actual student critiques.  They basically have the\nsame kind of comments as those,\" replied Ian pointing to the folders.\n\n\"Then you don't agree that the reason these `suspicious'\ncritiques stood out was because they were so different?\nIsn't that the reason you took them to Lyle?\"\n\n\"Randy did that.  I didn't go through all of them as he did,\nbut he showed me the ones he picked out and they were pretty much\nthe same as all the others--basically not good.\"\n\n\"Now which one of these critiques, these in the packet B,\nare you saying were very detrimental and personally injurious\nand caused you undue harm.?\"\n\n\"I haven't read them.  I'm talking about all the critiques in general.\"\n\n\"Then you are alleging that I wrote all the critiques?\"\n\n\"No.  A psychologist would find that a person would have to have\nmental problems to sit down and write all the critiques like that.\nWhat I'm saying is there is other evidence, probably intangible,\nthat a seed was planted in a student's mind, and that seed was\nportrayed in some of the comments that they wrote on their own.\"\n\nStill trying to get the question answered, Diana asked again,\nthis time reading from the memo from the dean.  \"The dean wrote\nthat I am, quote, `accused of creating fictitious student critiques\nwhich were very detrimental and personally injurious to two junior\nfaculty members' unquote.\n\n\"So I am asking again, which one of these have you selected to . . .\"\n\nOh, oh, Ian's in trouble thought Henry interrupting quickly with,\n\"Have you seen this memo, Ian?\"\n\n\"No.\"\n\nThe chair handed a copy of the memo and the packet of `suspicious'\ncritiques to Ian saying, \"He has not seen the memorandum you are\nreferring to.\"  To himself, he said, come on Ian, get it together.\nThis is dangerous ground.\n\nIan read the memo and then looked at the critiques.  \"Well,\nthere are things in here. . .Randy's and my teaching effectiveness\ndown to 2 and yours up at 5.  A comment that you are an\nexcellent lecturer.  This one has to do with sexism. . .\nI don't know about that.\n\n\"Now I haven't gone through these.  These are things that\nRandy found, things he pulled out and brought to my attention.\"\n\n\"When was this?\" queried Diana\n\n\"Oh, I can't recall the exact date.\"\n\n\"According to this memo that you say you haven't seen, Lyle has written\nthat during the early part of last fall, you came to him with two critiques--\nnow, I assume he means three--does that. . .\"\n\n\"That sounds reasonable, but I don't remember exactly what month it was.\"\n\n\"Was it before or after the problems that you had with publishers\nregarding copyright infractions in the radiology course. . .\nthe year I was not in it?\"\n\nHenry felt as of he had been punched in the stomach and the gasp\nof surprise escaping from his lips was audible to everyone in the room.\nBefore any of the panel could react, Trenchant held up her hand\nin a gesture universally representing STOP.  \"Let him answer the question,\"\nshe insisted.\n\nMy God, the bitch has pinned him and I can't think what to\ndo to stop this.  Come on, Ian, deny knowing anything about what\nshe's asking.  Think what you're saying.  Henry started to sweat.\n\nIan seemed oblivious to the tense atmosphere.  \"Before or after?\nJeez, I don't remember.\"\n\n\"Was it right around that time, perhaps?\"\n\n\"I really don't remember.  The copyright infractions happened last fall--\nactually during the first week of classes.  So I don't remember for sure,\nbut I think Randy came to me after that with these SmurFFs.\"\n\nGood lord, the asshole is admitting to plagiarism.  Henry found\nhis tongue finally.  \"The reason we are here has to do with these\n`suspect' evaluations and irrelevant matter should be left out,\"\nhe protested with a warning look at Ian.\n\nInteresting, thought Diana.  It's OK to bring in anything\nthat is derogatory or even believed to be derogatory about me\nand my casting spells on the students, but anything about their\nadmitted dishonesty is verboten.  Beam me up, Scotty. . .\n\nShe turned her attention back to Ian.  \"Just a few more questions.\nYou have said that Randy picked these evaluations out, and I see\nno date on them.  Do you have any idea of the year they refer to?\"\n\n\"I assume that they were the SmurFFs that he had received recently.\nBut I'm not sure.  We just keep them all in one pile.\"\n\n\"Now, usually after the students have handed in their SmurFFs\nis it not correct that you are given yours and the course critiques\nand you keep them unless Lyle wants the secretaries to summarize\nthem for the dean?\"\n\n\"Right.\"\n\n\"That is all I need to ask.  Thank you.\"\n\nThere was a short break while Henry dismissed Ian and called\nthe panel into a whispering huddle with him.  Looking up,\nhe addressed Janet and Diana, almost as an afterthought.\n\"You need not leave the room, we will be finished in a few minutes.\"\n\nI've got to set these people straight after what has just gone down,\nhe thought.  We're calling her next and they have to be warned\nnot to pursue red herrings.\n\n\n\n\nChapter 16\n\n\nAfter the formalities of swearing in were completed, the `suspect'\nevaluations were identified as being contained in packets called\nexhibit 3 and 4 by the chair and Diana was asked if she wrote them.\n\nFollowing her denial, Henry asked her why `they' would suggest\nthat she had.  She answered that she had no idea.  Damn her,\nthought Henry.  She won't rise to the bait.\n\nNext, the chair turned to exhibit 5, which he identified as\nsome of the standards used by the document examiners.\nApparently, he had heard and taken note when Trenchant had made\na point of the fact that the so-called standards were copies.\n\n\"One is an original, here on top--the rest are copies.\"\nThen he continued, obliquely, asking, \"have you seen these before?\"\n\n\"Since these exhibits were passed around and discussed yesterday,\"\nTrenchant answered, \"I have seen something that appears like this.\n\n\"If you are asking if I wrote them, the answer is that I\ncouldn't say.  The one original in the packet looks like my\nsignature but there is no date on it.  I don't know when it was\nwritten and do not recall writing it.\n\n\"These others show dates of a long time ago.  We're in the\nlate eighties now and these are dated '61, '69. . .\"\n\n\"We have some dated more current that the document examiners used.\nI can send over to Mark's office for them.\"\n\n\"Oh, you have additional evidence that I was not given before the hearing?\nIs that correct?\"\n\n\"No.  Well, I mean no one has looked at it.  No one on this\ncommittee either.  This was handled between Mark and the document\nexaminers.  I will call Mark right now and have him bring them over.\"\n\nHenry left the hearing room and headed up the stairs to the witness\nwaiting room where Mark was standing by for just such emergencies.\nYou'd think we were the ones on trial, he grumbled to himself.\nWhy does she persist in this inane manner when I've got everything\nso well planned out?  \"Mark, Trenchant's called us on the remaining\nstandards that you sent but that we decided not to include in the\nmaterial we gave her.  Please go and get them and bring them to\nthe hearing room as soon as possible.\"\n\nAs the men descended the stairs, Mark to leave and Henry to return\nto the hearing, Mark asked, \"how did she find out about them, Henry?\"\n\n\"She was making such a fuss about all the standards having dates\nso far back that she couldn't identify them and the panel\napparently thinks this is a valid reason why she won't identify them.\nI had to say the document examiners had more recent samples\nof her handwriting or. . .\"  Henry broke off quickly as Helen\ncame out of the room used by Diana's witnesses at the foot of the stairs.\n\n\"Hi, guys,\" greeted Helen placidly.  \"How's it going?  Are you on a break?\"\n\nSpare me these emancipated females, thought Henry as he angrily ignored her,\nwaived goodbye to Mark and reentered the hearing room.\n\nCongenial old Mark, badly in need of a conversation fix\nafter Ian had left, approached Helen with a wide smile.\n\"No,\" he said to her, \"Henry just had to step out for a minute\nso he could tell me something he needed me to get for him.\n\n\"I'm on the way over to the admin building right now.  You must\nbe one of the witness for Diana.  Sure hope this isn't too traumatic\nfor you all.  It really is a terrible thing to have happen at Belmont\nand I'm sure that as much as you all must like Diana and want to help her\nthat as soon as you understand the preponderance of evidence against her,\nyou'll decide. . .\"  Strange woman, he thought, as Helen went back into\nthe waiting room and firmly closed the door.  Oh well, I might as well\ngo over and get that stuff for Henry.\n\nInside the hearing room, Henry had ruled that they would go ahead\nfor now and introduce the material when it was brought over.\n\nContinuing her challenge, Diana said, \"I repeat again, this\nis evidence, this is material that was sent to the document\nexaminers that I have not seen.  Is that correct?  Even though\nyou and Lyle have both assured me that I was given all the evidence?\"\n\n\"Well, that only meant that you had all the material sent at that time.\nThis is additional information that the document examiners brought with them.\"\n\n\"Material that I was not privy to and had no opportunity to question\nthe document examiners on!  I consider this most unfair.\"\n\nAnuse smirked.\n\n\"Well,\" Henry replied, \"you will see it presently so that's\nall right.  The committee may now ask additional questions.\"\n\nEsther wanted to know what was going on in the department.\n\"We have heard from Lyle, Ian and Randy.  What is your perception?\"\n\nDamn the woman, fumed Henry.  I purposely warned her against asking\nthat kind of question.  He turned his full attention on Diana's answer.\n\n\"I will confirm first that there were problems.  When I was\nin the course, I objected to using published material without\npermission from the publisher and credit to the author.\n\n\"I also refused to allow them to use the manual I had\nwritten and copyrighted, which they wanted to present to\nthe students as their own after they had added to it.\n\n\"I was ordered to do this by Lyle and when I refused,\nI was threatened with a lawsuit and then told that\nthey would take what they wanted anyway.\n\n\"When I first wrote the manual, I offered it free of charge\nto Ian for the course.  He was delighted and most grateful\nthat I had undertaken the project.  The manual was well accepted\nby the students and was used in the course for two years.\n\n\"I had no objection to it being used the next year--\nthe year I was not in the course.  But, I would not\nallow them to revise it or steal it.\"\n\nDiana Trenchant went on to explain that her manual was strictly\nconcerned with basic radiology information; information that would\nprepare students for the more demanding courses in radiology therapy\nthat they would encounter the next year.\n\n\"One year, I audited those courses so that when I wrote the manual,\nI could make sure that students would be well prepared for them.\n\n\"There was never any question that I supported the presentation of\nexperimental material in addition to the basics contained in the manual.\nActually what they proposed adding to the course was not new.  We have\nbeen doing this for several years, before Randy came to NERD,\nusing legitimate reference material obtained from publishers.\"\n\n\"Was there any connection between all this and the\nalleged fictitious SmurFFs?\" pursued Esther.\n\n\"It does seem rather strange to me that they suddenly\nappeared at the time Ian and Randy were facing copyright\ninfringement charges--according to Ian's testimony.\n\nDiana continued by telling the committee that there had been\nno problems until Randy had come into the course.  When she\nworked with Ian, things went fine.  They conferred and cooperated\nwith each other.  Ian's evaluations gradually got better.\n\n\"After Randy came in, I was left out of the loop.  He, Ian and Lyle\nmade decisions and I was not informed.  For example, two years ago,\nRandy was made co-director of the course with Ian. I was not told about it.\"\n\nThe door to the hearing room opened and Mark's head floated through\nthe opening.  Ah good, thought Henry, just the kind of distraction\nI need to stop this line of questioning.  \"We will now introduce\nthis material,\" he said as he got up to take the large brown envelope\nMark produced in the doorway.  \"The dates on these documents,\nused as standards by the document examiners, are more recent.\"\nSmugly, he handed copies of these documents to each of the\npanel members and then to Diana, keeping one set for himself.\n\n\"These documents appear to be copies from personnel files,\"\nobserved Diana, looking at the chair for confirmation.\n\n\"Yes,\" Henry confirmed.  \"They were taken from your personnel file\nand sent by the university attorney to use as standards.\"\n\n\"Then I would like to see the release I signed so that this\nmaterial could be removed from my file,\" demanded Trenchant.\n\n\"Release?  No release was necessary,\" Henry looked puzzled\nand frowned with annoyance.\n\n\"Mr. Chairman, you have made note several times that\nthis termination hearing is justified by a certain paragraph\nin the faculty handbook,\"  Diana replied firmly.  \"In that\nsame handbook, there is a paragraph stating that no material shall\nbe removed from a faculty person's file without the permission of\nthat person.  If you have a handbook here, I will find the exact\nwording and read it to you.\"\n\n\"Oh, I know what you are referring to and that does not\napply in this case,\" Henry ruled quickly and then turned\nto the panel and said, \"We must get on with it.  Are these\nyour handwriting?\"\n\n\"I don't know.  These are copies.  Copies are suspicious.\"\n\nAnuse interjected demanding to know why.\n\nDiana explained to him that she had done a great deal of research,\nsince she had first been charged, into document examination.\nAccomplished document examiners insist on original, authentic standards.\nExcept for a couple, all of these so-called standards are copies.\nIn addition, as you will recall from her answer to the questions\nI asked her, the examiner you engaged admitted that she did not know\nof her own knowledge that I had written the standards she used.\n\n\"A competent examiner would have the person in question write\nthe standards in his or her presence.  That way the analyst\nis unbiased, and can swear that the standards are authentic.\n\n\"I also learned that one should never identify copies as\none's writing because copies may be altered and recopied so the\nalterations do not show.\"\n\n\"Now these came from the administration and you certainly\ncan't think that any alteration went on,\" scoffed Anuse.\n\n\"I certainly can think it's possible.  Just as I know it's\npossible to forge handwriting so even the experts cannot tell.\"\n\n\"No, that is incorrect.  The analysts testified that\nshe could tell forgeries.\"\n\n\"She also testified that I had written these `suspect'\nevaluations but admitted that she had not authenticated\nthe standards used nor insisted on original standards.\n\n\"As far as believing that tampering could be done, I remind\nyou that one of these `suspect' documents was tampered with\nand Lyle admitted doing it.\"\n\n\"What!\"  blurted Henry, \"what. . .\"\n\n\"This one here.\"  The accused held up the evaluation that\nhad a three word printed comment on the course.  Stapled to it\nwas a note reading, `Lyle, have a happy Christmas, Diana'.\n\n\"This was given the document examiners as `suspect' evaluation #6,\nyet clearly Lyle knew that he had prejudiced it by putting six\nadditional words on it that he knew I had written.  This is\noriginal   writing on Christmas paper and not part of this evaluation,\nyet from the report the examiners made, it was treated as part of a\n`suspect' document.\"\n\nHenry quickly told Janet that she could stop taking notes\nwhile the committee huddled off the record.  Feverishly, he\nopened the analyst report and scanned the relevant paragraph.\nAfter a few moments, Henry and Frank Anuse exchanged glances.\nAnuse nodded and Henry told Janet they were back on record.\nImmediately, Anuse sarcastically claimed that he didn't under\nstand what all the fuss was about.  He could see no tampering.\n\nTrenchant explained again.  \"It is obvious.  A known standard\nis affixed to an unknown document.  It is made a part of that\nunknown document.\"\n\nAnuse seemed to deliberately misunderstand.  He continued\nthis over and over, taking different tacks but essentially\nhe was bent on wearing Diana down.\n\nCareful, thought Henry.  A court would say Anuse was\nbadgering the witness.  Henry knew this was not proper\nquestioning, it was arguing, but he let it continue.\n\n\"Oh,\" Anuse would say in an annoying, baiting way, \"it was not\naltered since Lyle had stapled it there so it wouldn't get lost.\"\nand \"I don't understand where you have a problem with this.\"\n\nAfter several minutes of this, he dismissed the whole complaint.\nScathingly, he said that it didn't matter since the whole document\nhad been written by Trenchant anyway.  The document analyst had said so.\n\n\"Yes they had,\" Diana agreed.  \"Despite the fact that there\nwere three PRINTED words on the SmurFF.  The WRITING they\nidentified was only on the slip of paper that Lyle had attached.\n\nThe panel was silent.  Trenchant addressed them.  \"When I was\nfirst charged with writing these critiques, I spoke to a few\nprofessional document examiners.  Right off, I discovered that\nI could not afford to hire one to do an unbiased analysis.\nHowever, they usually were willing to answer general questions\non the phone for a small consulting fee.\n\n\"In talking with them and reading the material they suggested to me,\nI came away with some interesting information.  None that I talked to\nfelt they were infallible or claimed that handwriting was as unique\nas fingerprints, but they enjoyed the benefits of that illusion.\n\n\"Both tape recordings and polygraph (lie detector) evidence\nis not allowed in courts.  The so-called expert testimony of\ndoctors, psychiatrists, as well as various technical expertise\nsuch as fingerprint and document analysis is.  Deus ex machina\nis evidently not looked highly upon by judges, possibly because\nthey allow no other gods before them in their courtrooms.\n\n\"Court certification of a document examiner means that the\ncourt has accepted their training and experience.  This is seldom\nchecked and is fairly loosely defined by the profession itself.\nIt does not indicate a perfect batting average for the examiner.\n\n\"Most analysts that I contacted said that if they were hired\nin this case, they would want to examine all of the critiques--\nnot just the handful picked out by NERD.  There is always the chance\nof there being another individual with similar handwriting\nin that many samples.\n\n\"They admitted there were people capable of forging the handwriting\nof another person.  They directed me to check out the literature\non the Hitler Diaries and the more recent White Salamander Papers.\nWhat these two cases had in common was that the best, most expert\ndocument examiners in the world were fooled.  Because these were\nsensational cases, they were highly publicized.  Most forgeries\nget little or no attention from the media but the fact remains\nthat a good forger can fool highly qualified document examiners.\n\n\"Oh, yes.  There is one more thing I want to question here\nsince most of the documents you have listed as so-called standards\nare copies.  These copies are mostly memos addressed to people\nin the department.  If they are authentic, why aren't they originals?\nIf I had written and sent those, it would have been the originals--\nif I'd made a copy it would have been kept for my files.\"\n\nMy God, Henry screamed to himself, why do I let her go on\nwith this?  Well, of course, it's because those women are\nlistening and look interested so I don't dare cut her own\ntestimony off too often.  They were not happy with the way Frank\nwas badgering her and I didn't want to alienate them any further.\nAloud, he said, \"Does the panel have any more questions?\"\nGetting no response, the chair called a short recess.\n\n\nWhen Diana entered the waiting room, her witnesses gathered around,\nfull of support and questions.  \"All in all, it went pretty well,\"\nshe told them.  \"The real victory was getting out of there without\nthrottling Frank Anuse.  He asks question after question always\ndiscounting your answer.  He doesn't come right out and say\nyou're lying but it is implied in his manner.\n\n\"The rest of the panel aren't bad.  Esther gets a little mixed up\nin what she wants to say at times and is a bit hard to understand,\nbut she appears to be trying to be fair.  I think the other two\nwomen on the panel are more sympathetic toward me now.\n\n\"It isn't much fun, but you shouldn't be in there very long,\nso that's some compensation.\"\n\n\"They were at you for a long time,\" Sarah's voice quavered\never so slightly.\n\n\"Yes, but I'm their designated criminal.  I really don't think\nthey will treat you badly, but if they do, get up and walk out.\nI mean that, it goes for all of you,\" Trenchant said firmly.\n\n\"There's the summons.  Go in there and give 'em hell, Andrea.\nIt's party time,\"  said Helen, patting them both on the back\nas they left for the hearing room.\n\n\n\n\nChapter 17\n\n\nAndrea Stern was barely sworn when Esther demanded,\n\"are you a medical student?\"\n\nThen, suddenly realizing that she had spoken out of turn\nsince it was Diana's prerogative to question her witnesses first,\nshe apologized.\n\nTrenchant immediately asked Andrea to give her name and\noccupation for the record.  Replying to further questions,\nAndrea testified that she had known Diana for many years\nand had rented a room in her house for six of them.\nShe attested to the overall integrity of Trenchant.\nBoldly, mincing no words, she fixed the panel with\na friendly smile and continued.\n\n\"I think these charges are ludicrous, for two reasons.\nOne is that when Diana Trenchant has a problem with someone,\nshe marches right up and tells them.  She is very forthright\nand would not do anything devious or underhanded.  The second reason\nis that she has always had a high opinion of academic honesty.\"\n\nA young woman of exceptional intelligence and ability,\nAndrea had graduated from Belmont, summa cum laude,\nwith a BA, after completion of a double, self-designed major.\nBecause of her great love and knowledge of books, she found\nemployment in the library where she soon became indispensable.\nThere were those at Belmont who recognized and revered\nexceptional ability and were not threatened by it.\n\nOn being questioned as to what she knew about work conditions in NERD,\nshe observed that from what she had heard from Diana, it wasn't a very\nhappy place to work.  Directing her answer toward Trenchant, she divulged,\n\"You were not my only source for this information.  My aunt works in the\ndepartment and I heard from both of you enough to form that impression.\n\n\"Just last month, my aunt told me that you may have been given\nan excessive course load in an attempt to break your spirit\nor drive you out of the department, much in the same way that\nshe was given a very minimum salary increase, in an attempt\nto get her to move on.\"\n\nAndrea continued by confirming that the laboratory manual that\nhad been used in the course for two years was indeed written by Diana\nin her own home, with her own equipment and on her own time.\nShe, Andrea, had witnessed this and had helped with the proof reading.\n\nFeigning a bored expression that he did not feel, Henry asked\nif she had any evidence specific to the critiques in question.\n\n\"No, nothing specific, except if she were out to discredit\nsomeone on the faculty, she would certainly have brains\nenough to do something effective--not play with SmurFFs,\"\nAndrea delivered, with a chuckle.  Then she continued in a serious,\nalmost censoring tone, \"I'm surprised that you actually take this\ncharge seriously.  You should have better sense.  The whole campus\nis laughing at you.\"\n\nAs Henry seemed on the verge of apoplexy, Anuse quickly\nasked who her aunt was.\n\nAndrea looked directly at him and answered, \"Dr. Biggot.\nShe teaches nutrition to the freshman medical students.\"\n\nEsther wanted to be clear.  \"Your aunt confirmed in both cases,\nhers and Trenchant, that this was an underlying way of getting rid of them.\"\n\n\"Exactly.  She felt that they were not welcome in the department\nand that this was a way to encourage them to move on.\"\n\n\"Now, we'll have no more of this,\" Henry interjected,\n\"we really can't take second hand information here.\nI have already warned you people on the panel about this.\"\n\n\"All I did was have her repeat what she'd said already,\"\nEsther squeaked, \"I didn't ask the question.\"\n\nHenry was not pacified by her remark.  More information\npositive toward Trenchant was being presented then he was\nwilling to hear--or then he wanted the panel to hear.\nHe turned to Trenchant and said harshly, \"your witnesses must\naddress the charge here.  Since this witness does not have any\ninformation directly relating to that charge, she is excused.\"\n\nAndrea glanced at Diana who nodded, then smiling brightly,\nshe thanked the panel for listening and left the room.\n\n\"Eventually, I will call witness that will speak directly\nto the charge you refer to.  Right now, since you have allowed\nmassive testimony against me that had nothing to do with\nthe specific charge you keep referring to, I mean to respond\nto all of those allegations.\n\n\"You wrote me a letter which I have here, saying that\nthe hearing would not be conducted with strict rules.\nYou stated that I could present anything that I deemed important\nand that is what I am doing.  And, in a much briefer manner\nthan you have presented the evidence against me.  I'll remind you\nthat you allowed plenty of hearsay testimony when your witnesses\nwere testifying.\"\n\nHenry let out an exasperated breath, turned toward the panel\nand said, \"I think we'd better break for lunch and discuss how\nmuch of this irrelevant material we are prepared to listen to.\nWe also will have to consider having Ann Biggot testify and bring\nLyle back.  We cannot let these unsubstantiated charges stand.\"\n\nAt the word lunch, the stenographer packed up her gear with\nalacrity and headed out the door closely followed by Trenchant.\nNo words were exchanged this time, just a mutual groan of relief\nat their escape.\n\n\n\n\nChapter 18\n\n\nLunch was again catered to the upstairs witnesses' waiting room.\nA rather pensive panel gathered around the table to help themselves\nto sandwiches, fruit, cookies and a beverage.\n\nHenry had the floor and continued to speak while they were\ngetting their food.  \"There is a limit as to how much\nof this insignificant twaddle we should allow.\"\n\n\"I agree,\" Frank Anuse said, firmly.  \"We should tell her that we will\nhear no more testimony from these witnesses of hers unless it bears\non the specific charge--she did write and submit those evaluations.\nThe document examiner was certain of it.\"\n\n\"Well, I don't agree,\"  Jane spoke sharply.  \"I, for one,\ndidn't find that document examiner particularly convincing.\"\n\n\"How can you say that?\"  Anuse blurted.  \"She had impeccable credentials.\nShe's allowed to testify in court.  Never been refused, she said.\nMark told us that handwriting is as exact and individual as fingerprints.\"\n\n\"I'm not convinced,\" returned Jane.  \"She had no independently researched\ndata on her success vs failure ratio.  You heard her say, `in her opinion,'\nshe was 100% correct.  Bull. Nobody's perfect.\"\n\nGlancing at the two other women, Henry observed them nodding\ntheir heads in agreement.  Trenchant had made some other good\npoints, he thought.  She picked up on the lack of original\nstandards and cited that rule in the faculty handbook that\nforbade an individual's personnel file from being revealed to\nothers without the individual's permission.  Damn the woman.\nThis hearing was supposed to be a lead pipe cinch and all it had\nbeen so far was trouble.  I'd better call for Mark to come over\nand talk to them.  Perhaps even have him testify.  Mark could say\nthe right things to bring the women around. . .if only he didn't\nbore them to distraction first.\n\nAs he walked toward the phone, he couldn't help but feel\na bit chagrined that his own letter had been read back\nto him--the one he'd sent Trenchant outlining the rules\nfor the hearing.  He had meant for it to be intimidating.\nDidn't think she'd find anyone who'd dare to testify.\n\nDownstairs, Diana and her witnesses were lolling about in comfort,\neating and drinking the results of a MacDonald's run that Roz and Helen\nhad made.\n\nShe had been telling them about Lyle's testimony when James\nsuddenly jumped to his feet crying, \"say again!\"\n\nRepeating herself, Diana asked, \"What's the problem.\"\n\n\"No problem.  You said he testified that the new evaluation\nforms were sent up from the dean's office on the tenth of\nDecember last year, right?  And he found the `suspect'\nevaluations sometime during that same week?\"\n\n\"That's what he said.  What is it, James?  You look so excited!\"\n\n\" Don't you remember?  Don't you remember what happened to you\nThanksgiving Day last year--the injury to your wrist, your right wrist?\nYou weren't writing anything until a couple of days before Christmas\nand even then it was painful for you.  You were wearing that wrist support\nall the time for well over a month.\"\n\n\"My God, I had forgotten that.  Are you sure of the dates?\nI just remember the December labs were hell because I couldn't\ndo the boards.\"\n\n\"Absolutely.  I remember coming back from spending Thanksgiving\nat home and you were soaking your wrist which was all swollen up\nand remember, you wore that brace and couldn't write and. . .\"\n\n\"I remember the wrist brace,\" cried Jennifer.  \"You had me\nwrite things on the board for you at my lab because you couldn't.\"\n\n\"Me too,\" chimed in Roz.\n\n\"James, Jennifer, Roz, will you tell that to the panel\nin addition to what you already plan to testify to?\"\n\n\"Sure, no problem.\"\n\n\"Betcherass!\"\n\n\"That will really give this charge against you the deep six\nalong with Sarah's testimony,\"  Roz said excitedly as the whole\nbunch of happy people left their food and joined each other\nin a wild victory dance.  Premature for sure, but the powerless\nand the innocent naively take their joy where they can find it.\n\nWhen the hearing commenced again, the panel appeared subdued,\nand listlessly turned over pages of notes as Henry told Diana\nto call her next witness and cautioned her that, \"they should\nbe addressing the specific charge here.\"\n\n\"Just a moment,\" Jane demanded.  \"Before we have the next witness,\nI'd like to ask you a question, Diana.  You said earlier that you were\nnot free to call witnesses from your department.  Why?\"\n\nTrenchant, who was on her way to the door to get her next witness,\npaused and said, \"They asked me not to.  They felt it would be impossible\nfor them to testify since they most probably would contradict their chairman.\"\n\n\"You are saying they are afraid to testify?\"\n\n\"That's correct.  Just like you saw Jean was.  Her knowledge\nand belief in me was the only thing that made it possible\nfor her to overcome her fear of losing her position.\n\n\"It is much worse for people in my department and for that matter\nfor medical students who have not been allowed to testify.\nThings can be made very difficult for them.\"\n\nEsther pursued, \"Are you stating that Lyle has discussed\nthis case with the department?\"\n\n\"Oh, yes. Very definitely.  After he accused me, he went in\nto Ann Biggot's office and told her.  My job was offered\nto two people in the department around the same time.\nLyle has told others besides me that this hearing is only a formality.\nRemember, he's the one that decides the raises.\"\n\n\"What sort of thing could people in your department testify about?\"\n\n\"They could substantiate what I have said about the negligent,\ncareless way the evaluation process is carried out and how little\nimport is placed on it.  They could confirm that the evaluations\nwere often laying around on someone's desk or in the secretaries' office.\n\n\"They could explain that the evaluations got mixed together\nfrom year to year and unless one happened to be dated,\nthere was no way to separate one year from the next.\"\n\n\"They could tell you the reason for the problems that occurred\nin the radiology course and affirm that my manual was plagiarized.\n\n\"Being right there where the business of the department is\ncarried out, they could tell you that one of Lyle's first acts\nwhen he came into the department six years ago was to eliminate\nmy position.  When I protested this act of discrimination to the\nAttorney General's Office and they brought charges, he claimed\nthat he had only told me that he would keep me if he had the funds. . .\"\n\n\"You are saying. . .you are painting a picture of suspicion and\nallegation that are hearsay and unsubstantiated,\" Anuse interrupted,\nbald pate aflame with anger.\n\n\"Correct.  And we've heard tons of unsubstantiated hearsay\nin testimony from previous witnesses.\"\n\n\"That doesn't matter.  We are only interested in these documents,\nnothing else.  Those are side issues and not a part of this investigation.\"\n\n\"They most certainly are a part of it.  If what you say is true,\nthe dean would have just written one sentence in his letter.\nHe would have written, `I want her out of here because. . . .'\nInstead, he wrote two pages filled with unsubstantiated hearsay\nand charges of insubordination and dishonesty based on Lyle's\naccusation and I want to answer them!\"\n\n\"Nonsense, the charges are clear.  You forged seven SmurFFs.\nThe rest was only a chronology of the events.\"\n\n\"But the chronology is untrue and biased.\"\n\n\"No.  Everything is based on the testimony of the handwriting witness,\nwe just filter through the rest of the material.\"  Anuse turned to the chair,\na bored look on his face.  \"We waste time with this useless trivia.\"\nHe had just spent the last few minutes in full sneer, trying his best\nto beat Trenchant to her knees with the sheer force of his position\nof power.  Forced to desist by the negative vibes he was getting\nfrom most of the panel, he took refuge in assuming the victor's pose.\n\n\"The panel asked the question, `why didn't I have witnesses from\nthe department.'  I merely answered it,\" retorted Trenchant, pugnaciously.\n\n\"Call your next witness.\"  Henry fairly bellowed as he tried\nfor the last word.\n\n\"I shall, but first I want to point out that the charges against me\ncontain the words taken from the faculty handbook, `serious breaches\nof generally accepted moral standards in the profession. . .'\n\n\"I submit to you that the copyright infringements committed by Ian and\nRandy were also serious breaches of generally accepted moral standard\nin the profession and Chairman Lyle Stone condoned them.\n\n\"Now I'll get my next witness.\"  said Diana, heading once again for the door.\n\nJames Prouty walked into the hearing room and looked around.\n\"Take that seat there, please.\" Henry motioned toward the seat\nopposite the panel.\n\n\"Oh,\" said James, in a surprised tone of voice.  \"I understood from someone\nwho had testified earlier that the witnesses sat across from Diana.\"\n\n\"Well. . .\" the chair cleared his throat and looked uncomfortable.\n\"Things get shifted around, you know.  Sit right there and be sworn in.\"\n\nThat James, thought Diana, barely stifling her laughter,\ntrust him to say something disconcerting.  He knew darn well\nthat there was a different seating arrangement for the two sets\nof witnesses because she had told him about it.\n\nUnder questioning, James Prouty said that he had rented a room\nin Diana's home for four and one half years.  He could and would\naffirm that she had written a radiology manual at her home computer.\n\nHe could also confirm the great animosity held against her\nby the former chair of NERD, Jimbo Jones, who was now one of the\nmany associate academic vice presidents.  James had been a\nwork/study student in NERD and had heard Jimbo yell and verbally\nhammer at Diana any number of times.\n\n\"As you all are aware,\" James said, smiling at the panel,\n\"besides the five medical student SmurFFs, there are two SmurFFs\nthat Dr. Jones is said to have found in the Nursing Nutrition\ncourse that he lectures in.\"\n\n\"And that the document examiners are sure Diana wrote,\"\nAnuse crowed, breaking in triumphantly.  \"But all this tells\nus nothing new concerning the charge.  This is repetitive,\ntime wasting information.  Mr. Chairman, may we get on with it.\"\n\n\"James, were you living in my home last December?\"\n\n\"Yes, I was.\"\n\n\"Would you please tell in your own words why I could not have printed\nor written the two `suspicious' evaluations found by Lyle who claims\nthey were written and submitted by me that year?\"\n\nJames turned his agreeable, smiling face once more toward\nthe panel and said clearly, \"Because you sprained your right\nwrist and were unable to write or use it until shortly before\nChristmas Day, the 25th.\"\n\n\"How do you confirm that I could not write?\"\n\n\"Several ways.  For example, I saw the swollen condition of\nyour wrist daily and observed your limited use of that hand.\nTelephone messages for me were left on the printer when they\nused to be handwritten in notes.\"\n\nLeaning toward the panel, James confided, \"You see, she could\none-finger the computer keys with her left hand.\n\n\"I filled out the order forms for her children's Christmas presents\nthat year since she was unable to write enough to complete them.\n\n\"Around the 22nd or 23rd of December, she could use her hand\nwell enough to write the checks for her bills.  It was painful\nfor her and she had some difficulty doing this.  We made a joke\nof it--whether they would turn off the electricity or telephone\nbecause the signatures on her checks were not at all like her\nnormal signature.\"\n\nQuestions exploded from the panel like hail on a tin roof.\n\"Was her wrist wrapped?\"  \"Did she have a brace?\"  \"Did she\nsee a doctor?\"\n\nAlthough Diana had not completed her examination of her own witness,\nthe panel jumped in and took over the questioning.\n\nHenry, feeling decidedly undermined by this testimony,\ndecided not to interrupt this flurry of out-of-order questioning.\nHe realized that this tactic of interrupting greatly hampered\nthe smooth flow of information a witness had to give.  It also served\nto confuse the witness since questions were coming from more than\none panel member at a time.  He decided that he would not stop it.\n\nHe never paused to think that the transcript of the hearing\nwould show that Diana was interrupted in this manner more than\ntwenty times.  This would become significant when the Attorney\nGeneral made the report of her investigation.\n\nJames waited until the panel ran out of questions and started\nto look sheepishly at one another, then he said, \"Yes, her wrist\nwas wrapped.  She did not see a doctor but was treating it herself.\"\n\nNow the panel turned its attention toward Diana in one of\nthe frequent times they questioned her in front of a witnesses.\n\"When did you write the Christmas note to Lyle, then?\"\nThis question directed at Diana came from Esther.\n\nShe answered firmly, \"The twenty-fourth, the day before Christmas.\nIt was still painful for me to write then and I was still wearing the brace.\nAs you will observe, it is a very short note.\"\n\nWell, this is not getting us anywhere, thought Henry, and\nI'd better put a stop to it.  \"I fail to see what all this\nhas to do with the charge,\" he complained, petulantly.\n\nDiana was ready for that one and answered succinctly,\n\"According to Lyle's testimony, he received the unused student\nevaluation forms for that year from the dean's office on the\ntenth of December.  Lyle testified that they were given out\nto the students the same day.  He could not remember the exact\nday that he claims to have found the `suspect' evaluations,\nbut he did say that he found them sometime during the same week.\nDuring that time I could not use my right hand and I was not\ndoing any writing, or printing for that matter.\"\n\n\"Oh.\"  The sigh that went with it escaped before Henry could\neven realize the `Oh' had departed from his mouth.  He looked\nfrantically at Anuse who appeared to have lost it and just\nshrugged his shoulders at Henry's glance.\n\nWanting to spare James, if possible, from attack by either\nHenry or Anuse when they recovered from shock, Diana quickly\nsaid, \"Thank you, James.\"\n\nAs soon as James had left, Diana continued, \"Before I\nget to the next witness, I refer you again to this memo.\"\nTrenchant replied.  She held the paper aloft in her hand.\n\"Contained in the memo Lyle wrote to Dean Broadhurst is\nthe assertion that on March seventeenth, he `discussed\nthe charges with me and recommended that I resign.'\nThis is patently false.  He accused.  He demanded.\nHe was angry.  He yelled.  He said, `you must resign,\nyou have no recourse.  The president, the vice president\nand the academic council have met and demanded your resignation.'\nHe would not listen to me.  He repeated several times that I\nhad been nothing but trouble to him ever since I took him\nto court six years ago.\n\n\"He was abusive and he was angry.  He said nothing about a hearing.\nWhen I got a word in edgewise, I told him that I was going to contact\nthe ombudsman and he said that I couldn't--that I had no recourse.\n\n\"Later on when he finally stopped yelling and heard me\ndeny his charges, he told me that since I would not resign,\nthere would be a hearing but it wouldn't matter.  It was just\na formality.  I would be terminated, no matter what.\"\n\n\"You should have brought that up when Lyle was here so\nwe would have his response.\"  Henry returned vigorously.\nI have to get on top of this hearing and stay there no matter what,\nhe thought.\n\n\"Should I have?  I'm not a lawyer and I'm not trying to be one.\nThe University Ombudsman told me not to have a lawyer present.\nHe said it would just anger you and turn you against me.\nHe advised me to prepare my case well and present it\nin good order and that is just what I am doing.\n\n\"Right now, I am telling you my side of this story.  You have\nbeen listening for hours to the NERD's allegations and I have\nthe right to respond.   At the beginning of this hearing,\nyou announced that the panel would question its witnesses\nand then I would cross examine them.  You never said anything\nabout debating them.  You have already heard from Lyle.\nAgain I remind you that your letter to me, sent in advance\nof this hearing, contained nothing about specific order\nof presenting my evidence.  Should I read it to you again?\nYou are trying to introduce new rules in the middle of the game.\"\n\n\"Mr. Chairman, I think that we must ask Lyle back here to\nclear up these fabricated charges we have been hearing,\"\nsaid Anuse in a bored tone.  He made a note and then\nlooked toward Henry again.  His look plainly said, ignore her.\n\n\"Yes,\" the chair agreed.  Then offhandedly, as if he had not\nheard a word of her argument, he said to Diana, \"call your next witness.\"\n\nJane watched the interchange between Henry and Anuse with disdain.\nThey are in league together against Diana, she thought and this\ntestimony has thrown them for a loop.  They are going to have to start\nconsidering the information we are hearing in a professional,\nimpartial manner now.  They have got to concede that these charges\nby NERD may be false or at the very least, unsupported by real evidence.\nSo many things about this hearing are strange.  I've noticed that although\nthe charge against Diana, initiated by Lyle, specifically related to the\nfive `suspect' medical student evaluations, three other documents\nwere sent to the document examiners and were marked as evidence,\nshe mused.  No one has questioned how these other documents were\ndeemed `harmful to two young faculty members', as Lyle claimed in\nhis charges.  According to the dean's letter, two are `suspect' SmurFFs\nfrom the nursing nutrition course and the third is a printed note found\nby one of Lyle's closest friends.  The explanation for the note Henry\ngave us was that when Lyle told his friend what was going on,\nshe `just remembered' a note found in her mailbox last year\nthat she thought was `suspicious' so they sent that to the\ndocument examiners as well.\n\nThe examiners concluded that one of the nursing nutrition\nevaluations was written by Diana.  The other and the printed note\nthey were unsure of.  I'm beginning to feel like Alice in\nWonderland.  Jane rubbed her eyes and studied her notes again.\nHow do they expect to prove that this hodgepodge of unrelated\nevidence threatens two men who only teach in the radiation course?\n\n\n\n\nChapter 19\n\n\nWhen the nursing students heard that some of their evaluations\nhad been sent off campus, in defiance of an explicit ruling pertaining\nto student confidentiality, Diana was blitzed with students clamoring\nto testify at her hearing so they could protest this indecency.\nAs a group, they obtained hundreds of signatures on a petition\nrequesting the A.C.L.U. to take up their cause.  The A.C.L.U\nwas most sympathetic, but on finding that the evaluations sent\nwere not signed, felt there was nothing they could do.\n\nThe students argued that since the administration put such emphasis\non handwriting identification, it might use this method to identify\nthe writers of SmurFFs, which were supposed to be anonymous.\n\nThe group sent a strong letter of protest to The Pope and continued\ntheir campaign across campus.  One of the leaders of these\nconcerned students, Jennifer Glass, was the next witness for Diana.\n\n\nJennifer Glass worked in a downtown social service agency full time.\nShe was taking the nursing nutrition course under the Continuing\nEducation Department.\n\nA rather large woman of thirty, she dressed well and showed\nno embarrassment or nervousness.  She was educated extensively\nin New York State schools and had graduated an education major.\nErudite and accomplished, she faced the panel with a most\npositive sense of anticipation.\n\n\"Yes,\" she answered the direct examination question posed by Diana,\n\"I am in your nutrition lab and I have talked with you extensively\nabout the way evaluations are handled in the medical school.\n\n\"I came to you first to complain, thinking that the department\nwas lax leaving them around in the lecture hall.  I or anyone else\ncould have filled out any number of them, since we were told to leave\nour finished evaluations in the NERD office.  I was disturbed that\nthe students were not taking them seriously.  It seemed to indicate\nto me that the nutrition course was not considered important enough\nto be properly evaluated.  That bothered me.\n\n\"You assured me that the evaluation process wasn't unique\nto the nursing course and took me to the NERD office to see\nhow the medical students evaluation was conducted.\n\n\"I was appalled.  Throughout my training, it was stressed\nhow important the process is.  At the colleges I attended,\nthey were taken seriously--a representative from the student\ngovernment would sign out the required number of forms from\nthe administration official and bring them to the classroom.\n\n\"All teachers or instructors had to leave the room while\nwe filled out our evaluation.  They were collected, counted\nand brought back to the administration official.  The data was\ngiven to the instructor but never the evaluations themselves\nbecause student confidentiality was considered to be an\nimportant step in the process.\n\n\"In contrast, at Belmont the evaluation process is a joke--\neven the, er, enriched acronym, SmurFFs, this university\nhas chosen to call the evaluation forms for student feedback\nattests to this.\"\n\n\"Were you ever given specific instructions relating to\nthe evaluations?\" asked Diana.\n\n\"Yes, Dr. Lyle Stone, at the beginning of the course,\ntold us that there would be evaluations periodically and that\nit was very important for us to fill them out since they would\nprovide feedback on the course content and the instructors.\nHe also stressed that they would be confidential.\n\n\"I remember being impressed, thinking, Oh great!  Then instead\nof a proper evaluation procedure, the forms were left in piles\nat the end of rows to be filled out during the lecture or\ntaken home to do.  Just get them back before the end of the week,\nthey told us.\"\n\n\"Did you ever initiate a conversation with Lyle Stone regarding\nhow you felt about document examiners and student confidentiality?\"\n\n\"Yes, right after the lecture, the first part of this May,\nRoz Peel and a couple of other students and I went up to him\nafter lecture.\n\n\"We told him that we were concerned that our student evaluations,\nwhich we had been told were confidential, and which we had been told\nhad a specific purpose, had been sent outside the university without\npermission or knowledge of the students.\"\n\n\"Would you be referring to these documents?\"  Trenchant got up\nfrom her chair and walked around the table until she came to where\nJennifer was sitting and handed her exhibits 3 and 4--the SmurFFs\nJimbo Jones was reported to have discovered.\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"What happened then?\"\n\n\"He said that no student evaluations were sent out\nand that our confidentiality had not been breached.\n\n\"I disagreed with him and said that I had seen copies of\nthose evaluations and the report of the document examiner.\nHe started yelling then and became very defensive.  He said that\nthe only evaluations that were sent out had been written by you.\nWe said that if he knew that, why send them out.  Then he got\nabusive of you and said like you were crazy to do something like that.\nHe said that they sent them to a document examiner because they\nknew you wrote them.  He said he would never do that with\nany evaluation that a student made out.\"\n\n\"Can you recall anytime during the first semester that I had\nan injured wrist and couldn't put instructions on the board?\"\n\n\"Yes, it was in December--exam week, the 9th through the 13th.\nI did some of it for you.\"\n\nThe panel started to bombard Jennifer with questions.  Good,\nHenry thought, apparently they aren't interested in her direct\nevidence relating to the incapacity of Diana as they are totally\nignoring that testimony.  Instead, they are giving all\nindications of being hurt by her denunciation of the way\nthe evaluation process is carried out at Belmont.\n\nA typical faculty reaction, Henry chuckled to himself as he listened.\nThey aren't asking questions, they're defending our evaluation process\nby giving long speeches.  Here's Anuse explaining at length that the\nuniversity takes student confidentiality very seriously and pays\na great deal of attention to evaluations.  He's trying to stroke\nthe witness into backing off from some of her allegations and it\nappears to be working. . .no, not any more, he went too far.\n\nJennifer was quite sharply reminding Frank that she had\nwritten her concerns to various administrative officials\naround campus and the fact that student evaluations had been\nmisused had been confirmed.\n\nI'd better help, thought Henry.  \"You must understand that\nLyle Stone had to give the answers he did because by that time\nhe knew the results of the examiners report and anything he said\nwas referring to that.\"\n\nThe witness, however, remained adamant.  It was her distinct\nimpression that Stone had already convinced himself that Diana\nhad written the critiques before they were sent to the examiners.\n\nThe witness, however, remained adamant.  It was her distinct impression\nthat before they were sent to the examiners Stone had already convinced\nhimself that Diana had written the critiques.\n\nHenry was massively uncomfortable with what this suggested.\nIt wouldn't do to have the panel hear much more of this.\nHe commenced another long speech, explaining that Lyle couldn't\nhave said anything like that because it was not Lyle Stone that\nsent the `suspect' SmurFFs out--it was Mark, the university attorney.\n\"So you see, you must have misunderstood,\" he concluded, patronizingly.\n\nBefore the witness could respond, Anuse professed not to understand\nwhy it made any difference how the evaluation was conducted.\nHe went on and on in this vein in a querulous, whining voice.\n\nOnce he had wound down, Esther started to muddy the waters\nbecause she didn't understand what was sent out and when.\n\"Are you saying all the SmurFFs were sent off campus?\" she asked.\n\n\"No, the discussion is about these `suspect' evaluations,\"\nexplained Jane, indicating the exhibits.\n\n\"Well, that's all right then,\" Esther explained in a motherly\ntone to the witness, \"those SmurFFs never left.  The examiners\ncame here yesterday and looked at them.\"  Esther had become more\nof a space cadet than ever, thought Jane.  And obviously,\nHenry and Anuse are disturbed by this.\n\nStupid broad, thought Henry.  He signaled Janet that the\nhearing was off the record and gathered the panel into a huddle\nto straighten out Esther before she did some real harm.\n\nWhen the hearing reconvened, all the players went round again\nwith paternal and maternal advice.  Rather than asking for information\nfrom the witness, they took turns telling her that she hadn't heard what\nshe was testifying about.  Obviously, she was mistaken.\n\n\"Now, I'm sure you see that no one was trying to attempt to\nhave any student identified by having a document examiner look\nat these,\" cajoled Anuse.\n\n\"That's what you say.  But I think what you have done is illegal.\nI really think it is illegal and if I find a way to do it,\nI am going to stop it. . .\"\n\nAnuse tried to interrupt, but Jennifer was on a roll. \"We had\nan oral contract.  Dr. Stone stood up in front of the whole class\nand told us what the evaluation forms were to be used for.\nAnd they weren't, they were used for something else and that is not right.\"\n\nHenry was stung into action.  He interjected to assure her that\nshe must not worry because the administration would never violate\na student's confidentiality or go back on its word to them.\n\nHe thought he was pouring on oil, but Jennifer knew bullshit\nwhen she heard it.  \"I don't believe it,\"  asserted Jennifer stoically.\n\nDiana took this opportunity to reinforce Jennifer's testimony\nwith another example of the kind of honesty and fair play\nthat the administration practiced.  \"You are arguing with my witness,\nnot questioning her.  She has good reason for her belief.\nWhen I came into this hearing, it was with the assurance\nfrom my department chairman and the chairman of this panel,\nboth senior administrators, that I had been given all\nof the material that would be presented as evidence relating\nto the handwriting examiners.\n\n\"This proved to be unequivocally false.  The evidence you\nhave introduced, Mr. Chairman, contains many documents\nthat were never given to me to examine before the hearing.\"\n\nThis started another bout between Diane and Anuse,\nwho apparently able to read Lyle's and the chair's mind,\nkept insisting that what Lyle and Henry meant was that Diana\nhad been given all of the material available at that date.\n\nHenry rushed in to agreed that yes that was what was meant.\n\"Lyle gave you everything he had at that date.\"\n\n\"Then it was incumbent upon this committee to see that I\nhad all of the evidence before the hearing.\"\n\n\"But,\" protested the chair, \"we didn't get all the evidence\nourselves until today.\"\n\n\"Then it shouldn't have been presented until I had an\nopportunity to examine it!  I am finished with this witness.\"\n\nHenry quickly announced that there would be a break.\n\nWhen they were back on the record, Henry announced,\n\"Once the witnesses for Diana complete their testimony,\nwe will call Lyle back to clear up the misconceptions\nthis last witness has introduced.  Also we will call\nAnn Biggot, and Mark. . .,\"  To straighten out the\npanel on the document examiners, he thought to himself.\nHe continued, \"while we are at it, we should probably hear from Jimbo.\"\n\nApparently, thought Jane, if he hears anything contradictory\nto what he's already established as correct, someone has to\ncome back and explain it away.\n\n\n\n\nChapter 20\n\n\nThe next witness was Roz Peel.\n\nThroughout the ordeal of the hearing, Roz had been the\nsparkplug of the outfit.  Her high spirits and unquenchable\noptimism lifted the whole group of witnesses.\n\nHere was a young woman who had known severe adversity in\nher life which she had battled and continued to battle.\nFew knew the particulars because she was a very private person.\nShe didn't feel that anything was accomplished by bleeding all over\nother people about her own troubles.  It was much better for her\nand others to be positive and upbeat.\n\nWhen she identified herself and was sworn, she told the\npanel that she was a full-time student in the College of\nAgriculture and worked part-time at the Belmont print shop.\n\nA petite woman in her late twenties, she sat back in her chair,\nlarger than life and twinkled merrily at the panel.  Her good humor\nwas so contagious that the panel, as one, smiled back at her.\n\nShe readily confirmed the testimony of Jennifer, announcing clearly\nthat she was present when the conversation with Lyle took place.\n\"He said many times that no student evaluations had ever been sent\nto the document examiners.  When we asked him how he knew beforehand\nthat none of the ones he was sending were student's, he replied that\nhe knew who had written them before they were sent away to be analyzed.\"\n\nDiana asked her to think carefully, \"Are you sure that he\nmeant that he knew this before the documents were sent and\nnot as a result of the report of the document examiners?\"\n\nRoz's reply was good natured but firm.  \"Yes, I am certain.\nWe asked him the question several times because we found\nhis answer a little odd, I mean, why would he bother to have\nthem analyzed if he knew who wrote them?\n\n\"He said clearly, more than once, that no student evaluations\nhad been sent because he knew beforehand who had written the ones sent.\"\n\n\"Did he have any opinion on why I would do such a thing?\" prompted Diana.\n\n\"He said you had a psychological problem.  He inferred that you were sick\nbut he was not a psychologist so he couldn't define it.\"\n\n\"How did he conduct himself during your conversation?\"\n\n\"He was very angry and seemed threatened by us.\nI backed away many times when he raised his voice and shouted.\nI thought it was a little strange that two undergraduate women\nwould be a threat to him--maybe he needs psychological help!\"\nRoz turned to the panel with a big smile to share the joke with them.\n\nDiana placed her hand firmly against her mouth and looked down\nat her notes until the bubble of mirth that threatened to overcome her\nhad dissipated, then continued with her questioning.\n\"On a different subject now--do you have any contact with medical students?\"\n\n\"Yes.  Working right in the medical building as I have\nfor the last three years, I get to know a lot of them.\"\n\n\"Last year, during the first semester--that would be from September\nthrough December--do you recall any impressions you might have gotten\nas to their feelings about the radiology course?\"\n\n\"Yes.  They felt that the professors knew very little about\nwhat they were teaching so it was a waste of time to go to lectures.\"\n\n\"Now,\" interposed Henry, \"we are getting into secondhand information\nand we should be hearing from the medical students themselves.\"\n\n\"Fine,\" rejoined Diana.  \"If you can get them over here, do that.\nI would be happy to have them testify.\n\n\"In the meantime, you wrote in your letter to me that I could present\nwhatever I felt was germane and since the medical students are not allowed\nto come, this is the best I can do.\"\n\n\"It will be noted that it is secondhand information,\"\nsaid Henry haughtily.  He pretended to appear unconcerned\nwith the testimony and adopt Anuse's strategy of ignoring\nanything Diana might say that was bothersome.\n\n\"I agree.  The testimony should be labeled clearly as secondhand.\"\nDiana pounced on Henry's depiction of Roz's testimony.\n\"Now let us go back over the testimony your witnesses\ngave which alleged that students had been manipulated for years by me.\nLet us get all of the student evaluations for all of the years,\nthat your witnesses testified to, but never produced.\nLet us get all of the prior information out into the open\nand let's honestly label it for what it is--secondhand information.\"\n\nHenry rolled his eyes back in resignation, \"Get on with it.\"\n\n\"Thank you.  Roz, during the three years that you knew\nfreshmen medical students that were taking the radiology course,\ndid you ever hear any of them say that I had tried to influence\nthem in any way or told them how to write their evaluations?\"\n\n\"Certainly not!\"  Roz was very firm on this.  \"If they could\nbe such pushovers as to be influenced by a non-tenured faculty\nmember, the university should reevaluate its admission policy.\"\n\n\"Thank you, I have no more questions.\"\n\nHenry knew he had to make a desperate attempt to trip up\nthe witness in semantics.  Always before, this had been the\npurview of Frank Anuse but this time Frank sat silent,\nand for good reason.  He had known Roz for some time\nand was not about to go for two out of three falls with her.\n\n\"You must be aware that there was no way in which your\nevaluations could be tied to a specific student because\nthere was no student handwriting sent,\" challenged Henry.\n\n\"How was it known that no student handwriting was sent?\"\nquestioned Roz, serenely.\n\n\"I just want to assure you that no student handwriting was sent.\"\nA flush began to appear on his brow.\n\n\"Are you trying to say that no student standards were sent?\nIf so, I understand that.  But SmurFFs with student writing\non them were.\"\n\n\"Yes, SmurFFs were sent, but there was no way in which one\ncould identify them.\"  Henry was unaware that he had caught\nhimself in his own semantics and made an interesting admission.\n\nRoz wasn't going to let up or get sidetracked by it from\nthe main argument.  \"That is not relevant to what we are\ndiscussing.  It was wrong to send those evaluations,\nwhether so-called standards of ours accompanied them or not.\nBecause technically, that was our writing.\"\n\nHenry slumped in his chair in desperate need of an antacid,\nas the others on the panel asked questions relating to the\nnursing nutrition course.  Suddenly Frank Anuse leaned forward\nand interrupted the questions.  \"Do you remember a time when\nDiana had a sprained wrist?\"\n\n\"Yes.  She sprained it late in November and some of us helped\nput notes on the board for the final labs in December.\"\n\nBlocked on that issue, Anuse tried to maneuver her into agreeing\nthat it should be wrong for anyone who was not a student to fill\nout evaluations.  \"It could be very harmful for a faculty person,\ncouldn't it?\"\n\n\"Two evaluations out of two hundred?\" twinkled Roz.  \"I think they\nwould have survived.  But to more fully reply to your question,\nit has not been proven that the evaluations in question were not\nfilled out by students.\"\n\n\"Oh that's because you haven't heard some other testimony.\"\nAnuse said happily and firmly back in control.\n\n\"I agree that I have not heard all of the testimony.\nHowever, if that testimony was important, and it must be\nsince you appear to believe it, why wasn't the hearing open\nas Diana requested?  If it had been, I would have been here\nto hear the testimony you put such stock in and would be able\nto evaluate it for myself.\"\n\n\n\n\nChapter 21\n\n\nProfessor Diana Trenchant was sitting at her desk preparing for\nthe evening laboratory.  Roz had just left with Jennifer to talk\nto as many students as they could find.  It had been Jennifer's\nidea and she had brought Roz along to help talk Diana into it.\nEver since Jennifer had asked her what was wrong and Diana had\nexplained and shown her the copies of the SmurFF's she had been\naccused of writing, Jennifer had been pondering what to do.\n\nShe was older than most of the students and had seen enough\nof life to know that one had to fight or be trampled.\nShe didn't want to see a good teacher trampled.\n\n\"You mean they have accused you of writing these and demand\nthat you resign?\"  She was dumbfounded.  After she had looked\nat them more carefully, she asked, \"Is this all of them?\nFive medical radiology and two nursing nutrition?\"\n\n\"That's it.\"\n\n\"This sucks!  And this paper is the graphologist report?\"\nJennifer used the scientific designation, graphologist,\nrather than the term document examiner.  \"Look here,\nthese are what they call standards, did you write these?\"\n\n\"I could have, I suppose, but the dates on them are so long\nago that I just don't remember for sure.\"\n\n\"Well, two of these evaluations are printed.  There is no printing\namong the standards.  Look, I know a little about graphology\nand I know that they can't compare printing to writing standards.\nThis looks like a setup.  We need to put a crimp in Lyle Stone's tail.\nIt's unconscionable that he would send student evaluations to a graphologist.\"\n\nLater, when Roz had come in, she had asked Diana if they could tell\nthe other students in the class about the two nursing nutrition SmurFFs.\n\"We'll ask them to come up and see if they can identify if they wrote these.\nThen we'll check with the med students and have them do the same.\nSomebody must have written these and we need to find out who.\"\n\nDiana agreed but only if no pressure was put on anyone.\n\"This must be absolutely voluntary.  I will copy some completed\nforms from last year's class and put them with these two\nto be identified.  No one will know which two are critical.\"\n\nLater in the day, several groups of students had wandered in\nto look at the pile of evaluations, shake their heads and wander out again.\n\nThat is until Jenny Smythe bubbled her way in.  Jenny was\nfrom England.  Her husband was a doctor associated with the\nmedical school and she was continuing her education while he was\nposted here.  She pounced delightedly on one of the forms,\n\"This looks just like Sarah's writing.  Sarah and I sit together\nat all the lectures and I've seen her handwriting so many times.\nI'll go get her!\"  And Jenny was off with that efficient British\nwalking gait that one associates with woolen socks and moors.\n\nThe next day, Sarah appeared at Diana's door, tentative\nand a bit apprehensive.  Sarah was a shy young woman barely\nout of high school.  Raised on a farm, she had not yet assumed\nthe mask that so many of her more sophisticated classmates wore.\n\n\"Jenny said I should look at some evaluations because you\nhave some trouble because of them.\"\n\n\"Yes, thanks for coming by.  They are on the bench there.\"\nDiana pointed.\n\nSarah put down her books and started to look through the SmurFFs.\n\"Jenny's right.  This one is mine.\"  Sarah said, mournfully.\n\"I was so hoping it wouldn't be.\"\n\nShe handed Diana one of the forms.  It was one of the two\nthat had been sent for analysis.  With this proof that the\ngraphologists had erred, Diana's hopes were raised and then\nquickly lowered when Sarah declared that she was afraid to\ntestify at the hearing which was to be held soon.  She was\napologetic about it.  Her folks had told her not to get involved;\nthat it might mean trouble for her if she admitted to what\nshe had written.\n\nRoz and Jennifer, by this time, were well into their campaign\nprotesting the sending off-campus of the student confidential evaluations.\nThey were unhappy that Sarah wouldn't testify, but they respected her feelings.\n\nLater on in the week, Sarah appeared at Diana's office door again.\n\"You know,\" she said softly, \"I think my parents are wrong on this.\nI wrote something that got you into trouble and I should stand up\nand admit it.  Only, I'm so scared.  But I know I have to do it.\n\n\"I'll go to the hearing but that's all I'm going to do.\nI don't want to get mixed up any further in this and I don't\nwant anything at all to do with those. . .those. . .graph\nwhatever people.  You know, whoever it was that said this\nwas your writing is nuts. . .I wrote this.\"\n\n\nSarah shuffled carefully into the hearing room, shaking with\nan advanced case of stage fright that threatened to upset her\nvery balance.\n\nAs she had told Sarah she would, Diana got up from her chair,\nwalked around the table and stood beside her after she had been\nidentified and sworn.  \"Did you take the Nursing Nutrition course\nlast school year, Sarah?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"And did you make out a course evaluation for Dr. Jamison Jones?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"Is this that evaluation?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\nDiana turned to the panel.  \"This witness has just identified\nthis evaluation from your evidence packet C, exhibit four.\"\n\nBefore Diana could continue, the panel erupted in a\nveritable frenzy of questions, all talking at once.\n\n\"What is that number?\"\n\n\"What was she handed?\"\n\n\"What is written on it?\"\n\nWhen there was a pause in the clamor, Sarah, holding exhibit\nfour said again quietly, \"Yes, this is mine.\"\n\n\"This is not one that went to the document examiners, right?\"\nHenry was frantic.\n\n\"The witness has just identified document number two of exhibit four,\"\nrepeated Diana.\n\nAs the panel again started to question Sarah, Henry struggled\nfor control.  Face blanched, hands compressed into fists so tightly\nthat the nails bit into his palms, he listened powerlessly as Esther\ngot the first question out.  \"Sarah, how can you be sure that this is yours?\"\n\n\"Because I recognize the handwriting; I know what I wrote, that is why.\"\n\n\"I'd like to conduct the examination of my own witness,\nif I may,\" snapped Diana as the panel broke out in a flurry\nof questions after Esther's initial one.  This angry outburst\nshocked the panel into silence, temporarily.\n\nIn a more relaxed voice, Diana nodded toward them and said,\n\"Thank you.  Now, Sarah, have you been pressured in any way\nto make this identification or have you been promised anything\nfor doing it--by me or any other person?  Remember, you are\nunder oath to tell the complete truth.\"\n\n\"No.\"\n\n\"Thank you.  I have finished the direct examination of this witness.\"\n\n\"May I see packet C to make sure I understand,\" said a very flustered\nHenry Tarbuck.\n\nEsther started in on Sarah.  Even though Sarah had given\nher class and student status at the beginning of her testimony,\nEsther asked for it all again.  Perhaps she thought Diana was\nringing in an impostor.  Others on the panel took over as Esther\npaused for breath.\n\nSarah carefully answered each question, becoming confused only\nwhen two or three questions were thrown at her at the same time.\nShe established who she was and how she had found out about the\n\"whole business.\"\n\n\"Tell me again when you took the course?\"\n\n\"Is there a date on the form?\"\n\nRaising his voice in the way that men will in the presence\nof women as an effective way of silencing them and holding\nthe floor by intimidation, Anuse drawled conversationally,\n\"What you claim is interesting.  This document was identified\nby the document examiner as being written by Dr. Trenchant.\"\nHe fixed Sarah with a patronizing grimace.  His attitude plainly\nsaid I don't believe you, little girl.\n\nSarah replied, \"I know that.\"\n\n\"Well, we should see a sample of your handwriting.\"\n\n\"You have a sample.  It is right there on that paper I identified.\"\n\n\"No, absolutely not.  It cannot be.  You have made a mistake.\nThat SmurFF has been identified by experts as being in Diana's handwriting.\"\n\n\"We'll take some of your writing to the document examiner.\nThat will settle it.\"  Esther beamed at having such a great idea.\n\n\"No.  You already have a sample of my writing.  I won't have anything\nmore to do with those people.  Look how they made this mistake.\nI don't like how those people are.\"  Sarah did not have much faith\nin document examiners--she of all people had reason not to.\n\n\"Well, we can do nothing here with this.  It is just hearsay or. . .\"\nFrank's voice trailed off as he looked to Henry for a ruling.\n\nFrank Anuse is trying to sweep the evidence under the rug,\nthought Jane.  He came into this hearing with his mind made up.\nAny attempt Henry and Anuse have made toward impartiality is a sham.\n\nDiana addressed the panel, speaking forcefully.  \"Sarah has\nidentified the evaluation under oath.  You have that document as\na sample of her handwriting.  I think that is sufficient and you\nare upsetting her with your badgering.\"\n\n\"Well, the analysts are convinced that you wrote it.\"\nAnuse had turned ugly again.\n\n\"Handwriting evidence is not always conclusive,\" retorted Diana.\n\nAnuse turned his hostility toward Sarah.  \"How do you recognize\nthat as yours?\"  Ignoring the fact that this had been asked and answered.\n\nPatiently, Sarah said, \"Because it is.  It looks like mine\nand that is what I wrote.\"\n\nHenry made a monumental blunder and didn't realize it until it was\ntoo late.  After consistently arguing that the university would\nnever send student handwriting off campus to a document examiner,\nhe proposed just that!  \"We have samples of your handwriting\nin the university files that we can send to have checked,\" he threatened.\n\n\"No. You cannot do that with student files.  You have no right\nto send my records away like that.  You already have sent my SmurFF\nand you have that as a sample of my writing if you need it.\"\n\n\"Are you afraid?\"  Henry tried for intimidation to cover his faux pas.\n\"Of what?\"\n\n\"Yes, I'm afraid.  I'm afraid of who's on the other side of this.\nI'm afraid of who is lying about Dr. Trenchant and what could happen\nto me for coming here to testify.\"\n\nOnce again, Anuse led her through questions, to explain how\nshe had seen the copy of this evaluation.  Finally he said,\n\"and what did you think when you saw it?\"\n\nHer answer, delivered in a soft but firmly decisive tone,\nlanded like a bombshell in the midst of the panel.  They sat in\nstunned silence for a beat and then the chair abruptly dismissed her.\n\n\"I was shocked,\" Sarah said, earnestly.  Tears, long held back\nnow slowly slid down her face, marking the planes and valleys\nwith ripples that winked on and off reflecting the room lights\n\"And I didn't want to even say it was mine.  But I did, because it was.\"\n\nDiana left the hearing room shortly after Sarah to ask Helen,\nher last witness, to come in.  The whole group was in the hallway\ngathered around Sarah as she came out of the hearing room door.\n\n\"What did they do to her in there,\" demanded Roz, angrily.\n\n\"They were pretty nasty.  They fired questions at her so fast\nthat she didn't understand what they were asking half the time.\nThey all but called her a liar, poor kid,\" answered Diana.\n\nHelen came over.  \"You tell them I'll be in just as soon\nas Sarah is calmed down.  Sadistic bastards!\"\n\n\n\n\nChapter 22\n\n\nDiana returned to the hearing room alone and sat down.\nAddressing the panel, she said firmly, \"My next witness will be\nin shortly.   She is helping Sarah because you upset her so much.\"\n\nAnuse and Henry looked pleased.  The women were anxious\nand concerned except for Esther who appeared puzzled.\n\nShortly thereafter, Helen Schauer marched into the room and\ntook the witness chair as if she owned it.  Her Teutonic\nancestors would have been proud.  Helen, at age thirty,\nconsidered herself a responsible adult.  She owned property\nand was very serious about her abilities and her nursing studies.\n\n\nShe had begged Diana to let her come as a witness.  A little\ntaller than average, she was a strong looking woman.  Blonde hair\nframed a face that, while not beautiful, reflected a healthy\nradiance that enhanced her image of strength.  Now, sitting\nthere, exuding confidence, she gave her name and was sworn.\nHer testimony should have been important, but Diana wasn't too\ncertain that the panel would listen.  It backed up what Roz\nhad to say about the feelings of the medical students concerning\nthe radiology course.\n\nThe most Diana hoped to accomplish from this testimony was\nto have the committee order NERD to make available the course\nand instructor evaluation for the previous year.  That was\nthe year that Lyle had claimed the students loved the course\nand the instructors.  That was the year Diana did not teach in it.\n\n\"Are you acquainted with any medical students who took\nthe radiology course this last year?\" questioned Diana.\n\nHelen testified that two of the rooms in her home were rented\nby medical students.  \"The gist of the conversation around\nour dinner table was that they felt the course was a complete\nwaste of time.  `Most of the year, it seemed as if we knew more\nthan the instructors,'\" she quoted one of them as saying.\n\nJane couldn't wait for Diana to complete her questioning\nof Helen and broke in with, \"Would the students come and\ntalk with us?\"  She pretended to forget that medical students\nwere not allowed at the hearing.\n\n\"No.  Medical students were told they should not testify.\nThey did request that I tell you that both she and my other\nroomer gave a bad evaluation of the course in the SmurFFs\nthey filled out this year.  They hoped that by doing that,\nthe course would be changed and improved for the students next year.\nYou have been told that all the evaluations were positive that year.\"\n\nHenry appeared to misunderstand.  \"If they didn't think their\nevaluations were done correctly, they should go to the dean.\"\nHe said to Helen, severely.\n\n\"Huh?  I didn't say anything about them feeling their evaluations. . .\nwhat do you mean?\"\n\n\"If there is a problem with their evaluations,\nthey should go to the dean.\"\n\n\"I didn't say there was a problem.  I don't know where you\nare coming from.  I will repeat what I said since it appears\nthat I have been misunderstood.  They told me that they had filled\nout a very negative evaluation on the radiology course, and that\nthey knew that others in the class did also because there was\ngreat dissatisfaction with the course.\"\n\nHenry immediately reminded the panel members that this was all hearsay.\nIt will be trouble, he thought, if anyone on the panel asks for the\nSmurFFs for the year Diana didn't teach that course.  Lyle doesn't want\nthem seen and for good reason.  He and his boys have perjured themselves.\n\nNo one seemed to have any more questions.  Even Anuse appeared wary.\nThis was one witness that they weren't going to confuse.  She not only\nhad both feet planted on the ground, she looked as if she'd enjoy planting\nthe panel under them.  Noting that there were no more questions coming,\nDiana thanked her and said, \"Looks like we are finished with you, Helen.\"\n\n\"You may be finished with me, but I am not finished with you!\"\nShe took in everyone in the room with that remark, surprising Diana\nas much as anyone on the panel.  Even Janet looked up with\na startled expression.\n\nOne could almost hear the horns of the Valkyrie sounding as\na Brunnhilde spirit sparkled in the body of this nursing student.\n\n\"I am concerned and distressed,\" she continued.  \"First,\nfor how you treated that young woman who testified before me.\nI have known Sarah for several months and she is as honest\nand sincere as anyone I have ever known.\n\n\"You know what she told us when she came out?  She said you\ndidn't believe her because you had already decided on the basis\nof the graphologist's report.  She said it wasn't fair.  That person\nswore only to an opinion.  She, Sarah, had sworn to a fact.\n\n\"Also, from what the other witnesses have told me and what\nI have just experienced myself, I don't believe you want to\nfind out the truth.  You just want to terminate our teacher.\n\n\"No, I am not finished yet.\"  Helen held up a warning hand to\nHenry who was about to protest, palm flat out like a traffic cop.\n\"I have a BA in German and I am working toward a BA in nursing,\nand I am disgusted, I am really disgusted at what happened with\nmy nutrition course evaluation.  Despite what we were told in the\nclassroom concerning the use of the evaluations for the course\nand professors, they were sent off-site to a graphologist. . .\"\n\n\"Only a few, there were only a small number,\" insisted Henry.\nGood Lord, he thought, abashed, I never should have admitted\nthat any were sent.\n\n\"So what!  Maybe mine was one of them.  You shouldn't be breaching\nstudent confidentiality to expedite some personnel matter.\nAnd let me tell you, I'm not the only one in the class that feels that way.\nYou have deceived us and we will not fill out any more of those forms\nunless we are forced to.\"\n\n\"But you must understand,\" urged Esther, \"no other writing\nby students went out at the same time.  There would not be any\nchance that anybody would know who was the person who wrote them.\"\n\nEsther really was out of it, thought Annette.\n\n\"That is totally irrelevant.\" Helen replied firmly.  \"The\npoint is our confidential evaluations were sent off-site.\nI think a lot of damage has been done.  It is unconscionable.\nIf we ever do fill out another evaluation form, it will be\ncompletely sterile so it can't be used to hurt anyone by an\nirresponsible administration.  That is what many of the med\nstudents did in their last evaluation.  They just marked\neverything average and typed all comments.  That is why you\nhaven't seen any of their SmurFFs from that year.\"\n\n\"Thank you, Helen.\"  Diana stood up and walked around the table\nto open the door for her.\n\n\"We'll take a short recess,\" Henry announced.\n\nDuring this recess, he told the panel that he had decided to adjourn\nthe hearing until the next day.\n\n\nHenry had just reached the hallway of his home when the\nphone summoned him with its strident demand to be answered.\nLoosening his tie with one hand, he picked up the instrument\nwith the other, \"Yes, hello, Tarbuck residence.\"\n\n\"Ah, good.  You're home, Henry.\"  This superb example of\ndeductive reasoning delivered in the imperious manner of\na self-appointed earth-god could only be The Pope.\n\n\"Yes, how are you, John?\"  Henry had pulled off his tie and\nwas settling himself comfortably in the chair next to the phone.\n\"Sorry I missed you when I returned to the office, but we decided\nto adjourn early so I did a few errands I've been putting off\nand then I came home.\"\n\n\"No problem, Henry.  I just wanted to check with you to see\nhow things are going.  Mark said there was a bit of a dust up\nover the file material he sent the document examiners as standards?\"\n\n\"Yes.  Trenchant is making an issue of every little thing\nshe can think of.  Actually, I think she must have some outside help--\nsomeone is advising her.  Perhaps even someone at Belmont.\"\n\n\"Giving you a lot of trouble, is she?  Slap her down, Henry,\nslap her down.  We've got her good on this one.  Mark tells me\nthe document examiner was one hundred percent sure that\nTrenchant wrote those things,\" The Pope boomed expansively.\n\n\"That's correct.  The only thing is the three women on the\npanel don't place much confidence in the examiner's ability\nand right now they aren't accepting her testimony.  Besides that,\nTrenchant has a student witness who claims that she, the witness,\nwrote one of those SmurFFs our analyst said was written by Trenchant.\"\n\n\"My God.  That doesn't sound good at all.  I thought Mark\nsaid handwriting analysis was as foolproof as fingerprints.\"\n\n\"Well, that's the legal argument lawyers use.  Apparently,\nthey aren't.  Trenchant gave us two cases as examples of these\nso-called experts being fooled.  One was concerning the Hitler\nDiaries and another she called the White Salamander Affair.\nShe also listed several other sources for the panel to check on.\"\n\n\"What are you going to do?  You've got to whip that panel in line\nand do it fast, Henry, we're in this thing too deep to back off now.\"\n\n\"I know, and I'm on top of it.  Mark is going to testify\nconcerning his experience as an attorney with handwriting\nevidence.  Also, I've ruled most of Trenchant's testimony\nand that of her witnesses hearsay.  That cuts out a lot of\npotentially damaging information.\n\n\"Did you know, John, that those two guys who brought the complaint\nagainst her in the first place had plagiarized several textbooks\nas well as Trenchant's stuff and that both the dean and Lyle Stone\nknew about it?\"\n\n\"Penny ante stuff, Henry.  Everybody copies material for their courses.\nThat's why every department has a copying machine.\"\n\n\"Well this sure sounded serious.  They photographed a whole\natlas and presented it to their class as their own work.\"\n\n\"So?  It's just Trenchant's word, isn't it?  Who's going to\nbelieve she isn't just indulging in sour grapes?\"\n\n\"The whole panel, that's who.  That stupid son of a bitch,\nIan, admitted to it.\"\n\n\"Don't worry so, Henry.  Surely you can explain that away\nas a misstatement on his part.  He can just say that he didn't\nunderstand the question and. . .\"\n\n\"I've already done that with the panel but I can't keep up forever\nexplaining away every boner they pull.  I've got to call Lyle back\nto testify again and the panel wants to hear from one of his faculty,\nAnn Biggot, and from Jimbo as well.\"\n\n\"What can I do to help you, Henry.\"\n\n\"Get on their asses, please, John.  Those dilettantes\nin the medical school just made a very poor showing.\nThey weren't prepared or. . .would you believe, John,\nthat Lyle couldn't even remember how many SmurFFs he was\ngiven and the dean contradicted a vital part of his testimony.\nBoth Ian and Randy stunk. Please, lower the boom on Lyle\nand the others slated to testify tomorrow.  They have got\nto do their homework.\"\n\n\"I'll get right on it, Henry.  Don't worry now.  Just remember\nthat we can keep everyone--reporters, local, state and federal--\nout of our business simply by claiming academic privilege.\nThere is nothing we can't explain away.  Nothing we can't\nmake disappear if we need to.\"\n\n\"OK, John, and thanks.\"\n\n\"Right.  Good evening, Henry.\"\n\nHenry hung up the phone and stretched.  Strange, he thought,\nsniffing the air experimentally, I don't smell anything cooking.\nWonder if we're going out for dinner.  For that matter, I wonder\nwhere Kate is, haven't heard her moving around.  Oh, well, she's\nprobably in the back yard.\n\nResigning himself to the distinct possibility that he would\nhave to get ready for another night out, he went in search of her.\nThe kitchen first, he decided.  I'll grab something out of the\nrefrigerator to eat and. . .what's this note on the table?\nHenry started to read it and then sat down heavily in a\nnearby chair to finish reading.  \"Be damned,\" he breathed.\n\"She's left me.\"\n\n\n\n\nTHE HEARING - DAY 3\n\n\n\nChapter 23\n\n\nThe next morning, the panel members looked relaxed and confident.\nHenry hoped there would be now more gaffes, especially since\nThe Pope had gotten after them.  He congratulated himself\nfor thinking to ask.  He knew from experience that The Pope\ncould be very persuasive.\n\nThe first witness called by the panel was the university attorney,\nMark Rogers.  He entered the room, spoke to everyone there, addressing\nthem by name, and took the seat indicated just across from Diana.\n\nMark would never be called handsome.  He carried a bit too\nmuch weight in his face for that.  He was, however, garrulous.\nThis part of his character endeared him to the administration\nthat he served so well, since his long winded approach to any\nproblem brought to him, bored most people to death before\nthey got any answer.\n\nThis saved the administrators the problem of dealing with\nmost complaints brought by faculty and staff.  If the\nadministrators wanted some legal answers, they contacted a real\nlawyer, usually Simon Murrain, from a high priced law firm in town.\n\nMark had never had any success as an attorney in the real world,\nbut here in the cloistered world of academia, he flourished.\nIn the rapidly changing meaning of words, Mark knew which side\nof the butter the bread was on.  He could lie or tell the truth\nwith the same absolute conviction.\n\nAnd now he was giving an ample demonstration of this to the panel.\nHe knew that he had been called in because Henry was terrified\nthat the document examiner's evidence had been overturned by\nthe defense testimony.  He also knew that the three women\non the panel were not disposed favorably to the analyst\nwho had come to testify.  Well, by golly, he thought,\nold Mark will put out the fire.\n\nIn answer to a simple question, Mark replied by starting from\nwhen he graduated from law school and tracing his entire career.\nAlong the way, he revealed, he had discovered these\nparticular document examiners.\n\nFor all his verbosity, he was convincing.  Henry was pleased.\nAfter all, he was an attorney.  Who would know better how courts\nand evidence worked than an attorney?  Then too, Mark had been\nthe one to send the `suspect' evaluations to the analyst that he,\nhimself, had recommended.  Mark had ordered the material from\nDiana's personnel file, so he could attest to the legality of it.\n\nJane observed that the other members of the panel, immersed in his tale,\nseemingly failed to realize that he confirmed several interruptions\nin the chain of custody of the documents he was referring to.\nMost notable was when he was asked to identify the various packets\nof handwriting evidence that was marked as exhibits for this hearing.\nHe either, \"hadn't reviewed them closely enough to determine. . .\"\nor claimed that he \"honestly didn't recall who I received the note\nfrom (the note Lyle's friend had found `strange'),\" as answers\nto direct questions from the panel.\n\nHenry, hoping to create some clarity, put the finishing touches\non the breaks in the chain of custody of the `suspect' documents\nthat were being discussed.  \"Oh, the problem here must be because\nsome of the packets have been separated apart.\"\n\nJane noticed that Mark also had only vague recollections as to\nwhen all these things took place.  He prefaced every phrase with,\n\"to the best of my recollection\" or \"at best I can recall,\"\nin proper attorney fashion, proving that he had, after all,\ngotten something out of law school.\n\nHaving agreed, with Henry's prompting, that he did remember\ngetting five radiology SmurFFs from Lyle, two nursing nutrition\nSmurFFs from Jimbo, he was handed a note, referred to as `Lyle's\nfriend's strange note' by Henry and asked, \"And did you also sent\nthe document examiners this note?\"\n\n\"This would appear to be the original note; the only thing\nthat I have seen is a copy of this note.  I don't believe\nuntil now I had actually seen an original.\"\n\nGood Lord, thought Jane.  Surely someone should question this.\nThe document examiner testified that ALL the `suspect' documents\nwere originals and now Mark, the guy that sent them to the examiners,\nis saying he has only seen a copy.\n\nHe's vague and unsure of most everything he claims he was involved\nin and most of his evidence is what someone else told him or that\nhe `had assumed'.  This was the kind of testimony that Henry had\nbeen so critical of when the defense witnesses were examined,\ncalling it second hand information.  Apparently, coming from\nthe university attorney, it is considered to be all right,\nJane commented to herself.  At one point, with help from Henry,\nMark brought forth information that Jane thought might be triple hearsay.\n\nHe said, \"I remember now that Jimbo told me that Lyle told him\nthat Lyle's friend had found the note.\"\n\nNot a voice was raised in complaint from the panel.\nAnd not from me either, thought Jane.  I'm not sticking\nmy neck out when a lawyer is testifying.\n\nHenry appeared to be pleased.  Mark had done well enough\neven though he had been a bit shaky on dates.  Anyway, the panel\ndidn't seem to notice.  He had established handwriting analysis\nas nearly infallible--not by evidence, not by proof, but solely\nbecause he said so.\n\nHe was pleased when cross examination by Diana was continually\nbroken into by the panel.  As a result of this, the question\nof the dates when these things happened was never really established.\nAs things stood, Lyle, Randy and now Mark had all given conflicting\ndates concerning when these documents were sent out for analysis,\nwhen each received them and what each received.\n\nHowever, under tenacious questioning by Diana, Mark divulged\nthat the `strange' note, apparently sent as an afterthought,\nhad only been looked at by the examiners the day before coming to testify.\nThat was why he had only seen a copy of it since the original was given\nto them on their arrival by Henry.  Their opinion was not conclusive,\nbut they thought it probable that Diana had printed it.  They were wise\nto vacillate on this, Mark observed, since their supply of printing\nstandards was very limited.\n\nBecause of the way Mark presented this, the panel was left\nwith the impression that had there been enough standards,\nthe document examiner would certainly have found that Diana\nhad printed it.\n\nAn angry exchange occurred when Diana protested strongly\nthat here was another piece of evidence that she was surprised\nwith after being told that she had received all of it.\n\nHenry smiled vacuously and said, \"It was introduced yesterday.\"\n\n\"I never saw it.\"\n\n\"It was in the analyst's report for you to see.\"\n\n\"Now you tell me.\"\n\n\"You could have read it anytime.\"\n\n\"When?  Every time there was a break, you shooed me out of here.\"\n\n\"We needed this room to confer.\"\n\nAnuse broke in to hammer home another spike of explanation in the\nmaze of questionable activity engaged in by the administration.\n\"Mark, from a legal point of view, can an employee's personnel\nrecords be sent out for this type of analysis without the\nindividual's permission or verification?\"\n\nMark answered, again with the qualifier, which was not\ndeemed noteworthy by the committee members. \"In my opinion,\nthey may not be used for just any purpose, but they certainly\nmay be used for those purposes.\"\n\nWell, sure.  Ask the guy who did it if it was all right.\nSome legal opinion! thought Diana.\n\nIt was, however, the benchmark, the criterion of the\nprejudice exhibited by the hearing panel throughout.\nThe Attorney General, after her investigation was complete,\nwrote in her report that, \". . .the panel utilized a procedure\nin which guilt was not investigated, but assumed.  The university\nplaced the burden of proof on Diana Trenchant to prove she was innocent,\nbut denied her the evidence to do so.\n\n\"In fact,\" The A.G.'s report continued, \"the process was\nso fundamentally unfair and reflected such an aggressive\ndetermination by the university to discharge her, that\nits actions have strengthened the inference of discrimination.\"\n\n\n\n\nChapter 24\n\n\nAfter Mark had left, Associate Academic Vice President, Jimbo Jones\nwas sworn.  He had held the chair of NERD for many years,\nthen when Lyle took over, Jimbo was moved to the central\nadministrative post.  Henry smiled wryly, hoping for the best\nbecause no matter how poor a performance was turned in by senior\nadministrators, they were never fired--they knew where too many\nbodies were buried.  They were kept around and use as needed\nto plug gaps and cover asses, especially their own. . .\n\nHaving few duties as a Vee, Jimbo lectured, teamed with Lyle,\nin the nursing nutrition course.  He used to refer to them\nas a dog and pony show.  The students thought of two other\nanimals that would have described the situation better,\nsince neither man was greatly liked.\n\nThis was mainly because both had a low opinion of undergraduates,\nfelt it was beneath them to lecture at this level and didn't try\nto hide their opinion from the students.\n\nLyle and Jimbo gave these few lectures because the university policy\nof increasing administration personnel and research faculty while\ndecreasing teachers had decimated the ranks of competent instructors.\n\nUpper level administrators like Jimbo were paid in the six figure category.\nA few professors received fifty grand a year; most substantially less.\nA limited number of excellent teaching faculty worked their butts off\nteaching course after course for peanuts.  The ever burgeoning,\ncorpulent administration and research people had light duties\nand lots of play time--to say nothing of having the money to play.\n\nAt the time Diana was employed at NERD, it was not unique\nfor the research professors to spend one or two afternoons a week\non the golf course, lake or ski slopes.  Any research accomplished\nmostly fell to the technicians paid by a grant or the university.\nCitizens who donated money for research into various diseases\nwould be astonished to discover how little of their money went\ninto the research, and how much went into paying administrative salaries.\n\nAt Belmont, Friday afternoons turned into happy hours as medical\nresearch professors with their light teaching loads relaxed\ntogether in the conference room recuperating for the weekend.\n\n\nWhen Jimbo was asked to identify the two evaluations--\nthese being the two from nursing nutrition that Lyle had said\nJimbo had brought to him, he professed not to recall how they were\nfound or where.  \"I don't remember if I found them or who found them,\"\nhe stated.  \"I have seen them before, but I don't know who discovered them.\"\n\nHenry started to get nervous.  This damn jerk who found\nthose two SmurFFs professed no recollection of it.\nHe hurried into the breach.  \"What you are saying, Jimbo, is that\neither you or Lyle found them but you don't remember which.\"\n\nEven with this prompting, Jimbo couldn't hack it.\nHe looked over at Henry and smiled without speaking.\n\n\"Yes, thank you.  Of course, that's it.\"  Henry testified\nfor him and then tried to prove through Jimbo's testimony\nthat Diana had a history of conflict with department members.\n\nOnce again, Jane observed, no examples were given.  The names of\nthe individuals involved in these alleged conflicts were not given\nso there was no confimation of the testimony.  When she tried\nto get specifics on these conflicts, Jimbo answered that,\n\". . .it involved the kind of facility utilization problems\nthat one runs into in a small department.\"\n\nPursuing this, Jane asked, \"Did they have anything to do\nwith running a course or what should be taught in a course?\"\n\n\"No.\"\n\nAt this juncture, Esther, not to be outdone asked if the\ndifficulty had anything to do with her ability to teach.\n\nJimbo replied that her ability to teach had never been in question.\nHe also confirmed, much to Henry's chagrin, that Diana had worn a\nbrace on her wrist in December but could not remember exactly when.\n\nSince he had been commandeered to help in the radiology lab\nafter Diana left the course, he was asked how the medical\nstudents responded that year.  His answer indicated that\nhe believed the students generally liked the lab portion.\nHe also disclosed that the lab had not changed at all from\nwhat had been taught in previous years.\n\nNot bloody likely, thought Diana, since they copied most of the\nmaterial from my manual that they were expressly forbidden to use. . .\nthe manual that was so successful in the course for the previous two years.\n\nWhen Jimbo declared that the year Diana didn't teach, the course content was\nno different from the previous year, Henry tried to hurry him out the door.\nHe recalled all the testimony from the NERD people insisting that things\nwere much different and much improved after Diana left the course.\n\nBefore he could, Diana said, \"I have one question, Jimbo.\nWe taught that lab together for many years when you were\nchair of NERD.  During that time, it was my impression that\neach year's class could differ immensely from the previous year.\nSpecifically, one year, the class would like the way the course\nwas run, then the next year's class would hate it.  Do you agree?\"\n\n\"Yes, wholeheartedly, absolutely.\"\n\n\"Thank you.\"\n\nHenry walked Jimbo out of the hearing room wishing fervently\nthat he had never asked him to testify.  What a mess, but hopefully\nLyle could fix it.\n\n\n\n\nChapter 25\n\n\nAnn Biggot was a crawling morass of nerves.  As she explained to the panel,\nit was not really fear of retribution for what she might say, it was fear\nthat she might be understood incorrectly and that would harm either her\nchairman or Diana.  She was overwhelmed, she exclaimed, \". . .because I\nheard that this is the first Termination for Cause Hearing ever held\nin Belmont!\"\n\nWhat an airhead, Henry thought.  She swings so widely back and forth\nthat her testimony is generally contradictory and always rambling.\nWhen she criticizes Lyle, in answer to a question from the panel,\nshe, in nearly the same breath, praises him on a totally unrelated issue.\n\nLord protect me from these dithering female types, he implored,\nraising his eyes toward the ceiling.  He looked back at the\nwitness critically.  She's held her own in the looks department\nfor a woman of her age, he decided, but has let herself go to fat somewhat.\nMust be, from the looks of her about ten years or so younger than Diana.\nWell, Lyle thinks she loyal to him and that's what counts here.\n\nAnn would not confirm her niece's testimony.  Andrea had said\nher aunt thought that the excessive course load given Diana by Lyle\nwas an attempt to break her spirit or drive her from the department.\nAnn declared that she, \"could not remember saying that.  It is possible\nthat was what Andrea understood me to say.\"\n\nWhen asked directly if there was sex discrimination in the department,\nshe said that in the past, she had felt some discrimination because of sex,\nbut she knew now that this was not the case.  She gave several reasons why\nshe was not treated the same or paid as much as the males in the department.\n\n\"It probably was because my research is so much different from the rest or\nbecause Lyle was new in the position and didn't realize what he was saying.\"\n\nJane felt anger toward Ann as she listened.  She had asked around\nfor information about her when she knew Ann would be testifying.\nAnn, of all people, knew what the situation truly was because Lyle\nhad named her as the department Affirmative Action representative.\nReflecting on the efficacy of the AA program, Jane knew that Belmont,\nlike most universities around the country, had continued problems\nwith grant procurement due to being out of compliance with the laws\nconcerning discrimination and harassment.  To counter this, or rather,\nto nip any potential problems in the bud, the administration created\na setup whereby every department had an appointed representative\nfor Affirmative Action.\n\nAll complaints had to be brought to this person.  At NERD,\nthis was Ann--who in turn took them to the department chair.\nA case of the proverbial fox guarding the chickens, Jane thought wryly.\n\nThe complaints and the person complaining, the complainant,\nwere \"handled\" by a special administrative flunky.  It was made\ncrystal clear that problems would increase if one pursued a complaint.\nFaculty women on tenure track were especially vulnerable to these\nkinds of threats.\n\nIf the charge was serious and the complainant had evidence\nand witnesses, and could not be persuaded to drop the charges,\nthe common practice was to transfer the complainant to another\ndepartment.  No one could ever remember a male at Belmont being\npunished, transferred or discharged for discrimination or harassment.\n\nJane knew that Ann had heard complaints--from women in the department\nand from medical students who had suffered discrimination and harassment.\nShe shook her head sadly, wondering what she would have done in\nsimilar circumstances.  Would she also chose not to reveal the\ntruth to the committee, fearing reprisals?\n\nIn response to several other questions posed by the panel,\nAnn Biggot proclaimed that she had no fear of reprisal for her\ntestimony, but every so often a Freudian slip would break out\nfrom her careful answers.  She was confirming a question from\nDiana concerning how both of them were often overlooked when\ndepartmental journals were circulated.  \"If I didn't get a\njournal, I would just take it out of someone else's box,\" she\nsaid angrily, then with a guilty expression, \"Maybe I won't\nbe working there next week.\"\n\nJane asked, \"Does he customarily yell or get angry at people?\"\n\nAvoiding the question, Ann replied, \"The biggest problem\nwith him is getting him to put his answers down in writing.\"\n\nShe did, however, confirm that she had been asked to testify\nby Diana and had begged off.  \"Not really because of losing my\njob. . .it was just that it was so serious a charge. . .\"\n\nAnn amply substantiated what Diana had already testified to\nregarding her many attempts to communicate with Lyle and\nestablish a better relationship.  She was also generous\nwith her assertion that Diana was a totally honest person.\n\n\"We have had problems sometimes working together, but the\none thing I was sure of was her absolute, utter honesty.\nThis charge came as a horrible shock to me, and that is the truth.\n\n\"To give you an idea of how much I trust her, there are two people\nin the department that I would feel right about leaving alone\nin my office and she was one of them.  I wouldn't even trust Lyle.\"\n\nThroughout the testimony of this witness, the panel continually\ninterrupted the cross examinations of Diana.  This happened\nat especially crucial times when important evidence was\non the verge of being brought out or confirmed.  One time,\nto the chagrin of Henry and Frank, it worked in Trenchant's favor.\n\nHenry had interrupted to ask Ann about a rather damning quote\nattributed to her by Lyle which appeared on Diana's yearly\nReappointment Appraisal Sheet.  It read, \"I believe that she\n(Diana) is completely ineffective in the summer medical\nnutrition course and should be replaced.\"\n\nAnn was adamant that she had not said that.  Instead, she insisted,\n\"When the chairman came to me for my input on your appraisal,\nI told him what you had told me,\" directing her answer at Diana,\n\"which was that you felt ineffective.  I told him that I\nthought you had tried desperately hard to learn this material.\nI said to him that you were working assiduously and trying\nunremittingly but that you and I both felt that you needed\nat least another year of study to be really proficient.\"\n\nOn hearing this, Jane blanched with shock.  Here was information\nthat Lyle had falsified a senior faculty person's (Ann) appraisal\non the reappointment papers of Diana.  Anuse interrupted Diana's\nquestioning and attempted to gloss over the damning admission.\nHe suggested that it was just a misunderstanding in terms.\n\nIt didn't work because Ann was angry that her honest comments\nregarding the teaching effectiveness of Diana had been misconstrued\nin a way that was completely false and she made that clear to Anuse\nin no uncertain terms.\n\nAfter finishing off Anuse, she turned to Diana and said,\n\"For you to come into the summer course with no training at all,\nat the age of 57, and be trained to teach nutrition. . .for you\nto undertake such an endeavor amazed me.  I made it clear to Lyle\nthat she needed more time, perhaps one more summer to be\nan effective teacher--not what he quoted me as saying!\"\n\nNow the chair stepped in and advised that this was getting\nway off the subject they were there to discuss, but the panel,\nexcept for Anuse, wanted to hear more and Ann, still angry\nat the way she had been misquoted, obliged them.\n\n\". . .and the teaching load put on her.  It was a horrible\nthing to ask somebody to do--seven labs in a week plus\ndirecting the radiology lab during the first semester.\nIn the past, these labs were distributed among the graduate\nstudents and to ask one person to do that, I thought was. . .\n\n\"Remember,\" turning again to address Diana.  \"I told you it\nwas a terrible stress for you to undergo and that if I were\nsubjected to that, I couldn't do it.\"\n\nDirecting her remarks back to the panel, she continued.\n\"I know, because at one point in my life, I taught five courses\nat one time and I went about bananas after two years;\nI had to quit because of the stress.\"\n\nHenry interrupted decisively this time and announce a recess.\nThe testimony of his witness was getting entirely to sympathetic\ntoward Diana and he wanted no more references to Lyle's creative\nediting of Ann's comments on the employee appraisal form.\nFalsifying employee reappointment forms was a real no-no,\nespecially now with the union breathing down our necks, he thought.\n\n\n\n\nChapter 26\n\n\nAlready in evidence and on the record was the incident of Lyle's\ntampering with one of the so-called suspicious SmurFFs by stapling\na note written by Diana to it.  Now there was testimony that he had\nfalsified a comment by one of the senior faculty which appeared on an\nappraisal form.  One more example of evidence-tampering was still to come.\n\nWhen the hearing reconvened, Jane interrupted.  \"One moment before\nwe go on to the next witness.   A point of clarification.  From what\nI heard a little while ago, I think Diana believes that we send the\npresident the recommendation of this committee.  Now, my understanding\nwas that we do not make a recommendation, we make a report of our findings.\"\n\n\"That is correct.  We are only going to write a report.\nWe don't make recommendations.  We only make a report of the\nhearing.  That's all we are looking at,\"  Henry said frantically.\nDamn and blast, how did she get on to that and why didn't I pick up on it.\nI shudder to think what those dingy women would do if they knew that when\nmy report for this committee comes out, it will find the entire panel\nhas made a recommendation that is unanimous and it is for termination.\n\nThe hearing was about completed.  Henry could feel the relief\nflooding through him like a torrent.  Full of great expectations,\nhe announced that Lyle would be the next witness and \"all these\nlittle misunderstandings will be cleared up.\"  True to form,\nlike a well rehearsed circus act, the performance that followed\nwent off like greased lightning.  Henry allowed neither the other\nmembers of the panel nor Diana to clutter it up.\n\nFirst the clarification of number of `suspicious' SmurFFs found,\nwhen they were found and who found them.  This time, Lyle looking\nconfident and well coached, consulted his crib sheet and gave the\nanswer without circumlocution.\n\nLooking both eager and willing to help out as best he could,\nLyle earnestly spoke his piece. \"After checking with Mark who had\nthe date in the files, we found that the material was sent to the\nanalyst in the fall of last year.  There were originally three\nthat Randy and Ian had given him, not two as he had said in his\nprevious testimony.  I can't think why I said two, of course,\nI meant three.\"\n\n\"Jimbo had found and sent him the two `suspicious' nursing\nnutrition SmurFFs.\"  To prove this, he conveniently produced\na covering letter, which the chair put into evidence, that\nexpressly said that.   \". . .and, it is dated and signed by Jimbo.\n\n\"Most certainly,\" Lyle continued,  \"I never knew that Diana\nhad copyrighted the radiology manual and most certainly,\nIan and Randy did not copy from it.  That is ridiculous.\"\n\nHis pious account of the meeting with Diana in his office when\nhe told her of the document examiners findings, was ingenious.\nHe claimed to have been devastated at having to do that to an employee.\nHe had behaved with loving kindness throughout the \"very painful interview.\n\n\"Of course no one in the department or among the medical students\nwould be afraid to come and testify.  Perish the thought.\n\n\"I must have been misunderstood before when the panel got the\nimpression that ALL the critiques were good in this last year\nwhen Diana did not teach.  I thought I had made it clear that\nit was Ian's SmurFFs that had improved markedly.\"\n\nStill, Jane noted.  He did not produce them for the panel\nto confirm his testimony and the chair, despite the request\nof Diana that they be solicited, did not ask for them.\n\nWhen Henry hesitated, Trenchant reminded Lyle that student's likes\nand dislikes of an instructor could vary wildly from year to year.\n\"Remember how great your SmurFFs were in the nursing course\nthree years ago?\" She said.  \"Then the very next year, they were the pits.\nIsn't that correct?\"\n\nLyle reluctantly agreed that it was and Henry quickly took back\nthe questioning to bring Lyle to the crowning touch of his testimony\nbefore Trenchant could further discredit him.  Henry asked if he\nthought Diana was unable to write because of an injured wrist during\nthe December last evaluation period.  Proudly, Lyle presented two\noriginal handwritten documents.  \"Both of these,\" he claimed,\n\"were written by Diana and I found them in my files.\"\n\n\"This one is dated in mid December, at the time she claims\nshe could not write,\" he smirked triumphantly at Diana.\n\n\"Did you write that?\"  Henry demanded of Diana, looking smug\nand terribly well pleased with the way things were going.\n\n\"Yes, I did, but not in December.  I wrote that after\nreturning from Christmas\\New Year's vacation in January before\nthe classes started.  This note refers to equipment I would\nrequire for the room I was assigned to teach in during the winter\nsemester.  I was not assigned that room until I returned from\nvacation in January so I wouldn't be writing anything about\nfixtures in December.  This is a fact that can be verified.\n\n\"Look at this.  Trenchant held up the paper for the panel to see.\n\"The right hand corner has been torn off where I put the date\nwhich would be in January.  The date written on this note is\nat the bottom and was written in by Lyle.  The ink used is\nentirely different for the date than for the rest of the note\nand I recognize the way he makes sevens with the slash.\"\n\n\"Well, yes.\"  Lyle allowed, showing some discomfort, he had\nwritten that date in because the note wasn't dated and he put\nthe date on when he received it and that was in December.\nHe said nothing about the torn corner and looked very anxious.\n\n\"Well I kept a copy of this note which I can bring in showing\nthe date to be where this piece was torn off and that date will\nbe in January.\"  Trenchant announced, turning to the committee members.\n\"Once more, evidence in this hearing has been tampered with.\"\n\n\"It won't be necessary to see your copy,\"  Henry ruled, hastily.\n\"I'm sure this is just a difference that occurs where each person\nremembers the date a bit differently.  There is no attempt to tamper here. . .\"\n\n\n\n\nChapter 27\n\n\nHenry nervously dismissed Lyle and directed the committee's\nattention toward Diana to distract them from further questioning.\n\"We have finished with the witnesses in this hearing.\nIf you have a brief summation or anything you want to say in closing,\nwe will hear it, go ahead,\" he ordered.  \"First, however, you and\nthe stenographer may take a break while the panel confers.\"\n\n\nInstead of leaving after he had finished testifying,\nJimbo Jones had gone back to the waiting room to pick up\nhis belongings.  Except for Jonathan, the room was empty\nof people now that the hearing was winding down.\n\n\"Hello, how goes it,\"  Jonathan greeted him.  He had been\nmaking himself available in the committee waiting room a few\nhours every day as Henry had ordered.  This was so it would\nappear that Trenchant had the availability of counsel from\nthe ombudsman if the matter ever came up.\n\n\"Not bad.  Henry seems a mite wound up though.  Can't understand why.\nThe whole academic council decided to terminate her, what is he getting\nall haired out about?\"\n\n\"As I understand it,\" Jonathan offered, leaning toward Jimbo\nand lowering his voice into a conspiratorial, confidential tone,\nTrenchant has managed to bring forth a good defense and has the\nhearing panel pretty well divided.  Only Frank Anuse is going\nalong with Henry.  The women are looking at the evidence and they\naren't convinced.  Jane confided in me during the last break that\nshe thought it was possible that Trenchant had been framed.\"\n\n\"What the hell would give her that idea,\" grinned Jimbo, with a sly wink.\n\n\"Quiet, keep your voice down.\"  Jonathan moved away from\nJimbo and closed the hearing room door.  \"Well, for one thing,\none of the SmurFFs you found was evidently written by a student.\nShe came forward and identified it.  That really casts doubt on\nthe ability of the document examiners.\"\n\n\"One I found?  I just don't understand all this.  Everyone keeps\ntelling me that I found some SmurFFs in my course.  Lyle, Henry, Mark\nand now you.  I don't remember it and I told the panel that just\na few minutes ago.\"\n\n\"You told the panel that?  Good God, Jimbo, Henry was\ndepending on you to confirm that you had found them.\nLyle is probably showing them the note you wrote right now.\"\n\n\"Come off it, Jonathan.  Lyle didn't say anything about lying\nto the panel and it was that cute Janie babe that asked.\nIf Trenchant had asked the question, I would have said that I\nhad found them.  No problem.  All Lyle asked me to do was write\nand date the note last year sometime.  Nobody asked me about that.\"\n\nThank heavens, thought Jonathan.  Aloud, he said, \"You'd better\nkeep that under your hat, Jimbo.  From what Jane tells me,\nLyle has been pretty creative with the evidence already.\"\n\n\"So what?\" Jimbo replied, expansively.  \"That's his part of\nthe scheme.  After all, he's the one that wants to get rid of her.\"\n\n\"Yes, you're right, but be careful about saying things like that.\nYou never know who will hear and try to make something of it.\nOh, by the way, did you hear that Kate left Henry?  He said she\nwas gone when he got home last night--just left him a note.\"\n\n\"No shit.  Who'd she catch him doin' it with?\"\n\n\"Well from what I hear. . .\"\n\nThe two men gossiped cozily until the members of the panel\narrived to announce that the hearing had ended.\n\n\n\"Proceed with your summary,\" Henry commanded indifferently\nwhen everyone was back in place at the table.\n\nDiana Trenchant finished making a note and then said, \"Yes,\nI have some closing words, but first, I want to point out that\nI was given no opportunity to present rebuttal witness as you did.\"\n\nAnuse shifted in his seat, then carefully and slowly, as if\nhe were speaking to a retarded person, said, \"You misunderstand.\nThey were not rebuttal witnesses.  We had them come to clarify\nthings that your witnesses said.\"\n\nBull! thought Diana.  Aloud, she continued, \"They contradicted\nsome of my evidence and I was not given a chance to CLARIFY\ntheir testimony with my witnesses.\"\n\nWhat is she trying to pull now, Henry moaned to himself,\nbut much to his surprise, Diana pulled her notes in front\nof her and began her closing remarks.\n\n\"Now, for the first charge--that I created false SmurFFs.\nI have shown that the document examiner erred regarding the\n`suspect' SmurFFs they examined.  One, at least, was a recognized\nstudent written evaluation.  Therefore, their opinion on all\nof the documents is open to question.  Several witnesses have\ntestified as to the wrist injury I sustained, showing that I could not\nhave written the two SmurFFs Lyle said he found in the course last year.\n\n\"Also, the `suspect' SmurFFs from previous years are highly dubious\nas evidence of anything.  They are not dated and there has been\nno discernible chain of custody established.  Ian could not even\nidentify them and disagreed with Randy that they were somehow different\nfrom the rest of the evaluations received.\n\n\"I remind you again that document examiners are not\ninfallible and that only a couple of small examples of\nmy handwriting were submitted to them that were NOT copies.\nWe have just seen that Lyle had other examples of original writing\nof mine.  Why didn't they submit original writing as standards\nor better yet, authenticate the standards by having them written\nin the presence of the document examiner?\n\n\"In point of fact, none of the writing used as standards\nwere authenticated and this makes them moot.\n\n\"The second charge, that I submitted these `suspect' documents\nas student SmurFFs, is unproven.  That is because none of the\nstudent SmurFFs for those years in question can be validated.\nThis is because of the way the evaluation process is administered.\nTherefore, a chain of custody for the so-called suspicious SmurFF's\nwas not and cannot be established.\n\n\"In the 25 years that I have worked at this university, I have never\nbeen accused of dishonesty.  My work has not been criticized.\nMy teaching ability has always been praised.  The biggest criticism\nthat I have received is that I am at times abrasive.\n\n\"You have heard enough to form the obvious conclusion about\nhow I was treated in the department and how heavy my teaching\nload was.  I hope you will pay attention to the fact that right\nhere under oath, Lyle, the person who has made these charges\nagainst me, has tampered with the evidence three times.\"\n\nJane was impressed.  She's right.  He attached a note written\nby Diana to one of the suspicious SmurFFs; detrimentally misquoted\nAnn's evaluation of Diana's performance on promotion sheets\nand now this last note which very obviously has a large piece\ntorn off from the corner.  He must have been told they needed\nproof that she could write during that time so he tore off\nthe real date and wrote in one in December.  What a scumball.\n\nDiana continued, \"I want to thank you all very much for the\nopportunity to finally respond and disprove these outrageous\ncharges.  Thank you.\"\n\nBefore Henry could speak, Jane said, \"Diana, I was interested\nin what you had to say about the F.B.I. and the information regarding\ndocument examination.  Is there something further that you would suggest\nwe look at?\"\n\n\"Yes.  You should research this so-called science or art as I did.\nRead about the Hitler Diaries and the White Salamander Papers.\nLearn why authenticated, original standards are important. . .\n\n\"I also again request that you procure the SmurFFs for the\nradiology instructors and course given last year and see how\nthe testimony you have just heard has misrepresented them.\"\n\n\"Is that it then?\"  Henry could just barely keep the ugliness\nhe felt out of his voice.\n\nAt Diana's nod, Henry said, \"We must end this.  I don't think\nwe'll need any further hearings,\" said Henry, stacking up his pile\nof files and papers and preparing to stand up.  \"You will hear from us\nas soon as possible.  Perhaps as soon as two weeks.  Certainly no longer\nthan a month.  We will have our report for you and the president then.\"\n\nThat was mid-June.\n\n\n\n\n\nACADEMIC JUSTICE\n\n\n\nChapter 28\n\n\nIt is the first of July.  The committee has met two times\nsince the hearing ended.  The first time, the split was three\nto two.  The three women were resolute that there was not\nenough evidence to believe that Diana had written the documents.\nThey did not put much credence into the report of the document\nexaminer and they didn't believe Lyle.\n\nHenry could not and would not agree to write the report\nannouncing this to The Pope.  His instructions were clear\n--get Trenchant.  Seeking distance, he suggested that they should,\nin any event, wait for the complete transcript of the hearing.\nWhen that had arrived and everyone had refreshed their memories,\nthey would hold another meeting.\n\nThe second meeting, held two weeks later, lasted four hours.\nBy the end of the session, everyone was tired and angry\nand no one had moved from their original position.\nIt was a battle of the transcript.  Not only had Anuse\nand Henry burned the midnight oil preparing for the meeting\nwith suitable quotes from the transcript, but the same\ncould be said of Jane, Esther and Annette.\n\nAs tempers, which had so far been under control, flared\nand threatened to widen the gulf between the two sides,\nHenry realized that the arguments were just solidifying\nthe opposition and, damn it to hell, they were the majority!\nSince the handwriting evidence was so shaky, he dared not\nforce the issue. He would find another way.\n\nHe quickly called an end to it, told them tersely that\nhe would let them know when the next meeting would be\nand then before anyone else moved, he left the room.\n\n\n\n\nChapter 29\n\n\nAugust slipped into September.\n\nWhat's happening with the hearing?   Everyone was asking.\nNo one had an answer.\n\nThen the president of N.O.W, Ellie Smeal, came on campus to give\na speech.  The room was packed with women from all over campus.\nAfterwards, Esther saw Diana and went up to her.\n\n\"What is going on?  Have you heard anything?\" she inquired.\n\n\"You're the one on the committee.  I haven't heard anything\nsince the hearing ended.  You guys told me a month, tops.\nHaven't you been writing the report?\"  Trenchant answered tersely.\nShe was becoming increasingly strung out by the delay and by\nthe obvious fact that the committee chair had once again lied to her.\n\n\"Oh,\" said Esther, alarm showing on her pudgy face,  \"I'm not\nsupposed to talk about it.  I haven't heard anything.\"\nShe finished, walking away leaving Diana more in the dark\nthan ever. . .and more apprehensive.\n\nOctober dropped its leaves.\n\nNovember brought an early snow.\n\nChristmas flashed brightly, dulled and stood aside for the\nstart of a new year.\n\nIt had been nearly seven months since the hearing had ended\nbut Henry had not been idle.  After the debacle of the second\nmeeting of the panel, The Pope and Henry had decided to send the\nmaterial away for confirmation by another document examiner.\nThe women on the panel were not privy to this information.\n\"If they can't cooperate, leave them out in the cold,\"\nwas Henry's decision.\n\n\n\"How many had you contacted before you found this one, Henry?\"\nFrank Anuse had stopped by Henry's office in the administration building\nat Henry's invitation.  A great deal of time had gone by and he had\nbeen getting edgy with all the questions aimed at him by concerned faculty.\nIt was great to have some positive results.  Even though he couldn't\nbroadcast them, he could give his inquisitors a knowing look\nand indicate that it was in the bag.\n\n\"This makes the fourth.  The bastards take forever to make\nup their minds.  They say they are busy with other analyses,\nbut you'd think with all we're paying them that. . .\"\nHenry shook his head in disgust.\n\n\"And they all said the same thing.  They didn't like to\nmake a positive match using copies of the standards we sent?\"\nFrank Anuse asked.\n\n\"That's it.  They all wanted originals.\"\n\n\"The guy that has them now though, called and said essentially\nthe same thing at first, except he thought if he could have a lot\nmore standards, he could make a decision even if they were copies.\"\n\n\"And. . .\"\n\n\"And, I sent off copies of everything in her personnel file.\"\n\n\"You mean forms and such like?  Don't they have other people's\nwriting on them besides Trenchant's?\"\n\n\"Oh, yes, but that doesn't matter.  The main thing is\nwe got confirmation.  The guy will testify to that and then\nthose damn lady-professors are going to toe the line, or else.\"\n\n\"You've already sent Trenchant the copies and notice of the next hearing?\"\n\n\"Yup.  Did it this morning.  Same mail as I sent it to the rest\nof the committee.\"\n\n\"Seems as though it would have been simpler just to have her write\nsomething in front of witnesses and use those originals instead\nof farting around all this time with copies,\" Anuse suggested.\n\"This process has taken nearly a year already.\"\n\n\"There's reasons.  Not something you and I have to know about,\nbut there's reasons.  Anyway, here's your copy.  Enjoy.\"\n\n\n\n\nChapter 30\n\n\nA registered package arrived for Diana.  It contained copies\nof the `suspect' SmurFFs and copies of the standards that she\nhad seen before at the hearing.  Also enclosed were many\nother documents, apparently copied from microfiche files.\nThese copies were atrocious, all spotty with black dots and lines.\nMost of the letters were blurred and some parts were unreadable.\n\nThe package also contained a report from another document examiner.\nThis one agreed that Diana had written six of the eight documents\nsent to them for analysis, but was not sure of two of them.\nJust like the previous examiners--except it wasn't the\nsame two they indicated.\n\nNevertheless, the cover letter, signed by Henry, decreed that\nthis was supportive testimony and the hearing would reconvene\nin five days to present this evidence formally to Diana.\nAt that time she would be given an opportunity to cross examine\nthe so-called expert testimony of the document examiner.\n\nThis time Henry was taking no chances.  This time, the document\nexaminer was male.\n\nDiana and her supporters were not terribly surprised by\ncontents of the package.  It did, however, confirm that as\nfar as the Belmont administration was concerned, she would be\nconvicted even if they had to move heaven and earth to prove it.\n\nThe initial hearing of three days, the official protocol,\nthe declarations of good faith made by the panel members--\nall a sham.  She'd waited long enough.  It was time to\nseek help outside of Belmont U.\n\nPart of her decision to take this path was made in response to the\noutpouring of support from the staff, faculty and students of Belmont.\nThese people, many of whom felt repressed themselves, knew that there\nwas no way that justice or fairness could be brought about within\nthe university structure.  Anyone who had experience with university\npolitics completely subscribed to the dubious accolade that\nuniversity politics were the meanest of all types known to exist.\n\nMany were angry that the whole rotten business evolved around\na mere seven out of several hundred forms--all of which in the\nnormal course of events would have been ignored.\n\nThere was frustration as well.  They felt helpless and many\nwere sickened at their lack of ability to effect any change.\nBy sending money to Diana, \"to help with legal expenses,\"\nthey could mitigate their helplessness and their fear.\n\nEfforts were initiated to bring the affair before the\nFaculty Senate but they were quashed as soon as they started by\nthe new Senate president, former ombudsman, Jonathan Bambridge.\n\nTrustees were approached by supporters as well as university\nalumni groups.  There was sympathy, but no one wanted to risk\ntheir position against the very real power wielded by the administration.\n\nSeveral women faculty went to the Pope and pleaded for him to intercede.\nThese were brave women.  They took to the meeting with the university\npresident examples of many cases of proven misconduct that had occurred\non campus.  In every case, no man had ever been terminated.  They reminded\nhim that this was the first time at Belmont that a termination for cause\ncharge had been made, and that it was against a woman.\n\nThe group of faculty women begged him to reconsider.  To press\nsuch minuscule charges in the first place had been a mistake.\nThe information had spread across campus, the town and the state,\nmaking almost every person who heard of it laugh at first,\nthen as they realized that it was not a joke become indignant.\n\n\"The publicity already has been harmful and it can only get\nworse if this hearing is continued,\" one of the professors\nurgently stated to The Pope.  \"Why do you continue with this?\"\n\nThey were told that the decision to prosecute was final and that\nthere was nothing they could do.  Then they were shown the door.\n\nThe same sort of treatment was given to staff and students\nexcept that they usually got shorter shrift.  Islands of\nconcerned people protested but never joined in concert.\nIt was not a safe undertaking at Belmont University.  Not if\nyou wanted to keep your position.  As Edmund Burke observed,\n\"When bad men combine, the good must associate;\nelse they will fall one by one, an unpitied\nsacrifice in a contemptible struggle.\"\n\nThe final straw that tipped the balance and sent Diana to an\nattorney to fight the inevitable termination was an editorial\nthat appeared in THE PROD, the Belmont student newspaper.\nIn a strongly worded article it condemned the undemocratic\njudicial process of the Belmont administration, which flouted\nthe laws of the state and made up its own to fit each occasion.\nThe editorial compared Belmont's disciplinary process to feudal times.\n\n\nIt was titled:\n\n\nPUNISHING THE VICTIM\n\n\n. . .Dr. Diana Trenchant was accused of wrong doing.\nTherefore, she was tried by a jury of her accusers\nin accordance with university policy.\nAlthough two witness, who in any court would be\ncalled `expert' witnesses, testified against her,\nshe was not allowed an adequate defense--that is,\nthe service of an attorney who would be competent\nto cross examine so-called expert testimony.\nShe was also not allowed access to documents\nneeded in her own defense.\n\nShe will most certainly be summarily terminated--\ndeprived of her livelihood without due process--\nanother victim of Belmont Kangaroo Kort Justice.\n\n\n\n\"That does it,\" she told Andrea and James whose support\nhad never wavered throughout the ordeal.  \"I refuse to be one\nof Burke's `unpitied sacrifice'.  More specifically, I refuse\nto be their victim.  Perhaps the courts can do something.\nLet's give it a shot.\"\n\nThe women on the panel took a lot of heat for the reconvening\nof the hearing.  Ricocheting across campus were the whisperings\nand lamentations of Esther as she endeavored to absolve herself from blame.\n\nJane's battle with her conscience reached only the ears of her\nclosest friends, but her glacial features and bent posture bespoke\nher frustration and her impotency.\n\nThe saddest of all was Annette who had quietly borne the conflicting\nwaves of testimony that flowed over her at the hearing.  She had dared\nto speak up a couple of times, but now she knew that it had been a mistake.\nWhatever Henry asked her to sign, she would sign.  Without question,\nwithout hesitation, but not with good conscience.  His visit to her\nand his carefully chosen words concerning his knowledge\nof her life-style had left no doubt remaining that\nthe threat of exposure was real.\n\n\nDiana found out early on that it would be unwise to place\ntoo much confidence in the judicial system.  She discovered\nthat a court cares nothing about right or wrong, good or bad.\nIt cares only about what the law is, can you prove it,\nand who proves it in the most entertaining manner.\n\nThe Attorney General had told Diana that an additional hazard\nwas that this was a civil rights case--sex discrimination.\nThe current federal administration had knocked the hell out of\nmost of the laws pertaining to sex or age discrimination\nand greatly weakened any remaining.  The EEOC was acting like\na toothless pussy cat under the direction of a staunch Reagan\\Bush\nconservative whose payoff would be a seat on the Supreme Court.\n\nHowever, for all its drawbacks, it was the only game in town.\nA choice, instead of giving up.  Besides, Diana was overwhelmed\nwith the magnitude of support in the form of cold cash from the\nuniversity community and alumni.  She had to at least have the faith\nin herself that others had shown--but the cost!  Enough to make her\nfrugal Yankee blood congeal in horror.\n\nWell, no help for it, she thought.  She carefully figured out\njust how far she could go with what she had and what had been given her.\nThat far she would go and no further.  She'd give the court a chance,\nbut she wouldn't bet the whole farm on it and certainly not the rest\nof her life.  Decidedly not in a city where the old boy network\nwas so substantial and entrenched that it kept its meeting place\na male bastion and ruled the entire state from it.  Not to mention\nthat The Pope was a prepaid member--a perk traditionally given\nBelmont's president.\n\n\n\n\nChapter 31\n\n\nEver since the original charges had been made, the Public\nProtection Division of the Attorney General's Office had been\ninvestigating the case brought to it by Diana.  It functioned\nto protect the legal rights of Diana and provide a copy of its\nreport to the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC).\n\nIt had been denied access to the previous three day hearing by\nthe Belmont administration, but was promised the hearing transcript.\nAfter a great deal of prompting, the transcript, all 700 pages of it,\nhad been sent to the Attorney General's Office as agreed.\n\nIt was copied and shared with the attorney representing Diana, Al Garrett.\nHe was appalled at the way the university administration had handled\nthe hearing and felt that all that was needed was to hit the\nuniversity administration with legal paperosa plentimus\nand they would soon see reason.\n\nHe was unaware that the age of reason had not yet penetrated\nBelmont University.  Their axiom was, `Reason?  There is no reason,\nit's company policy.'\n\nThe ensuing legal detritus delayed the reconvening of the\nsecond round of the university hearing, but didn't prevent it.\nIn the short time given, Diana obtained affidavits from a\nprominent document examiner and a promise of testimony\nfrom the university psychologist.\n\n\nA court reporter was once again recording the proceedings,\nbut it wasn't Janet.  The surroundings had changed also.\nNow, they were all sitting around a table in a very large\nauditorium in the English Department.\n\nDiana had an attorney present, but university policy prevented\nhim from doing anything except whisper instructions to her.\nOf course, they had talked beforehand and had planned how\nthe defense part and cross examination would go.  Even so,\nthe attorney was still in the court mode--he had little\nor no concept of a university hearing and much of what\nwent on left him stunned with disbelief and unable to\nprovide much direction.  When he tried, whispering furtively\ninto Diana's ear to do this or say that, it made Diana\nlittle more than a puppet dangling on one string,\nand just as effective.  One thing for certain,\nthought Diana as the hearing progressed,\nsomeone should tell lawyers about breath mints!\n\nAs soon as she could gain recognition from the chair,\nDiana requested that the hearing be open.  \"The purpose\nof a closed hearing in personnel matters is to protect the employee.\nI waive that protection.\"  To herself, she thought, I know from\nexperience that I have much more protection in public opinion\nthan I have as a member of the faculty of Belmont University.\n\n\"Interested citizens and the press are waiting outside.\nThey were prevented from coming in.  I respectfully request that\nthey be allowed to enter.\"  Prevented was right,  she thought,\na plethora of Kampus Kops was guarding the door of the hearing room.\nHenry was indeed worried that the goings-on in the hearing room might\nbe observed by an impartial observer and had taken steps to prevent it.\n\n\"No.\"  He answered, \"It is the policy of the university that\nhearings be closed.  We will now proceed to the testimony\nof the second document examiner.\"\n\nHenry was pleased to note that while Amos Avery, the handwriting analyst,\nwas being sworn, the panel members played with the files on the table\nin front of them.  He had met with each of the women individually\nand had whipped them into line.  His eyes sparkled as he recalled\ntheir helplessness and his feelings of power.\n\nHenry next proceeded to enter into evidence various letters\nand the handwriting documents. Diana, under instructions from\nher attorney, objected.  Objections which would have been\ngiven credence in a court of law were just ignored by Henry.\nThe only thing all the legal patter accomplished was to increase\nthe tension and the red in his face.\n\nWell, I'll just have to bear it, he thought grimly.  That sharp lawyer,\nSimon Murrain, hired by The Pope to advise them on both hearings\nhad been adamant.  \"Always let her speak.  You can interrupt her witnesses,\nyou can even ignore what she says or refuse what she may request.\nBut always let her have her say.  We can't have her complaining that\nshe didn't get a fair hearing.\"  Henry remembered how he had laughed\nat the simplicity of that strategy.\n\nConcerning what she was saying now, Henry wasn't about to pay\nany attention.  The objections Trenchant was making were important,\nhaving to do with the evidence.  The writing used as standards\nwere still not authenticated.  The copies of microfiche files\nwere almost unreadable due to their being covered with dots and black lines.\n\nIn contention were the extra standards that this analyst had requested\nsince he could not be sure of the authorship of the `suspect' SmurFFs\nusing the same standards provided to the first analyst.\n\n\"You are not following any rules of evidence here,\"\nTrenchant was continuing.  \"You are just submitting things\non a whim.  You have given this examiner copies--very bad copies--\nof material supposedly from my personnel file covering a period\nof over twenty years.  Even if authentic, these documents contain\nthe handwriting or printing of at least seven other people,\nposibly more, and I see nothing that delineates which of all these\ndifferent writings is supposed to be the standard,\" she argued.\n\n\"Some of the writing on these was written entirely by my\ndaughter or son,\"  Diana held up the documents for inspection.\n\"These tuition exemption forms were filled out and signed\nwith my name by either my son or my daughter, for example.\nThe rest of the writing is by a personnel officer.\n\n\"I am surprised that you didn't send samples of writing from\nthe entire university while you were at it,\" she finished sarcastically,\ndisgust clearly portrayed in her voice and on her face.\n\n\"This hearing is being held solely to hear the report of this\ndocument examiner.  You will be given a chance to comment on his report,\"\nHenry continued, blithely ignoring Diana's protest.\n\n\"Who made these rulings?\"  queried Diana, prompted by Al.\n\n\"Pardon me?\" Henry asked.\n\n\"Who made the rulings concerning the admissibility of these standards?\"\n\n\"I am reading the ground rules for this hearing which are contained\nin my letter to you.  I am entering it into the proceedings.\"\n\n\"So.  Who made the ruling?  Not the committee!\"\n\n\"The committee is aware of these things.\"\n\n\"The committee is just going along with whatever you propose.\nWhy can't you admit that you are making the rules of evidence?\nWhy do we need the rest of the panel?\"\n\n\"The committee made the decision and can speak up if they\ndo not agree.\"  All of the women on the panel busily shuffled\npapers and Anuse beamed like a misplaced beacon.  The silence\nof the panel told it all.  Three cowered, two glowed.\nHenry was confident.\n\nWell, thought Diana, we knew it would be a struggle.\nTurning to the material she and Al had prepared, she read\ninto the record, once again, that she wanted an open hearing.\nThat SHE had nothing to hide.\n\nContinuing on, she brought out other legal points that Al\nfelt needed to be in the record.  \"We have over and over again\nrequested documents from the university and been denied them.\nYou have provided me with nothing with which I can dispute your case.\nI am referring to some six hundred student SmurFFs that were referred\nto by your witnesses in the last hearing, over thirty times,\nyet never once were they given into evidence.\"\n\n\"What are you going on about?\"  Anuse feigned boredom.\n\n\"I am talking about the student SmurFFs that I requested at\nthe last hearing.  The charge was made that the `suspect' SmurFFs\nwere totally different from normal student SmurFFs and I need\nthose for you to see that in reality, they are quite similar.\"\n\n\"I'm willing to believe the testimony that they exist and\nwhat they are represented to be.  I don't need to see them\nin person.\"  Nonchalantly, Anuse destroyed any illusion\nof committee impartiality with this remark.  The committee's\nreport to The Pope would remove any doubt that might linger.\n\nHenry called a recess.  It always seemed to work to break up the flow.\n\n\n\n\nChapter 32\n\n\nWhen the hearing commenced again, the document examiner began\nhis testimony.  \"I have examined the documents in question\nand found that six were written by Diana Trenchant and two probably were.\"\n\nAllen Avery was a tall, heavy-set man, florid of face and\nnearly as ugly as Jimbo.  He looked like a twenty-year cop\nand lowered his monster brows fiercely at Diana whenever he\nreferred to her.  His presentation was not as ornate as that\nof Alice Stebbins.  Instead of using blown up photographs\nof individual letters, he passed out copies of a single sheet\non which there were two columns of letters.\n\nOne column was labeled standard, the other unknown.\nHe testified that he had found enough similarities\nin these particular letters to identify the writer.\n\nFrank Anuse asked if another examiner would find the same\nsimilarities in the same letters.\n\nThe answer was, \"Given equal training, they should pick out\nthe same things that I did.\"  He went on to explain that examples\nwere given in books and the document examiners studied the books.\n\nOn being asked if the material could have been written by\nan expert forger, he answered much differently than the first\ndocument examiner. \"Who would know?  I'm not saying it couldn't\nbe done, but I don't feel that it was.\"  If the women on the\npanel had been alert, they would have challenged a scientist that\nfelt a conclusion--feelings were more in the realm of the arts.\nScience was supposed to deal with facts.\n\nHe explained that he had asked for more standards because\nthe ones sent were not complete.  Yet the first analyst had said\nshe was one-hundred-percent certain on the basis of what was sent.\n\n\"I wanted more recent samples to see what variations there were.\nWe don't write every letter the same every time.  We look for the range.\"\n\nAsked if handwriting analysis was as exact as fingerprints,\nhe said, \"It is as individual and as unique as fingerprints.\"\nYet when asked if a number of different analysts looked at the\nsame documents, would they all agree, he answered, \"If they had\nequal training and experience.\"\n\nAfter a short recess, Diana was allowed to examine the witness.\nHer first question was directed toward the authenticity of the\nstandards submitted.  \"Do you know of your own knowledge that\nthe exemplars sent to you were all written by me?\"\n\n\"No.\"\n\nShe turned to Henry and said, \"then, I request that this report\nbe removed from evidence since it states facts that this examiner\ndeclares are false.\"\n\nWhile Henry looked at her incredulously, she read from the\nexaminer's report, illustrating all the places where the\nstandards were referred to as being her handwriting or printing.\n\nHenry was outraged.  \"Of course, when he writes that in his\nreport, he means that he is using my communication with him.\nI wrote that these were samples of your handwriting, that I\nhad every reason to believe that they were.\"\n\nDiana persisted.  \"I see nothing in the report to the effect\nthat he was `told' anything as you state.  He very definitely\nwrites that they ARE standards of my handwriting.  Now he says\nunder oath that he does not know.  These errors nullify the report.\"\n\n\"I feel that the report tells us what we asked from the document examiners.\"\nWith that, Henry thought, the book is closed.  No one could argue with that.\nYou get what you pay for. Case closed.\n\nDoggedly, Diana continued.  \"Did you do a top of the letter pattern?\"\n\n\"I beg your pardon.  Would you explain what you mean by\ntop of the letter pattern?\"\n\nWith subsequent questions, Diana established that he did\nnot know what bottom of the letter pattern, space pattern\nor slant pattern were.  These techniques, common to document\nexaminers, were completely unknown to this so-called expert.\nTrenchant explained to him what these common handwriting tests\nwere all about.\n\nIt was then established that he only did a letter comparison.\nHe claimed that the other tests or techniques, \"were done by graphologists.\"\nHis attitude made crystal clear that he considered graphologists to be\na very dirty word.  \"I,\" he continued, with a conceited accent on the word,\n\"am a document examiner.\"  When Diana named her source of information\nand held up the book of a prominent document examiner, his reply was,\n\"That person must come from a different viewpoint that I do.\"\n\n\"It appears that what you refer to as graphologists,\nin your profession, are much more thorough in their\nanalysis of handwriting and printing than you are.\nThe author of this book makes a point of insisting on\noriginal, authenticated standards and doing several different\ntypes of measurements.  The idea being that when they decide\na document's author, it is based on several different tests.\n\n\"You did only a letter by letter comparison then.  Every letter?\"\n\n\"A majority of them.\"\n\nIt turned out not to be the case.  Diana brought up letter after\nletter that the analyst had not found a match to. \"S\" was one of them.\nLooking hastily through the so-called standards, Avery finally found one,\nbut it was a printed capital \"S\" which he was saying was a match\nfor a small case scripted \"s\" found at the end of a word.\nFor all that time and trouble, he discovered it in a signature\npurported to have been written by Diana twenty years ago!\nThis document also contained the writing of more than one person,\nand the signature itself was written by Diana's daughter.\n\nOther discrepancies were brought out.  T's that were not\ncrossed, small i's with a backward slant, the written letter R\nwhich looked like a U.  These and other examples of letters found\nin the `suspicious' SmurFFs, were not found to be represented in\ntwenty years worth of material allegedly copied from the files.\n\n\"It doesn't matter,\" Avery asserted.  \"I mean it is entirely\npossible that the writer could have made an R like that even\nthough I can't show you an example.\"\n\n\"You were given samples of what you were told was my\nhandwriting that covered twenty to thirty years?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"Is it not true that a person's handwriting may change due to\ninjury or disease such as osteoporosis, rheumatism or arthritis?\"\n\n\"I would agree that a person's handwriting can change over the years.\"\n\n\"Do you know of any statistical studies pertaining to the accuracy\nof handwriting analysis?\"\n\n\"Accuracy?\"\n\n\"Yes.  Is it 50%, 75% or 100% accurate?  Do you know of any studies made?\"\n\n\"It is 100% accurate.  It is allowed in the courts.\"\n\n\"Wait a minute.  Are you saying the courts have made a study?\"\n\n\"I don't know if such a study has been made.  But the courts\nallow handwriting identification testimony to be given.\"\n\n\"That is damn different than statistical tests of accuracy.\nTell me this.  Courts allow juries to give verdicts of guilty or not guilty,\nis that correct?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"That doesn't mean that they are always correct in their assessment,\nthat just means that the court accepts it, right?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"You are aware that the courts accept and allow testimony\nfrom any number of so-called experts in many different fields\nsuch as doctors, psychologists, engineers and natural scientist,\njust to name a few?\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"This does not necessarily mean that all of these are\none hundred percent correct in their testimony.\nIt just means that the court accepts and allows it.\nIs that correct?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"Sources of error can exist in handwriting analysis, can they not?\nThere are a lot of judgment calls just like there is in most professions,\nisn't that correct?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"So we really have no evidence that handwriting analysis is infallible.\nIn fact, there are document examiners that are honest enough not to claim that.\"\n\n\"Well, they must be graphologists.  We are on a different basis\nand it cannot be carried over to what we are doing.\"\n\nTrenchant then named a well known document examiner\nand asked if Avery knew of him.\n\n\"Of course.\"\n\n\"Is he a graphologist?\"\n\n\"No.\"\n\n\"We talked to him about this situation and asked him questions.\nUnfortunately, it was much too expensive to bring him here to testify,\nhowever, he did agree to make an affidavit.  I will read from it now.\nQuote. `It is my opinion that the identification of handwriting\nis not as positive as fingerprint identification.  While a document examiner\nmay feel that his or her opinion is 100 percent positive, the facts are\nthat the opinion is based on qualifications, training, experience\nand judgment, any of which may be limiting or otherwise subject\nto question.  In addition, the known standards used in the\ncomparison for the Belmont case may be tainted or under dispute.'\"\n\n\"I don't agree.\"  The document examiner said, visibly upset.\n\nHenry called a recess.\n\nWhen the session opened again, Diana asked, \"If you had your druthers,\nwould you agree with other document examiners that original standards\nare preferable to copies?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"You have said that you could not reach a conclusion from\nthe first lot of so-called standards sent to you.  If you had\nnot been sent all that additional material going back 20 to 30\nyears, what would have been your conclusion?\"\n\n\"I would have no conclusion.\"\n\n\"I am interested in your report of this note.  The other\nunknown material you were sent was written on evaluation forms.\nI am speaking now of the note.\"  Trenchant held up her copy.\n\nAvery nodded and located his copy among the papers before\nhim on the table.\n\n\"Now, you report that you cannot be sure of the authorship\nof this note which has quite a few words but you can be sure of\nthe authorship of this evaluation form which has only two words.\"\n\nAvery found the other document referred to and looked at them\nand then at his notes.  \"Yes,\" he agreed.  \"I could not be sure\nof the note because it contains block printing.\"\n\n\"So do these other SmurFFs that you say you have identified.\nThere is some block printing on the note that we are talking about,\nbut most of it is small case printing.\"\n\n\"Well, there were not enough individualistic examples\nin the note to be sure.\"\n\nHenry wished that they had never let that note be sent to\nthe document examiners.  It had been nothing but trouble and\nwas not related to the SmurFF forgery that Diana was charged with.\nThat damn note which had come out of nowhere--reportedly given Lyle\nby his good friend but never verified, was not identified as being\nwritten by Diana by either of the two document examiner firms.\nThe two examiners also differed on the identification of\none of the `suspect' medical school SmurFFs.  One was sure\nof Exhibit 2 but not of 3.  The other was sure of 3 but not of 2.\nHenry recalled that now both document examiner witnesses agreed\nthat the handwriting did change over the years.  Jesus, if this\nwoman keeps it up, she'll destroy all our evidence.  Quickly,\nHenry stepped in and Amos Avery, the second document examiner\nthat the Belmont administration had hired, was excused.\n\n\n\n\nChapter 33\n\n\nAfter Avery left the hearing room, Diana put the expert\ndocument examiner's affidavit, that she had read from,\ninto evidence.  The expert had sworn in this affidavit\nthat all of the student evaluations for the medical school\ncourses for those years should be analyzed.  It was possible\nthat another person or persons had handwriting or printing\nthat was similar to Diana's.  She read this portion to the\ncommittee and added that she hoped they would read the\ncomplete affidavit which contained several pages of the\ndocument examiner's credentials.\n\nAll along, the women kept their eyes either on these papers\nor on the witness.  They steadfastly refused to look at Diana\nor at the chair.  They asked few questions of the witness,\ntonelessly, and did not ask any follow up or clarifying questions.\n\nAnnette gives new dimension to the act of keeping a low profile,\nthought Henry.  Her demeanor resembles that of a puppy that has\njust been whipped for pissing on the new carpet.  Jane, on the\nother hand, adopts a superior mien.  Her greatly elevated nose\nbrings her whole being into an altitude seemingly far above\nthe detestable situation she finds herself in.\n\nAs for Esther, well, she's a wreck.  Never terribly lucid\nin her thought processes, she babbles incoherently and then\napologizes when asked to repeat them.  Her piggy eyes dart\nfrom witness to her papers in a flurry of indecisiveness.\n\nFrank Anuse is up to form though and really enjoying it.\nHenry watched Frank proudly as he flung Diana a shit eatin' grin\nat every opportunity and at times actually taunted her in a way\nreminiscent of a town bully.\n\nAt this point in the proceedings, Anuse laughed aloud in a derisive,\ntaunting fashion, causing everyone on the panel to look at him\nin shocked silence.  The chair put up a warning hand.\n\nEsther, all the way out in left field and looking bewildered asked,\n\"I don't remember.  Did we receive something from the students?\"\n\nDiana stood up and walked over to where Anuse sat.  Jowl to jowl with him,\nshe said succinctly, \"It isn't funny, Mr. Frank Anuse.  It is not funny,\nit is serious.\"  To Esther, she said, \"You probably don't see everything\nthat comes in or goes out of this committee.\n\n\"Again, I want to state that I have been denied access to all\nthese student evaluations that are needed for my defense.\nIn addition, this committee has steadfastly refused to confirm\nthe testimony of their witnesses concerning these documents\nby demanding that they be produced.\"  Diana returned to her chair.\n\nHer attorney, Al Garret, leaned over and whispered into her ear.\nHe congratulated her on heeding his advice to be assertive and demanding.\n\nDiana continued, \"I would like to call Dr. Stacy Denton who\nhas information on the writing of the suspect documents.\"\n\n\"Is this. . .\", Henry floundered.  \"Is this new information\nreferring to the document examiner we just heard from?  This\nhearing is restricted, as I told you, to his testimony and--\"\n\n\"This witness has very pertinent information for the\ncommittee regarding my innocence of your charges.\"\n\n\"We do need to restrict this hearing\"\n\n\"Dr. Denton has been waiting nearly three hours to give her testimony.\"\n\nThe chair shrugged and muttered under his breath.   What would Simon\nMurrain advise.  I need time to think about it.  Aloud he said,\n\"The committee will recess to discuss this.\"\n\nEveryone was told to leave the hearing room except the committee.\nWhen they were alone, Henry made it clear.  \"We must limit this\nhearing only to the evidence we presented.\"\n\nJane, with grave misgivings concerning her future at Belmont,\nrose to the occasion.  \"I think we need to hear this.  We should\nat least appear to be giving her a fair hearing.\"\n\n\"She's already had that,\" snapped back Henry.  \"This hearing is expressly\nfor confirming the findings of the first document examiners.  Nothing else.\"\n\nAnuse, who had watched the others leave the hearing room\nunexpectedly sided with Jane and urged caution.  \"Perhaps we\nshould hear her, Henry.  Those damn reporters are still out there.\nIf we don't let her testify, it will be the lead story in tomorrow's paper.\"\n\n\"Still there, are they?  Bothersome creatures!  Well, that\nputs a different face on it.\"  He sat for a moment in thought.\nHe'd had his orders.  They were to wind this up fast.\n\"All right.  We'll hear that witness, however, I am declaring\nthis hearing closed as of right now.  Her testimony will appear\nto be heard by the panel and will be in the minutes to keep\nthe Attorney General and the press off our backs.\n\n\"But make no mistake, any of you.\"  He looked around at all\nthe committee members, his face stern and his voice threatening,\n\"We meet tomorrow at nine o'clock right here to sign this report\nthat you have already seen.  I'll redraft it to indicate that we\nhave had this additional testimony, but essentially, it will read\nthe same.  Is that clear?\"\n\n\n\n\nChapter 34\n\n\nThe hearing resumed.\n\nDr. Stacy Denton was sworn and Diana thanked her for waiting so long.\n\"Would you please state your qualifications as an expert witness?\"\n\n\"Yes, but first I must ask that you waive the privilege of confidentiality.\"\n\n\"Of course.  I absolutely waive the privilege of confidentiality\nso that you may respond to my questions and those of the panel.\"\n\nStacy then delivered a long list of professional qualifications having\nto do both with mental health counseling and organizational consulting.\n\nAs she was giving the requested information, Jane wished the\npanel could hear of the immense prestige Dr. Stacy Denton\nhad acquired throughout the university community over the\nyears that she had been a part of the Counseling Department.\nNot only was she widely acclaimed, she was genuinely liked\nand successful as a person, in the department she directed.\nAt the age of 42, she had shown abilities in her field that\nmost did not acquire until their later years.  This caused\nsome annoyance for her since she was constantly besieged by\nother counseling agencies all over the country, to come to them.\n\nJane remembered that when she had felt the shackles of threat\nsurround her, and realized that she really had no voice or will\non the committee, she had called Stacy.  Of course Stacy could not\ntell her that she had counseled Diana at the time she was first charged.\nShe could only listen to Jane's anguish at her own impotence.\nIt was only after Diana had called to ask Stacy if she would be willing\nto sign an affidavit for the federal court action, that Stacy could see\na way to do something.  She offered to also appear as a witness at\nthis final Belmont hearing if it were felt she would be needed.\nFew people of her stature would have waited outside the hearing room\nas she did, knowing that the committee might not even hear her testimony.\n\nShe testified that she had seen Diana professionally several times\nand that in her years of experience and training she had learned\ntechniques to determine behavior.\n\n\"I saw no evidence that Diana was lying, dissimulating or faking.\nI should say that in my position here, I see many people who are\nin trouble and there is a pattern to these reactions.  She exhibited\nwhat we in the profession call the typical victim reaction.\n\n\"In subsequent visits, I did a more thorough mental status exam.\nI used all sorts of techniques that uncover whether a person may\nbe unconsciously suppressing the fact that she wrote something,\nor did something.\n\n\"I believe that she could not have been lying.\" Stacy said succinctly.\n\"She was too upset, too shocked, to really fake me out.\"\n\n\nHenry carefully distorted her words in the recommendation\nthe committee later signed and sent to The Pope to read,\n`the psychologist found that Diana Trenchant had a genuine\nvictim response and truly believes herself to be innocent.'\nA far, and exceedingly prejudiced, cry from the actual testimony\nof the psychologist.  In fact, in the six page document,\nhe devoted only ten lines to Diana and her witnesses testimony--\none short paragraph!\n\nDiana asked Stacy if she could, without violating confidentiality,\ntell of similar cases at Belmont where a faculty person had been\naccused of wrong doing.\n\n \"It happens quite frequently, perhaps as often as once a month--\ncertainly a regular event.  And in none of these cases which might\ninvolve repeated incidents of drunkenness, sexual harassment,\nand, well, I can't go into details, but these are serious areas\nof misconduct that I'm referring to--not something as insignificant\nas seven SmurFFs!  In none of these cases was the person ever told\nto resign or face a termination for cause hearing.  The problem was\nhandled by the proper department head.  Either a warning was given\nor appropriate disciplinary action was taken.\"\n\nWhen Diana asked if the committee had any questions, Jane,\nin an attempt to demonstrate the proficiency of this expert witness,\nonce again bravely ventured forth asking Stacy to delineate some\nof the techniques used in this case and how she evaluated them.\n\nThe psychologist did this clearly and precisely, giving the\nmethods used and how Diana reacted.  It was very illuminating\ntestimony and totally ignored, except by the women who had hoped\nthat it might cause Henry to listen.\n\nAt one point, Anuse tried to twist Stacy's words around so\nit appeared that she was been saying that Diana had denied\nthat there was any trouble with any person in the department.\n\nStacy Denton set him securely and competently back on his heels,\nleaving no doubt in anyone's mind that she was no person to try\nthose tactics on.\n\n\n\n\nChapter 35\n\n\nWhen Stacy had been excused, the chair was ready to adjourn.\nOn the advice of her attorney, Diana requested that it be on\nthe record that, Anuse, one of the panel members had acted\nthroughout the hearing in a manner prejudicial and threatening\nto Diana and to her witnesses.\n\nHenry was livid with anger. \"You are out of order.  You are\nmaking statements about people on the committee that has\nnothing to do with this.  Your comment will not be entered\nand the committee will disregard it.\"\n\nHow typical of that woman to state the obvious, he fumed inwardly.\nAlways before, while ruling, he had kept his cool and at least\nglanced at the panel members for assent or dissent.  This time\nhe ably demonstrated that the show of democratic procedure was only that--\na show.  Damn her.  She had unglued him that time.\n\nIn any event, Diana was refused permission to enter the\nevidence she had that would have shown that Anuse was biased.\n\nNext, Diana reviewed the poor performance given by the document examiner.\n\"He testified that he could not make a decision on the first set of exemplars\nsent him.  Then when he was sent twenty years' worth of documents containing\nthe handwriting of multiple individuals, he claimed that he disregarded most\nof it.  She went over all of the individual letters in the `suspect'\nevaluations that Avery had not been able to match with anything\nin the writing he used as standards.  \"This shows that there were\nas many non-matches as matches in his presentation.\"\n\nThe panel listened passively, then Henry asked if that was\nher final statement.\n\n\"No,\" she answered.  \"I shall read that now.\"  She picked up\nthe paper which had been written mostly by her attorney and\nedited by her.  It was designed to get the legal points on the\nrecord so that they could be presented later in a court of law.\n\n\"We are at the end of another hearing and it is a grim\npage in the rights of faculty members of this university.\nI have been tried by a committee which is chaired by the\nprosecuting official.  He has reopened proceedings,\nengaged in ex parte communications, received legal advice\nfrom the prosecution's lawyer and denied me the opportunity\nto even examine the evidence against me.\n\n\"A faculty member at any state college, and indeed, a mail room\nemployee in the state Motor Vehicle Department would have more rights\nthan you have given me.\"\n\nHenry tuned her out.  All this legal stuff, he thought, is just\nto give her attorney crap to fill a brief.  Murrain had told him\nthis would probably happen.  Now, what's this?  Alertly, Henry listened.\n\n\"There are strong reasons to believe this panel has operated\nin violation of my state and federal rights.  If this committee\ndoes not end this unfortunate proceeding, the U.S. District Court\nwill finally have to determine these issues.\n\n\"This committee, at the last hearing, made several\npromises to me and I was fool enough to believe them.\nIt said that it would issue a decision within a few weeks;\ninstead, it launched a new investigation of its own without\nmy knowledge or participation which consumed over half a year.\nSecond, this committee assured me that I would not be affected by\nthese charges as I continued my teaching assignments in the department.\n`Go back to work,' you all assured me at the last hearing.\n`Everything is taken care of.'  I went back and was ordered to\nmove out of my office into a corner of the nutrition teaching lab.\nI was denied a telephone and given no help in moving my things.\nMy name has been removed from the department mail boxes\nand department meetings are held when I am teaching classes.\nFor these many months, while you reopened the investigation\nbehind my back, I have been a non-person in my department.\"\n\nJane shifted in her chair uneasily.  She recalled how all\nof these promises had been made when the panel had ended the\nfirst hearing.  In fact, she had made some of them herself.  It\nhad seemed then, she reflected, that the evidence against Diana\nwas inconclusive and that the majority of the panel felt this was\nso.  She had expected that just a simple vote of the panel would\nsend Diana back to her classroom where she belonged.\n\n\n\"I have served this university for nearly a quarter-century.\nStudents have consistently reviewed my efforts favorably\nand that is a source of much consternation in my department.\nThe entire central administration is prosecuting me,\nangered because I insisted on minimal rights.  For example:\nI refused to have my job eliminated or my copyrighted manual\nused without my consent.  They are determined to terminate me\nand have spared no resources in support of that goal.\nIt would appear that some of these efforts violate my rights\nunder state law, federal law, and the Constitution.\n\nThat's really what it's all about, decided Annette, as she kept\nher head lowered and her eyes fastened on the unseen files before her.\nViolation of her rights.  Violation of my rights to freely consider\nthe evidence both for and against her and render an impartial judgment.\n\n\n\"I believe this case represents what is in store for a person\nwho does not remain in the favor of those who determine policy\nfor this university.\n\n\"I have been accused of writing seven SmurFFs over a two\nyear period.  Only five of these seven were alleged to have been\ndetrimental to two faculty men, Ian and Randy.  This is five out\nof the six to eight hundred submitted for medical radiology\nduring that time.  At a minimum, even were these charges true,\nthe misconduct of which I am accused would be dishonesty, but of\na variety with no real import or effect.\"\n\n\nDiana stopped and reached for the glass of water in front\nof her.  I wish I could tell these people what it has been like\nworking here in this university for the last twenty-five years.\nIf they would only listen, I'd throw out this prepared statement\nin a flash and start with. . .her thoughts went back only a very\nfew years, to before the affirmative action laws.\n\nShe recalled vividly how she was treated, what women were\nsubjected to--still subjected to, she amended, wryly.\nLewd, suggestive poses of women in every lab and office.\nHuge posters on many doors facing the hallways.\nProjections via slides of scantily or unclothed women\nin provocative poses that were used to \"illustrate\"\nlecture material and treated with derision by the male lecturer.\nWe couldn't complain because we were told that if we didn't like it\nwe could leave.  We were told that this activity was normal and healthy.\nWe were told that if we found it offensive, we must be `queer'.\n\nAnd then that wonderful day when Sally, a woman graduate student,\nfound and placed on her door, a large full length picture of an unclad male.\nHe was young and pleasant looking--like the boy next door.\nNo suggestiveness here.  Just the human male form.\nHis penis hung quietly from his pelvis, as unremarkable\nand vulnerable as the breast of an old woman.\nBut what an uproar it caused.  The men were furious.\nThey clucked and cackled like a bunch of biddy hens\nwhich had been surprised by a predator's invasion of the hen house.\nDiana held the glass to her mouth for a few moments more even though\nshe was not drinking to stifle the smile that was trying to force\nitself into being from the memory.\n\nThe offending poster was quickly torn down, torn up and\nstill the cacophony continued unabated.  That is, until Sally\nwas called in to the NERD chairman's office.  When she emerged,\nshe packed up her belongings and left.  Of course,  we can't have\nthat kind of sexual depravity continue.  The men were certainly\nunited in that decision.  How quickly and easily they can fire\nwomen for whatever men define as impropriety.\n\n\nShe continued with her statement.  \"We have seen no evidence that\nany faculty were injured by those SmurFFs.  The evaluations that had\nan impact were the hundreds of evaluations that we have not seen\ndespite my efforts to have them made available for this hearing.\nIf these faculty had problems, it was with their teaching.\n\n\"There is no evidence or any proof as to when, or even if,\nthese seven SmurFFs were submitted.\n\n\"The administration has not shown any motive on my part to\nfabricate and submit them.  What I am really accused of is\nmanipulating student opinion to deny Ian and Randy tenure,\nwhen, in fact, neither have been denied tenure and I have not\nmanipulated student opinion.  If student evaluations improved\nthe year that I did not teach in the course, it was in part\nbecause previous criticisms have been taken to heart and teaching\nimproved in the course.  And also because Ian specifically\ninstructed the students to make only positive comments.\nYou could verify this by talking to the medical students,\nbut you are not allowed to.\"\n\n\nEsther tried to follow Diana's words and rebut each point\nas she heard it but was overcome by the simple truth of\nwhat she was hearing.  She, too, had been convinced that the\nhandwriting evidence was not to be trusted.  One of the people in\nher department had once worked at NERD.  She had confirmed the status\nof Diana in the department and corroborated what she had told the panel.\nEsther shrugged.  Too bad, can't be helped, she thought.\n\n\"Evidence was introduced at this hearing without being authenticated.\nHundreds of SmurFFs were described but shown to no one.\nProfessional witnesses were used against me yet I was not allowed\nto have an attorney cross-examine them.  And the ultimate injustice\nis that the prosecution official is the chair of the hearing panel!\n\n\"I do not believe that I ever had a chance in these proceedings.\nIf the administration's evidence is insufficient, you reopen\nthe hearing and get more, using unauthenticated material.\nIf I am effectively questioning a witness, interrupt me,\nas you did countless times.  If there is evidence on my behalf,\nyou deny it to me.\"\n\n\nFrank Anuse was delightedly and avidly listening to Diana's\nclosing statement.  God, he thought.  You can sure tell that it\nwas written by a lawyer and he's pulled out all the stops.\nWhat a tear jerker, he judged, cynically.  As if any of what\nshe was saying mattered.  The facts were that we decide what\nwill be correct, not the stupid courts.  Besides, she's getting\nwhat she deserves after what she put me through with that complaint\nto the Affirmative Action Office because I didn't interview male\napplicants for positions in my department.  He raged inwardly as\nhe remembered the time he had to spend to comply with the order\nto produce all of his records and defend all of his placements.\nDamned uppity bitch.\n\n\n\"This panel has simply followed the lead of the prosecutor,\nHenry Tarbuck, and allowed him to continue to dictate to you\nwithout question--without thought of equal treatment.\n\n\"I am aware, as you are, that a male faculty member was recently\nconvicted of child molesting, given a leave of absence and then\nreplaced in his position without loss of pay or tenure.\nIs what you accuse me of doing worse than child molestation?\"\n\nDiana let the question hang in the air for several moments\nwhile she looked at the panel.  Only Henry and Anuse returned\nher gaze, the women kept their eyes steadfastly on their papers\nwhich they held like shields before them.  Useless, she thought,\nthen aloud said, \"Thank you.  I have concluded my statement.\"\n\n\"I would like to clarify a few things,\" Henry began pontifically.\n\"The record will show that the remarks you have made are your opinions.\nWe will not respond to them.  I want to make it clear, however,\nthat I am a chairman of a committee of the faculty--not the prosecutor.\"\nThere, he thought selfrighteously, that will show her that I can quote\nmy lawyer too.\n\n\"Secondly, we do not decide anything.  We will not recommend anything.\nWe are merely the investigating committee which makes the report.\"\n\n\n\n\nChapter 36\n\n\nTrue to form, Henry adjourned the second hearing with lies--\nit didn't matter, he reflected, we have the power.\n\nThe hearing panel met the next day.  Each person was given a copy\nof the report that Henry had prepared.  \"Read it and when you have finished,\ncome over here and sign this original.  I will require that you turn in\nyour copies today.  You are to keep this report in confidence.\"\n\n\"When is Diana to be notified?\"  Timidly, Esther asked the question,\nraising her eyes from the document she was reading.\n\n\"In good time.  When it is deemed appropriate.\"  Henry was terse\nin his reply, warning that no further questions from the other\nmembers of the committee would be tolerated.\n\nFollowing this, Esther sent a letter to The Pope asking him\nnot to terminate Diana.  Later, she would show copies of\nthis letter to the staff and faculty women who criticized\nher for signing such a malicious report.  \"We had to sign it.\nWe had no choice, but see--I tried to help her!\"\n\nHenry sent a copy of the hearing panel's report to Diana late in March.\nIt was in the form of a memorandum addressed to The Pope.  Even though\nthe report had been signed early in February, it was dated March 31st,\nas were all the signatures at the end.\n\nThe report of six pages had four parts: Factual history;\nProcedures followed; Findings on considerations; and Recommendations.\nSurprise, surprise--after maintaining in two separate hearings\nthat the committee only gave a report and would not recommend any action.\n\nActually there was little in the report that came as any surprise.\nThe so-called `Factual history' was a composite of the testimony of Lyle,\nIan and Randy.  It was carefully written.  It reported that,\n\"Lyle had discovered several `suspicious' student feedback forms. . .\"\nwhen in fact he had said two.\n\nThe report was redolent with accusation.  Phrases such as\n\". . .she forged. . .\" and \". . .department could not\ntolerate forgery. . .\" were found throughout and put in a context\ndifficult to justify.  One of these sentences read: \"Given the opinion\nof the handwriting experts that she had `forged student course\nevaluations in a manner designed to denigrate the performance\nof co-faculty members', the chairman of NERD decided to seek\ntermination for cause.\"  Thus the document examiners were not\nonly given credit for identifying a person's handwriting,\nbut Henry claimed they were able to read the intent of the person\nwhom they said wrote the material examined.  Nowhere in the\nhearing were their clairvoyant abilities established.\n\nIndeed, the entire section contained nothing of the events\nas testified to by Diana and her witnesses.\n\nThe section on the `Procedures followed' was again taken\nfrom what Henry had decided were the procedures followed\nand wickedly slanted against Diana.  It did not mention that\nthe reason thirty-two additional standards were sent to the\nsecond document examiner was because he could not make a decision\non the basis of the standards sent to the first one.  Instead, it\nclaimed that the second document examiner confirmed the results\nof the first.  It also omitted to add that the standards sent were\nabysmally poor copies from microfiche, covered a period of 25 years\nand included handwriting and printing of many different people.\n\nHenry thought the section called `Findings on considerations', was a gem.\nAfter he had finished writing it, he had leaned back in his chair\nand mentally patted himself on the back.  Here was contained the only\nmention that there had been other testimony entered into the hearing.\nHere, in the entire six page report, only 10 lines were devoted to\nthe witnesses for Diana.  The testimony of Sarah, he tersely\ndismissed with: \"One student witness identified one of the suspect\ncritiques and claimed that she (the student) had written it,\nbut the claim was not substantiated because the student\nwould not have her handwriting examined.\"\n\nMonths later, the investigator for the Attorney General would note\nthat incident in the transcript of the hearing and make the following\ncomment in her report.  \"Did the committee really expect that the\nhired experts could, at a point when opinions had been stated under oath,\nseriously undertake a fresh analysis of the questioned document?\"\n\nHenry's report gave no indication that the standards were\nunauthenticated or why Diana was not asked to write for\nthe document examiners to produce authenticated ones.\n\nAll of the testimony of Diana was totally ignored.  It was as if\nshe had never appeared at the hearing--a non-person status like\nthat maintained against her by her department since the accusation\nwas first made.\n\nOf course it follows that the `Recommendation' section would state,\ntrue to the faculty handbook's rhetoric, that termination was recommended\nsince Diana had demonstrated a lack of professional and moral fitness.\n\n\n\n\nTHE COURT AND ATTORNEY GENERAL\n\n\nChapter 37\n\n\nIn the days following the hearing, the Belmont administration\ndirected its attention to the complaint brought against it in\nthe County Superior Court.  On its behalf, attorney Simon Murrain\nbegan the usual returns from the baseline destined to increase costs,\ndelay judgment and frustrate justice.\n\nThe analogy to tennis is not farfetched.  One side, the plaintiff\nvia her attorney, Al Garret, serves.  A volley of paper ensues\nfrom both sides directed at each other, but under the supervision\nand rule of the official, a judge.\n\nWhere the analogy loses ground is that very little action occurs\nin the court.  Sure, the plaintiff and respondent and the lawyers must\nshow up for hearings, but most everything goes on in the judges' chambers.\n\nSimon Murrain had a great deal of practice in delaying tactics.\nOver the last four years, seven people had brought suit against Belmont\nfor sex discrimination.  All seven had been forced to withdraw\nas their cases dragged on and on and their resources dwindled.\nSimon's initial move this time was to have the case go to a higher court,\nin this instance the United States District Court.\n\nThis move placed two additional burdens on the plaintiff and her attorney.\nFirst, the cost of the proceedings was greater than at the district level\nand second, the travel distance to attend hearings increased fifty-fold.\n\nAn advantage was also inadvertently given.  The judge who was appointed\nto sit at this session was known for his fairness and knowledge of the law.\n\nAl Garret immediately filed an amended complaint to the federal court\nwhich could rule on federal laws as well as state.  In it, he listed\nsix charges against Belmont University:  1. Violation of due process;\n2. violation of constitutional law; 3. violation of the state\nadministrative procedures act; 4. violation of the state\nopen meeting law; 5. violation of the state access to public records\nand 6. violation of the fair employment practices act.\n\nWith the listing of these charges, he asked that the court issue\na restraining order, an injunction that would order the respondent,\nBelmont University, to grant the plaintiff her right to a fair\nand impartial hearing by the university and access to the documents\nthat had been withheld from her.\n\nIt was at this time, shortly after the final university hearing had ended,\nthat Diana began getting threatening phone calls.  She was told to drop\nthe court proceedings if she didn't want something really bad to happen to her.\n\nAfter the initial hearing on the complaint and before any decision\nwas handed down by the judge, Murrain filed a motion for summary judgment\non counts three, four, five and six--all of the counts related to state law.\nIn effect, he was asking the judge to throw out the four charges for lack\nof validity.\n\nHis motion caused a veritable flurry of other motions from both sides\nand effectively delayed the process of law by dividing the charges.\nIt also increased the cost to the plaintiff.  It was a gamble for\nthe university.  If it paid off, it would cut the charges down to two--\nboth federal, while disposing of all the others.  If it didn't?\nNo problem, there were always appeals to be made that could\ncontinue the process indefinitely.\n\nAt the hearing on these motions, Al Garret limited his argument to\na synopsis of his brief.  He carefully related the applicable laws\nand requested that the defendant, Belmont University, be ordered\nto grant a fair, open hearing to the plaintiff, Diana.  Also,\nthat the plaintiff be supplied with the student feedback evaluations\nshe had requested and that had been denied to her.\n\nAl was an intelligent work-horse of an attorney.  At 57, he took\nhis legal duties seriously.  His heavy glasses with their\nthick rims gave him a scholastic air.  All that was needed\nto complete the image of absent minded professor was a pipe.\nHe had diligently searched the literature for precedents\nwhich he presented to the judge in a mild but measured tone.\nA reasonable man, he projected this image to the court and made\na fine presentation.  No sparkle, just facts and precedents\nclearly presented.\n\nWhen the judge turned his attention to the respondent, Simon\nMurrain stood to address the court looking more like a walking\nadvertisement for expensive men's wear than an attorney.\nSimon oozed charm with all the proficiency of a hangman leading\nthe way to the gallows.  Close to Al in age, Simon was of a\ndifferent bent.  His argument was presented with show and words--\nit worked well with juries who tended to watch him instead of what\nhe said. Today, there was no jury present, but his modus operandi\ndidn't change.\n\n\"Your honor,\" he commenced.  \"The plaintiff was given a fair hearing\nunder the rules of Belmont University.  She was given due process.\nDespite the fact that she forged many evaluation forms causing untold\nharm to two young faculty persons, the university made every effort\nto treat her with fairness and consideration.\"  He continued for some\ntime in the same vein, constantly and consistently referring to\nthe plaintiff as a forger--a criminal.\n\nGleefully, Murrain reflected, in court, we attorneys can say anything,\nor most anything, we want to.  We do not have to operate under the\nconstraints imposed on the rest of the populace and preface a charge\nwith the word alleged.  Truth is not required of us either,\nalthough most judges attempt to keep the elocution within\nthe bounds of propriety.\n\nAnother check in the system is the presence of the opposing\nattorney who is supposed to function to limit any freewheeling\nantics of his colleague by appealing to the judge.\n\nBut Al did not object to Simon's presentation.  He felt confident\nthat the judge would rule on the law, not on the performance.\nBesides, he rather enjoyed watching and listening to Simon's kind of theater.\n\nFollowing the hearing, the wait began.  How would the judge decide?\nWhen would the judge decide?\n\n\nEven though the hearing committee at Belmont had made its\nreport and recommendation to terminate, the actual termination\nletter had not yet been sent.  From the time she was accused,\nDiana had found life at work to be difficult.  As a plaintiff,\nin a lawsuit against Belmont, it was nearly impossible.\n\nNearly, that is, because her students never wavered in their efforts\nto encourage and help her.  It was during this wait that factual\ninformation was obtained concerning a dean at Belmont who had falsified\na faculty promotion sheet.  The occurrence had been rumored,\nbut now the players were known.  Al Garret had talked to the\nprincipals of the event and obtained two affidavits attesting\nto the misconduct and subsequent lack of punishment awarded\nthe dean who was still employed at the university.\nThe man had suffered no loss of rank or pay for his transgression.\nThese affidavits were added to the pile of papers already on file\nwith the judge.\n\nEarly in June, the Opinion and Order of the judge arrived.\nAl Garret's third charge had been thrown out by the judge\nwho wrote that the law cited did not apply to Belmont University.\nThe other three charges were sustained.\n\nOn charge number four, relating to the open meeting law,\nthe judge wrote in part: \"To permit this hearing panel to operate\noutside the Open Meeting Law would be to enable the university\nto take round-about steps to avoid its public duty.\"\n\nHe continued by describing the hearing panel as resembling,\n\". . .the type of secret activities the Open Meeting Law seeks\nto prevent. . .\" and suggested that if the panel had considered\nany area to be extremely sensitive, it could have gone into\nexecutive session.  Even this he qualified--asserting that\nit was subject to the plaintiff's right to a public hearing.\n\nAs to the public record law, charge number five, he ruled that\nthe plaintiff should have access to the evaluations requested.\n\"The Court finds,\" he wrote, \"that Belmont must comply with\nthe Public Records Law.\"\n\nFinally, on charge number six, relating to the fair employment law,\nthe judge found the evidence submitted to be sufficient to indicate\nretaliatory, sexual discrimination.\n\n\nA few days later, with this Opinion and Order from the court in hand,\nJohn T. Pope, president of Belmont University, terminated the plaintiff,\neffective immediately.\n\nThe Pope's action was expected by everyone except Al Garret,\nDiana's attorney--he still thought he'd won the case.\nBelmont had been thumbing its nose at the judicial system\nas long as anyone could remember.\n\nDiana Trenchant packed up the teaching and research accumulations\nof nearly twenty-five years and left for home.\n\nNeither the president nor any of the Vees could be reached for comment.\nHowever, Bob Alastar, the PR for Belmont, called in the press.\n\"We have no comment,\" he asserted.  \"It is the university's policy\nnot to discuss personnel decisions with the press.\"\n\nNow there was a new angle in the threatening phone calls to\nthe plaintiff.  The caller would start out in a friendly fashion.\nIn a conversational tone, he would advise Diana to, \"go down to\nthe courthouse and examine the court records for the past ten years.\nJust check the directory for all the cases that Belmont has been\ninvolved in and read the outcome.  The court clerk will help you.\"\nThen the voice would become threatening.  \"You will see that no one\nhas ever won a case against Belmont.  It owns the courts and it\nowns the lawyers.  You'll lose all your money and you'll be hurt\nin other ways.  It can and will make appeal after appeal.\nIt can and will tie this case up for years.  Give it up\nbefore you get hurt.\"\n\n\n\n\nChapter 38\n\n\nThe investigation by the Attorney General continued.  When she tried\nto interview potential witnesses at Belmont, she was prevented\nby the administration.  \"Do not even talk with her,\" was the gag order\nthat went out from the central administration of Belmont to every chair\nand director.  These lesser administrators were told to alert their\ndepartments or units and advise all faculty, staff and students\nnot to cooperate in her investigation.\n\nFor a while, the investigation lagged.  It was hoped that as tempers cooled\nand reason reasserted itself, the university would be more receptive\nto the questions posed by the A.G.  It was, after all, to their benefit\nto answer the questions.  It was an opportunity to get their position\nknown because the report, when completed, would be sent to the EEOC.\nIt would have considerable influence on research grants applied\nfor by Belmont faculty.\n\nThe cooling off period solved nothing.  Belmont administration was adamant.\nThey had done the right thing.  There was nothing to investigate.\nThe incident had ended.  The Pope had spoken.\n\nActually, The Pope was doing more than speaking--he was engaged\nin composing excuses and explanations.  Supporters of Diana had\nsent the Judge's Order, or excerpts from it, to state legislators,\nfaculty, staff, students, alumni, trustees and any other person\nthat had expressed interest in the lawsuit.  This had resulted\nin hundreds of letters and phone calls to The Pope and members\nof his administration as well as to the Board of Trustees.\n\n\"What is going on?\"  One of the first callers demanded,\nhaving insisted, and gotten The Pope on the line.\n\"You fired a good teacher after a judge ruled that\nshe had not received a fair hearing?\"\n\n\"Our hearing panel gave her a fair hearing, sir.\nThe newspapers have just blown this up to sell papers,\"\nThe Pope replied, holding back his anger with difficulty\nand making his voice sound terribly knowledgeable.\n\n\"The judge said you didn't.  I saw his order.  Was the\nhearing open?  Did you give her all the documents she\nrequested, or not?\"  The caller was insistent.\n\n\"Well, sir, it's not that simple.  Our policy is to protect\nthe employee so we always have closed hearings.  There was\nno need to produce the documents in question.  The hearing panel\nwas confident that they were not needed.\"\n\n\"I don't care about how your hearing panel or how your policy goes.\nI'm asking about an excellent teacher who has served our university\nfor nearly a quarter of a century.  If she did what you have accused her of\n. . . good God, man!  Five out of thousands--what difference could that make?\nYou've made yourself look silly.\"\n\nThe Pope took no more calls after that except from the trustees.\nHe could not escape their critical views but with the help of his\nhandpicked chairman of the board, he managed to placate most of them.\n\nOne secretary was placed full-time answering letters and\nthe Vees were called on to answer the phone calls and talk\nto any one who came to the offices.  Consumption of antacid\nincreased astronomically in \"Vice Alley\"--lair of the Vees.\n\nPR man, Alastar and all the Vees were carefully coached to\nsuggest to the callers that Diana Trenchant had really done\nsomething unspeakable and that the charge that was aired was\n\"only the tip of the iceberg.\"  They also were told to hint\nconcerning her motives.  She was \"thought to have so desired the\nchairmanship of the department. . .\" or \"she was delusional in her\nassertion that she had written any course material, etc. . .\" or\n\"she was not really the type of woman that normal women, those\nwith husbands or boyfriends, wanted to associate with. . .\" or. . .\n\n\nMeanwhile, back at the court, legal papers piled up anew.\nDiana felt helpless, drawn along in a maelstrom of chaos.\nA veritable barrage of verbiage flew to the court, like guided missiles,\nfrom both attorneys.  They were couched in legal parlance and\ncushioned on expensive, patterned vellum.  For every submission,\nthere was a filing fee, hours of research and multiple law-firm billings.\nFor each batch of documents sent to the court, copies were made to send\nto the opposing attorney, the file and sometimes, even the plaintiff.\n\nOccasionally, a hearing on one or another of the various\nmotions was called.  When this happened, the lawyers and\nthe plaintiff were joined by the judge, his clerk and the\ncourt stenographer.\n\nEach attorney blew smoke--substantial as ghost poop.\nThe judge sat in the air high above the arena and pondered.\nAt times, he would interrupt and admonish.  Periodically he\nwould ask a question and these were the interesting moments\nas each attorney had a different answer.\n\nThe lawyer for the defense only knew what he had been told by\nHenry Tarbuck and Henry only knew what he had been told by Lyle.\n\nDiana's attorney knew only what she had told him and it was obvious\nthere was a lot that he hadn't remembered.  How little the truth counted\nin these proceedings, Diana thought as she listened to the screw up.\nNeither of these men, who are being questioned and are the only ones\nallowed to speak, were at Belmont when these events were occurring.\nMost of the time they are way out in left field with their answers.\nAnd here I sit, mute because the system demands it, unable to clear up\nthe confusion.  All this money spent and the judge still doesn't understand\nwhat the SmurFFs are.  He asked for clarification and got gibberish.\n\nThere's the gavel.  One more useless hearing is over with.\n\n\nThen, just as winter was getting a firm grip on the land,\nthe Attorney General released her report.  Diana and her\nsupporters were jubilant.  The local paper printed and the\nTV and radio blared: \"A strongly worded report from the A.G.'s\noffice to President Pope maintains that professor was fired unjustly.\"\n\nThe A.G.'s thirty page comprehensive Letter of Determination (LOD),\nmade it clear right at the beginning that the Belmont administration\nhad refused to cooperate in the investigation.  It emphasized that,\n\"The University declined to make available people and information.\"\nAt the end of the LOD, it reiterated Belmont's non-cooperation.\n\nThe LOD went on to state that the University had held\nTermination for Cause Hearings.  Sworn testimony was taken\nwhich had been completely transcribed by a court reporter.\nThis transcript and the court records relating to the illegal\ntermination suit were used in this investigation since the\nBelmont administration refused to cooperate with the Attorney General.\n\nIt took the form of a letter to The Pope.  In stark contrast\nto Henry's report, the LOD reviewed the history of the allegations\nagainst Diana, giving the charges and the response to these charges,\nequal weight and importance.  This information was from the transcript\nwhich contained the sworn statements of all the university personnel\ninvolved in the hearing--those people who were prevented by the\nadministration from talking to the A.G. investigator.  It also reviewed\nthe testimony of Diana and her witnesses.  Reference was made to the\ntestimony of the three document examiners--two presented by Belmont,\nthe affidavit of the one submitted by Diana at the second hearing.\n\nThe point was made early on that the specific charge which resulted\nin termination was that Diana had written seven evaluations out of\nsome one thousand submitted.  Five of these were alleged to have injured\ntwo faculty members.  It emphasized that testimony indicated that there\nwere no performance problems with Diana.  \". . .testimony from both sides\nestablished that she was highly regarded by her students, was very dependable\nand a hard worker.\"\n\nIt noted that while expert witnesses, the document examiners\nand the university attorney, were used to testify against Diana,\nshe was not allowed an attorney to conduct a competent cross examination.\nStating that even though supportive documents were not presented\nat the hearing, \"the committee accepted testimonial evidence\non the contents of them,\" it concluded that \". . .this represented\nthe most serious deprivation of fundamental fairness that occurred.\nAny concept of a fair administrative hearing, even one conducted\nwithout regard to strict rules of evidence, could not include\nthe admission of testimonial evidence of the contents of documents\nwhich were available only to the party presenting the evidence.\"\n\nCommenting on the dissatisfaction of the committee with the\ntestimony of the first document examiner, the LOD stated that,\n\"Rather than reject the testimony and find Trenchant innocent,\nthe committee continued the hearing and hired another document examiner.\nThis one disputed the findings of the first and required more standards.\nThe documents provided by Belmont were exceedingly poor copies\nof file contents, much of which was over twenty years old.\nMost of these so-called standards contained the handwriting\nof more than one person.  At no time was any evidence presented\nthat showed the standards sent by the administration to the\nhandwriting analysts to be the writing of Diana.\"\n\nRemarking on the fact that the committee was chaired by\nHenry Tarbuck who had already decided that Diana was guilty,\nthe A. G. wrote, \"The committee applied different rules\nof evidence to her and her witnesses, it badgered them\nand cautioned them against giving hearsay testimony.\n\n\"The committee rejected direct evidence by one student who testified\nunder oath that she had written one of the `suspect' documents.\nIt ignored the testimony of Diana as well as that of her witnesses.\"\n\nThen the LOD turned to the report from the hearing committee\nthat Henry had authored.  One paragraph stated: \"The effect of\nthe suspect critiques on the two people who were said to have\nbeen hurt by them had not been assessed, but did affect the\nindividuals involved.\"  To this, the A.G. declared, \"One questions\nthe committee's findings as an accurate reflection of the evidence.\nNo underlying facts were stated by the committee that explain\nits findings that `individuals were affected,' nor does the committee\nstate how it could make that finding while stating that it had\nnot examined the effect.\"\n\nAs precedents or comparison, the LOD reported that no\npenalties were imposed on two male Belmont faculty members,\none who had altered promotion papers, the other convicted\nof child molestation.  It quoted the testimony of Stacy Denton,\nthe university psychologist.  She had declared she knew of many\ninstances of faculty misconduct more serious than what was\nalleged in this case.  Those people had not been terminated.\n\nConcluding that the university's stated explanation for\nterminating Diana was not worthy of credence, the report\nfound there existed probable cause for sex and age discrimination\nand disparate discipline by Belmont against Diana.\n\nThe LOD was sent to the regional EEOC office which accepted\nit and confirmed the acceptance with the A.G. by phone.\nThe newspapers and television reporters had a field day with it.\nDiana and her supporters felt vindicated beyond measure.\nAlmost everyone believed that it was all over--that Diana had won.\nCongratulatory letters and phone calls flowed to Diana and\nBelmont University administration was given a verbal drubbing.\n\n\n\n\nChapter 39\n\n\nThe university PR system was cranked up to its fullest.\nLetters were sent out to various alumni groups around the\ncountry and speakers to these groups were alerted and advised.\nThe trashing of Diana blossomed into an intellectual lynching\nof the lowest order.   Much later on, as people came to understand\nthat the university had not complied with the findings of the court\nand Attorney General, there was a general loss of respect for Belmont\nwhich contributed to a decrease in enrollment.\n\nThe official Belmont University response was delivered by\nthe public relations spokesperson who dismissed the LOD as,\n\"inconsequential.  I don't know what all the fuss is about,\"\nhe said.  \"When you cut through the fancy title at the top\nit's just a lawyer's opinion.\"  No one else at Belmont\nwas available for comment.\n\nThe Pope did know what all the fuss was about and was\nstung by the words of condemnation contained in the LOD.\nHe immediately called his contact at the Washington DC office\nof the EEOC.  He complained fiercely that the LOD never gave\nthe university's side of the question.  \"No one here was\ninterviewed by the investigator from the Attorney General's Office,\"\nhe protested peevishly.\n\nHe got that right!\n\nHis contact got his protest an immediate hearing by the EEOC chairman,\nwho directed the regional office to quash the Attorney General's LOD.\nNo one in the head office bothered to read the LOD and learn\nthat the reason there were no interviews of university personnel\nbecause they refused to cooperate with the investigation.\nFriends in high places, indeed.\n\nIn addition, The Pope called a meeting to discuss their\ncourt strategy.  \"Now,\" The Pope said forcefully, \"It's time\nwe did something to end the legal hassle.  That damned judge!\nAnd, this A.G. letter on top of it.  We are getting too much\nbad publicity.  The letters and phone calls are driving everyone\ncrazy around here.  It's gone on long enough--too long!\"  Sitting\naround the conference table in the west wing of his office with\nhim was Murrain, Henry Tarbuck and Jimbo.\n\nMurrain spoke confidently.  \"The court business is nearly finished.\nI have already petitioned the judge for permission to start discovery.\nUnless the plaintiff is sitting on a gold mine, that will finish off her\nbank account right there.\"\n\n\"How's that?\" asked Jimbo.\n\n\"During discovery, we take depositions.  Al Garret will have to\ndepose a lot more witness than we do in order to even come close\nto presenting his case.  Conservatively speaking, he's looking\nat nearly a thousand bucks a day that he must bill Trenchant.\n\n\"And that's not even the best part.\"  Murrain caressed his\nface with his hand as if re-oiling the smile on its surface.\n\"I'll coach our people in evasive answers, which means that\nit will take days of deposition time for him to get the\ninformation that an unprepared witness would give in a hour.\n\n\"Good.\"  The Pope was pleased.\n\nNot so pleased was Al Garret and the plaintiff.  Both attorneys\nhad agreed some months ago that the process of discovery would not\nbe commenced until the judge had given his final ruling on the motions\nand the trial date set.  Murrain delivered his low blow without missing\na beat.  \"Oh,\" he cooed when Al called him to complain, \"I must have\nmisunderstood.  I thought you wanted to get started before the final ruling.\"\n\nAl was outclassed and he knew it.  Apologetically, he called the plaintiff\nand drew her the financial picture.  An appeal to the judge for permission\nto delay discovery was ignored--Murrain had carefully picked his time.\nIt was one of the last orders the judge signed before departing\non his vacation.\n\nThat's all she wrote, Diana acknowledged  In debt and unemployed,\nshe dropped her illegal-termination suit against Belmont University.\n\n\n\n\nAFTERGLOW\n\n\nChapter 40\n\n\nDeep within the bowels of the Belmont library building,\nthe university archivist, Igor O'Toole, had been keeping an\ninformal running tally of events relating to the SmurFF Affair.\nHe had gleaned the information from his friend, Diana, confirmed\ngossip, media sources, university documents and private sources\nwhich he knew to be reliable and would not reveal.  He had,\nover the past two years, posted it in a scrapbook.\n\nHis interest had been whetted when the story first broke.\nEveryone repeating it on campus was incredulous. . .termination\nfor cause on account of seven SmurFFs?  Really?  It must be a joke.\n\nBut Igor, casting out his informational net, discovered that\nit wasn't.  It was discrimination, pure and simple and he,\nbecause of his race, knew discrimination when he came on it.\n\nHe remembered how close he had come to not landing his\npresent position.   A man in his late forties, he had\nimpeccable credentials and years of experience in archival work.\nHe was also an African American.  Strong, competent and unassuming,\nhe had applied for the posted position of senior archivist\nand then waited for the decision from personnel.\n\nTime passed.  They told him they were still interviewing,\nbut he had learned from a contact he had made in the library\nthat they had reposted the advertisement for the job because\nno qualified applicants had been sent from personnel.\nThat was how Igor's pool of informational sources began.\n\nThen suddenly, he was called in for an interview.  By now his\ncontacts had grown and he discovered that his name had won him the job.\nSomeone in the personnel department had inadvertently listed him\nto the library as a viable candidate based on his last name. . .\nobviously Irish.  His race had been overlooked.\n\nThe library director was delighted with his credentials and\ncalled him in for an interview.  This firmly established to all\nand sundry that he was black.  Back then, tokenism was rampant\nso when the director hired him, the administration went along\nwith it, albeit reluctantly.  After all, the archives were in\nthe basement, who would notice?\n\nNow having enjoyed many years at Belmont and made many friends,\nhe was turning the last few pages of his scrapbook.\nIt was by now a huge tome, meticulously kept and\nrecently augmented by Diana's contribution of letters,\ncourt papers and related documents.  He had reached the\nfinal section dealing with the people involved and the aftermath.\n\nGrimly, he noted that despite the several instances of plagiarism\ncommitted by the two faculty men, Ian Heathson and Randy Fecesi,\nthey were promoted and given tenure.  The years of adverse student\nevaluations of their teaching abilities were all thrown out\non the basis of five `suspect' ones and Henry's report.\n\nRandy, at the insistence of the medical students, was moved\nout of the medical radiology course and into an undergraduate\nnutrition course.  A year later there were problems involving\nsome of the young women in the course.  The women were hushed up\nand Randy was given an immediate sabbatical of indefinite length.\n\nIan continued in the radiology course but was never able to\ncapture any grants to continue his research.\n\nThe best all around teacher in NERD, fed up to the gills\nwith having to continually save the department's teaching bacon,\nquit and moved away.  This excellent teacher, Ray Stinnis,\ncould no longer turn his back on the rampant dishonesty inherent in\nthe department--the treatment afforded Diana had been the last straw.\n\nAfter Ray's departure, Lyle Stone was forced to give\nlucrative courses up to other departments.  The resulting\ndecrease in revenue caused a severe decline in his research\nprograms and plans were underway to abolish the NERD entirely.\n\nFrank Anuse had suffered a near fatal heart attack.  Months later\nwhen he returned to work, it was reported that he was a changed man.\nHis attitude toward the women in his sector improved and it was\nreported that he regretted his role on the Trenchant panel.\n\nEsther received the promised promotion and a raise.  A year later,\nshe was retired--broken and unhappy.\n\nAnnette quit her position and moved out of the area with her roommate.\n\nJane, who had been tenured, left.  The circumstances were never divulged.\n\nJimbo and Dean Broadhurst were quietly retired.\n\nAn administrative intern in The Pope's office was summarily fired\nfor injudiciously stating that it would have been more cost effective\nto retire Diana than spend the thousands of dollars to terminate her.\n\n\"You see,\" he explained to the assembled president and Vees,\nwith more ignorance than good sense, \"Our current policy would\nhave paid for her retirement without any further outlay of\nmonies on our part.  The hearings, document examiners, courts and\nsubsequent damage control has cost nearly one hundred thousand dollars.\"\n\n\nStill reading, Igor marveled at how the ripples created by Diana's\nstruggle had widened and spread out of Belmont into the state.\nHer short but important court venture resulted in twenty areas\nof state statutes cited.  These annotated statutes served to\nstrengthen the application of the cited state laws to Belmont.\nUsing these laws, a faculty union was kindled and an\nAnimal Rights Organization sued successfully to attend\nBelmont animal research meetings.\n\nApplications for enrollment decreased as many became\nturned off by Belmont's noncompliance with the law.\n\nThe legislature of the state became disenchanted with the university\nbecause of the notoriety, and decreased its annual appropriation.\nA legislative investigation was initiated to ascertain the number\nand salaries of the central administration of Belmont.\n\nThe Pope felt the heat and got out of the kitchen--very suddenly.\nAn interim president was appointed by the trustees.\n\nHenry Tarbuck elected to stay when the new president\ncame on board and was demoted to an associate Vee.\nHis wife successfully sued for divorce and Henry's claim\nfor alimony was denied by the judge.  This meant that he had\nto go back to living on his own salary.\n\nTwo women successfully brought charges of sexual harassment\nagainst a Belmont administrator.  A court subsequently awarded\nthem nearly a million dollars in compensatory and punitive damages.\n\nSo many sex discrimination cases were initiated by Belmont staff\nthat the new administration created an entire unit to investigate\nand put out fires.\n\nDiana applied for unemployment compensation which the Belmont\nadministration opposed on the grounds that she was discharged\nfor dishonesty.  At the State Employment Service hearing,\nDiana submitted the Judge's Order and the LOD from the Attorney General.\n\nAlthough the entire upper administrative wing of the\npersonnel department appeared to testify against her,\nthe Employment Service hearing officer decided that she\nhad been unfairly terminated.  She drew unemployment checks\nfor only a few weeks.  They enabled her to get by until plans\nfor self-employment could be formulated.  Continuing in her\nteaching career was out--no references would be forthcoming from\nher last employer.  She started a small delivery business from\nher home and with that, her friends and Social Security,\nshe managed all right.\n\n\n\nChapter 41\n\n\nIgor O'Toole put his scrapbook aside, then stood up and stretched.\nBack at his work bench, preserving, repairing and reconstructing\nthe tomes of human accomplishments, mistakes and history,\nhe ruminated on how the more things change, the more they\nremain the same.\n\nThe structure of all but the most recently birthed colleges\nand universities is rigid, he observed to the roll of\ntransparent tape he was using to repair still another torn page.\nTheir medieval trappings, so obvious at historic functions,\nmay appear invisible in other facets of existence.  None the less,\nthese trappings still exist.\n\nPatterned much like the society of monks, higher educational\nadministrations still follow a monolithic, generally white\nmale-dominated path even though modern times have seen the\nenrollment of women students, the hiring of women faculty and\neven women in central administrative posts.  But it's a facade.\nThe real discipline, established centuries ago, is maintained\nand furiously guarded.\n\nFor a while, the newer laws of the seventies relating to affirmative\naction suggested that there would be a break in the male bastion.\nTime proved, however, that sex discrimination and sexual harassment laws\nwere never well enforced and were being slowly destroyed by the Supreme Court.\n\nContinuing his mentation, Igor allowed as how, like the monastery,\nthe university structure is maintained because it is supported throughout\nthe governmental system of a state or country.\n\nNow comes the turn of ethnicity as students of all races,\nreligions and creeds are storming the ancient fortifications.\nThus far, they have not even cracked the surface.  What appears\nto be maneuvers that should embarrass a university administration\nonly serve to entrench it even more.\n\nAt Belmont, the student's attempts to force political\ncorrectness--PC, on the administration culminated in\na takeover of their offices.  Nothing new here.\nThis has happened at many universities all over the country.\nThe result of the takeover, far from enlightening the powers that be,\nonly delighted the Belmont administration.\n\nAs student protests do every time, he reflected, they take\nthe public's attention away from the stench of the secret\nuniversity policies and procedures and place it on the antics\nof the students.  Most always, student protests involved property\ndestruction.  As a result, public opinion turns against student\ninnovators or bell ringers.  The cause of their protest--entrenched,\npolluted power--is again shrouded by the ignorance that gave it birth\nin the middle ages.\n\nIgor yawned and scratched his chin.  Most of the collected\nintelligence and experiences of the world is in this library,\nhe reminded himself, but few avail themselves of it.  Upstairs now,\nyou don't even have to search through books for whatever you're\nlooking for, you just punch up a computer and it collects\neverything ever written on any subject you can think of.\n\nBut with all these wonderful strides in disseminating information,\nhe marveled, the people running this place act just like they always have.\nTradition covers a multitude of sins and power corrupts now just as it used to.\n\nToo bad most young people don't realize how much their protests\njust solidify the status quo, or rather, most of them don't.\nIgor smiled to himself as he glanced at the clock.\n\nDiana would be back by now.  Time to give her a call.\nHe sat down at his desk and dialed the phone.\n\n\"Thought I'd find you in.  I've just been thinking about\nour little project and taking a lot of comfort from it.\"\n\nHe listened briefly, then said, \"Just thought it was too bad\nthat most young folks waste their efforts so.  Not like those\ntwo young women upstairs.  They are exceptions.\"\n\nListening again, he answered, \"Yes, they are good friends\nand just as upset as me over the SmurFF fiasco.  Well, we have\nbegun something that will have an effect for some time to come.\". . .\n\n\"Me?  I'm tickled pink to have had a part in an endeavor which,\nin the Baconian sense, allows, `. . .a kind of wild justice' to prevail. . .\n\n\"Well, yes, I am still angry at the way Dan Field acted when\nthe students came to him on your behalf, Diana.  This guy claimed\nto be so strong for human rights, claimed to represent the blacks\nand other down-trodden and he crapped out.  No doubt about it,\nhe had the position and the clout to have stopped this thing in\nits tracks.  He was the administrations's visible token black.\n\n\"And that brother in the EEOC.  Surely, as head honcho, he should\nhave checked the facts before blindly bowing to political pressure. . .\n\n\"Well yes, thank you.  I, Igor have made up for both of those Oreos.\nI have made Afro-Americanism stand for something positive at Belmont.\"\n\nSmiling now, he reviewed with her the culmination of the combined\nefforts of those two women upstairs, Diana and himself.\n\nPooling their knowledge of computers, they had formulated\nand introduced a harmless virus into the library computer\nwhich had already spread throughout this library and beyond.\nAnd it would continue to spread.   The contents of his scrapbook,\nalong with all the originals of the documents Diana could produce,\nhad been incorporated into the viral computer program so that\nwhenever anyone queried information on any relevant topic,\nthe SmurFF Affair at Belmont would be targeted.  The true facts\nof the good ol' boy conspiracy against Diana Trenchant could\nno longer be hidden by the administration.\n\nAny interested person would be able to access all of the\nletters and documents relating to it.  The entire transcript,\nattorney briefs, Attorney General's LOD and all the shady\nmeetings and despicable planning engaged in by the power\nstructure of Belmont University would be instantly available in\nmenu form on their computer screen.  The virus would see to that\nand good old human curiosity would do the rest.\n\nStill smiling, Igor said, \"So long and take care.  I'll talk to you tomorrow.\"\n\nPicking up his jacket, he turned off the lights.\nAnother day--well, it would seem good to get home.\n\nUpstairs, as he passed between the desks of Roz and Andrea, the women\nwho had made such fantastic use of the contents of his scrapbook, he paused.\nHolding up both arms, palms flat out, he said, \"Good night, my friends.\nHave a nice evening. . .and thank you.\"\n\nSlapping his palms in unison, with grins broad enough to span\nthe universe, they returned the greeting and the emotion.",
