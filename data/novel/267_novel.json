 "text": "THE TOUCHSTONE\n\nBy Edith Wharton\n\n\n\n\nI\n\n\n“Professor Joslin, who, as our readers are doubtless aware, is engaged in\nwriting the life of Mrs. Aubyn, asks us to state that he will be greatly\nindebted to any of the famous novelist’s friends who will furnish\nhim with information concerning the period previous to her coming to\nEngland. Mrs. Aubyn had so few intimate friends, and consequently so few\nregular correspondents, that letters will be of special value. Professor\nJoslin’s address is 10 Augusta Gardens, Kensington, and he begs us to\nsay that he will promptly return any documents entrusted to him.”\n\nGlennard dropped the SPECTATOR and sat looking into the fire. The club\nwas filling up, but he still had to himself the small inner room, with\nits darkening outlook down the rain-streaked prospect of Fifth Avenue.\nIt was all dull and dismal enough, yet a moment earlier his boredom had\nbeen perversely tinged by a sense of resentment at the thought that, as\nthings were going, he might in time have to surrender even the despised\nprivilege of boring himself within those particular four walls. It was\nnot that he cared much for the club, but that the remote contingency of\nhaving to give it up stood to him, just then, perhaps by very reason\nof its insignificance and remoteness, for the symbol of his increasing\nabnegations; of that perpetual paring-off that was gradually reducing\nexistence to the naked business of keeping himself alive. It was the\nfutility of his multiplied shifts and privations that made them\nseem unworthy of a high attitude; the sense that, however rapidly he\neliminated the superfluous, his cleared horizon was likely to offer no\nnearer view of the one prospect toward which he strained. To give up\nthings in order to marry the woman one loves is easier than to give them\nup without being brought appreciably nearer to such a conclusion.\n\nThrough the open door he saw young Hollingsworth rise with a yawn\nfrom the ineffectual solace of a brandy-and-soda and transport his\npurposeless person to the window. Glennard measured his course with a\ncontemptuous eye. It was so like Hollingsworth to get up and look out of\nthe window just as it was growing too dark to see anything! There was\na man rich enough to do what he pleased--had he been capable of\nbeing pleased--yet barred from all conceivable achievement by his own\nimpervious dulness; while, a few feet off, Glennard, who wanted only\nenough to keep a decent coat on his back and a roof over the head of the\nwoman he loved Glennard, who had sweated, toiled, denied himself for\nthe scant measure of opportunity that his zeal would have converted into\na kingdom--sat wretchedly calculating that, even when he had resigned\nfrom the club, and knocked off his cigars, and given up his Sundays out\nof town, he would still be no nearer attainment.\n\nThe SPECTATOR had slipped to his feet and as he picked it up his eye\nfell again on the paragraph addressed to the friends of Mrs. Aubyn. He\nhad read it for the first time with a scarcely perceptible quickening of\nattention: her name had so long been public property that his eye passed\nit unseeingly, as the crowd in the street hurries without a glance by\nsome familiar monument.\n\n“Information concerning the period previous to her coming to\nEngland....” The words were an evocation. He saw her again as she had\nlooked at their first meeting, the poor woman of genius with her long\npale face and short-sighted eyes, softened a little by the grace of\nyouth and inexperience, but so incapable even then of any hold upon\nthe pulses. When she spoke, indeed, she was wonderful, more wonderful,\nperhaps, than when later, to Glennard’s fancy at least, the consciousness\nof memorable things uttered seemed to take from even her most intimate\nspeech the perfect bloom of privacy. It was in those earliest days, if\never, that he had come near loving her; though even then his sentiment\nhad lived only in the intervals of its expression. Later, when to\nbe loved by her had been a state to touch any man’s imagination, the\nphysical reluctance had, inexplicably, so overborne the intellectual\nattraction, that the last years had been, to both of them, an agony of\nconflicting impulses. Even now, if, in turning over old papers, his hand\nlit on her letters, the touch filled him with inarticulate misery....\n\n“She had so few intimate friends... that letters will be of special\nvalue.” So few intimate friends! For years she had had but one; one\nwho in the last years had requited her wonderful pages, her tragic\noutpourings of love, humility, and pardon, with the scant phrases by\nwhich a man evades the vulgarest of sentimental importunities. He\nhad been a brute in spite of himself, and sometimes, now that the\nremembrance of her face had faded, and only her voice and words remained\nwith him, he chafed at his own inadequacy, his stupid inability to rise\nto the height of her passion. His egoism was not of a kind to mirror its\ncomplacency in the adventure. To have been loved by the most brilliant\nwoman of her day, and to have been incapable of loving her, seemed to\nhim, in looking back, the most derisive evidence of his limitations; and\nhis remorseful tenderness for her memory was complicated with a sense of\nirritation against her for having given him once for all the measure of\nhis emotional capacity. It was not often, however, that he thus probed\nthe past. The public, in taking possession of Mrs. Aubyn, had eased his\nshoulders of their burden. There was something fatuous in an attitude of\nsentimental apology toward a memory already classic: to reproach one’s\nself for not having loved Margaret Aubyn was a good deal like being\ndisturbed by an inability to admire the Venus of Milo. From her\ncold niche of fame she looked down ironically enough on his\nself-flagellations.... It was only when he came on something that\nbelonged to her that he felt a sudden renewal of the old feeling, the\nstrange dual impulse that drew him to her voice but drove him from her\nhand, so that even now, at sight of anything she had touched, his heart\ncontracted painfully. It happened seldom nowadays. Her little presents,\none by one, had disappeared from his rooms, and her letters, kept from\nsome unacknowledged puerile vanity in the possession of such treasures,\nseldom came beneath his hand....\n\n“Her letters will be of special value--” Her letters! Why, he must have\nhundreds of them--enough to fill a volume. Sometimes it used to seem\nto him that they came with every post--he used to avoid looking in his\nletter-box when he came home to his rooms--but her writing seemed to\nspring out at him as he put his key in the door--.\n\nHe stood up and strolled into the other room. Hollingsworth, lounging\naway from the window, had joined himself to a languidly convivial group\nof men to whom, in phrases as halting as though they struggled to define\nan ultimate idea, he was expounding the cursed nuisance of living in\na hole with such a damned climate that one had to get out of it by\nFebruary, with the contingent difficulty of there being no place to take\none’s yacht to in winter but that other played-out hole, the Riviera.\nFrom the outskirts of this group Glennard wandered to another, where\na voice as different as possible from Hollingsworth’s colorless organ\ndominated another circle of languid listeners.\n\n“Come and hear Dinslow talk about his patent: admission free,” one of\nthe men sang out in a tone of mock resignation.\n\nDinslow turned to Glennard the confident pugnacity of his smile. “Give\nit another six months and it’ll be talking about itself,” he declared.\n“It’s pretty nearly articulate now.”\n\n“Can it say papa?” someone else inquired.\n\nDinslow’s smile broadened. “You’ll be deuced glad to say papa to IT\na year from now,” he retorted. “It’ll be able to support even you in\naffluence. Look here, now, just let me explain to you--”\n\nGlennard moved away impatiently. The men at the club--all but those who\nwere “in it”--were proverbially “tired” of Dinslow’s patent, and none\nmore so than Glennard, whose knowledge of its merits made it loom large\nin the depressing catalogue of lost opportunities. The relations between\nthe two men had always been friendly, and Dinslow’s urgent offers to\n“take him in on the ground floor” had of late intensified Glennard’s\nsense of his own inability to meet good luck half way. Some of the men\nwho had paused to listen were already in evening clothes, others on\ntheir way home to dress; and Glennard, with an accustomed twinge of\nhumiliation, said to himself that if he lingered among them it was in\nthe miserable hope that one of the number might ask him to dine. Miss\nTrent had told him that she was to go to the opera that evening with her\nrich aunt; and if he should have the luck to pick up a dinner-invitation\nhe might join her there without extra outlay.\n\nHe moved about the room, lingering here and there in a tentative\naffectation of interest; but though the men greeted him pleasantly no\none asked him to dine. Doubtless they were all engaged, these men who\ncould afford to pay for their dinners, who did not have to hunt for\ninvitations as a beggar rummages for a crust in an ash-barrel! But\nno--as Hollingsworth left the lessening circle about the table an\nadmiring youth called out--“Holly, stop and dine!”\n\nHollingsworth turned on him the crude countenance that looked like the\nwrong side of a more finished face. “Sorry I can’t. I’m in for a beastly\nbanquet.”\n\nGlennard threw himself into an arm-chair. Why go home in the rain to\ndress? It was folly to take a cab to the opera, it was worse folly to go\nthere at all. His perpetual meetings with Alexa Trent were as unfair to\nthe girl as they were unnerving to himself. Since he couldn’t marry her,\nit was time to stand aside and give a better man the chance--and\nhis thought admitted the ironical implication that in the terms of\nexpediency the phrase might stand for Hollingsworth.\n\n\n\n\nII\n\n\nHe dined alone and walked home to his rooms in the rain. As he turned\ninto Fifth Avenue he caught the wet gleam of carriages on their way to\nthe opera, and he took the first side street, in a moment of irritation\nagainst the petty restrictions that thwarted every impulse. It was\nridiculous to give up the opera, not because one might possibly be bored\nthere, but because one must pay for the experiment.\n\nIn his sitting-room, the tacit connivance of the inanimate had centred\nthe lamp-light on a photograph of Alexa Trent, placed, in the obligatory\nsilver frame, just where, as memory officiously reminded him, Margaret\nAubyn’s picture had long throned in its stead. Miss Trent’s features\ncruelly justified the usurpation. She had the kind of beauty that comes\nof a happy accord of face and spirit. It is not given to many to have\nthe lips and eyes of their rarest mood, and some women go through life\nbehind a mask expressing only their anxiety about the butcher’s bill or\ntheir inability to see a joke. With Miss Trent, face and mind had the\nsame high serious contour. She looked like a throned Justice by some\ngrave Florentine painter; and it seemed to Glennard that her most\nsalient attribute, or that at least to which her conduct gave most\nconsistent expression, was a kind of passionate justice--the intuitive\nfeminine justness that is so much rarer than a reasoned impartiality.\nCircumstances had tragically combined to develop this instinct into a\nconscious habit. She had seen more than most girls of the shabby side of\nlife, of the perpetual tendency of want to cramp the noblest attitude.\nPoverty and misfortune had overhung her childhood and she had none of\nthe pretty delusions about life that are supposed to be the crowning\ngrace of girlhood. This very competence, which gave her a touching\nreasonableness, made Glennard’s situation more difficult than if he had\naspired to a princess bred in the purple. Between them they asked\nso little--they knew so well how to make that little do--but they\nunderstood also, and she especially did not for a moment let him forget,\nthat without that little the future they dreamed of was impossible.\n\nThe sight of her photograph quickened Glennard’s exasperation. He was\nsick and ashamed of the part he was playing. He had loved her now for\ntwo years, with the tranquil tenderness that gathers depth and volume\nas it nears fulfilment; he knew that she would wait for him--but the\ncertitude was an added pang. There are times when the constancy of the\nwoman one cannot marry is almost as trying as that of the woman one does\nnot want to.\n\nGlennard turned up his reading-lamp and stirred the fire. He had a long\nevening before him and he wanted to crowd out thought with action. He\nhad brought some papers from his office and he spread them out on his\ntable and squared himself to the task....\n\nIt must have been an hour later that he found himself automatically\nfitting a key into a locked drawer. He had no more notion than a\nsomnambulist of the mental process that had led up to this action. He\nwas just dimly aware of having pushed aside the papers and the heavy\ncalf volumes that a moment before had bounded his horizon, and of laying\nin their place, without a trace of conscious volition, the parcel he had\ntaken from the drawer.\n\nThe letters were tied in packets of thirty or forty. There were a great\nmany packets. On some of the envelopes the ink was fading; on others,\nwhich bore the English post-mark, it was still fresh. She had been dead\nhardly three years, and she had written, at lengthening intervals, to\nthe last....\n\nHe undid one of the earlier packets--little notes written during their\nfirst acquaintance at Hillbridge. Glennard, on leaving college, had\nbegun life in his uncle’s law office in the old university town. It was\nthere that, at the house of her father, Professor Forth, he had first\nmet the young lady then chiefly distinguished for having, after two\nyears of a conspicuously unhappy marriage, returned to the protection of\nthe paternal roof.\n\nMrs. Aubyn was at that time an eager and somewhat tragic young woman,\nof complex mind and undeveloped manners, whom her crude experience of\nmatrimony had fitted out with a stock of generalizations that exploded\nlike bombs in the academic air of Hillbridge. In her choice of a husband\nshe had been fortunate enough, if the paradox be permitted, to light on\none so signally gifted with the faculty of putting himself in the wrong\nthat her leaving him had the dignity of a manifesto--made her, as\nit were, the spokeswoman of outraged wifehood. In this light she was\ncherished by that dominant portion of Hillbridge society which was\nleast indulgent to conjugal differences, and which found a proportionate\npleasure in being for once able to feast openly on a dish liberally\nseasoned with the outrageous. So much did this endear Mrs. Aubyn to the\nuniversity ladies that they were disposed from the first to allow her\nmore latitude of speech and action than the ill-used wife was generally\naccorded in Hillbridge, where misfortune was still regarded as a\nvisitation designed to put people in their proper place and make them\nfeel the superiority of their neighbors. The young woman so privileged\ncombined with a kind of personal shyness an intellectual audacity that\nwas like a deflected impulse of coquetry: one felt that if she had been\nprettier she would have had emotions instead of ideas. She was in fact\neven then what she had always remained: a genius capable of the\nacutest generalizations, but curiously undiscerning where her personal\nsusceptibilities were concerned. Her psychology failed her just where it\nserves most women and one felt that her brains would never be a guide\nto her heart. Of all this, however, Glennard thought little in the first\nyear of their acquaintance. He was at an age when all the gifts and\ngraces are but so much undiscriminated food to the ravening egoism of\nyouth. In seeking Mrs. Aubyn’s company he was prompted by an intuitive\ntaste for the best as a pledge of his own superiority. The sympathy\nof the cleverest woman in Hillbridge was balm to his craving for\ndistinction: it was public confirmation of his secret sense that he was\ncut out for a bigger place. It must not be understood that Glennard was\nvain. Vanity contents itself with the coarsest diet; there is no\npalate so fastidious as that of self-distrust. To a youth of Glennard’s\naspirations the encouragement of a clever woman stood for the symbol\nof all success. Later, when he had begun to feel his way, to gain a\nfoothold, he would not need such support; but it served to carry\nhim lightly and easily over what is often a period of insecurity and\ndiscouragement.\n\nIt would be unjust, however, to represent his interest in Mrs. Aubyn as\na matter of calculation. It was as instinctive as love, and it missed\nbeing love by just such a hair-breadth deflection from the line of\nbeauty as had determined the curve of Mrs. Aubyn’s lips. When they met\nshe had just published her first novel, and Glennard, who afterward had\nan ambitious man’s impatience of distinguished women, was young enough\nto be dazzled by the semi-publicity it gave her. It was the kind of book\nthat makes elderly ladies lower their voices and call each other “my\ndear” when they furtively discuss it; and Glennard exulted in the\nsuperior knowledge of the world that enabled him to take as a matter of\ncourse sentiments over which the university shook its head. Still\nmore delightful was it to hear Mrs. Aubyn waken the echoes of academic\ndrawing-rooms with audacities surpassing those of her printed page. Her\nintellectual independence gave a touch of comradeship to their intimacy,\nprolonging the illusion of college friendships based on a joyous\ninterchange of heresies. Mrs. Aubyn and Glennard represented to each\nother the augur’s wink behind the Hillbridge idol: they walked together\nin that light of young omniscience from which fate so curiously excludes\none’s elders.\n\nHusbands who are notoriously inopportune, may even die inopportunely,\nand this was the revenge that Mr. Aubyn, some two years after her return\nto Hillbridge, took upon his injured wife. He died precisely at the\nmoment when Glennard was beginning to criticise her. It was not that\nshe bored him; she did what was infinitely worse--she made him feel his\ninferiority. The sense of mental equality had been gratifying to his raw\nambition; but as his self-knowledge defined itself, his understanding of\nher also increased; and if man is at times indirectly flattered by the\nmoral superiority of woman, her mental ascendency is extenuated by no\nsuch oblique tribute to his powers. The attitude of looking up is a\nstrain on the muscles; and it was becoming more and more Glennard’s\nopinion that brains, in a woman, should be merely the obverse of beauty.\nTo beauty Mrs. Aubyn could lay no claim; and while she had enough\nprettiness to exasperate him by her incapacity to make use of it, she\nseemed invincibly ignorant of any of the little artifices whereby women\ncontrive to palliate their defects and even to turn them into graces.\nHer dress never seemed a part of her; all her clothes had an impersonal\nair, as though they had belonged to someone else and been borrowed in an\nemergency that had somehow become chronic. She was conscious enough of\nher deficiencies to try to amend them by rash imitations of the most\napproved models; but no woman who does not dress well intuitively will\never do so by the light of reason, and Mrs. Aubyn’s plagiarisms, to\nborrow a metaphor of her trade, somehow never seemed to be incorporated\nwith the text.\n\nGenius is of small use to a woman who does not know how to do her hair.\nThe fame that came to Mrs. Aubyn with her second book left Glennard’s\nimagination untouched, or had at most the negative effect of removing\nher still farther from the circle of his contracting sympathies. We are\nall the sport of time; and fate had so perversely ordered the chronology\nof Margaret Aubyn’s romance that when her husband died Glennard felt as\nthough he had lost a friend.\n\nIt was not in his nature to be needlessly unkind; and though he was\nin the impregnable position of the man who has given a woman no more\ndefinable claim on him than that of letting her fancy that he loves\nher, he would not for the world have accentuated his advantage by any\nbetrayal of indifference. During the first year of her widowhood their\nfriendship dragged on with halting renewals of sentiment, becoming more\nand more a banquet of empty dishes from which the covers were never\nremoved; then Glennard went to New York to live and exchanged the faded\npleasures of intercourse for the comparative novelty of correspondence.\nHer letters, oddly enough, seemed at first to bring her nearer than her\npresence. She had adopted, and she successfully maintained, a note as\naffectionately impersonal as his own; she wrote ardently of her work,\nshe questioned him about his, she even bantered him on the inevitable\npretty girl who was certain before long to divert the current of his\nconfidences. To Glennard, who was almost a stranger in New York,\nthe sight of Mrs. Aubyn’s writing was like a voice of reassurance in\nsurroundings as yet insufficiently aware of him. His vanity found a\nretrospective enjoyment in the sentiment his heart had rejected, and\nthis factitious emotion drove him once or twice to Hillbridge, whence,\nafter scenes of evasive tenderness, he returned dissatisfied with\nhimself and her. As he made room for himself in New York and peopled the\nspace he had cleared with the sympathies at the disposal of agreeable\nand self-confident young men, it seemed to him natural to infer that\nMrs. Aubyn had refurnished in the same manner the void he was not\nunwilling his departure should have left. But in the dissolution of\nsentimental partnerships it is seldom that both associates are able to\nwithdraw their funds at the same time; and Glennard gradually learned\nthat he stood for the venture on which Mrs. Aubyn had irretrievably\nstaked her all. It was not the kind of figure he cared to cut. He had\nno fancy for leaving havoc in his wake and would have preferred to sow\na quick growth of oblivion in the spaces wasted by his unconsidered\ninroads; but if he supplied the seed it was clearly Mrs. Aubyn’s\nbusiness to see to the raising of the crop. Her attitude seemed indeed\nto throw his own reasonableness into distincter relief: so that they\nmight have stood for thrift and improvidence in an allegory of the\naffections.\n\nIt was not that Mrs. Aubyn permitted herself to be a pensioner on his\nbounty. He knew she had no wish to keep herself alive on the small\nchange of sentiment; she simply fed on her own funded passion, and the\nluxuries it allowed her made him, even then, dimly aware that she had\nthe secret of an inexhaustible alchemy.\n\nTheir relations remained thus negatively tender till she suddenly wrote\nhim of her decision to go abroad to live. Her father had died, she had\nno near ties in Hillbridge, and London offered more scope than New York\nto her expanding personality. She was already famous and her laurels\nwere yet unharvested.\n\nFor a moment the news roused Glennard to a jealous sense of lost\nopportunities. He wanted, at any rate, to reassert his power before she\nmade the final effort of escape. They had not met for over a year, but\nof course he could not let her sail without seeing her. She came to\nNew York the day before her departure, and they spent its last hours\ntogether. Glennard had planned no course of action--he simply meant to\nlet himself drift. They both drifted, for a long time, down the languid\ncurrent of reminiscence; she seemed to sit passive, letting him push\nhis way back through the overgrown channels of the past. At length she\nreminded him that they must bring their explorations to an end. He rose\nto leave, and stood looking at her with the same uncertainty in his\nheart. He was tired of her already--he was always tired of her--yet he\nwas not sure that he wanted her to go.\n\n“I may never see you again,” he said, as though confidently appealing to\nher compassion.\n\nHer look enveloped him. “And I shall see you always--always!”\n\n“Why go then--?” escaped him.\n\n“To be nearer you,” she answered; and the words dismissed him like a\nclosing door.\n\nThe door was never to reopen; but through its narrow crack Glennard, as\nthe years went on, became more and more conscious of an inextinguishable\nlight directing its small ray toward the past which consumed so little\nof his own commemorative oil. The reproach was taken from this thought\nby Mrs. Aubyn’s gradual translation into terms of universality. In\nbecoming a personage she so naturally ceased to be a person that\nGlennard could almost look back to his explorations of her spirit as on\na visit to some famous shrine, immortalized, but in a sense desecrated,\nby popular veneration.\n\nHer letters, from London, continued to come with the same tender\npunctuality; but the altered conditions of her life, the vistas of new\nrelationships disclosed by every phrase, made her communications as\nimpersonal as a piece of journalism. It was as though the state, the\nworld, indeed, had taken her off his hands, assuming the maintenance of\na temperament that had long exhausted his slender store of reciprocity.\n\nIn the retrospective light shed by the letters he was blinded to\ntheir specific meaning. He was not a man who concerned himself with\nliterature, and they had been to him, at first, simply the extension of\nher brilliant talk, later the dreaded vehicle of a tragic importunity.\nHe knew, of course, that they were wonderful; that, unlike the authors\nwho give their essence to the public and keep only a dry rind for their\nfriends, Mrs. Aubyn had stored of her rarest vintage for this hidden\nsacrament of tenderness. Sometimes, indeed, he had been oppressed,\nhumiliated almost, by the multiplicity of her allusions, the wide scope\nof her interests, her persistence in forcing her superabundance of\nthought and emotion into the shallow receptacle of his sympathy; but\nhe had never thought of the letters objectively, as the production of a\ndistinguished woman; had never measured the literary significance of her\noppressive prodigality. He was almost frightened now at the wealth in\nhis hands; the obligation of her love had never weighed on him like\nthis gift of her imagination: it was as though he had accepted from her\nsomething to which even a reciprocal tenderness could not have justified\nhis claim.\n\nHe sat a long time staring at the scattered pages on his desk; and in\nthe sudden realization of what they meant he could almost fancy some\nalchemistic process changing them to gold as he stared. He had the\nsense of not being alone in the room, of the presence of another self\nobserving from without the stirring of subconscious impulses that sent\nflushes of humiliation to his forehead. At length he stood up, and\nwith the gesture of a man who wishes to give outward expression to his\npurpose--to establish, as it were, a moral alibi--swept the letters into\na heap and carried them toward the grate. But it would have taken too\nlong to burn all the packets. He turned back to the table and one by one\nfitted the pages into their envelopes; then he tied up the letters and\nput them back into the locked drawer.\n\n\n\n\nIII\n\n\nIt was one of the laws of Glennard’s intercourse with Miss Trent that\nhe always went to see her the day after he had resolved to give her up.\nThere was a special charm about the moments thus snatched from the\njaws of renunciation; and his sense of their significance was on\nthis occasion so keen that he hardly noticed the added gravity of her\nwelcome.\n\nHis feeling for her had become so vital a part of him that her nearness\nhad the quality of imperceptibly readjusting his point of view, so\nthat the jumbled phenomena of experience fell at once into a rational\nperspective. In this redistribution of values the sombre retrospect\nof the previous evening shrank to a mere cloud on the edge of\nconsciousness. Perhaps the only service an unloved woman can render the\nman she loves is to enhance and prolong his illusions about her rival.\nIt was the fate of Margaret Aubyn’s memory to serve as a foil to Miss\nTrent’s presence, and never had the poor lady thrown her successor into\nmore vivid relief.\n\nMiss Trent had the charm of still waters that are felt to be renewed\nby rapid currents. Her attention spread a tranquil surface to the\ndemonstrations of others, and it was only in days of storm that one felt\nthe pressure of the tides. This inscrutable composure was perhaps her\nchief grace in Glennard’s eyes. Reserve, in some natures, implies merely\nthe locking of empty rooms or the dissimulation of awkward encumbrances;\nbut Miss Trent’s reticence was to Glennard like the closed door to the\nsanctuary, and his certainty of divining the hidden treasure made him\ncontent to remain outside in the happy expectancy of the neophyte.\n\n“You didn’t come to the opera last night,” she began, in the tone that\nseemed always rather to record a fact than to offer a reflection on it.\n\nHe answered with a discouraged gesture. “What was the use? We couldn’t\nhave talked.”\n\n“Not as well as here,” she assented; adding, after a meditative pause,\n“As you didn’t come I talked to Aunt Virginia instead.”\n\n“Ah!” he returned, the fact being hardly striking enough to detach him\nfrom the contemplation of her hands, which had fallen, as was their\nwont, into an attitude full of plastic possibilities. One felt them to\nbe hands that, moving only to some purpose, were capable of intervals of\nserene inaction.\n\n“We had a long talk,” Miss Trent went on; and she waited again before\nadding, with the increased absence of stress that marked her graver\ncommunications, “Aunt Virginia wants me to go abroad with her.”\n\nGlennard looked up with a start. “Abroad? When?”\n\n“Now--next month. To be gone two years.”\n\nHe permitted himself a movement of tender derision. “Does she really?\nWell, I want you to go abroad with ME--for any number of years. Which\noffer do you accept?”\n\n“Only one of them seems to require immediate consideration,” she\nreturned, with a smile.\n\nGlennard looked at her again. “You’re not thinking of it?”\n\nHer gaze dropped and she unclasped her hands. Her movements were so rare\nthat they might have been said to italicize her words. “Aunt Virginia\ntalked to me very seriously. It will be a great relief to mother and the\nothers to have me provided for in that way for two years. I must\nthink of that, you know.” She glanced down at her gown which, under a\nrenovated surface, dated back to the first days of Glennard’s wooing. “I\ntry not to cost much--but I do.”\n\n“Good Lord!” Glennard groaned.\n\nThey sat silent till at length she gently took up the argument. “As the\neldest, you know, I’m bound to consider these things. Women are such a\nburden. Jim does what he can for mother, but with his own children to\nprovide for it isn’t very much. You see, we’re all poor together.”\n\n“Your aunt isn’t. She might help your mother.”\n\n“She does--in her own way.”\n\n“Exactly--that’s the rich relation all over! You may be miserable in\nany way you like, but if you’re to be happy you’ve got to be so in her\nway--and in her old gowns.”\n\n“I could be very happy in Aunt Virginia’s old gowns,” Miss Trent\ninterposed.\n\n“Abroad, you mean?”\n\n“I mean wherever I felt that I was helping. And my going abroad will\nhelp.”\n\n“Of course--I see that. And I see your considerateness in putting its\nadvantages negatively.”\n\n“Negatively?”\n\n“In dwelling simply on what the going will take you from, not on what\nit will bring you to. It means a lot to a woman, of course, to get\naway from a life like this.” He summed up in a disparaging glance the\nbackground of indigent furniture. “The question is how you’ll like\ncoming back to it.”\n\nShe seemed to accept the full consequences of his thought. “I only know\nI don’t like leaving it.”\n\nHe flung back sombrely, “You don’t even put it conditionally then?”\n\nHer gaze deepened. “On what?”\n\nHe stood up and walked across the room. Then he came back and paused\nbefore her. “On the alternative of marrying me.”\n\nThe slow color--even her blushes seemed deliberate--rose to her lower\nlids; her lips stirred, but the words resolved themselves into a smile\nand she waited.\n\nHe took another turn, with the thwarted step of the man whose nervous\nexasperation escapes through his muscles.\n\n“And to think that in fifteen years I shall have a big practice!”\n\nHer eyes triumphed for him. “In less!”\n\n“The cursed irony of it! What do I care for the man I shall be then?\nIt’s slaving one’s life away for a stranger!” He took her hands\nabruptly. “You’ll go to Cannes, I suppose, or Monte Carlo? I heard\nHollingsworth say to-day that he meant to take his yacht over to the\nMediterranean--”\n\nShe released herself. “If you think that--”\n\n“I don’t. I almost wish I did. It would be easier, I mean.” He broke off\nincoherently. “I believe your Aunt Virginia does, though. She somehow\nconnotes Hollingsworth and the Mediterranean.” He caught her hands\nagain. “Alexa--if we could manage a little hole somewhere out of town?”\n\n“Could we?” she sighed, half yielding.\n\n“In one of those places where they make jokes about the mosquitoes,” he\npressed her. “Could you get on with one servant?”\n\n“Could you get on without varnished boots?”\n\n“Promise me you won’t go, then!”\n\n“What are you thinking of, Stephen?”\n\n“I don’t know,” he stammered, the question giving unexpected form to his\nintention. “It’s all in the air yet, of course; but I picked up a tip\nthe other day--”\n\n“You’re not speculating?” she cried, with a kind of superstitious\nterror.\n\n“Lord, no. This is a sure thing--I almost wish it wasn’t; I mean if I\ncan work it--” He had a sudden vision of the comprehensiveness of the\ntemptation. If only he had been less sure of Dinslow! His assurance gave\nthe situation the base element of safety.\n\n“I don’t understand you,” she faltered.\n\n“Trust me, instead!” he adjured her, with sudden energy; and turning on\nher abruptly, “If you go, you know, you go free,” he concluded.\n\nShe drew back, paling a little. “Why do you make it harder for me?”\n\n“To make it easier for myself,” he retorted.\n\n\n\n\nIV\n\n\nGlennard, the next afternoon, leaving his office earlier than usual,\nturned, on his way home, into one of the public libraries.\n\nHe had the place to himself at that closing hour, and the librarian\nwas able to give an undivided attention to his tentative request for\nletters--collections of letters. The librarian suggested Walpole.\n\n“I meant women--women’s letters.”\n\nThe librarian proffered Hannah More and Miss Martineau.\n\nGlennard cursed his own inarticulateness. “I mean letters to--to some\none person--a man; their husband--or--”\n\n“Ah,” said the inspired librarian, “Eloise and Abailard.”\n\n“Well--something a little nearer, perhaps,” said Glennard, with\nlightness. “Didn’t Merimee--”\n\n“The lady’s letters, in that case, were not published.”\n\n“Of course not,” said Glennard, vexed at his blunder.\n\n“There are George Sand’s letters to Flaubert.”\n\n“Ah!” Glennard hesitated. “Was she--were they--?” He chafed at his own\nignorance of the sentimental by-paths of literature.\n\n“If you want love-letters, perhaps some of the French eighteenth\ncentury correspondences might suit you better--Mlle. Aisse or Madame de\nSabran--”\n\nBut Glennard insisted. “I want something modern--English or American. I\nwant to look something up,” he lamely concluded.\n\nThe librarian could only suggest George Eliot.\n\n“Well, give me some of the French things, then--and I’ll have Merimee’s\nletters. It was the woman who published them, wasn’t it?”\n\nHe caught up his armful, transferring it, on the doorstep, to a cab\nwhich carried him to his rooms. He dined alone, hurriedly, at a small\nrestaurant near by, and returned at once to his books.\n\nLate that night, as he undressed, he wondered what contemptible impulse\nhad forced from him his last words to Alexa Trent. It was bad enough to\ninterfere with the girl’s chances by hanging about her to the obvious\nexclusion of other men, but it was worse to seem to justify his weakness\nby dressing up the future in delusive ambiguities. He saw himself\nsinking from depth to depth of sentimental cowardice in his reluctance\nto renounce his hold on her; and it filled him with self-disgust to\nthink that the highest feeling of which he supposed himself capable was\nblent with such base elements.\n\nHis awakening was hardly cheered by the sight of her writing. He tore\nher note open and took in the few lines--she seldom exceeded the first\npage--with the lucidity of apprehension that is the forerunner of evil.\n\n“My aunt sails on Saturday and I must give her my answer the day after\nto-morrow. Please don’t come till then--I want to think the question\nover by myself. I know I ought to go. Won’t you help me to be\nreasonable?”\n\nIt was settled, then. Well, he would be reasonable; he wouldn’t stand\nin her way; he would let her go. For two years he had been living some\nother, luckier man’s life; the time had come when he must drop back into\nhis own. He no longer tried to look ahead, to grope his way through\nthe endless labyrinth of his material difficulties; a sense of dull\nresignation closed in on him like a fog.\n\n“Hullo, Glennard!” a voice said, as an electric-car, late that\nafternoon, dropped him at an uptown corner.\n\nHe looked up and met the interrogative smile of Barton Flamel, who\nstood on the curbstone watching the retreating car with the eye of a man\nphilosophic enough to remember that it will be followed by another.\n\nGlennard felt his usual impulse of pleasure at meeting Flamel; but\nit was not in this case curtailed by the reaction of contempt that\nhabitually succeeded it. Probably even the few men who had known Flamel\nsince his youth could have given no good reason for the vague mistrust\nthat he inspired. Some people are judged by their actions, others by\ntheir ideas; and perhaps the shortest way of defining Flamel is to say\nthat his well-known leniency of view was vaguely divined to include\nhimself. Simple minds may have resented the discovery that his opinions\nwere based on his perceptions; but there was certainly no more definite\ncharge against him than that implied in the doubt as to how he would\nbehave in an emergency, and his company was looked upon as one of those\nmildly unwholesome dissipations to which the prudent may occasionally\nyield. It now offered itself to Glennard as an easy escape from the\nobsession of moral problems, which somehow could no more be worn in\nFlamel’s presence than a surplice in the street.\n\n“Where are you going? To the club?” Flamel asked; adding, as the younger\nman assented, “Why not come to my studio instead? You’ll see one bore\ninstead of twenty.”\n\nThe apartment which Flamel described as his studio showed, as its one\nclaim to the designation, a perennially empty easel; the rest of its\nspace being filled with the evidences of a comprehensive dilettanteism.\nAgainst this background, which seemed the visible expression of its\nowner’s intellectual tolerance, rows of fine books detached themselves\nwith a prominence, showing them to be Flamel’s chief care.\n\nGlennard glanced with the eye of untrained curiosity at the lines of\nwarm-toned morocco, while his host busied himself with the uncorking of\nApollinaris.\n\n“You’ve got a splendid lot of books,” he said.\n\n“They’re fairly decent,” the other assented, in the curt tone of the\ncollector who will not talk of his passion for fear of talking of\nnothing else; then, as Glennard, his hands in his pockets, began to\nstroll perfunctorily down the long line of bookcases--“Some men,” Flamel\nirresistibly added, “think of books merely as tools, others as tooling.\nI’m between the two; there are days when I use them as scenery, other\ndays when I want them as society; so that, as you see, my library\nrepresents a makeshift compromise between looks and brains, and the\ncollectors look down on me almost as much as the students.”\n\nGlennard, without answering, was mechanically taking one book after\nanother from the shelves. His hands slipped curiously over the smooth\ncovers and the noiseless subsidence of opening pages. Suddenly he came\non a thin volume of faded manuscript.\n\n“What’s this?” he asked, with a listless sense of wonder.\n\n“Ah, you’re at my manuscript shelf. I’ve been going in for that sort of\nthing lately.” Flamel came up and looked over his shoulders. “That’s a\nbit of Stendhal--one of the Italian stories--and here are some letters\nof Balzac to Madame Commanville.”\n\nGlennard took the book with sudden eagerness. “Who was Madame\nCommanville?”\n\n“His sister.” He was conscious that Flamel was looking at him with the\nsmile that was like an interrogation point. “I didn’t know you cared for\nthis kind of thing.”\n\n“I don’t--at least I’ve never had the chance. Have you many collections\nof letters?”\n\n“Lord, no--very few. I’m just beginning, and most of the interesting\nones are out of my reach. Here’s a queer little collection, though--the\nrarest thing I’ve got--half a dozen of Shelley’s letters to Harriet\nWestbrook. I had a devil of a time getting them--a lot of collectors\nwere after them.”\n\nGlennard, taking the volume from his hand, glanced with a kind of\nrepugnance at the interleaving of yellow cris-crossed sheets. “She was\nthe one who drowned herself, wasn’t she?”\n\nFlamel nodded. “I suppose that little episode adds about fifty per cent.\nto their value,” he said, meditatively.\n\nGlennard laid the book down. He wondered why he had joined Flamel.\nHe was in no humor to be amused by the older man’s talk, and a\nrecrudescence of personal misery rose about him like an icy tide.\n\n“I believe I must take myself off,” he said. “I’d forgotten an\nengagement.”\n\nHe turned to go; but almost at the same moment he was conscious of a\nduality of intention wherein his apparent wish to leave revealed itself\nas a last effort of the will against the overmastering desire to stay\nand unbosom himself to Flamel.\n\nThe older man, as though divining the conflict, laid a detaining\npressure on his arm.\n\n“Won’t the engagement keep? Sit down and try one of these cigars. I\ndon’t often have the luck of seeing you here.”\n\n“I’m rather driven just now,” said Glennard, vaguely. He found himself\nseated again, and Flamel had pushed to his side a low stand holding a\nbottle of Apollinaris and a decanter of cognac.\n\nFlamel, thrown back in his capacious arm-chair, surveyed him through\na cloud of smoke with the comfortable tolerance of the man to whom no\ninconsistencies need be explained. Connivance was implicit in the air.\nIt was the kind of atmosphere in which the outrageous loses its edge.\nGlennard felt a gradual relaxing of his nerves.\n\n“I suppose one has to pay a lot for letters like that?” he heard himself\nasking, with a glance in the direction of the volume he had laid aside.\n\n“Oh, so-so--depends on circumstances.” Flamel viewed him thoughtfully.\n“Are you thinking of collecting?”\n\nGlennard laughed. “Lord, no. The other way round.”\n\n“Selling?”\n\n“Oh, I hardly know. I was thinking of a poor chap--”\n\nFlamel filled the pause with a nod of interest.\n\n“A poor chap I used to know--who died--he died last year--and who left\nme a lot of letters, letters he thought a great deal of--he was fond\nof me and left ‘em to me outright, with the idea, I suppose, that\nthey might benefit me somehow--I don’t know--I’m not much up on such\nthings--” he reached his hand to the tall glass his host had filled.\n\n“A collection of autograph letters, eh? Any big names?”\n\n“Oh, only one name. They’re all letters written to him--by one person,\nyou understand; a woman, in fact--”\n\n“Oh, a woman,” said Flamel, negligently.\n\nGlennard was nettled by his obvious loss of interest. “I rather think\nthey’d attract a good deal of notice if they were published.”\n\nFlamel still looked uninterested. “Love-letters, I suppose?”\n\n“Oh, just--the letters a woman would write to a man she knew well. They\nwere tremendous friends, he and she.”\n\n“And she wrote a clever letter?”\n\n“Clever? It was Margaret Aubyn.”\n\nA great silence filled the room. It seemed to Glennard that the words\nhad burst from him as blood gushes from a wound.\n\n“Great Scott!” said Flamel, sitting up. “A collection of Margaret\nAubyn’s letters? Did you say YOU had them?”\n\n“They were left me--by my friend.”\n\n“I see. Was he--well, no matter. You’re to be congratulated, at any\nrate. What are you going to do with them?”\n\nGlennard stood up with a sense of weariness in all his bones. “Oh, I\ndon’t know. I haven’t thought much about it. I just happened to see that\nsome fellow was writing her life--”\n\n“Joslin; yes. You didn’t think of giving them to him?”\n\nGlennard had lounged across the room and stood staring up at a bronze\nBacchus who drooped his garlanded head above the pediment of an Italian\ncabinet. “What ought I to do? You’re just the fellow to advise me.” He\nfelt the blood in his cheek as he spoke.\n\nFlamel sat with meditative eye. “What do you WANT to do with them?” he\nasked.\n\n“I want to publish them,” said Glennard, swinging round with sudden\nenergy--“If I can--”\n\n“If you can? They’re yours, you say?”\n\n“They’re mine fast enough. There’s no one to prevent--I mean there are\nno restrictions--” he was arrested by the sense that these accumulated\nproofs of impunity might precisely stand as the strongest check on his\naction.\n\n“And Mrs. Aubyn had no family, I believe?”\n\n“No.”\n\n“Then I don’t see who’s to interfere,” said Flamel, studying his\ncigar-tip.\n\nGlennard had turned his unseeing stare on an ecstatic Saint Catherine\nframed in tarnished gilding.\n\n“It’s just this way,” he began again, with an effort. “When letters are\nas personal as--as these of my friend’s.... Well, I don’t mind telling\nyou that the cash would make a heap of difference to me; such a lot that\nit rather obscures my judgment--the fact is if I could lay my hand on a\nfew thousands now I could get into a big thing, and without appreciable\nrisk; and I’d like to know whether you think I’d be justified--under the\ncircumstances....” He paused, with a dry throat. It seemed to him at the\nmoment that it would be impossible for him ever to sink lower in his own\nestimation. He was in truth less ashamed of weighing the temptation than\nof submitting his scruples to a man like Flamel, and affecting to appeal\nto sentiments of delicacy on the absence of which he had consciously\nreckoned. But he had reached a point where each word seemed to compel\nanother, as each wave in a stream is forced forward by the pressure\nbehind it; and before Flamel could speak he had faltered out--“You don’t\nthink people could say... could criticise the man....”\n\n“But the man’s dead, isn’t he?”\n\n“He’s dead--yes; but can I assume the responsibility without--”\n\nFlamel hesitated; and almost immediately Glennard’s scruples gave way\nto irritation. If at this hour Flamel were to affect an inopportune\nreluctance--!\n\nThe older man’s answer reassured him. “Why need you assume any\nresponsibility? Your name won’t appear, of course; and as to your\nfriend’s, I don’t see why his should, either. He wasn’t a celebrity\nhimself, I suppose?”\n\n“No, no.”\n\n“Then the letters can be addressed to Mr. Blank. Doesn’t that make it\nall right?”\n\nGlennard’s hesitation revived. “For the public, yes. But I don’t see\nthat it alters the case for me. The question is, ought I to publish them\nat all?”\n\n“Of course you ought to.” Flamel spoke with invigorating emphasis. “I\ndoubt if you’d be justified in keeping them back. Anything of Margaret\nAubyn’s is more or less public property by this time. She’s too great\nfor any one of us. I was only wondering how you could use them to the\nbest advantage--to yourself, I mean. How many are there?”\n\n“Oh, a lot; perhaps a hundred--I haven’t counted. There may be more....”\n\n“Gad! What a haul! When were they written?”\n\n“I don’t know--that is--they corresponded for years. What’s the odds?”\n He moved toward his hat with a vague impulse of flight.\n\n“It all counts,” said Flamel, imperturbably. “A long\ncorrespondence--one, I mean, that covers a great deal of time--is\nobviously worth more than if the same number of letters had been written\nwithin a year. At any rate, you won’t give them to Joslin? They’d fill a\nbook, wouldn’t they?”\n\n“I suppose so. I don’t know how much it takes to fill a book.”\n\n“Not love-letters, you say?”\n\n“Why?” flashed from Glennard.\n\n“Oh, nothing--only the big public is sentimental, and if they WERE--why,\nyou could get any money for Margaret Aubyn’s love-letters.”\n\nGlennard was silent.\n\n“Are the letters interesting in themselves? I mean apart from the\nassociation with her name?”\n\n“I’m no judge.” Glennard took up his hat and thrust himself into his\novercoat. “I dare say I sha’n’t do anything about it. And, Flamel--you\nwon’t mention this to anyone?”\n\n“Lord, no. Well, I congratulate you. You’ve got a big thing.” Flamel was\nsmiling at him from the hearth.\n\nGlennard, on the threshold, forced a response to the smile, while he\nquestioned with loitering indifference--“Financially, eh?”\n\n“Rather; I should say so.”\n\nGlennard’s hand lingered on the knob. “How much--should you say? You\nknow about such things.”\n\n“Oh, I should have to see the letters; but I should say--well, if you’ve\ngot enough to fill a book and they’re fairly readable, and the book is\nbrought out at the right time--say ten thousand down from the publisher,\nand possibly one or two more in royalties. If you got the publishers\nbidding against each other you might do even better; but of course I’m\ntalking in the dark.”\n\n“Of course,” said Glennard, with sudden dizziness. His hand had slipped\nfrom the knob and he stood staring down at the exotic spirals of the\nPersian rug beneath his feet.\n\n“I’d have to see the letters,” Flamel repeated.\n\n“Of course--you’d have to see them....” Glennard stammered; and, without\nturning, he flung over his shoulder an inarticulate “Good-by....”\n\n\n\n\nV\n\n\nThe little house, as Glennard strolled up to it between the trees,\nseemed no more than a gay tent pitched against the sunshine. It had the\ncrispness of a freshly starched summer gown, and the geraniums on the\nveranda bloomed as simultaneously as the flowers in a bonnet. The garden\nwas prospering absurdly. Seed they had sown at random--amid laughing\ncounter-charges of incompetence--had shot up in fragrant defiance of\ntheir blunders. He smiled to see the clematis unfolding its punctual\nwings about the porch. The tiny lawn was smooth as a shaven cheek, and a\ncrimson rambler mounted to the nursery-window of a baby who never cried.\nA breeze shook the awning above the tea-table, and his wife, as he drew\nnear, could be seen bending above a kettle that was just about to boil.\nSo vividly did the whole scene suggest the painted bliss of a stage\nsetting, that it would have been hardly surprising to see her step\nforward among the flowers and trill out her virtuous happiness from the\nveranda-rail.\n\nThe stale heat of the long day in town, the dusty promiscuity of the\nsuburban train were now but the requisite foil to an evening of scented\nbreezes and tranquil talk. They had been married more than a year,\nand each home-coming still reflected the freshness of their first day\ntogether. If, indeed, their happiness had a flaw, it was in resembling\ntoo closely the bright impermanence of their surroundings. Their love as\nyet was but the gay tent of holiday-makers.\n\nHis wife looked up with a smile. The country life suited her, and her\nbeauty had gained depth from a stillness in which certain faces might\nhave grown opaque.\n\n“Are you very tired?” she asked, pouring his tea.\n\n“Just enough to enjoy this.” He rose from the chair in which he had\nthrown himself and bent over the tray for his cream. “You’ve had a\nvisitor?” he commented, noticing a half-empty cup beside her own.\n\n“Only Mr. Flamel,” she said, indifferently.\n\n“Flamel? Again?”\n\nShe answered without show of surprise. “He left just now. His yacht is\ndown at Laurel Bay and he borrowed a trap of the Dreshams to drive over\nhere.”\n\nGlennard made no comment, and she went on, leaning her head back against\nthe cushions of her bamboo-seat, “He wants us to go for a sail with him\nnext Sunday.”\n\nGlennard meditatively stirred his tea. He was trying to think of the\nmost natural and unartificial thing to say, and his voice seemed to come\nfrom the outside, as though he were speaking behind a marionette. “Do\nyou want to?”\n\n“Just as you please,” she said, compliantly. No affectation of\nindifference could have been as baffling as her compliance. Glennard, of\nlate, was beginning to feel that the surface which, a year ago, he\nhad taken for a sheet of clear glass, might, after all, be a mirror\nreflecting merely his own conception of what lay behind it.\n\n“Do you like Flamel?” he suddenly asked; to which, still engaged with\nher tea, she returned the feminine answer--“I thought you did.”\n\n“I do, of course,” he agreed, vexed at his own incorrigible tendency to\nmagnify Flamel’s importance by hovering about the topic. “A sail would\nbe rather jolly; let’s go.”\n\nShe made no reply and he drew forth the rolled-up evening papers which\nhe had thrust into his pocket on leaving the train. As he smoothed them\nout his own countenance seemed to undergo the same process. He ran his\neye down the list of stocks and Flamel’s importunate personality receded\nbehind the rows of figures pushing forward into notice like so many\nbearers of good news. Glennard’s investments were flowering like his\ngarden: the dryest shares blossomed into dividends, and a golden harvest\nawaited his sickle.\n\nHe glanced at his wife with the tranquil air of the man who digests\ngood luck as naturally as the dry ground absorbs a shower. “Things are\nlooking uncommonly well. I believe we shall be able to go to town for\ntwo or three months next winter if we can find something cheap.”\n\nShe smiled luxuriously: it was pleasant to be able to say, with an air\nof balancing relative advantages, “Really, on the baby’s account I shall\nbe almost sorry; but if we do go, there’s Kate Erskine’s house... she’ll\nlet us have it for almost nothing....”\n\n“Well, write her about it,” he recommended, his eyes travelling on\nin search of the weather report. He had turned to the wrong page; and\nsuddenly a line of black characters leapt out at him as from an ambush.\n\n“‘Margaret Aubyn’s Letters.’ Two volumes. Out to-day. First edition of\nfive thousand sold out before leaving the press. Second edition ready\nnext week. THE BOOK OF THE YEAR....”\n\nHe looked up stupidly. His wife still sat with her head thrown back,\nher pure profile detached against the cushions. She was smiling a little\nover the prospect his last words had opened. Behind her head shivers\nof sun and shade ran across the striped awning. A row of maples and\na privet hedge hid their neighbor’s gables, giving them undivided\npossession of their leafy half-acre; and life, a moment before, had\nbeen like their plot of ground, shut off, hedged in from importunities,\nimpenetrably his and hers. Now it seemed to him that every maple-leaf,\nevery privet-bud, was a relentless human gaze, pressing close upon their\nprivacy. It was as though they sat in a brightly lit room, uncurtained\nfrom a darkness full of hostile watchers.... His wife still smiled; and\nher unconsciousness of danger seemed, in some horrible way, to put her\nbeyond the reach of rescue....\n\nHe had not known that it would be like this. After the first odious\nweeks, spent in preparing the letters for publication, in submitting\nthem to Flamel, and in negotiating with the publishers, the transaction\nhad dropped out of his consciousness into that unvisited limbo to which\nwe relegate the deeds we would rather not have done but have no notion\nof undoing. From the moment he had obtained Miss Trent’s promise not\nto sail with her aunt he had tried to imagine himself irrevocably\ncommitted. After that, he argued, his first duty was to her--she had\nbecome his conscience. The sum obtained from the publishers by Flamel’s\nadroit manipulations and opportunely transferred to Dinslow’s successful\nventure, already yielded a return which, combined with Glennard’s\nprofessional earnings, took the edge of compulsion from their way of\nliving, making it appear the expression of a graceful preference for\nsimplicity. It was the mitigated poverty which can subscribe to a review\nor two and have a few flowers on the dinner-table. And already in\na small way Glennard was beginning to feel the magnetic quality of\nprosperity. Clients who had passed his door in the hungry days sought\nit out now that it bore the name of a successful man. It was understood\nthat a small inheritance, cleverly invested, was the source of his\nfortune; and there was a feeling that a man who could do so well for\nhimself was likely to know how to turn over other people’s money.\n\nBut it was in the more intimate reward of his wife’s happiness that\nGlennard tasted the full flavor of success. Coming out of conditions so\nnarrow that those he offered her seemed spacious, she fitted into her\nnew life without any of those manifest efforts at adjustment that are\nas sore to a husband’s pride as the critical rearrangement of the bridal\nfurniture. She had given him, instead, the delicate pleasure of watching\nher expand like a sea-creature restored to its element, stretching out\nthe atrophied tentacles of girlish vanity and enjoyment to the rising\ntide of opportunity. And somehow--in the windowless inner cell of his\nconsciousness where self-criticism cowered--Glennard’s course seemed\njustified by its merely material success. How could such a crop of\ninnocent blessedness have sprung from tainted soil?\n\n\n\nNow he had the injured sense of a man entrapped into a disadvantageous\nbargain. He had not known it would be like this; and a dull anger\ngathered at his heart. Anger against whom? Against his wife, for not\nknowing what he suffered? Against Flamel, for being the unconscious\ninstrument of his wrong-doing? Or against that mute memory to which his\nown act had suddenly given a voice of accusation? Yes, that was it;\nand his punishment henceforth would be the presence, the unescapable\npresence, of the woman he had so persistently evaded. She would always\nbe there now. It was as though he had married her instead of the other.\nIt was what she had always wanted--to be with him--and she had gained\nher point at last....\n\nHe sprang up, as though in an impulse of flight.... The sudden movement\nlifted his wife’s lids, and she asked, in the incurious voice of the\nwoman whose life is enclosed in a magic circle of prosperity--“Any\nnews?”\n\n“No--none--” he said, roused to a sense of immediate peril. The papers\nlay scattered at his feet--what if she were to see them? He stretched\nhis arm to gather them up, but his next thought showed him the futility\nof such concealment. The same advertisement would appear every day, for\nweeks to come, in every newspaper; how could he prevent her seeing it?\nHe could not always be hiding the papers from her.... Well, and what if\nshe did see it? It would signify nothing to her, the chances were that\nshe would never even read the book.... As she ceased to be an element of\nfear in his calculations the distance between them seemed to lessen\nand he took her again, as it were, into the circle of his conjugal\nprotection.... Yet a moment before he had almost hated her!... He\nlaughed aloud at his senseless terrors.... He was off his balance,\ndecidedly.\n\n“What are you laughing at?” she asked.\n\nHe explained, elaborately, that he was laughing at the recollection\nof an old woman in the train, an old woman with a lot of bundles, who\ncouldn’t find her ticket.... But somehow, in the telling, the humor of\nthe story seemed to evaporate, and he felt the conventionality of her\nsmile. He glanced at his watch, “Isn’t it time to dress?”\n\nShe rose with serene reluctance. “It’s a pity to go in. The garden looks\nso lovely.”\n\nThey lingered side by side, surveying their domain. There was not space\nin it, at this hour, for the shadow of the elm-tree in the angle of the\nhedge; it crossed the lawn, cut the flower-border in two, and ran up the\nside of the house to the nursery window. She bent to flick a caterpillar\nfrom the honey-suckle; then, as they turned indoors, “If we mean to\ngo on the yacht next Sunday,” she suggested, “oughtn’t you to let Mr.\nFlamel know?”\n\nGlennard’s exasperation deflected suddenly. “Of course I shall let him\nknow. You always seem to imply that I’m going to do something rude to\nFlamel.”\n\nThe words reverberated through her silence; she had a way of thus\nleaving one space in which to contemplate one’s folly at arm’s length.\nGlennard turned on his heel and went upstairs. As he dropped into a\nchair before his dressing-table he said to himself that in the last hour\nhe had sounded the depths of his humiliation and that the lowest dregs\nof it, the very bottom-slime, was the hateful necessity of having\nalways, as long as the two men lived, to be civil to Barton Flamel.\n\n\n\n\nVI\n\n\nTHE week in town had been sultry, and the men, in the Sunday\nemancipation of white flannel and duck, filled the deck-chairs of the\nyacht with their outstretched apathy, following, through a mist of\ncigarette-smoke, the flitting inconsequences of the women. The party\nwas a small one--Flamel had few intimate friends--but composed of more\nheterogeneous atoms than the little pools into which society usually\nruns. The reaction from the chief episode of his earlier life had\nbred in Glennard an uneasy distaste for any kind of personal saliency.\nCleverness was useful in business; but in society it seemed to him as\nfutile as the sham cascades formed by a stream that might have been used\nto drive a mill. He liked the collective point of view that goes with\nthe civilized uniformity of dress-clothes, and his wife’s attitude\nimplied the same preference; yet they found themselves slipping more\nand more into Flamel’s intimacy. Alexa had once or twice said that she\nenjoyed meeting clever people; but her enjoyment took the negative form\nof a smiling receptivity; and Glennard felt a growing preference for the\nkind of people who have their thinking done for them by the community.\n\nStill, the deck of the yacht was a pleasant refuge from the heat on\nshore, and his wife’s profile, serenely projected against the changing\nblue, lay on his retina like a cool hand on the nerves. He had never\nbeen more impressed by the kind of absoluteness that lifted her beauty\nabove the transient effects of other women, making the most harmonious\nface seem an accidental collocation of features.\n\nThe ladies who directly suggested this comparison were of a kind\naccustomed to take similar risks with more gratifying results. Mrs.\nArmiger had in fact long been the triumphant alternative of those who\ncouldn’t “see” Alexa Glennard’s looks; and Mrs. Touchett’s claims to\nconsideration were founded on that distribution of effects which is the\nwonder of those who admire a highly cultivated country. The third lady\nof the trio which Glennard’s fancy had put to such unflattering uses,\nwas bound by circumstances to support the claims of the other two. This\nwas Mrs. Dresham, the wife of the editor of the RADIATOR. Mrs. Dresham\nwas a lady who had rescued herself from social obscurity by assuming the\nrole of her husband’s exponent and interpreter; and Dresham’s leisure\nbeing devoted to the cultivation of remarkable women, his\nwife’s attitude committed her to the public celebration of their\nremarkableness. For the conceivable tedium of this duty, Mrs. Dresham\nwas repaid by the fact that there were people who took HER for a\nremarkable woman; and who in turn probably purchased similar distinction\nwith the small change of her reflected importance. As to the other\nladies of the party, they were simply the wives of some of the men--the\nkind of women who expect to be talked to collectively and to have their\nquestions left unanswered.\n\nMrs. Armiger, the latest embodiment of Dresham’s instinct for the\nremarkable, was an innocent beauty who for years had distilled\ndulness among a set of people now self-condemned by their inability\nto appreciate her. Under Dresham’s tutelage she had developed into a\n“thoughtful woman,” who read his leaders in the RADIATOR and bought the\nbooks he recommended. When a new novel appeared, people wanted to know\nwhat Mrs. Armiger thought of it; and a young gentleman who had made a\ntrip in Touraine had recently inscribed to her the wide-margined result\nof his explorations.\n\nGlennard, leaning back with his head against the rail and a slit of\nfugitive blue between his half-closed lids, vaguely wished she wouldn’t\nspoil the afternoon by making people talk; though he reduced his\nannoyance to the minimum by not listening to what was said, there\nremained a latent irritation against the general futility of words.\n\nHis wife’s gift of silence seemed to him the most vivid commentary on\nthe clumsiness of speech as a means of intercourse, and his eyes had\nturned to her in renewed appreciation of this finer faculty when\nMrs. Armiger’s voice abruptly brought home to him the underrated\npotentialities of language.\n\n“You’ve read them, of course, Mrs. Glennard?” he heard her ask; and, in\nreply to Alexa’s vague interrogation--“Why, the ‘Aubyn Letters’--it’s\nthe only book people are talking of this week.”\n\nMrs. Dresham immediately saw her advantage. “You HAVEN’T read them? How\nvery extraordinary! As Mrs. Armiger says, the book’s in the air; one\nbreathes it in like the influenza.”\n\nGlennard sat motionless, watching his wife.\n\n“Perhaps it hasn’t reached the suburbs yet,” she said, with her\nunruffled smile.\n\n“Oh, DO let me come to you, then!” Mrs. Touchett cried; “anything for a\nchange of air! I’m positively sick of the book and I can’t put it down.\nCan’t you sail us beyond its reach, Mr. Flamel?”\n\nFlamel shook his head. “Not even with this breeze. Literature travels\nfaster than steam nowadays. And the worst of it is that we can’t any\nof us give up reading; it’s as insidious as a vice and as tiresome as a\nvirtue.”\n\n“I believe it IS a vice, almost, to read such a book as the ‘Letters,’”\n said Mrs. Touchett. “It’s the woman’s soul, absolutely torn up by the\nroots--her whole self laid bare; and to a man who evidently didn’t care;\nwho couldn’t have cared. I don’t mean to read another line; it’s too\nmuch like listening at a keyhole.”\n\n“But if she wanted it published?”\n\n“Wanted it? How do we know she did?”\n\n“Why, I heard she’d left the letters to the man--whoever he is--with\ndirections that they should be published after his death--”\n\n“I don’t believe it,” Mrs. Touchett declared.\n\n“He’s dead then, is he?” one of the men asked.\n\n“Why, you don’t suppose if he were alive he could ever hold up his\nhead again, with these letters being read by everybody?” Mrs. Touchett\nprotested. “It must have been horrible enough to know they’d been\nwritten to him; but to publish them! No man could have done it and no\nwoman could have told him to--”\n\n“Oh, come, come,” Dresham judicially interposed; “after all, they’re not\nlove-letters.”\n\n“No--that’s the worst of it; they’re unloved letters,” Mrs. Touchett\nretorted.\n\n“Then, obviously, she needn’t have written them; whereas the man, poor\ndevil, could hardly help receiving them.”\n\n“Perhaps he counted on the public to save him the trouble of reading\nthem,” said young Hartly, who was in the cynical stage.\n\nMrs. Armiger turned her reproachful loveliness to Dresham. “From the way\nyou defend him, I believe you know who he is.”\n\nEveryone looked at Dresham, and his wife smiled with the superior air of\nthe woman who is in her husband’s professional secrets. Dresham shrugged\nhis shoulders.\n\n“What have I said to defend him?”\n\n“You called him a poor devil--you pitied him.”\n\n“A man who could let Margaret Aubyn write to him in that way? Of course\nI pity him.”\n\n“Then you MUST know who he is,” cried Mrs. Armiger, with a triumphant\nair of penetration.\n\nHartly and Flamel laughed and Dresham shook his head. “No one knows; not\neven the publishers; so they tell me at least.”\n\n“So they tell you to tell us,” Hartly astutely amended; and Mrs. Armiger\nadded, with the appearance of carrying the argument a point farther,\n“But even if HE’S dead and SHE’S dead, somebody must have given the\nletters to the publishers.”\n\n“A little bird, probably,” said Dresham, smiling indulgently on her\ndeduction.\n\n“A little bird of prey then--a vulture, I should say--” another man\ninterpolated.\n\n“Oh, I’m not with you there,” said Dresham, easily. “Those letters\nbelonged to the public.”\n\n“How can any letters belong to the public that weren’t written to the\npublic?” Mrs. Touchett interposed.\n\n“Well, these were, in a sense. A personality as big as Margaret Aubyn’s\nbelongs to the world. Such a mind is part of the general fund of\nthought. It’s the penalty of greatness--one becomes a monument\nhistorique. Posterity pays the cost of keeping one up, but on condition\nthat one is always open to the public.”\n\n“I don’t see that that exonerates the man who gives up the keys of the\nsanctuary, as it were.”\n\n“Who WAS he?” another voice inquired.\n\n“Who was he? Oh, nobody, I fancy--the letter-box, the slit in the wall\nthrough which the letters passed to posterity....”\n\n“But she never meant them for posterity!”\n\n“A woman shouldn’t write such letters if she doesn’t mean them to be\npublished....”\n\n“She shouldn’t write them to such a man!” Mrs. Touchett scornfully\ncorrected.\n\n“I never keep letters,” said Mrs. Armiger, under the obvious impression\nthat she was contributing a valuable point to the discussion.\n\nThere was a general laugh, and Flamel, who had not spoken, said, lazily,\n“You women are too incurably subjective. I venture to say that most men\nwould see in those letters merely their immense literary value, their\nsignificance as documents. The personal side doesn’t count where there’s\nso much else.”\n\n“Oh, we all know you haven’t any principles,” Mrs. Armiger declared; and\nAlexa Glennard, lifting an indolent smile, said: “I shall never write\nyou a love-letter, Mr. Flamel.”\n\nGlennard moved away impatiently. Such talk was as tedious as the buzzing\nof gnats. He wondered why his wife had wanted to drag him on such a\nsenseless expedition.... He hated Flamel’s crowd--and what business had\nFlamel himself to interfere in that way, standing up for the publication\nof the letters as though Glennard needed his defence?...\n\nGlennard turned his head and saw that Flamel had drawn a seat to Alexa’s\nelbow and was speaking to her in a low tone. The other groups had\nscattered, straying in twos along the deck. It came over Glennard that\nhe should never again be able to see Flamel speaking to his wife without\nthe sense of sick mistrust that now loosened his joints....\n\n\nAlexa, the next morning, over their early breakfast, surprised her\nhusband by an unexpected request.\n\n“Will you bring me those letters from town?” she asked.\n\n“What letters?” he said, putting down his cup. He felt himself as\nhelplessly vulnerable as a man who is lunged at in the dark.\n\n“Mrs. Aubyn’s. The book they were all talking about yesterday.”\n\nGlennard, carefully measuring his second cup of tea, said, with\ndeliberation, “I didn’t know you cared about that sort of thing.”\n\nShe was, in fact, not a great reader, and a new book seldom reached her\ntill it was, so to speak, on the home stretch; but she replied, with a\ngentle tenacity, “I think it would interest me because I read her life\nlast year.”\n\n“Her life? Where did you get that?”\n\n“Someone lent it to me when it came out--Mr. Flamel, I think.”\n\nHis first impulse was to exclaim, “Why the devil do you borrow books of\nFlamel? I can buy you all you want--” but he felt himself irresistibly\nforced into an attitude of smiling compliance. “Flamel always has the\nnewest books going, hasn’t he? You must be careful, by the way, about\nreturning what he lends you. He’s rather crotchety about his library.”\n\n“Oh, I’m always very careful,” she said, with a touch of competence that\nstruck him; and she added, as he caught up his hat: “Don’t forget the\nletters.”\n\nWhy had she asked for the book? Was her sudden wish to see it the result\nof some hint of Flamel’s? The thought turned Glennard sick, but he\npreserved sufficient lucidity to tell himself, a moment later, that his\nlast hope of self-control would be lost if he yielded to the temptation\nof seeing a hidden purpose in everything she said and did. How much\nFlamel guessed, he had no means of divining; nor could he predicate,\nfrom what he knew of the man, to what use his inferences might be put.\nThe very qualities that had made Flamel a useful adviser made him the\nmost dangerous of accomplices. Glennard felt himself agrope among alien\nforces that his own act had set in motion....\n\nAlexa was a woman of few requirements; but her wishes, even in trifles,\nhad a definiteness that distinguished them from the fluid impulses of\nher kind. He knew that, having once asked for the book, she would not\nforget it; and he put aside, as an ineffectual expedient, his momentary\nidea of applying for it at the circulating library and telling her that\nall the copies were out. If the book was to be bought it had better be\nbought at once. He left his office earlier than usual and turned in at\nthe first book-shop on his way to the train. The show-window was stacked\nwith conspicuously lettered volumes. “Margaret Aubyn” flashed back\nat him in endless repetition. He plunged into the shop and came on a\ncounter where the name reiterated itself on row after row of bindings.\nIt seemed to have driven the rest of literature to the back shelves. He\ncaught up a copy, tossing the money to an astonished clerk who pursued\nhim to the door with the unheeded offer to wrap up the volumes.\n\nIn the street he was seized with a sudden apprehension. What if he were\nto meet Flamel? The thought was intolerable. He called a cab and drove\nstraight to the station where, amid the palm-leaf fans of a perspiring\ncrowd, he waited a long half-hour for his train to start.\n\nHe had thrust a volume in either pocket and in the train he dared not\ndraw them out; but the detested words leaped at him from the folds of\nthe evening paper. The air seemed full of Margaret Aubyn’s name. The\nmotion of the train set it dancing up and down on the page of a magazine\nthat a man in front of him was reading....\n\nAt the door he was told that Mrs. Glennard was still out, and he went\nupstairs to his room and dragged the books from his pocket. They lay\non the table before him like live things that he feared to touch.... At\nlength he opened the first volume. A familiar letter sprang out at\nhim, each word quickened by its glaring garb of type. The little broken\nphrases fled across the page like wounded animals in the open.... It was\na horrible sight.... A battue of helpless things driven savagely out of\nshelter. He had not known it would be like this....\n\nHe understood now that, at the moment of selling the letters, he had\nviewed the transaction solely as it affected himself: as an unfortunate\nblemish on an otherwise presentable record. He had scarcely considered\nthe act in relation to Margaret Aubyn; for death, if it hallows,\nalso makes innocuous. Glennard’s God was a god of the living, of the\nimmediate, the actual, the tangible; all his days he had lived in the\npresence of that god, heedless of the divinities who, below the surface\nof our deeds and passions, silently forge the fatal weapons of the dead.\n\n\n\n\nVII\n\n\nA knock roused him and looking up he saw his wife. He met her glance in\nsilence, and she faltered out, “Are you ill?”\n\nThe words restored his self-possession. “Ill? Of course not. They told\nme you were out and I came upstairs.”\n\nThe books lay between them on the table; he wondered when she would see\nthem. She lingered tentatively on the threshold, with the air of leaving\nhis explanation on his hands. She was not the kind of woman who could be\ncounted on to fortify an excuse by appearing to dispute it.\n\n“Where have you been?” Glennard asked, moving forward so that he\nobstructed her vision of the books.\n\n“I walked over to the Dreshams for tea.”\n\n“I can’t think what you see in those people,” he said with a shrug;\nadding, uncontrollably--“I suppose Flamel was there?”\n\n“No; he left on the yacht this morning.”\n\nAn answer so obstructing to the natural escape of his irritation left\nGlennard with no momentary resource but that of strolling impatiently to\nthe window. As her eyes followed him they lit on the books.\n\n“Ah, you’ve brought them! I’m so glad,” she exclaimed.\n\nHe answered over his shoulder, “For a woman who never reads you make the\nmost astounding exceptions!”\n\nHer smile was an exasperating concession to the probability that it had\nbeen hot in town or that something had bothered him.\n\n“Do you mean it’s not nice to want to read the book?” she asked. “It was\nnot nice to publish it, certainly; but after all, I’m not responsible\nfor that, am I?” She paused, and, as he made no answer, went on, still\nsmiling, “I do read sometimes, you know; and I’m very fond of Margaret\nAubyn’s books. I was reading ‘Pomegranate Seed’ when we first met. Don’t\nyou remember? It was then you told me all about her.”\n\nGlennard had turned back into the room and stood staring at his wife.\n“All about her?” he repeated, and with the words remembrance came to\nhim. He had found Miss Trent one afternoon with the novel in her hand,\nand moved by the lover’s fatuous impulse to associate himself in some\nway with whatever fills the mind of the beloved, had broken through\nhis habitual silence about the past. Rewarded by the consciousness of\nfiguring impressively in Miss Trent’s imagination he had gone on from\none anecdote to another, reviving dormant details of his old Hillbridge\nlife, and pasturing his vanity on the eagerness with which she received\nhis reminiscences of a being already clothed in the impersonality of\ngreatness.\n\nThe incident had left no trace in his mind; but it sprang up now like an\nold enemy, the more dangerous for having been forgotten. The instinct\nof self-preservation--sometimes the most perilous that man can\nexercise--made him awkwardly declare--“Oh, I used to see her at people’s\nhouses, that was all;” and her silence as usual leaving room for a\nmultiplication of blunders, he added, with increased indifference, “I\nsimply can’t see what you can find to interest you in such a book.”\n\nShe seemed to consider this intently. “You’ve read it, then?”\n\n“I glanced at it--I never read such things.”\n\n“Is it true that she didn’t wish the letters to be published?”\n\nGlennard felt the sudden dizziness of the mountaineer on a narrow ledge,\nand with it the sense that he was lost if he looked more than a step\nahead.\n\n“I’m sure I don’t know,” he said; then, summoning a smile, he passed\nhis hand through her arm. “I didn’t have tea at the Dreshams, you know;\nwon’t you give me some now?” he suggested.\n\nThat evening Glennard, under pretext of work to be done, shut himself\ninto the small study opening off the drawing-room. As he gathered up his\npapers he said to his wife: “You’re not going to sit indoors on such a\nnight as this? I’ll join you presently outside.”\n\nBut she had drawn her armchair to the lamp. “I want to look at my book,”\n she said, taking up the first volume of the “Letters.”\n\nGlennard, with a shrug, withdrew into the study. “I’m going to shut\nthe door; I want to be quiet,” he explained from the threshold; and she\nnodded without lifting her eyes from the book.\n\nHe sank into a chair, staring aimlessly at the outspread papers. How was\nhe to work, while on the other side of the door she sat with that volume\nin her hand? The door did not shut her out--he saw her distinctly, felt\nher close to him in a contact as painful as the pressure on a bruise.\n\nThe sensation was part of the general strangeness that made him feel\nlike a man waking from a long sleep to find himself in an unknown\ncountry among people of alien tongue. We live in our own souls as in\nan unmapped region, a few acres of which we have cleared for our\nhabitation; while of the nature of those nearest us we know but the\nboundaries that march with ours. Of the points in his wife’s character\nnot in direct contact with his own, Glennard now discerned his\nignorance; and the baffling sense of her remoteness was intensified by\nthe discovery that, in one way, she was closer to him than ever before.\nAs one may live for years in happy unconsciousness of the possession\nof a sensitive nerve, he had lived beside his wife unaware that her\nindividuality had become a part of the texture of his life, ineradicable\nas some growth on a vital organ; and he now felt himself at once\nincapable of forecasting her judgment and powerless to evade its\neffects.\n\nTo escape, the next morning, the confidences of the breakfast-table, he\nwent to town earlier than usual. His wife, who read slowly, was given to\ntalking over what she read, and at present his first object in life was\nto postpone the inevitable discussion of the letters. This instinct of\nprotection in the afternoon, on his way uptown, guided him to the club\nin search of a man who might be persuaded to come out to the country to\ndine. The only man in the club was Flamel.\n\nGlennard, as he heard himself almost involuntarily pressing Flamel to\ncome and dine, felt the full irony of the situation. To use Flamel as\na shield against his wife’s scrutiny was only a shade less humiliating\nthan to reckon on his wife as a defence against Flamel.\n\nHe felt a contradictory movement of annoyance at the latter’s ready\nacceptance, and the two men drove in silence to the station. As they\npassed the bookstall in the waiting-room Flamel lingered a moment and\nthe eyes of both fell on Margaret Aubyn’s name, conspicuously displayed\nabove a counter stacked with the familiar volumes.\n\n“We shall be late, you know,” Glennard remonstrated, pulling out his\nwatch.\n\n“Go ahead,” said Flamel, imperturbably. “I want to get something--”\n\nGlennard turned on his heel and walked down the platform. Flamel\nrejoined him with an innocent-looking magazine in his hand; but Glennard\ndared not even glance at the cover, lest it should show the syllables he\nfeared.\n\nThe train was full of people they knew, and they were kept apart till\nit dropped them at the little suburban station. As they strolled up the\nshaded hill, Glennard talked volubly, pointing out the improvements\nin the neighborhood, deploring the threatened approach of an electric\nrailway, and screening himself by a series of reflex adjustments from\nthe imminent risk of any allusion to the “Letters.” Flamel suffered his\ndiscourse with the bland inattention that we accord to the affairs of\nsomeone else’s suburb, and they reached the shelter of Alexa’s tea-table\nwithout a perceptible turn toward the dreaded topic.\n\nThe dinner passed off safely. Flamel, always at his best in Alexa’s\npresence, gave her the kind of attention which is like a beaconing light\nthrown on the speaker’s words: his answers seemed to bring out a latent\nsignificance in her phrases, as the sculptor draws his statue from the\nblock. Glennard, under his wife’s composure, detected a sensibility to\nthis manoeuvre, and the discovery was like the lightning-flash across a\nnocturnal landscape. Thus far these momentary illuminations had served\nonly to reveal the strangeness of the intervening country: each fresh\nobservation seemed to increase the sum-total of his ignorance. Her\nsimplicity of outline was more puzzling than a complex surface. One may\nconceivably work one’s way through a labyrinth; but Alexa’s candor\nwas like a snow-covered plain where, the road once lost, there are no\nlandmarks to travel by.\n\nDinner over, they returned to the veranda, where a moon, rising behind\nthe old elm, was combining with that complaisant tree a romantic\nenlargement of their borders. Glennard had forgotten the cigars. He went\nto his study to fetch them, and in passing through the drawing-room he\nsaw the second volume of the “Letters” lying open on his wife’s table.\nHe picked up the book and looked at the date of the letter she had been\nreading. It was one of the last... he knew the few lines by heart. He\ndropped the book and leaned against the wall. Why had he included that\none among the others? Or was it possible that now they would all seem\nlike that...?\n\nAlexa’s voice came suddenly out of the dusk. “May Touchett was right--it\nIS like listening at a key-hole. I wish I hadn’t read it!”\n\nFlamel returned, in the leisurely tone of the man whose phrases are\npunctuated by a cigarette, “It seems so to us, perhaps; but to another\ngeneration the book will be a classic.”\n\n“Then it ought not to have been published till it had become a classic.\nIt’s horrible, it’s degrading almost, to read the secrets of a woman one\nmight have known.” She added, in a lower tone, “Stephen DID know her--”\n\n“Did he?” came from Flamel.\n\n“He knew her very well, at Hillbridge, years ago. The book has made him\nfeel dreadfully... he wouldn’t read it... he didn’t want me to read it.\nI didn’t understand at first, but now I can see how horribly disloyal it\nmust seem to him. It’s so much worse to surprise a friend’s secrets than\na stranger’s.”\n\n“Oh, Glennard’s such a sensitive chap,” Flamel said, easily; and Alexa\nalmost rebukingly rejoined, “If you’d known her I’m sure you’d feel as\nhe does....”\n\nGlennard stood motionless, overcome by the singular infelicity with\nwhich he had contrived to put Flamel in possession of the two points\nmost damaging to his case: the fact that he had been a friend of\nMargaret Aubyn’s, and that he had concealed from Alexa his share in the\npublication of the letters. To a man of less than Flamel’s astuteness\nit must now be clear to whom the letters were addressed; and the\npossibility once suggested, nothing could be easier than to confirm it\nby discreet research. An impulse of self-accusal drove Glennard to the\nwindow. Why not anticipate betrayal by telling his wife the truth in\nFlamel’s presence? If the man had a drop of decent feeling in him, such\na course would be the surest means of securing his silence; and above\nall, it would rid Glennard of the necessity of defending himself against\nthe perpetual criticism of his wife’s belief in him....\n\nThe impulse was strong enough to carry him to the window; but there\na reaction of defiance set in. What had he done, after all, to need\ndefence and explanation? Both Dresham and Flamel had, in his hearing,\ndeclared the publication of the letters to be not only justifiable but\nobligatory; and if the disinterestedness of Flamel’s verdict might be\nquestioned, Dresham’s at least represented the impartial view of the\nman of letters. As to Alexa’s words, they were simply the conventional\nutterance of the “nice” woman on a question already decided for her by\nother “nice” women. She had said the proper thing as mechanically as she\nwould have put on the appropriate gown or written the correct form of\ndinner-invitation. Glennard had small faith in the abstract judgments\nof the other sex; he knew that half the women who were horrified by\nthe publication of Mrs. Aubyn’s letters would have betrayed her secrets\nwithout a scruple.\n\nThe sudden lowering of his emotional pitch brought a proportionate\nrelief. He told himself that now the worst was over and things would\nfall into perspective again. His wife and Flamel had turned to other\ntopics, and coming out on the veranda, he handed the cigars to Flamel,\nsaying, cheerfully--and yet he could have sworn they were the last words\nhe meant to utter!--“Look here, old man, before you go down to Newport\nyou must come out and spend a few days with us--mustn’t he, Alexa?”\n\n\n\n\nVIII\n\n\nGlennard had, perhaps unconsciously, counted on the continuance of this\neasier mood. He had always taken pride in a certain robustness of fibre\nthat enabled him to harden himself against the inevitable, to convert\nhis failures into the building materials of success. Though it did not\neven now occur to him that what he called the inevitable had hitherto\nbeen the alternative he happened to prefer, he was yet obscurely\naware that his present difficulty was one not to be conjured by any\naffectation of indifference. Some griefs build the soul a spacious\nhouse--but in this misery of Glennard’s he could not stand upright. It\npressed against him at every turn. He told himself that this was because\nthere was no escape from the visible evidences of his act. The “Letters”\n confronted him everywhere. People who had never opened a book discussed\nthem with critical reservations; to have read them had become a social\nobligation in circles to which literature never penetrates except in a\npersonal guise.\n\nGlennard did himself injustice, it was from the unexpected discovery of\nhis own pettiness that he chiefly suffered. Our self-esteem is apt to\nbe based on the hypothetical great act we have never had occasion to\nperform; and even the most self-scrutinizing modesty credits itself\nnegatively with a high standard of conduct. Glennard had never thought\nhimself a hero; but he had been certain that he was incapable of\nbaseness. We all like our wrong-doings to have a becoming cut, to be\nmade to order, as it were; and Glennard found himself suddenly thrust\ninto a garb of dishonor surely meant for a meaner figure.\n\nThe immediate result of his first weeks of wretchedness was the resolve\nto go to town for the winter. He knew that such a course was just beyond\nthe limit of prudence; but it was easy to allay the fears of Alexa who,\nscrupulously vigilant in the management of the household, preserved\nthe American wife’s usual aloofness from her husband’s business cares.\nGlennard felt that he could not trust himself to a winter’s solitude\nwith her. He had an unspeakable dread of her learning the truth about\nthe letters, yet could not be sure of steeling himself against the\nsuicidal impulse of avowal. His very soul was parched for sympathy; he\nthirsted for a voice of pity and comprehension. But would his wife pity?\nWould she understand? Again he found himself brought up abruptly against\nhis incredible ignorance of her nature. The fact that he knew well\nenough how she would behave in the ordinary emergencies of life, that\nhe could count, in such contingencies, on the kind of high courage and\ndirectness he had always divined in her, made him the more hopeless of\nher entering into the torturous psychology of an act that he himself\ncould no longer explain or understand. It would have been easier had\nshe been more complex, more feminine--if he could have counted on\nher imaginative sympathy or her moral obtuseness--but he was sure of\nneither. He was sure of nothing but that, for a time, he must avoid her.\nGlennard could not rid himself of the delusion that by and by his action\nwould cease to make its consequences felt. He would not have cared to\nown to himself that he counted on the dulling of his sensibilities: he\npreferred to indulge the vague hypothesis that extraneous circumstances\nwould somehow efface the blot upon his conscience. In his worst moments\nof self-abasement he tried to find solace in the thought that Flamel had\nsanctioned his course. Flamel, at the outset, must have guessed to\nwhom the letters were addressed; yet neither then nor afterward had he\nhesitated to advise their publication. This thought drew Glennard to\nhim in fitful impulses of friendliness, from each of which there was a\nsharper reaction of distrust and aversion. When Flamel was not at the\nhouse, he missed the support of his tacit connivance; when he was there,\nhis presence seemed the assertion of an intolerable claim.\n\nEarly in the winter the Glennards took possession of the little house\nthat was to cost them almost nothing. The change brought Glennard the\nimmediate relief of seeing less of his wife, and of being protected, in\nher presence, by the multiplied preoccupations of town life. Alexa, who\ncould never appear hurried, showed the smiling abstraction of a pretty\nwoman to whom the social side of married life has not lost its novelty.\nGlennard, with the recklessness of a man fresh from his first financial\nimprudence, encouraged her in such little extravagances as her good\nsense at first resisted. Since they had come to town, he argued, they\nmight as well enjoy themselves. He took a sympathetic view of the\nnecessity of new gowns, he gave her a set of furs at Christmas, and\nbefore the New Year they had agreed on the obligation of adding a\nparlour-maid to their small establishment.\n\nProvidence the very next day hastened to justify this measure by placing\non Glennard’s breakfast-plate an envelope bearing the name of the\npublishers to whom he had sold Mrs. Aubyn’s letters. It happened to be\nthe only letter the early post had brought, and he glanced across the\ntable at his wife, who had come down before him and had probably\nlaid the envelope on his plate. She was not the woman to ask awkward\nquestions, but he felt the conjecture of her glance, and he was debating\nwhether to affect surprise at the receipt of the letter, or to pass it\noff as a business communication that had strayed to his house, when a\ncheck fell from the envelope. It was the royalty on the first edition of\nthe letters. His first feeling was one of simple satisfaction. The\nmoney had come with such infernal opportuneness that he could not help\nwelcoming it. Before long, too, there would be more; he knew the book\nwas still selling far beyond the publisher’s previsions. He put the\ncheck in his pocket and left the room without looking at his wife.\n\nOn the way to his office the habitual reaction set in. The money he had\nreceived was the first tangible reminder that he was living on the\nsale of his self-esteem. The thought of material benefit had been\novershadowed by his sense of the intrinsic baseness of making the\nletters known; now he saw what an element of sordidness it added to the\nsituation and how the fact that he needed the money, and must use it,\npledged him more irrevocably than ever to the consequences of his act.\nIt seemed to him, in that first hour of misery, that he had betrayed his\nfriend anew.\n\nWhen, that afternoon, he reached home earlier than usual, Alexa’s\ndrawing-room was full of a gayety that overflowed to the stairs. Flamel,\nfor a wonder, was not there; but Dresham and young Hartly, grouped about\nthe tea-table, were receiving with resonant mirth a narrative delivered\nin the fluttered staccato that made Mrs. Armiger’s conversation like the\nejaculations of a startled aviary.\n\nShe paused as Glennard entered, and he had time to notice that his wife,\nwho was busied about the tea-tray, had not joined in the laughter of the\nmen.\n\n“Oh, go on, go on,” young Hartly rapturously groaned; and Mrs. Armiger\nmet Glennard’s inquiry with the deprecating cry that really she didn’t\nsee what there was to laugh at. “I’m sure I feel more like crying. I\ndon’t know what I should have done if Alexa hadn’t been home to give me\na cup of tea. My nerves are in shreds--yes, another, dear, please--” and\nas Glennard looked his perplexity, she went on, after pondering on\nthe selection of a second lump of sugar, “Why, I’ve just come from the\nreading, you know--the reading at the Waldorf.”\n\n“I haven’t been in town long enough to know anything,” said Glennard,\ntaking the cup his wife handed him. “Who has been reading what?”\n\n“That lovely girl from the South--Georgie--Georgie what’s her name--Mrs.\nDresham’s protegee--unless she’s YOURS, Mr. Dresham! Why, the big\nball-room was PACKED, and all the women were crying like idiots--it was\nthe most harrowing thing I ever heard--”\n\n“What DID you hear?” Glennard asked; and his wife interposed: “Won’t you\nhave another bit of cake, Julia? Or, Stephen, ring for some hot\ntoast, please.” Her tone betrayed a polite satiety of the topic under\ndiscussion. Glennard turned to the bell, but Mrs. Armiger pursued him\nwith her lovely amazement.\n\n“Why, the ‘Aubyn Letters’--didn’t you know about it? The girl read them\nso beautifully that it was quite horrible--I should have fainted if\nthere’d been a man near enough to carry me out.”\n\nHartly’s glee redoubled, and Dresham said, jovially, “How like you women\nto raise a shriek over the book and then do all you can to encourage the\nblatant publicity of the readings!”\n\nMrs. Armiger met him more than half-way on a torrent of self-accusal.\n“It WAS horrid; it was disgraceful. I told your wife we ought all to\nbe ashamed of ourselves for going, and I think Alexa was quite right to\nrefuse to take any tickets--even if it was for a charity.”\n\n“Oh,” her hostess murmured, indifferently, “with me charity begins at\nhome. I can’t afford emotional luxuries.”\n\n“A charity? A charity?” Hartly exulted. “I hadn’t seized the full beauty\nof it. Reading poor Margaret Aubyn’s love-letters at the Waldorf before\nfive hundred people for a charity! WHAT charity, dear Mrs. Armiger?”\n\n“Why, the Home for Friendless Women--”\n\n“It was well chosen,” Dresham commented; and Hartly buried his mirth in\nthe sofa-cushions.\n\nWhen they were alone Glennard, still holding his untouched cup of tea,\nturned to his wife, who sat silently behind the kettle. “Who asked you\nto take a ticket for that reading?”\n\n“I don’t know, really--Kate Dresham, I fancy. It was she who got it up.”\n\n“It’s just the sort of damnable vulgarity she’s capable of! It’s\nloathsome--it’s monstrous--”\n\nHis wife, without looking up, answered gravely, “I thought so too. It\nwas for that reason I didn’t go. But you must remember that very few\npeople feel about Mrs. Aubyn as you do--”\n\nGlennard managed to set down his cup with a steady hand, but the room\nswung round with him and he dropped into the nearest chair. “As I do?”\n he repeated.\n\n“I mean that very few people knew her when she lived in New York. To\nmost of the women who went to the reading she was a mere name, too\nremote to have any personality. With me, of course, it was different--”\n\nGlennard gave her a startled look. “Different? Why different?”\n\n“Since you were her friend--”\n\n“Her friend!” He stood up impatiently. “You speak as if she had had only\none--the most famous woman of her day!” He moved vaguely about the room,\nbending down to look at some books on the table. “I hope,” he added,\n“you didn’t give that as a reason, by the way?”\n\n“A reason?”\n\n“For not going. A woman who gives reasons for getting out of social\nobligations is sure to make herself unpopular or ridiculous.\n\nThe words were uncalculated; but in an instant he saw that they had\nstrangely bridged the distance between his wife and himself. He felt her\nclose on him, like a panting foe; and her answer was a flash that showed\nthe hand on the trigger.\n\n“I seem,” she said from the threshold, “to have done both in giving my\nreason to you.”\n\n\nThe fact that they were dining out that evening made it easy for him to\navoid Alexa till she came downstairs in her opera-cloak. Mrs. Touchett,\nwho was going to the same dinner, had offered to call for her, and\nGlennard, refusing a precarious seat between the ladies’ draperies,\nfollowed on foot. The evening was interminable. The reading at the\nWaldorf, at which all the women had been present, had revived the\ndiscussion of the “Aubyn Letters” and Glennard, hearing his wife\nquestioned as to her absence, felt himself miserably wishing that she\nhad gone, rather than that her staying away should have been remarked.\nHe was rapidly losing all sense of proportion where the “Letters” were\nconcerned. He could no longer hear them mentioned without suspecting\na purpose in the allusion; he even yielded himself for a moment to\nthe extravagance of imagining that Mrs. Dresham, whom he disliked, had\norganized the reading in the hope of making him betray himself--for he\nwas already sure that Dresham had divined his share in the transaction.\n\nThe attempt to keep a smooth surface on this inner tumult was as endless\nand unavailing as efforts made in a nightmare. He lost all sense of what\nhe was saying to his neighbors and once when he looked up his wife’s\nglance struck him cold.\n\nShe sat nearly opposite him, at Flamel’s side, and it appeared to\nGlennard that they had built about themselves one of those airy barriers\nof talk behind which two people can say what they please. While the\nreading was discussed they were silent. Their silence seemed to Glennard\nalmost cynical--it stripped the last disguise from their complicity. A\nthrob of anger rose in him, but suddenly it fell, and he felt, with\na curious sense of relief, that at bottom he no longer cared whether\nFlamel had told his wife or not. The assumption that Flamel knew about\nthe letters had become a fact to Glennard; and it now seemed to him\nbetter that Alexa should know too.\n\nHe was frightened at first by the discovery of his own indifference. The\nlast barriers of his will seemed to be breaking down before a flood of\nmoral lassitude. How could he continue to play his part, to keep his\nfront to the enemy, with this poison of indifference stealing through\nhis veins? He tried to brace himself with the remembrance of his wife’s\nscorn. He had not forgotten the note on which their conversation had\nclosed. If he had ever wondered how she would receive the truth\nhe wondered no longer--she would despise him. But this lent a new\ninsidiousness to his temptation, since her contempt would be a refuge\nfrom his own. He said to himself that, since he no longer cared for\nthe consequences, he could at least acquit himself of speaking in\nself-defence. What he wanted now was not immunity but castigation: his\nwife’s indignation might still reconcile him to himself. Therein lay\nhis one hope of regeneration; her scorn was the moral antiseptic that he\nneeded, her comprehension the one balm that could heal him....\n\nWhen they left the dinner he was so afraid of speaking that he let her\ndrive home alone, and went to the club with Flamel.\n\n\n\n\nIX\n\n\nHE rose next morning with the resolve to know what Alexa thought of him.\nIt was not anchoring in a haven, but lying to in a storm--he felt the\nneed of a temporary lull in the turmoil of his sensations.\n\nHe came home late, for they were dining alone and he knew that\nthey would have the evening together. When he followed her to the\ndrawing-room after dinner he thought himself on the point of speaking;\nbut as she handed him his coffee he said, involuntarily: “I shall have\nto carry this off to the study, I’ve got a lot of work to-night.”\n\nAlone in the study he cursed his cowardice. What was it that had\nwithheld him? A certain bright unapproachableness seemed to keep him at\narm’s length. She was not the kind of woman whose compassion could be\ncircumvented; there was no chance of slipping past the outposts; he\nwould never take her by surprise. Well--why not face her, then? What he\nshrank from could be no worse than what he was enduring. He had pushed\nback his chair and turned to go upstairs when a new expedient presented\nitself. What if, instead of telling her, he were to let her find out for\nherself and watch the effect of the discovery before speaking? In this\nway he made over to chance the burden of the revelation.\n\nThe idea had been suggested by the sight of the formula enclosing\nthe publisher’s check. He had deposited the money, but the notice\naccompanying it dropped from his note-case as he cleared his table for\nwork. It was the formula usual in such cases and revealed clearly enough\nthat he was the recipient of a royalty on Margaret Aubyn’s letters. It\nwould be impossible for Alexa to read it without understanding at once\nthat the letters had been written to him and that he had sold them....\n\nHe sat downstairs till he heard her ring for the parlor-maid to put out\nthe lights; then he went up to the drawing-room with a bundle of papers\nin his hand. Alexa was just rising from her seat and the lamplight fell\non the deep roll of hair that overhung her brow like the eaves of a\ntemple. Her face had often the high secluded look of a shrine; and it\nwas this touch of awe in her beauty that now made him feel himself on\nthe brink of sacrilege.\n\nLest the feeling should dominate him, he spoke at once. “I’ve brought\nyou a piece of work--a lot of old bills and things that I want you to\nsort for me. Some are not worth keeping--but you’ll be able to judge of\nthat. There may be a letter or two among them--nothing of much account,\nbut I don’t like to throw away the whole lot without having them looked\nover and I haven’t time to do it myself.”\n\nHe held out the papers and she took them with a smile that seemed to\nrecognize in the service he asked the tacit intention of making amends\nfor the incident of the previous day.\n\n“Are you sure I shall know which to keep?”\n\n“Oh, quite sure,” he answered, easily--“and besides, none are of much\nimportance.”\n\nThe next morning he invented an excuse for leaving the house without\nseeing her, and when he returned, just before dinner, he found a\nvisitor’s hat and stick in the hall. The visitor was Flamel, who was in\nthe act of taking leave.\n\nHe had risen, but Alexa remained seated; and their attitude gave the\nimpression of a colloquy that had prolonged itself beyond the limits of\nspeech. Both turned a surprised eye on Glennard and he had the sense of\nwalking into a room grown suddenly empty, as though their thoughts were\nconspirators dispersed by his approach. He felt the clutch of his old\nfear. What if his wife had already sorted the papers and had told Flamel\nof her discovery? Well, it was no news to Flamel that Glennard was in\nreceipt of a royalty on the “Aubyn Letters.”...\n\nA sudden resolve to know the worst made him lift his eyes to his wife\nas the door closed on Flamel. But Alexa had risen also, and bending over\nher writing-table, with her back to Glennard, was beginning to speak\nprecipitately.\n\n“I’m dining out to-night--you don’t mind my deserting you? Julia Armiger\nsent me word just now that she had an extra ticket for the last Ambrose\nconcert. She told me to say how sorry she was that she hadn’t two--but I\nknew YOU wouldn’t be sorry!” She ended with a laugh that had the effect\nof being a strayed echo of Mrs. Armiger’s; and before Glennard could\nspeak she had added, with her hand on the door, “Mr. Flamel stayed so\nlate that I’ve hardly time to dress. The concert begins ridiculously\nearly, and Julia dines at half-past seven--”\n\nGlennard stood alone in the empty room that seemed somehow full of\nan ironical consciousness of what was happening. “She hates me,” he\nmurmured. “She hates me....”\n\n\nThe next day was Sunday, and Glennard purposely lingered late in\nhis room. When he came downstairs his wife was already seated at the\nbreakfast-table. She lifted her usual smile to his entrance and they\ntook shelter in the nearest topic, like wayfarers overtaken by a storm.\nWhile he listened to her account of the concert he began to think that,\nafter all, she had not yet sorted the papers, and that her agitation of\nthe previous day must be ascribed to another cause, in which perhaps he\nhad but an indirect concern. He wondered it had never before occurred to\nhim that Flamel was the kind of man who might very well please a woman\nat his own expense, without need of fortuitous assistance. If this\npossibility cleared the outlook it did not brighten it. Glennard merely\nfelt himself left alone with his baseness.\n\nAlexa left the breakfast-table before him and when he went up to the\ndrawing-room he found her dressed to go out.\n\n“Aren’t you a little early for church?” he asked.\n\nShe replied that, on the way there, she meant to stop a moment at\nher mother’s; and while she drew on her gloves, he fumbled among the\nknick-knacks on the mantel-piece for a match to light his cigarette.\n\n“Well, good-by,” she said, turning to go; and from the threshold she\nadded: “By the way, I’ve sorted the papers you gave me. Those that\nI thought you would like to keep are on your study-table.” She went\ndownstairs and he heard the door close behind her.\n\nShe had sorted the papers--she knew, then--she MUST know--and she had\nmade no sign!\n\nGlennard, he hardly knew how, found himself once more in the study. On\nthe table lay the packet he had given her. It was much smaller--she had\nevidently gone over the papers with care, destroying the greater number.\nHe loosened the elastic band and spread the remaining envelopes on his\ndesk. The publisher’s notice was among them.\n\n\n\n\nX\n\n\nHis wife knew and she made no sign. Glennard found himself in the case\nof the seafarer who, closing his eyes at nightfall on a scene he thinks\nto put leagues behind him before day, wakes to a port-hole framing the\nsame patch of shore. From the kind of exaltation to which his resolve\nhad lifted him he dropped to an unreasoning apathy. His impulse of\nconfession had acted as a drug to self-reproach. He had tried to shift\na portion of his burden to his wife’s shoulders and now that she had\ntacitly refused to carry it, he felt the load too heavy to be taken up\nagain.\n\nA fortunate interval of hard work brought respite from this phase of\nsterile misery. He went West to argue an important case, won it, and\ncame back to fresh preoccupations. His own affairs were thriving enough\nto engross him in the pauses of his professional work, and for over\ntwo months he had little time to look himself in the face. Not\nunnaturally--for he was as yet unskilled in the subtleties of\nintrospection--he mistook his temporary insensibility for a gradual\nrevival of moral health.\n\nHe told himself that he was recovering his sense of proportion, getting\nto see things in their true light; and if he now thought of his rash\nappeal to his wife’s sympathy it was as an act of folly from the\nconsequences of which he had been saved by the providence that watches\nover madmen. He had little leisure to observe Alexa; but he concluded\nthat the common-sense momentarily denied him had counselled her\nuncritical acceptance of the inevitable. If such a quality was a\npoor substitute for the passionate justness that had once seemed to\ncharacterize her, he accepted the alternative as a part of that general\nlowering of the key that seems needful to the maintenance of the\nmatrimonial duet. What woman ever retained her abstract sense of justice\nwhere another woman was concerned? Possibly the thought that he had\nprofited by Mrs. Aubyn’s tenderness was not wholly disagreeable to his\nwife.\n\nWhen the pressure of work began to lessen, and he found himself, in the\nlengthening afternoons, able to reach home somewhat earlier, he noticed\nthat the little drawing-room was always full and that he and his wife\nseldom had an evening alone together. When he was tired, as often\nhappened, she went out alone; the idea of giving up an engagement to\nremain with him seemed not to occur to her. She had shown, as a girl,\nlittle fondness for society, nor had she seemed to regret it during the\nyear they had spent in the country. He reflected, however, that he was\nsharing the common lot of husbands, who proverbially mistake the early\nardors of housekeeping for a sign of settled domesticity. Alexa, at any\nrate, was refuting his theory as inconsiderately as a seedling defeats\nthe gardener’s expectations. An undefinable change had come over her. In\none sense it was a happy one, since she had grown, if not handsomer,\nat least more vivid and expressive; her beauty had become more\ncommunicable: it was as though she had learned the conscious exercise of\nintuitive attributes and now used her effects with the discrimination of\nan artist skilled in values. To a dispassionate critic (as Glennard now\nrated himself) the art may at times have been a little too obvious. Her\nattempts at lightness lacked spontaneity, and she sometimes rasped\nhim by laughing like Julia Armiger; but he had enough imagination\nto perceive that, in respect of the wife’s social arts, a husband\nnecessarily sees the wrong side of the tapestry.\n\nIn this ironical estimate of their relation Glennard found himself\nstrangely relieved of all concern as to his wife’s feelings for Flamel.\nFrom an Olympian pinnacle of indifference he calmly surveyed their\ninoffensive antics. It was surprising how his cheapening of his wife put\nhim at ease with himself. Far as he and she were from each other they\nyet had, in a sense, the tacit nearness of complicity. Yes, they were\naccomplices; he could no more be jealous of her than she could despise\nhim. The jealousy that would once have seemed a blur on her whiteness\nnow appeared like a tribute to ideals in which he no longer believed....\n\n\nGlennard was little given to exploring the outskirts of literature. He\nalways skipped the “literary notices” in the papers and he had small\nleisure for the intermittent pleasures of the periodical. He had\ntherefore no notion of the prolonged reverberations which the “Aubyn\nLetters” had awakened in the precincts of criticism. When the book\nceased to be talked about he supposed it had ceased to be read; and this\napparent subsidence of the agitation about it brought the reassuring\nsense that he had exaggerated its vitality. The conviction, if it did\nnot ease his conscience, at least offered him the relative relief of\nobscurity: he felt like an offender taken down from the pillory and\nthrust into the soothing darkness of a cell.\n\nBut one evening, when Alexa had left him to go to a dance, he chanced to\nturn over the magazines on her table, and the copy of the Horoscope, to\nwhich he settled down with his cigar, confronted him, on its first\npage, with a portrait of Margaret Aubyn. It was a reproduction of the\nphotograph that had stood so long on his desk. The desiccating air of\nmemory had turned her into the mere abstraction of a woman, and this\nunexpected evocation seemed to bring her nearer than she had ever been\nin life. Was it because he understood her better? He looked long into\nher eyes; little personal traits reached out to him like caresses--the\ntired droop of her lids, her quick way of leaning forward as she spoke,\nthe movements of her long expressive hands. All that was feminine\nin her, the quality he had always missed, stole toward him from her\nunreproachful gaze; and now that it was too late life had developed\nin him the subtler perceptions which could detect it in even this poor\nsemblance of herself. For a moment he found consolation in the thought\nthat, at any cost, they had thus been brought together; then a flood of\nshame rushed over him. Face to face with her, he felt himself laid bare\nto the inmost fold of consciousness. The shame was deep, but it was a\nrenovating anguish; he was like a man whom intolerable pain has roused\nfrom the creeping lethargy of death....\n\nHe rose next morning to as fresh a sense of life as though his hour of\nmute communion with Margaret Aubyn had been a more exquisite renewal\nof their earlier meetings. His waking thought was that he must see her\nagain; and as consciousness affirmed itself he felt an intense fear of\nlosing the sense of her nearness. But she was still close to him; her\npresence remained the sole reality in a world of shadows. All through\nhis working hours he was re-living with incredible minuteness every\nincident of their obliterated past; as a man who has mastered the spirit\nof a foreign tongue turns with renewed wonder to the pages his youth has\nplodded over. In this lucidity of retrospection the most trivial detail\nhad its significance, and the rapture of recovery was embittered to\nGlennard by the perception of all that he had missed. He had been\npitiably, grotesquely stupid; and there was irony in the thought that,\nbut for the crisis through which he was passing, he might have lived on\nin complacent ignorance of his loss. It was as though she had bought him\nwith her blood....\n\nThat evening he and Alexa dined alone. After dinner he followed her to\nthe drawing-room. He no longer felt the need of avoiding her; he was\nhardly conscious of her presence. After a few words they lapsed into\nsilence and he sat smoking with his eyes on the fire. It was not that he\nwas unwilling to talk to her; he felt a curious desire to be as kind\nas possible; but he was always forgetting that she was there. Her full\nbright presence, through which the currents of life flowed so warmly,\nhad grown as tenuous as a shadow, and he saw so far beyond her--\n\nPresently she rose and began to move about the room. She seemed to be\nlooking for something and he roused himself to ask what she wanted.\n\n“Only the last number of the Horoscope. I thought I’d left it on this\ntable.” He said nothing, and she went on: “You haven’t seen it?”\n\n“No,” he returned coldly. The magazine was locked in his desk.\n\nHis wife had moved to the mantel-piece. She stood facing him and as he\nlooked up he met her tentative gaze. “I was reading an article in it--a\nreview of Mrs. Aubyn’s letters,” she added, slowly, with her deep,\ndeliberate blush.\n\nGlennard stooped to toss his cigar into the fire. He felt a savage wish\nthat she would not speak the other woman’s name; nothing else seemed to\nmatter. “You seem to do a lot of reading,” he said.\n\nShe still earnestly confronted him. “I was keeping this for you--I\nthought it might interest you,” she said, with an air of gentle\ninsistence.\n\nHe stood up and turned away. He was sure she knew that he had taken the\nreview and he felt that he was beginning to hate her again.\n\n“I haven’t time for such things,” he said, indifferently. As he moved to\nthe door he heard her take a precipitate step forward; then she paused\nand sank without speaking into the chair from which he had risen.\n\n\n\n\nXI\n\n\nAs Glennard, in the raw February sunlight, mounted the road to the\ncemetery, he felt the beatitude that comes with an abrupt cessation of\nphysical pain. He had reached the point where self-analysis ceases;\nthe impulse that moved him was purely intuitive. He did not even seek\na reason for it, beyond the obvious one that his desire to stand by\nMargaret Aubyn’s grave was prompted by no attempt at a sentimental\nreparation, but rather by the vague need to affirm in some way the\nreality of the tie between them.\n\nThe ironical promiscuity of death had brought Mrs. Aubyn back to\nshare the narrow hospitality of her husband’s last lodging; but though\nGlennard knew she had been buried near New York he had never visited\nher grave. He was oppressed, as he now threaded the long avenues, by a\nchilling vision of her return. There was no family to follow her hearse;\nshe had died alone, as she had lived; and the “distinguished mourners”\n who had formed the escort of the famous writer knew nothing of the woman\nthey were committing to the grave. Glennard could not even remember at\nwhat season she had been buried; but his mood indulged the fancy that it\nmust have been on some such day of harsh sunlight, the incisive February\nbrightness that gives perspicuity without warmth. The white avenues\nstretched before him interminably, lined with stereotyped emblems of\naffliction, as though all the platitudes ever uttered had been turned to\nmarble and set up over the unresisting dead. Here and there, no doubt, a\nfrigid urn or an insipid angel imprisoned some fine-fibred grief, as the\nmost hackneyed words may become the vehicle of rare meanings; but for\nthe most part the endless alignment of monuments seemed to embody those\neasy generalizations about death that do not disturb the repose of the\nliving. Glennard’s eye, as he followed the way indicated to him, had\ninstinctively sought some low mound with a quiet headstone. He had\nforgotten that the dead seldom plan their own houses, and with a pang he\ndiscovered the name he sought on the cyclopean base of a granite shaft\nrearing its aggressive height at the angle of two avenues.\n\n“How she would have hated it!” he murmured.\n\nA bench stood near and he seated himself. The monument rose before him\nlike some pretentious uninhabited dwelling; he could not believe that\nMargaret Aubyn lay there. It was a Sunday morning and black figures\nmoved among the paths, placing flowers on the frost-bound hillocks.\nGlennard noticed that the neighboring graves had been thus newly\ndressed; and he fancied a blind stir of expectancy through the sod, as\nthough the bare mounds spread a parched surface to that commemorative\nrain. He rose presently and walked back to the entrance of the cemetery.\nSeveral greenhouses stood near the gates, and turning in at the first he\nasked for some flowers.\n\n“Anything in the emblematic line?” asked the anaemic man behind the\ndripping counter.\n\nGlennard shook his head.\n\n“Just cut flowers? This way, then.” The florist unlocked a glass door\nand led him down a moist green aisle. The hot air was choked with the\nscent of white azaleas, white lilies, white lilacs; all the flowers were\nwhite; they were like a prolongation, a mystical efflorescence, of the\nlong rows of marble tombstones, and their perfume seemed to cover an\nodor of decay. The rich atmosphere made Glennard dizzy. As he leaned\nin the doorpost, waiting for the flowers, he had a penetrating sense of\nMargaret Aubyn’s nearness--not the imponderable presence of his inner\nvision, but a life that beat warm in his arms....\n\nThe sharp air caught him as he stepped out into it again. He walked back\nand scattered the flowers over the grave. The edges of the white petals\nshrivelled like burnt paper in the cold; and as he watched them the\nillusion of her nearness faded, shrank back frozen.\n\n\n\n\nXII\n\n\nThe motive of his visit to the cemetery remained undefined save as a\nfinal effort of escape from his wife’s inexpressive acceptance of his\nshame. It seemed to him that as long as he could keep himself alive to\nthat shame he would not wholly have succumbed to its consequences. His\nchief fear was that he should become the creature of his act. His wife’s\nindifference degraded him; it seemed to put him on a level with his\ndishonor. Margaret Aubyn would have abhorred the deed in proportion to\nher pity for the man. The sense of her potential pity drew him back to\nher. The one woman knew but did not understand; the other, it sometimes\nseemed, understood without knowing.\n\nIn its last disguise of retrospective remorse, his self-pity affected a\ndesire for solitude and meditation. He lost himself in morbid musings,\nin futile visions of what life with Margaret Aubyn might have been.\nThere were moments when, in the strange dislocation of his view, the\nwrong he had done her seemed a tie between them.\n\nTo indulge these emotions he fell into the habit, on Sunday afternoons,\nof solitary walks prolonged till after dusk. The days were lengthening,\nthere was a touch of spring in the air, and his wanderings now usually\nled him to the Park and its outlying regions.\n\nOne Sunday, tired of aimless locomotion, he took a cab at the Park gates\nand let it carry him out to the Riverside Drive. It was a gray afternoon\nstreaked with east wind. Glennard’s cab advanced slowly, and as he\nleaned back, gazing with absent intentness at the deserted paths that\nwound under bare boughs between grass banks of premature vividness, his\nattention was arrested by two figures walking ahead of him. This couple,\nwho had the path to themselves, moved at an uneven pace, as though\nadapting their gait to a conversation marked by meditative intervals.\nNow and then they paused, and in one of these pauses the lady, turning\ntoward her companion, showed Glennard the outline of his wife’s profile.\nThe man was Flamel.\n\nThe blood rushed to Glennard’s forehead. He sat up with a jerk and\npushed back the lid in the roof of the hansom; but when the cabman bent\ndown he dropped into his seat without speaking. Then, becoming\nconscious of the prolonged interrogation of the lifted lid, he called\nout--“Turn--drive back--anywhere--I’m in a hurry--”\n\nAs the cab swung round he caught a last glimpse of the two figures. They\nhad not moved; Alexa, with bent head, stood listening.\n\n“My God, my God--” he groaned.\n\nIt was hideous--it was abominable--he could not understand it. The woman\nwas nothing to him--less than nothing--yet the blood hummed in his ears\nand hung a cloud before him. He knew it was only the stirring of the\nprimal instinct, that it had no more to do with his reasoning self\nthan any reflex impulse of the body; but that merely lowered anguish\nto disgust. Yes, it was disgust he felt--almost a physical nausea. The\npoisonous fumes of life were in his lungs. He was sick, unutterably\nsick....\n\nHe drove home and went to his room. They were giving a little dinner\nthat night, and when he came down the guests were arriving. He looked at\nhis wife: her beauty was extraordinary, but it seemed to him the beauty\nof a smooth sea along an unlit coast. She frightened him.\n\nHe sat late that night in his study. He heard the parlor-maid lock the\nfront door; then his wife went upstairs and the lights were put out.\nHis brain was like some great empty hall with an echo in it; one thought\nreverberated endlessly.... At length he drew his chair to the table and\nbegan to write. He addressed an envelope and then slowly re-read what he\nhad written.\n\n\n“MY DEAR FLAMEL,”\n\n“Many apologies for not sending you sooner the enclosed check, which\nrepresents the customary percentage on the sale of the Letters.”\n\n“Trusting you will excuse the oversight,\n\n“Yours truly,\n\n“STEPHEN GLENNARD.”\n\n\nHe let himself out of the darkened house and dropped the letter in the\npost-box at the corner.\n\n\nThe next afternoon he was detained late at his office, and as he was\npreparing to leave he heard someone asking for him in the outer room. He\nseated himself again and Flamel was shown in.\n\nThe two men, as Glennard pushed aside an obstructive chair, had a\nmoment to measure each other; then Flamel advanced, and drawing out his\nnote-case, laid a slip of paper on the desk.\n\n“My dear fellow, what on earth does this mean?” Glennard recognized his\ncheck.\n\n“That I was remiss, simply. It ought to have gone to you before.”\n\nFlamel’s tone had been that of unaffected surprise, but at this his\naccent changed and he asked, quickly: “On what ground?”\n\nGlennard had moved away from the desk and stood leaning against the\ncalf-backed volumes of the bookcase. “On the ground that you sold Mrs.\nAubyn’s letters for me, and that I find the intermediary in such cases\nis entitled to a percentage on the sale.”\n\nFlamel paused before answering. “You find, you say. It’s a recent\ndiscovery?”\n\n“Obviously, from my not sending the check sooner. You see I’m new to the\nbusiness.”\n\n“And since when have you discovered that there was any question of\nbusiness, as far as I was concerned?”\n\nGlennard flushed and his voice rose slightly. “Are you reproaching me\nfor not having remembered it sooner?”\n\nFlamel, who had spoken in the rapid repressed tone of a man on the\nverge of anger, stared a moment at this and then, in his natural voice,\nrejoined, good-humoredly, “Upon my soul, I don’t understand you!”\n\nThe change of key seemed to disconcert Glennard. “It’s simple enough--”\n he muttered.\n\n“Simple enough--your offering me money in return for a friendly service?\nI don’t know what your other friends expect!”\n\n“Some of my friends wouldn’t have undertaken the job. Those who would\nhave done so would probably have expected to be paid.”\n\nHe lifted his eyes to Flamel and the two men looked at each other.\nFlamel had turned white and his lips stirred, but he held his temperate\nnote. “If you mean to imply that the job was not a nice one, you lay\nyourself open to the retort that you proposed it. But for my part\nI’ve never seen, I never shall see, any reason for not publishing the\nletters.”\n\n“That’s just it!”\n\n“What--?”\n\n“The certainty of your not seeing was what made me go to you. When\na man’s got stolen goods to pawn he doesn’t take them to the\npolice-station.”\n\n“Stolen?” Flamel echoed. “The letters were stolen?”\n\nGlennard burst into a coarse laugh. “How much longer do you expect me to\nkeep up that pretence about the letters? You knew well enough they were\nwritten to me.”\n\nFlamel looked at him in silence. “Were they?” he said at length. “I\ndidn’t know it.”\n\n“And didn’t suspect it, I suppose,” Glennard sneered.\n\nThe other was again silent; then he said, “I may remind you that,\nsupposing I had felt any curiosity about the matter, I had no way of\nfinding out that the letters were written to you. You never showed me\nthe originals.”\n\n“What does that prove? There were fifty ways of finding out. It’s the\nkind of thing one can easily do.”\n\nFlamel glanced at him with contempt. “Our ideas probably differ as to\nwhat a man can easily do. It would not have been easy for me.”\n\nGlennard’s anger vented itself in the words uppermost in his thought.\n“It may, then, interest you to hear that my wife DOES know about the\nletters--has known for some months....”\n\n“Ah,” said the other, slowly. Glennard saw that, in his blind clutch at\na weapon, he had seized the one most apt to wound. Flamel’s muscles were\nunder control, but his face showed the undefinable change produced\nby the slow infiltration of poison. Every implication that the words\ncontained had reached its mark; but Glennard felt that their obvious\nintention was lost in the anguish of what they suggested. He was sure\nnow that Flamel would never have betrayed him; but the inference only\nmade a wider outlet for his anger. He paused breathlessly for Flamel to\nspeak.\n\n“If she knows, it’s not through me.” It was what Glennard had waited\nfor.\n\n“Through you, by God? Who said it was through you? Do you suppose I\nleave it to you, or to anybody else, for that matter, to keep my wife\ninformed of my actions? I didn’t suppose even such egregious conceit as\nyours could delude a man to that degree!” Struggling for a foothold in\nthe small landslide of his dignity, he added, in a steadier tone, “My\nwife learned the facts from me.”\n\nFlamel received this in silence. The other’s outbreak seemed to\nhave reinforced his self-control, and when he spoke it was with a\ndeliberation implying that his course was chosen. “In that case I\nunderstand still less--”\n\n“Still less--?”\n\n“The meaning of this.” He pointed to the check. “When you began to speak\nI supposed you had meant it as a bribe; now I can only infer it was\nintended as a random insult. In either case, here’s my answer.”\n\nHe tore the slip of paper in two and tossed the fragments across the\ndesk to Glennard. Then he turned and walked out of the office.\n\nGlennard dropped his head on his hands. If he had hoped to restore his\nself-respect by the simple expedient of assailing Flamel’s, the result\nhad not justified his expectation. The blow he had struck had blunted\nthe edge of his anger, and the unforeseen extent of the hurt inflicted\ndid not alter the fact that his weapon had broken in his hands. He\nsaw now that his rage against Flamel was only the last projection of a\npassionate self-disgust. This consciousness did not dull his dislike of\nthe man; it simply made reprisals ineffectual. Flamel’s unwillingness to\nquarrel with him was the last stage of his abasement.\n\nIn the light of this final humiliation his assumption of his wife’s\nindifference struck him as hardly so fatuous as the sentimental\nresuscitation of his past. He had been living in a factitious world\nwherein his emotions were the sycophants of his vanity, and it was with\ninstinctive relief that he felt its ruins crash about his head.\n\nIt was nearly dark when he left his office, and he walked slowly\nhomeward in the complete mental abeyance that follows on such a crisis.\nHe was not aware that he was thinking of his wife; yet when he reached\nhis own door he found that, in the involuntary readjustment of his\nvision, she had once more become the central point of consciousness.\n\n\n\n\nXIII\n\n\nIt had never before occurred to him that she might, after all, have\nmissed the purport of the document he had put in her way. What if, in\nher hurried inspection of the papers, she had passed it over as related\nto the private business of some client? What, for instance, was to\nprevent her concluding that Glennard was the counsel of the unknown\nperson who had sold the “Aubyn Letters.” The subject was one not likely\nto fix her attention--she was not a curious woman.\n\nGlennard at this point laid down his fork and glanced at her between the\ncandle-shades. The alternative explanation of her indifference was not\nslow in presenting itself. Her head had the same listening droop as\nwhen he had caught sight of her the day before in Flamel’s company; the\nattitude revived the vividness of his impression. It was simple enough,\nafter all. She had ceased to care for him because she cared for someone\nelse.\n\nAs he followed her upstairs he felt a sudden stirring of his dormant\nanger. His sentiments had lost all their factitious complexity. He had\nalready acquitted her of any connivance in his baseness, and he felt\nonly that he loved her and that she had escaped him. This was now,\nstrangely enough, his dominating thought: the consciousness that he and\nshe had passed through the fusion of love and had emerged from it as\nincommunicably apart as though the transmutation had never taken place.\nEvery other passion, he mused, left some mark upon the nature; but love\npassed like the flight of a ship across the waters.\n\nShe sank into her usual seat near the lamp, and he leaned against the\nchimney, moving about with an inattentive hand the knick-knacks on the\nmantel.\n\nSuddenly he caught sight of her reflection in the mirror. She was\nlooking at him. He turned and their eyes met.\n\nHe moved across the room and stood before her.\n\n“There’s something that I want to say to you,” he began in a low tone.\n\nShe held his gaze, but her color deepened. He noticed again, with a\njealous pang, how her beauty had gained in warmth and meaning. It was\nas though a transparent cup had been filled with wine. He looked at her\nironically.\n\n“I’ve never prevented your seeing your friends here,” he broke out. “Why\ndo you meet Flamel in out-of-the-way places? Nothing makes a woman so\ncheap--”\n\nShe rose abruptly and they faced each other a few feet apart.\n\n“What do you mean?” she asked.\n\n“I saw you with him last Sunday on the Riverside Drive,” he went on, the\nutterance of the charge reviving his anger.\n\n“Ah,” she murmured. She sank into her chair again and began to play with\na paper-knife that lay on the table at her elbow.\n\nHer silence exasperated him.\n\n“Well?” he burst out. “Is that all you have to say?”\n\n“Do you wish me to explain?” she asked, proudly.\n\n“Do you imply I haven’t the right to?”\n\n“I imply nothing. I will tell you whatever you wish to know. I went for\na walk with Mr. Flamel because he asked me to.”\n\n“I didn’t suppose you went uninvited. But there are certain things a\nsensible woman doesn’t do. She doesn’t slink about in out-of-the-way\nstreets with men. Why couldn’t you have seen him here?”\n\nShe hesitated. “Because he wanted to see me alone.”\n\n“Did he, indeed? And may I ask if you gratify all his wishes with equal\nalacrity?”\n\n“I don’t know that he has any others where I am concerned.” She\npaused again and then continued, in a lower voice that somehow had an\nunder-note of warning. “He wished to bid me good-by. He’s going away.”\n\nGlennard turned on her a startled glance. “Going away?”\n\n“He’s going to Europe to-morrow. He goes for a long time. I supposed you\nknew.”\n\nThe last phrase revived his irritation. “You forget that I depend on you\nfor my information about Flamel. He’s your friend and not mine. In fact,\nI’ve sometimes wondered at your going out of your way to be so civil to\nhim when you must see plainly enough that I don’t like him.”\n\nHer answer to this was not immediate. She seemed to be choosing her\nwords with care, not so much for her own sake as for his, and his\nexasperation was increased by the suspicion that she was trying to spare\nhim.\n\n“He was your friend before he was mine. I never knew him till I was\nmarried. It was you who brought him to the house and who seemed to wish\nme to like him.”\n\nGlennard gave a short laugh. The defence was feebler than he had\nexpected: she was certainly not a clever woman.\n\n“Your deference to my wishes is really beautiful; but it’s not the first\ntime in history that a man has made a mistake in introducing his\nfriends to his wife. You must, at any rate, have seen since then that\nmy enthusiasm had cooled; but so, perhaps, has your eagerness to oblige\nme.”\n\nShe met this with a silence that seemed to rob the taunt of half its\nefficacy.\n\n“Is that what you imply?” he pressed her.\n\n“No,” she answered with sudden directness. “I noticed some time ago that\nyou seemed to dislike him, but since then--”\n\n“Well--since then?”\n\n“I’ve imagined that you had reasons for still wishing me to be civil to\nhim, as you call it.”\n\n“Ah,” said Glennard, with an effort at lightness; but his irony dropped,\nfor something in her voice made him feel that he and she stood at last\nin that naked desert of apprehension where meaning skulks vainly behind\nspeech.\n\n“And why did you imagine this?” The blood mounted to his forehead.\n“Because he told you that I was under obligations to him?”\n\nShe turned pale. “Under obligations?”\n\n“Oh, don’t let’s beat about the bush. Didn’t he tell you it was I who\npublished Mrs. Aubyn’s letters? Answer me that.”\n\n“No,” she said; and after a moment which seemed given to the weighing of\nalternatives, she added: “No one told me.”\n\n“You didn’t know then?”\n\nShe seemed to speak with an effort. “Not until--not until--”\n\n“Till I gave you those papers to sort?”\n\nHer head sank.\n\n“You understood then?”\n\n“Yes.”\n\nHe looked at her immovable face. “Had you suspected--before?” was slowly\nwrung from him.\n\n“At times--yes--” Her voice dropped to a whisper.\n\n“Why? From anything that was said--?”\n\nThere was a shade of pity in her glance. “No one said anything--no one\ntold me anything.” She looked away from him. “It was your manner--”\n\n“My manner?”\n\n“Whenever the book was mentioned. Things you said--once or twice--your\nirritation--I can’t explain--”\n\nGlennard, unconsciously, had moved nearer. He breathed like a man who\nhas been running. “You knew, then, you knew”--he stammered. The avowal\nof her love for Flamel would have hurt him less, would have rendered\nher less remote. “You knew--you knew--” he repeated; and suddenly his\nanguish gathered voice. “My God!” he cried, “you suspected it first, you\nsay--and then you knew it--this damnable, this accursed thing; you knew\nit months ago--it’s months since I put that paper in your way--and yet\nyou’ve done nothing, you’ve said nothing, you’ve made no sign, you’ve\nlived alongside of me as if it had made no difference--no difference in\neither of our lives. What are you made of, I wonder? Don’t you see the\nhideous ignominy of it? Don’t you see how you’ve shared in my disgrace?\nOr haven’t you any sense of shame?”\n\nHe preserved sufficient lucidity, as the words poured from him, to see\nhow fatally they invited her derision; but something told him they had\nboth passed beyond the phase of obvious retaliations, and that if any\nchord in her responded it would not be that of scorn.\n\nHe was right. She rose slowly and moved toward him.\n\n“Haven’t you had enough--without that?” she said, in a strange voice of\npity.\n\nHe stared at her. “Enough--?”\n\n“Of misery....”\n\nAn iron band seemed loosened from his temples. “You saw then...?” he\nwhispered.\n\n“Oh, God----oh, God----” she sobbed. She dropped beside him and hid\nher anguish against his knees. They clung thus in silence, a long time,\ndriven together down the same fierce blast of shame.\n\nWhen at length she lifted her face he averted his. Her scorn would have\nhurt him less than the tears on his hands.\n\nShe spoke languidly, like a child emerging from a passion of weeping.\n“It was for the money--?”\n\nHis lips shaped an assent.\n\n“That was the inheritance--that we married on?”\n\n“Yes.”\n\nShe drew back and rose to her feet. He sat watching her as she wandered\naway from him.\n\n“You hate me,” broke from him.\n\nShe made no answer.\n\n“Say you hate me!” he persisted.\n\n“That would have been so simple,” she answered with a strange smile. She\ndropped into a chair near the writing-table and rested a bowed forehead\non her hand.\n\n“Was it much--?” she began at length.\n\n“Much--?” he returned, vaguely.\n\n“The money.”\n\n“The money?” That part of it seemed to count so little that for a moment\nhe did not follow her thought.\n\n“It must be paid back,” she insisted. “Can you do it?”\n\n“Oh, yes,” he returned, listlessly. “I can do it.”\n\n“I would make any sacrifice for that!” she urged.\n\nHe nodded. “Of course.” He sat staring at her in dry-eyed self-contempt.\n“Do you count on its making much difference?”\n\n“Much difference?”\n\n“In the way I feel--or you feel about me?”\n\nShe shook her head.\n\n“It’s the least part of it,” he groaned.\n\n“It’s the only part we can repair.”\n\n“Good heavens! If there were any reparation--” He rose quickly and\ncrossed the space that divided them. “Why did you never speak?” he\nasked.\n\n“Haven’t you answered that yourself?”\n\n“Answered it?”\n\n“Just now--when you told me you did it for me.” She paused a moment and\nthen went on with a deepening note--“I would have spoken if I could have\nhelped you.”\n\n“But you must have despised me.”\n\n“I’ve told you that would have been simpler.”\n\n“But how could you go on like this--hating the money?”\n\n“I knew you would speak in time. I wanted you, first, to hate it as I\ndid.”\n\nHe gazed at her with a kind of awe. “You’re wonderful,” he murmured.\n“But you don’t yet know the depths I’ve reached.”\n\nShe raised an entreating hand. “I don’t want to!”\n\n“You’re afraid, then, that you’ll hate me?”\n\n“No--but that you’ll hate ME. Let me understand without your telling\nme.”\n\n“You can’t. It’s too base. I thought you didn’t care because you loved\nFlamel.”\n\nShe blushed deeply. “Don’t--don’t--” she warned him.\n\n“I haven’t the right to, you mean?”\n\n“I mean that you’ll be sorry.”\n\nHe stood imploringly before her. “I want to say something\nworse--something more outrageous. If you don’t understand THIS you’ll be\nperfectly justified in ordering me out of the house.”\n\nShe answered him with a glance of divination. “I shall understand--but\nyou’ll be sorry.”\n\n“I must take my chance of that.” He moved away and tossed the books\nabout the table. Then he swung round and faced her. “Does Flamel care\nfor you?” he asked.\n\nHer flush deepened, but she still looked at him without anger. “What\nwould be the use?” she said with a note of sadness.\n\n“Ah, I didn’t ask THAT,” he penitently murmured.\n\n“Well, then--”\n\nTo this adjuration he made no response beyond that of gazing at her\nwith an eye which seemed now to view her as a mere factor in an immense\nredistribution of meanings.\n\n“I insulted Flamel to-day. I let him see that I suspected him of having\ntold you. I hated him because he knew about the letters.”\n\nHe caught the spreading horror of her eyes, and for an instant he had\nto grapple with the new temptation they lit up. Then he said, with an\neffort--“Don’t blame him--he’s impeccable. He helped me to get them\npublished; but I lied to him too; I pretended they were written to\nanother man... a man who was dead....”\n\nShe raised her arms in a gesture that seemed to ward off his blows.\n\n“You DO despise me!” he insisted.\n\n“Ah, that poor woman--that poor woman--” he heard her murmur.\n\n“I spare no one, you see!” he triumphed over her. She kept her face\nhidden.\n\n“You do hate me, you do despise me!” he strangely exulted.\n\n“Be silent!” she commanded him; but he seemed no longer conscious of any\ncheck on his gathering purpose.\n\n“He cared for you--he cared for you,” he repeated, “and he never told\nyou of the letters--”\n\nShe sprang to her feet. “How can you?” she flamed. “How dare you?\nTHAT--!”\n\nGlennard was ashy pale. “It’s a weapon... like another....”\n\n“A scoundrel’s!”\n\nHe smiled wretchedly. “I should have used it in his place.”\n\n“Stephen! Stephen!” she cried, as though to drown the blasphemy on his\nlips. She swept to him with a rescuing gesture. “Don’t say such things.\nI forbid you! It degrades us both.”\n\nHe put her back with trembling hands. “Nothing that I say of myself can\ndegrade you. We’re on different levels.”\n\n“I’m on yours, whatever it is!”\n\nHe lifted his head and their gaze flowed together.\n\n\n\n\nXIV\n\n\nThe great renewals take effect as imperceptibly as the first workings of\nspring. Glennard, though he felt himself brought nearer to his wife,\nwas still, as it were, hardly within speaking distance. He was\nbut laboriously acquiring the rudiments of their new medium of\ncommunication; and he had to grope for her through the dense fog of his\nhumiliation, the distorting vapor against which his personality loomed\ngrotesque and mean.\n\nOnly the fact that we are unaware how well our nearest know us\nenables us to live with them. Love is the most impregnable refuge of\nself-esteem, and we hate the eye that reaches to our nakedness. If\nGlennard did not hate his wife it was slowly, sufferingly, that there\nwas born in him that profounder passion which made his earlier feeling\nseem a mere commotion of the blood. He was like a child coming back to\nthe sense of an enveloping presence: her nearness was a breast on which\nhe leaned.\n\nThey did not, at first, talk much together, and each beat a devious\ntrack about the outskirts of the subject that lay between them like a\nhaunted wood. But every word, every action, seemed to glance at it,\nto draw toward it, as though a fount of healing sprang in its poisoned\nshade. If only they might cut away through the thicket to that restoring\nspring!\n\nGlennard, watching his wife with the intentness of a wanderer to whom no\nnatural sign is negligible, saw that she had taken temporary refuge in\nthe purpose of renouncing the money. If both, theoretically, owned the\ninefficacy of such amends, the woman’s instinctive subjectiveness made\nher find relief in this crude form of penance. Glennard saw that she\nmeant to live as frugally as possible till what she deemed their debt\nwas discharged; and he prayed she might not discover how far-reaching,\nin its merely material sense, was the obligation she thus hoped to\nacquit. Her mind was fixed on the sum originally paid for the letters,\nand this he knew he could lay aside in a year or two. He was touched,\nmeanwhile, by the spirit that made her discard the petty luxuries which\nshe regarded as the signs of their bondage. Their shared renunciations\ndrew her nearer to him, helped, in their evidence of her helplessness,\nto restore the full protecting stature of his love. And still they did\nnot speak.\n\nIt was several weeks later that, one afternoon by the drawing-room fire,\nshe handed him a letter that she had been reading when he entered.\n\n“I’ve heard from Mr. Flamel,” she said.\n\nGlennard turned pale. It was as though a latent presence had suddenly\nbecome visible to both. He took the letter mechanically.\n\n“It’s from Smyrna,” she said. “Won’t you read it?”\n\nHe handed it back. “You can tell me about it--his hand’s so illegible.”\n He wandered to the other end of the room and then turned and stood\nbefore her. “I’ve been thinking of writing to Flamel,” he said.\n\nShe looked up.\n\n“There’s one point,” he continued, slowly, “that I ought to clear up.\nI told him you’d known about the letters all along; for a long time, at\nleast; and I saw it hurt him horribly. It was just what I meant to do,\nof course; but I can’t leave him to that false impression; I must write\nhim.”\n\nShe received this without outward movement, but he saw that the depths\nwere stirred. At length she returned, in a hesitating tone, “Why do you\ncall it a false impression? I did know.”\n\n“Yes, but I implied you didn’t care.”\n\n“Ah!”\n\nHe still stood looking down on her. “Don’t you want me to set that\nright?” he tentatively pursued.\n\nShe lifted her head and fixed him bravely. “It isn’t necessary,” she\nsaid.\n\nGlennard flushed with the shock of the retort; then, with a gesture\nof comprehension, “No,” he said, “with you it couldn’t be; but I might\nstill set myself right.”\n\nShe looked at him gently. “Don’t I,” she murmured, “do that?”\n\n“In being yourself merely? Alas, the rehabilitation’s too complete!\nYou make me seem--to myself even--what I’m not; what I can never be.\nI can’t, at times, defend myself from the delusion; but I can at least\nenlighten others.”\n\nThe flood was loosened, and kneeling by her he caught her hands. “Don’t\nyou see that it’s become an obsession with me? That if I could strip\nmyself down to the last lie--only there’d always be another one left\nunder it!--and do penance naked in the market-place, I should at least\nhave the relief of easing one anguish by another? Don’t you see that the\nworst of my torture is the impossibility of such amends?”\n\nHer hands lay in his without returning pressure. “Ah, poor woman, poor\nwoman,” he heard her sigh.\n\n“Don’t pity her, pity me! What have I done to her or to you, after all?\nYou’re both inaccessible! It was myself I sold.”\n\nHe took an abrupt turn away from her; then halted before her again. “How\nmuch longer,” he burst out, “do you suppose you can stand it? You’ve\nbeen magnificent, you’ve been inspired, but what’s the use? You can’t\nwipe out the ignominy of it. It’s miserable for you and it does HER no\ngood!”\n\nShe lifted a vivid face. “That’s the thought I can’t bear!” she cried.\n\n“What thought?”\n\n“That it does her no good--all you’re feeling, all you’re suffering. Can\nit be that it makes no difference?”\n\nHe avoided her challenging glance. “What’s done is done,” he muttered.\n\n“Is it ever, quite, I wonder?” she mused. He made no answer and they\nlapsed into one of the pauses that are a subterranean channel of\ncommunication.\n\nIt was she who, after awhile, began to speak with a new suffusing\ndiffidence that made him turn a roused eye on her.\n\n“Don’t they say,” she asked, feeling her way as in a kind of tender\napprehensiveness, “that the early Christians, instead of pulling down\nthe heathen temples--the temples of the unclean gods--purified them by\nturning them to their own uses? I’ve always thought one might do that\nwith one’s actions--the actions one loathes but can’t undo. One can\nmake, I mean, a wrong the door to other wrongs or an impassable wall\nagainst them....” Her voice wavered on the word. “We can’t always tear\ndown the temples we’ve built to the unclean gods, but we can put\ngood spirits in the house of evil--the spirits of mercy and shame and\nunderstanding, that might never have come to us if we hadn’t been in\nsuch great need....”\n\nShe moved over to him and laid a hesitating hand on his. His head was\nbent and he did not change his attitude. She sat down beside him without\nspeaking; but their silences now were fertile as rain-clouds--they\nquickened the seeds of understanding.\n\nAt length he looked up. “I don’t know,” he said, “what spirits have come\nto live in the house of evil that I built--but you’re there and that’s\nenough for me. It’s strange,” he went on after another pause, “she\nwished the best for me so often, and now, at last, it’s through her that\nit’s come to me. But for her I shouldn’t have known you--it’s through\nher that I’ve found you. Sometimes, do you know?--that makes it\nhardest--makes me most intolerable to myself. Can’t you see that it’s\nthe worst thing I’ve got to face? I sometimes think I could have\nborne it better if you hadn’t understood! I took everything from\nher--everything--even to the poor shelter of loyalty she’d trusted\nin--the only thing I could have left her!--I took everything from her,\nI deceived her, I despoiled her, I destroyed her--and she’s given me YOU\nin return!”\n\nHis wife’s cry caught him up. “It isn’t that she’s given ME to you--it\nis that she’s given you to yourself.” She leaned to him as though swept\nforward on a wave of pity. “Don’t you see,” she went on, as his eyes\nhung on her, “that that’s the gift you can’t escape from, the debt\nyou’re pledged to acquit? Don’t you see that you’ve never before been\nwhat she thought you, and that now, so wonderfully, she’s made you into\nthe man she loved? THAT’S worth suffering for, worth dying for, to a\nwoman--that’s the gift she would have wished to give!”\n\n“Ah,” he cried, “but woe to him by whom it cometh. What did I ever give\nher?”\n\n“The happiness of giving,” she said.",
