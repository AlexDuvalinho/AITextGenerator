Moreover, a small but\nsufficient competency was mine, allowing me reasonable comforts, and\nthe luxuries of a small but choice library, and a small but choice\ngarden.  These heavenly blessings had seemed mere than enough for\nnearly five years, during which the good sister and I had kept house\ntogether, leading a life of tranquil happy days.  Friends and books and\nflowers!  It was, we said, a good world, and I, simpleton,--pretty and\ndainty as Margaret was,--deemed it would go on forever. But, alas! one\nday came a Faust into our garden,--a good Faust, with no friend\nMephistopheles,--and took Margaret from me.  It is but a month since\nthey were married, and the rice still lingers in the crevices of the\npathway down to the quaint old iron-work gate. Yes! they have gone off\nto spend their honeymoon, and Margaret has written to me twice to say\nhow happy they are together in the Hesperides.  Dear happiness!\nSelfish, indeed, were he who would envy you one petal of that wonderful\nrose--Rosa Mundi--God has given you to gather.\n\nBut, all the same, the reader will admit that it must be lonely for me,\nand not another sister left to take pity on me, all somewhere happily\nsettled down in the Fortunate Isles.\n\nPoor lonely old house! do you, too, miss the light step of your\nmistress?  No longer shall her little silken figure flit up and down\nyour quiet staircases, no more deck out your silent rooms with flowers,\nhumming the while some happy little song.\n\nThe little piano is dumb night after night, its candles unlighted, and\nthere is no one to play Chopin to us now as the day dies, and the\nshadows stoop out of their corners to listen in vain.  Old house, old\nhouse!  We are alone, quite alone,--there is no mistake about\nthat,--and the soul has gone out of both of us.  And as for the garden,\nthere is no company there; that is loneliest of all. The very sunlight\nlooks desolation, falling through the thick-blossoming apple-trees as\nthrough the chinks and crevices of deserted Egyptian cities.\n\nWhile as for the books--well, never talk to me again about the\ncompanionship of books!  For just when one needs them most of all they\nseem suddenly to have grown dull and unsympathetic, not a word of\ncomfort, not a charm anywhere in them to make us forget the slow-moving\nhours; whereas, when Margaret was here--but it is of no use to say any\nmore!  Everything was quite different when Margaret was here: that is\nenough.  Margaret has gone away to the Fortunate Isles.  Of course\nshe'll come to see us now and again; but it won't be the same thing.\nYes! old echoing silent House of Joy that is Gone, we are quite alone.\nNow, what is to be done?\n\n\n\nCHAPTER II\n\nIN WHICH I DECIDE TO GO ON PILGRIMAGE\n\nThough I have this bad habit of soliloquising, and indeed am absurd\nenough to attempt conversation with a house, yet the reader must\nrealise from the beginning that I am still quite a young man.  I talked\na little just now as though I were an octogenarian. Actually, as I\nsaid, I am but just gone thirty, and I may reasonably regard life, as\nthe saying is, all before me.  I was a little down-hearted when I wrote\nyesterday. Besides, I wrote at the end of the afternoon, a melancholy\ntime.  The morning is the time to write.  We are all--that is, those of\nus who sleep well--optimists in the morning. And the world is sad\nenough without our writing books to make it sadder.  The rest of this\nbook, I promise you, shall be written of a morning.  This book! oh,\nyes, I forgot!--I am going to write a book.  A book about what?  Well,\nthat must be as God wills. But listen!  As I lay in bed this morning\nbetween sleeping and waking, an idea came riding on a sunbeam into my\nroom,--a mad, whimsical idea, but one that suits my mood; and put\nbriefly, it is this: how is it that I, a not unpresentable young man, a\nman not without accomplishments or experience, should have gone all\nthese years without finding that\n\n               \"Not impossible she\n  Who shall command my heart and me,\"--\n\nwithout meeting at some turning of the way the mystical Golden\nGirl,--without, in short, finding a wife?\n\n\"Then,\" suggested the idea, with a blush for its own absurdity, \"why\nnot go on pilgrimage and seek her?  I don't believe you'll find her.\nShe isn't usually found after thirty.  But you'll no doubt have good\nfun by the way, and fall in with many pleasant adventures.\"\n\n\"A brave idea, indeed!\" I cried.  \"By Heaven, I will take stick and\nknapsack and walk right away from my own front door, right away where\nthe road leads, and see what happens.\"  And now, if the reader please,\nwe will make a start.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER III\n\nAN INDICTMENT OF SPRING\n\n\"Marry! an odd adventure!\" I said to myself, as I stepped along in the\nspring morning air; for, being a pilgrim, I was involuntarily in a\nmediaeval frame of mind, and \"Marry! an odd adventure!\" came to my lips\nas though I had been one of that famous company that once started from\nthe Tabard on a day in spring.\n\nIt had been the spring, it will be remembered, that had prompted them\nto go on pilgrimage; and me, too, the spring was filling with strange,\nundefinable longings, and though I flattered myself that I had set out\nin pursuance of a definitely taken resolve, I had really no more\nfreedom in the matter than the children who followed at the heels of\nthe mad piper.\n\nA mad piper, indeed, this spring, with his wonderful lying music,--ever\nlying, yet ever convincing, for when was Spring known to keep his word?\nYet year after year we give eager belief to his promises.  He may have\nconsistently broken them for fifty years, yet this year he will keep\nthem.  This year the dream will come true, the ship come home. This\nyear the very dead we have loved shall come back to us again: for\nSpring can even lie like that.  There is nothing he will not promise\nthe poor hungry human heart, with his innocent-looking daisies and\nthose practised liars the birds.  Why, one branch of hawthorn against\nthe sky promises more than all the summers of time can pay, and a pond\nablaze with yellow lilies awakens such answering splendours and\nenchantments in mortal bosoms,--blazons, it would seem, so august a\nmessage from the hidden heart of the world,--that ever afterwards, for\none who has looked upon it, the most fortunate human existence must\nseem a disappointment.\n\nSo I, too, with the rest of the world, was following in the wake of the\nmagical music. The lie it was drawing me by is perhaps Spring's oldest,\ncommonest lie,--the lying promise of the Perfect Woman, the Quite\nImpossible She.  Who has not dreamed of her,--who that can dream at\nall?  I suppose that the dreams of our modern youth are entirely\ncommercial.  In the morning of life they are rapt by intoxicating\nvisions of some great haberdashery business, beckoned to by the\nvoluptuous enticements of the legal profession, or maybe the Holy Grail\nthey forswear all else to seek is a snug editorial chair.  These quests\nand dreams were not for me.  Since I was man I have had but one\ndream,--namely, Woman.  Alas! till this my thirtieth year I have found\nonly women.  No! that is disloyal, disloyal to my First Love; for this\nis sadly true,--that we always find the Golden Girl in our first love,\nand lose her in our second.\n\nI wonder if the reader would care to hear about my First Love, of whom\nI am naturally thinking a good deal this morning, under the\ndemoralising influences of the fresh air, blue sky, and various birds\nand flowers. More potent intoxicants these than any that need licenses\nfor their purveyance, responsible--see the poets--for no end of human\nfoolishness.\n\nI was about to tell the story of my First Love, but on second thoughts\nI decide not. It will keep, and I feel hungry, and yonder seems a\ndingle where I can lie and open my knapsack, eat, drink, and doze among\nthe sun-flecked shadows.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER IV\n\nIN WHICH I EAT AND DREAM\n\nThe girl we go to meet is the girl we have met before.  I evolved this\nsage reflection, as, lost deep down in the green alleys of the dingle,\nhaving fortified the romantic side of my nature with sandwiches and\nsherry, I lazily put the question to myself as to what manner of girl I\nexpected the Golden Girl to be.  A man who goes seeking should have\nsome notion of what he goes out to seek. Had I any ideal by which to\ntest and measure the damsels of the world who were to pass before my\ncritical choosing eye? Had I ever met any girl in the past who would\nserve approximately as a model,--any girl, in fact, I would very much\nlike to meet again? I was very sleepy, and while trying to make up my\nmind I fell asleep; and lo! the sandwiches and sherry brought me a\ndream that I could not but consider of good omen.  And this was the\ndream.\n\nI thought my quest had brought me into a strange old haunted forest,\nand that I had thrown myself down to rest at the gnarled mossy root of\na great oak-tree, while all about me was nought but fantastic shapes\nand capricious groups of gold-green bole and bough, wondrous alleys\nending in mysterious coverts, and green lanes of exquisite turf that\nseemed to have been laid down in expectation of some milk-white queen\nor goddess passing that way.\n\nAnd so still the forest was you could have heard an acorn drop or a\nbird call from one end of it to the other.  The exquisite silence was\nevidently waiting for the exquisite voice, that presently not so much\nbroke as mingled with it, like a swan swimming through a lake.\n\n\"Whom seek you?\" said, or rather sung, a planetary voice right at my\nshoulder.  But three short unmusical Saxon words, yet it was as though\na mystical strain of music had passed through the wood.\n\n\"Whom seek you?\"  and again the lovely speech flowered upon the\nsilence, as white water-lilies on the surface of some shaded pool.\n\n\"The Golden Girl,\" I answered simply, turning my head, and looking half\nsideways and half upwards; and behold! the tree at whose foot I lay had\nopened its rocky side, and in the cleft, like a long lily-bud sliding\nfrom its green sheath, stood a dryad, and my speech failed and my\nbreath went as I looked upon her beauty, for which mortality has no\nsimile.  Yet was there something about her of the earth-sweetness that\nclings even to the loveliest, star-ambitious, earth-born thing.  She\nwas not all immortal, as man is not all mortal.  She was the sweetness\nof the strength of the oak, the soul born of the sun kissing its green\nleaves in the still Memnonian mornings, of moon and stars kissing its\ngreen leaves in the still Trophonian nights.\n\n\"The maid you seek,\" said she, and again she broke the silence like the\nmoon breaking through the clouds, \"what manner of maid is she?  For a\nmaid abides in this wood, maybe it is she whom you seek.  Is she but a\nlovely face you seek?  Is she but a lofty mind?  Is she but a beautiful\nsoul?\"\n\n\"Maybe she is all these, though no one only, and more besides,\" I\nanswered.\n\n\"It is well,\" she replied, \"but have you in your heart no image of her\nyou seek? Else how should you know her should you some day come to meet\nher?\"\n\n\"I have no image of her,\" I said.  \"I cannot picture her; but I shall\nknow her, know her inerrably as these your wood children find out each\nother untaught, as the butterfly that has never seen his kindred knows\nhis painted mate, passing on the wing all others by.  Only when the\nlark shall mate with the nightingale, and the honey-bee and the\nclock-beetle keep house together, shall I wed another maid.  Fair maybe\nshe will not be, though fair to me. Wise maybe she will not be, though\nwise to me.  For riches I care not, and of her kindred I have no care.\nAll I know is that just to sit by her will be bliss, just to touch her\nbliss, just to hear her speak bliss beyond all mortal telling.\"\n\nThereat the Sweetness of the Strength of the Oak smiled upon me and\nsaid,--\n\n\"Follow yonder green path till it leads you into a little grassy glade,\nwhere is a crystal well and a hut of woven boughs hard by, and you\nshall see her whom you seek.\"\n\nAnd as she spoke she faded suddenly, and the side of the oak was once\nmore as the solid rock.  With hot heart I took the green winding path,\nand presently came the little grassy glade, and the bubbling crystal\nwell, and the hut of wattled boughs, and, looking through the open door\nof the hut, I saw a lovely girl lying asleep in her golden hair. She\nsmiled sweetly in her sleep, and stretched out her arms softly, as\nthough to enfold the dear head of her lover.  And, ere I knew, I was\nbending over her, and as her sweet breath came and went I whispered:\n\"Grace o' God, I am here.  I have sought you through the world, and\nfound you at last. Grace o' God, I have come.\"\n\nAnd then I thought her great eyes opened, as when the sun sweeps clear\nblue spaces in the morning sky.  \"Flower o' Men,\" then said she, low\nand sweet,--\"Flower o' Men, is it you indeed?  As you have sought, so\nhave I waited, waited...\"  And thereat her arms stole round my neck,\nand I awoke, and Grace o' God was suddenly no more than a pretty name\nthat my dream had given me.\n\n\"A pretty dream,\" said my soul, \"though a little boyish for thirty.\"\n\"And a most excellent sherry,\" added my body.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER V\n\nCONCERNING THE PERFECT WOMAN, AND THEREFORE CONCERNING ALL FEMININE\nREADERS\n\nAs I once more got under way, my thoughts slowly loitered back to the\ntheme which had been occupying them before I dropped asleep. What was\nmy working hypothesis of the Perfect Woman, towards whom I was thus\nleisurely strolling?  She might be defined, I reflected, as The Woman\nWho Is Worthy Of Us; but the improbability which every healthily\nconceited young man must feel of ever finding such a one made the\ndefinition seem a little unserviceable.  Or, if you prefer, since we\nseem to be dealing with impossibles, we might turn about and more truly\ndefine her as The Woman of Whom We are Worthy, for who dare say that\nshe exists?  If, again, she were defined as the Woman our More\nFortunate Friend Marries, her unapproachableness would rob the\ndefinition of any practical value.  Other generalisations proving\nequally unprofitable, I began scientifically to consider in detail the\nattributes of the supposititious paragon,--attributes of body and mind\nand heart. This was soon done; but again, as I thus conned all those\nvirtues which I was to expect united in one unhappy woman, the result\nwas still unsatisfying, for I began to perceive that it was really not\nperfection that I was in search of.  As I added virtue after virtue to\nthe female monster in my mind, and the result remained still inanimate\nand unalluring, I realised that the lack I was conscious of was not any\nnew perfection, but just one or two honest human imperfections.  And\nthis, try as I would, was just what I could not imagine.\n\nFor, if you reflect a moment, you will see that, while it is easy to\nchoose what virtues we would have our wife possess, it is all but\nimpossible to imagine those faults we would desire in her, which I\nthink most lovers would admit add piquancy to the loved one, that\nfascinating wayward imperfection which paradoxically makes her perfect.\n\nFaults in the abstract are each and all so uninviting, not to say\nalarming, but, associated with certain eyes and hair and tender little\ngowns, it is curious how they lose their terrors; and, as with vice in\nthe poet's image, we end by embracing what we began by dreading.  You\nsee the fault becomes a virtue when it is hers, the treason prospers;\nwherefore, no doubt, the impossibility of imagining it.  What\nparticular fault will suit a particular unknown girl is obviously as\ndifficult to determine as in what colours she will look her best.\n\nSo, I say, I plied my brains in vain for that becoming fault.  It was\nthe same whether I considered her beauty, her heart, or her mind.  A\ncharming old Italian writer has laid down the canons of perfect\nfeminine beauty with much nicety in a delicious discourse, which, as he\ndelivered it in a sixteenth-century Florentine garden to an audience of\nbeautiful and noble ladies, an audience not too large to be intimate\nand not too small to be embarrassing, it was his delightful good\nfortune and privilege to illustrate by pretty and sly references to the\ncharacteristic beauties of the several ladies seated like a ring of\nroses around him.  Thus he would refer to the shape of Madonna\nLampiada's sumptuous eyelids, and to her shell-like ears, to the\ncorrect length and shape of Madonna Amororrisca's nose, to the lily\ntower of Madonna Verdespina's throat; nor would the unabashed old\nFlorentine shrink from calling attention to the unfairness of Madonna\nSelvaggia's covering up her dainty bosom, just as he was about to\ndiscourse upon \"those two hills of snow and of roses with two little\ncrowns of fine rubies on their peaks.\"  How could a man lecture if his\ndiagrams were going to behave like that! Then, feigning a tiff, he\nwould close his manuscript, and all the ladies with their birdlike\nvoices would beseech him with \"Oh, no, Messer Firenzuola, please go on\nagain; it's SO charming!\" while, as if by accident, Madonna Selvaggia's\nmoonlike bosom would once more slip out its heavenly silver, perceiving\nwhich, Messer Firenzuola would open his manuscript again and proceed\nwith his sweet learning.\n\nHappy Firenzuola!  Oh, days that are no more!\n\nBy selecting for his illustrations one feature from one lady and\nanother from another, Messer Firenzuola builds up an ideal of the\nBeautiful Woman, which, were she to be possible, would probably be as\nfaultily faultless as the Perfect Woman, were she possible.\n\nMoreover, much about the same time as Firenzuola was writing,\nBotticelli's blonde, angular, retrousse women were breaking every one\nof that beauty-master's canons, perfect in beauty none the less; and\nlovers then, and perhaps particularly now, have found the perfect\nbeauty in faces to which Messer Firenzuola would have denied the name\nof face at all, by virtue of a quality which indeed he has tabulated,\nbut which is far too elusive and undefinable, too spiritual for him\ntruly to have understood,--a quality which nowadays we are tardily\nrecognising as the first and last of all beauty, either of nature or\nart,--the supreme, truly divine, because materialistically\nunaccountable, quality of Charm!\n\n\"Beauty that makes holy earth and heaven May have faults from head to\nfeet.\"\n\nO loveliest and best-loved face that ever hallowed the eyes that now\nseek for you in vain!  Such was your strange lunar magic, such the\nlight not even death could dim. And such may be the loveliest and\nbest-loved face for you who are reading these pages,--faces little\nunderstood on earth because they belong to heaven.\n\nThere is indeed only one law of beauty on which we may rely,--that it\ninvariably breaks all the laws laid down for it by the professors of\naesthetics.  All the beauty that has ever been in the world has broken\nthe laws of all previous beauty, and unwillingly dictated laws to the\nbeauty that succeeded it,--laws which that beauty has no less\nspiritedly broken, to prove in turn dictator to its successor.\n\nThe immortal sculptors, painters, and poets have always done exactly\nwhat their critics forbade them to do.  The obedient in art are always\nthe forgotten.\n\nLikewise beautiful women have always been a law unto themselves. Who\ncould have prophesied in what way any of these inspired law-breakers\nwould break the law, what new type of perfect imperfection they would\ncreate?\n\nSo we return to the Perfect Woman, having gained this much knowledge of\nher,--that her perfection is nothing more or less than her unique,\nindividual, charming imperfection, and that she is simply the woman we\nlove and who is fool enough to love us.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VI\n\nIN WHICH THE AUTHOR ANTICIPATES DISCONTENT ON THE PART OF HIS READER\n\n\"But come,\" I imagine some reader complaining, \"isn't it high time for\nsomething to happen?\"  No doubt it is, but what am I to do?  I am no\nless discontented.  Is it not even more to my interest than to the\nreader's for something to happen?  Here have I been tramping along\nsince breakfast-time, and now it is late in the afternoon, but never a\nfeather of her dove's wings, never a flutter of her angel's robes have\nI seen.  It is disheartening, for one naturally expects to find\nanything we seek a few minutes after starting out to seek it, and I\nconfess that I expected to find my golden mistress within a very few\nhours of leaving home. However, had that been the case, there would\nhave been no story, as the novelists say, and I trust, as he goes on,\nthe reader may feel with me that that would have been a pity. Besides,\nwith that prevision given to an author, I am strongly of opinion that\nsomething will happen before long.  And if the worst comes to the\nworst, there is always that story of my First Love wherewith to fill\nthe time.  Meanwhile I am approaching a decorative old Surrey town,\nlittle more than a cluster of ripe old inns, to one of which I have\nmuch pleasure in inviting the reader to dinner.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VII\n\nPRANDIAL\n\nDinner!\n\nIs there a more beautiful word in the language?\n\nDinner!\n\nLet the beautiful word come as a refrain to and fro this chapter.\n\nDinner!\n\nJust eating and drinking, nothing more, but so much!\n\nDrinking, indeed, has had its laureates. Yet would I offer my mite of\nprose in its honour.  And when I say \"drinking,\" I speak not of\nsmuggled gin or of brandy bottles held fiercely by the neck till they\nare empty.\n\nNay, but of that lonely glass in the social solitude of the\ntavern,--alone, but not alone, for the glass is sure to bring a dream\nto bear it company, and it is a poor dream that cannot raise a song.\nAnd what greater felicity than to be alone in a tavern with your last\nnew song, just born and yet still a tingling part of you.\n\nDrinking has indeed been sung, but why, I have heard it asked, have we\nno \"Eating Songs?\"--for eating is, surely, a fine pleasure. Many\npractise it already, and it is becoming more general every day.\n\nI speak not of the finicking joy of the gourmet, but the joy of an\nhonest appetite in ecstasy, the elemental joy of absorbing quantities\nof fresh simple food,--mere roast lamb, new potatoes, and peas of\nliving green.\n\nIt is, indeed, an absorbing pleasure.  It needs all our attention.  You\nmust eat as you kiss, so exacting are the joys of the mouth,--talking,\nfor example.  The quiet eye may be allowed to participate, and\nsometimes the ear, where the music is played upon a violin, and that a\nStradivarius.  A well-kept lawn, with six-hundred-years-old cedars and\na twenty-feet yew hedge, will add distinction to the meal.  Nor should\none ever eat without a seventeenth-century poet in an old yellow-leaved\nedition upon the table, not to be read, of course, any more than the\nflowers are to be eaten, but just to make music of association very\nsoftly to our thoughts.\n\nSome diners have wine too upon the table, and in the pauses of thinking\nwhat a divine mystery dinner is, they eat.\n\nFor dinner IS a mystery,--a mystery of which even the greatest chef\nknows but little, as a poet knows not,\n\n  \"with all his lore,\n  Wherefore he sang,\n  or whence the mandate sped.\"\n\n\n\"Even our digestion is governed by angels,\" said Blake; and if you will\nresist the trivial inclination to substitute \"bad angels,\" is there\nreally any greater mystery than the process by which beef is turned\ninto brains, and beer into beauty?  Every beautiful woman we see has\nbeen made out of beefsteaks.  It is a solemn thought,--and the finest\npoem that was ever written came out of a grey pulpy mass such as we\nmake brain sauce of.\n\nAnd with these grave thoughts for grace let us sit down to dinner.\n\nDinner!\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VIII\n\nSTILL PRANDIAL\n\nWhat wine shall we have?  I confess I am no judge of wines, except when\nthey are bad.  To-night I feel inclined to allow my choice to be\ndirected by sentiment; and as we are on so pretty a pilgrimage, would\nit not be appropriate to drink Liebfraumilch?\n\nHock is full of fancy, and all wines are by their very nature full of\nreminiscence, the golden tears and red blood of summers that are gone.\n\nForgive me, therefore, if I grow reminiscent. Indeed, I fear that the\nhour for the story of my First Love has come.  But first, notice the\nwaitress.  I confess, whether beautiful or plain,--not too\nplain,--women who earn their own living have a peculiar attraction for\nme.\n\nI hope the Golden Girl will not turn out to be a duchess.  As old\nCampion sings,--\n\n  \"I care not for those ladies\n        Who must be wooed and prayed;\n  Give me kind Amaryllis,\n        The wanton country-maid.\"\n\n\nTown-maids too of the same pattern. Whether in town or country, give me\nthe girls that work.  The Girls That Work!  But evidently it is high\ntime woe began a new chapter.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER IX\n\nTHE LEGEND OF HEBE, OR THE HEAVENLY HOUSEMAID\n\nYes, I blush to admit it, my First Love was a housemaid.  So was she\nknown on this dull earth of ours, but in heaven--in the heaven of my\nimagination, at all events--she was, of course, a goddess.  How she\nmanaged to keep her disguise I never could understand. To me she was so\nobviously dea certe.  The nimbus was so apparent.  Yet no one seemed to\nsee it but me.  I have heard her scolded as though she were any\nordinary earthly housemaid, and I have seen the butcher's boy trying to\nflirt with her without a touch of reverence.\n\nMaybe I understood because I saw her in that early hour of the morning\nwhen even the stony Memnon sings, in that mystical light of the young\nday when divine exiled things, condemned to rough bondage through the\nnoon, are for a short magical hour their own celestial selves, their\nunearthly glory as yet unhidden by any earthly disguise.\n\nNeither fairies nor fauns, dryads nor nymphs of the forest pools, have\nreally passed away from the world.  You have only to get up early\nenough to meet them in the meadows.  They rarely venture abroad after\nsix.  All day long they hide in uncouth enchanted forms.  They change\nmaybe to a field of turnips, and I have seen a farmer priding himself\non a flock of sheep that I knew were really a most merry company of\ndryads and fauns in disguise.  I had but to make the sign of the cross,\nsprinkle some holy water upon them, and call them by their sweet secret\nnames, and the whole rout had been off to the woods, with mad gambol\nand song, before the eyes of the astonished farmer.\n\nIt was so with Hebe.  She was really a little gold-haired blue-eyed\ndryad, whose true home was a wild white cherry-tree that grew in some\nscattered woodland behind the old country-house of my boyhood.  In\nspring-time how that naughty tree used to flash its silver nakedness of\nblossom for miles across the furze and scattered birches!\n\nI might have known it was Hebe.\n\nAlas! it no longer bares its bosom with so dazzling a prodigality, for\nit is many a day since it was uprooted.  The little dryad long since\nfled away weeping,--fled away, said evil tongues, fled away to the town.\n\nWell do I remember our last meeting. Returning home one evening, I met\nher at the lodge-gate hurrying away.  Our loves had been discovered,\nand my mother had shuddered to think that so pagan a thing had lived so\nlong in a Christian house.  I vowed--ah! what did I not vow?--and then\nwe stole sadly together to comfort our aching hearts under cover of the\nwoodland.  For the last time the wild cherry-tree bloomed,--wonderful\nblossom, glittering with tears, and gloriously radiant with stormy\nlights of wild passion and wilder hopes.\n\nMy faith lived valiantly till the next spring.  It was Hebe who was\nfaithless. The cherry-tree was dead, for its dryad had gone,--fled,\nsaid evil tongues, fled away to the town!\n\nBut as yet, in the time to which my thoughts return, our sweet secret\nmornings were known only to ourselves.  It was my custom then to rise\nearly, to read Latin authors,--thanks to Hebe, still unread.  I used to\nlight my fire and make tea for myself, till one rapturous morning I\ndiscovered that Hebe was fond of rising early too, and that she would\nlike to light my fire and make my tea.  After a time she began to\nsweeten it for me.  And then she would sit on my knee, and we would\ntranslate Catullus together,--into English kisses; for she was\ncuriously interested in the learned tongue.\n\nHow lovely she used to look with the morning sun turning her hair to\ngolden mist, and dancing in the blue deeps of her eyes; and once when\nby chance she had forgotten to fasten her gown, I caught glimpses of a\nbosom that was like two happy handfuls of wonderful white cherries...\n\nShe wore a marvellous little printed gown. And here I may say that I\nhave never to this day understood objections which were afterwards\nraised against my early attachment to print.  The only legitimate\nattachment to print stuff, I was told, was to print stuff in the form\nof blouse, tennis, or boating costume. Yet, thought I, I would rather\nsmuggle one of those little print gowns into my berth than all the\nsilks a sea-faring friend of mine takes the trouble to smuggle from far\nCathay.  However, every one to his taste; for me,\n\n  No silken madam, by your leave,\n       Though wondrous, wondrous she be,\n  Can lure this heart--upon my sleeve--\n       From little pink-print Hebe.\n\n\nFor I found beneath that pretty print such a heart as seldom beats\nbeneath your satin, warm and wild as a bird's.  I used to put my ear to\nit sometimes to listen if it beat right.  Ah, reader, it was like\nputting your ear to the gate of heaven.\n\nAnd once I made a song for her, which ran like this:--\n\n  There grew twin apples high on a bough\n       Within an orchard fair;\n  The tree was all of gold, I vow,\n       And the apples of silver were.\n\n  And whoso kisseth those apples high,\n       Who kisseth once is a king,\n  Who kisseth twice shall never die,\n       Who kisseth thrice--oh, were it I!--\n             May ask for anything.\n\n\nHebe blushed, and for answer whispered something too sweet to tell.\n\n\n\"Dear little head sunning over with curls,\" were I to meet you now,\nwhat would happen?  Ah! to meet you now were too painfully to measure\nthe remnant of my youth.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER X\n\nAGAIN ON FOOT--THE GIRLS THAT NEVER CAN BE MINE\n\nNext morning I was afoot early, bent on my quest in right good earnest;\nfor I had a remorseful feeling that I had not been sufficiently\ndiligent the day before, had spent too much time in dreaming and\nmoralising, in which opinion I am afraid the reader will agree.\n\nSo I was up and out of the town while as yet most of the inhabitants\nwere in the throes of getting up.  Somewhere too SHE, the Golden One,\nthe White Woman, was drowsily tossing the night-clothes from her limbs\nand rubbing her sleepy eyes. William Morris's lovely song came into my\nmind,--\n\n  'And midst them all, perchance, my love\n  Is waking, and doth gently move\n  And stretch her soft arms out to me,\n  Forgetting thousand leagues of sea.\"\n\n\nPerhaps she was in the very town I was leaving behind.  Perhaps we had\nslept within a few houses of each other.  Who could tell?\n\n\nLooking back at the old town, with its one steep street climbing the\nwhite face of the chalk hill, I remembered what wonderful exotic women\nThomas Hardy had found eating their hearts out behind the windows of\ndull country high streets, through which hung waving no banners of\nromance, outwardly as unpromising of adventure as the windows of the\ntown I had left.  And then turning my steps across a wide common, which\nran with gorse and whortleberry bushes away on every side to distant\nhilly horizons, swarthy with pines, and dotted here and there with\nstone granges and white villages, I thought of all the women within\nthat circle, any one of whom might prove the woman I sought,--from\nmilkmaids crossing the meadows, their strong shoulders straining with\nthe weight of heavy pails, to fine ladies dying of ennui in their\ncountry-houses; pretty farmers' daughters surreptitiously reading\nnovels, and longing for London and \"life;\" passionate young farmers'\nwives already weary of their doltish lords; bright-eyed bar-maids\nburied alive in country inns, and wondering \"whatever possessed them\"\nto leave Manchester,--for bar-maids seem always to come from\nManchester,--all longing modestly, said I, to set eyes on a man like\nme, a man of romance, a man of feeling, a man, if you like, to run away\nwith.\n\n\nMy heart flooded over with tender pity for these poor sweet\nwomen--though perhaps chiefly for my own sad lot in not encountering\nthem,--and I conceived a great comprehensive love-poem to be entitled\n\"The Girls that never can be Mine.\" Perhaps before the end of our tramp\ntogether, I shall have a few verses of it to submit to the elegant\ntaste of the reader, but at present I have not advanced beyond the\ntitle.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XI\n\nAN OLD MAN OF THE HILLS, AND THE SCHOOLMASTER'S STORY\n\nWhile occupying myself with these no doubt wanton reflections on the\nunfair division of opportunities in human life, I was leisurely\ncrossing the common, and presently I came up with a pedestrian who,\nthough I had little suspected it as I caught sight of him ahead, was\ndestined by a kind providence to make more entertaining talk for me in\nhalf an hour than most people provide in a lifetime.\n\nHe was an oldish man, turned sixty, one would say, and belonging, to\njudge from his dress and general appearance, to what one might call the\nupper labouring class.  He wore a decent square felt hat, a shabby\nrespectable overcoat, a workman's knitted waistcoat, and workman's\ncorduroys, and he carried an umbrella. His upper part might have\nbelonged to a small well-to-do tradesman, while his lower bore marks of\nrecent bricklaying. Without its being remarkable, he had what one calls\na good face, somewhat aquiline in character, with a refined forehead\nand nose.\n\nHis cheeks were shaved, and his whitening beard and moustache were worn\nsomewhat after the fashion of Charles Dickens.  This gave a slight\ntouch of severity to a face that was full of quiet strength.\n\nPassing the time of day to each other, we were soon in conversation, I\nasking him this and that question about the neighbouring country-side,\nof which I gathered he was an old inhabitant.\n\n\"Yes,\" he said presently, \"I was the first to put stick or stone on\nWhortleberry Common yonder.  Fifteen years ago I built my own wood\ncottage there, and now I'm rebuilding it of good Surrey stone.\"\n\n\"Do you mean that you are building it yourself, with your own hands, no\none to help you?\" I asked.\n\n\"Not so much as to carry a pail of water,\" he replied.  \"I'm my own\ncontractor, my own carpenter, and my own bricklayer, and I shall be\nsixty-seven come Michaelmas,\" he added, by no means irrelevantly.\n\nThere was pride in his voice,--pardonable pride, I thought, for who of\nus would not be proud to be able to build his own house from floor to\nchimney?\n\n\"Sixty-seven,--a man can see and do a good deal in that time,\" I said,\nnot flattering myself on the originality of the remark, but desiring to\nset him talking.  In the country, as elsewhere, we must forego\nprofundity if we wish to be understood.\n\n\"Yes, sir,\" he said, \"I have been about a good deal in my time.  I have\nseen pretty well all of the world there is to see, and sailed as far as\nship could take me.\"\n\n\"Indeed, you have been a sailor too?\"\n\n\"Twenty-two thousand miles of sea,\" he continued, without directly\nanswering my remark.  \"Yes, Vancouver's about as far as any vessel need\nwant to go; and then I have caught seals off the coast of Labrador, and\nwalked my way through the raspberry plains at the back of the White\nMountains.\"\n\n\"Vancouver,\" \"Labrador,\" \"The White Mountains,\" the very names, thus\ncasually mentioned on a Surrey heath, seemed full of the sounding sea.\nLike talismans they whisked one away to strange lands, across vast\ndistances of space imagination refused to span.  Strange to think that\nthe shabby little man at my side had them all fast locked, pictures\nupon pictures, in his brain, and as we were talking was back again in\ngoodness knows what remote latitude.\n\nI kept looking at him and saying, \"Twenty-two thousand miles of sea!\nsixty-seven! and builds his own cottage!\"\n\nIn addition to all this he had found time to be twenty-one years a\npoliceman, and to beget and rear successfully twelve children. He was\nnow, I gathered, living partly on his pension, and spoke of this\ndaughter married, this daughter in service here, and that daughter in\nservice there, one son settled in London and another in the States,\nwith something of a patriarchal pride, with the independent air too of\na man who could honestly say to himself that, with few advantages from\nfortune, having had, so to say, to work his passage, every foot and\nhour of it, across those twenty-two thousand miles and those\nsixty-seven years, he had made a thoroughly creditable job of his life.\n\nAs we walked along I caught glimpses in his vivid and ever-varying talk\nof the qualities that had made his success possible. They are always\nthe same qualities!\n\nA little pile of half-hewn stones, the remains of a ruined wall,\nscattered by the roadside caught his eye.\n\n\"I've seen the time when I wouldn't have left them stones lying out\nthere,\" he said, and presently, \"Why, God bless you, I've made my own\nboots before to-day.  Give me the tops and I'll soon rig up a pair\nstill.\"\n\nAnd with all his success, and his evident satisfaction with his lot,\nthe man was neither a prig nor a teetotaller.  He had probably seen too\nmuch of the world to be either.  Yet he had, he said, been too busy all\nhis life to spend much time in public-houses, as we drank a pint of ale\ntogether in the inn which stood at the end of the common.\n\n\"No, it's all well enough in its way, but it swallows time,\" he\nremarked.  \"You see, my wife and I have our own pin at home, and when\nI'm a bit tired, I just draw a glass for myself, and smoke a pipe, and\nthere's no time wasted coming and going, and drinking first with this\nand then with the other.\"\n\nA little way past the inn we came upon a notice-board whereon the lord\nof the manor warned all wayfarers against trespassing on the common by\nmaking encampments, lighting fires or cutting firewood thereon, and to\nthis fortunate circumstance I owe the most interesting story my\ncompanion had to tell.\n\nWe had mentioned the lord of the manor as we crossed the common, and\nthe notice-board brought him once more to the old man's mind.\n\n\"Poor gentleman!\" he said, pointing to the board as though it was the\nlord of the manor himself standing there, \"I shouldn't like to have had\nthe trouble he's had on my shoulders.\"\n\n\"Indeed?\" I said interrogatively.\n\n\"Well, you see, sir,\" he continued, instinctively lowering his voice to\na confidential impressiveness, \"he married an actress; a noble lady too\nshe was, a fine dashing merry lady as ever you saw.  All went well for\na time, and then it suddenly got whispered about that she and the\nvillage schoolmaster were meeting each other at nights, in the\nmeadow-bottom at the end of her own park.  It lies over that way,--I\ncould take you to the very place.  The schoolmaster was a noble-looking\nyoung man too, a devil-me-care blade of a fellow, with a turn for\npoetry, they said, and a merry man too, and much in request for a song\nat The Moonrakers of an evening. Many 's the night I've heard the\nwindows rattling with the good company gathered round him.  Yes, he was\na noble-looking man, a noble-looking man,\" he repeated wistfully, and\nwith an evident sympathy for the lovers which, I need hardly say, won\nmy heart.\n\n\"But how, I wonder, did they come to know each other?\" I interrupted,\nanxious to learn all I could, even if I had to ask stupid questions to\nlearn it.\n\n\"Well, of course, no one can say how these things come about. She was\nthe lady of the manor and the patroness of his school; and then, as I\nsay, he was a very noble-looking man, and probably took her fancy; and,\nsir, whenever some women set their hearts on a man there's no stopping\nthem. Have him they will, whatever happens. They can't help it, poor\nthings!  It's just a freak of nature.\"\n\n\"Well, and how was it found out?\" I again jogged him.\n\n\"One of Sir William's keepers played the spy on them.  He spread it all\nover the place how he had seen them on moonlight nights sitting\ntogether in the dingle, drinking champagne, and laughing and talking as\nmerry as you please; and, of course, it came in time to Sir William--\"\n\n\"You see that green lane there,\" he broke off, pointing to a romantic\npath winding along the heath side; \"it was along there he used to go of\na night to meet her after every one was in bed; and when it all came\nout there was a regular cartload of bottles found there.  The squire\nhad them all broken up, but the pieces are there to this day.\n\n\"Yes,\" he again proceeded, \"it hit Sir William very hard. He's never\nbeen the same man since.\"\n\nI am afraid that my sympathies were less with Sir William than better\nregulated sympathies would have been.  I confess that my imagination\nwas more occupied with that picture of the two lovers making merry\ntogether in the moonlit dingle.\n\nIs it not, indeed, a fascinating little story, with its piquant\ncontrasts and its wild love-at-all-costs?  And how many such stories\nare hidden about the country, lying carelessly in rustic memories, if\none only knew where to find them!\n\nAt this point my companion left me, and I--well, I confess that I\nretraced my steps to the common and rambled up that green lane, along\nwhich the romantic schoolmaster used to steal in the moonlight to the\nwarm arms of his love.  How eagerly he had trodden the very turf I was\ntreading,--we never know at what moment we are treading sacred earth!\nBut for that old man, I had passed along this path without a thrill.\nHad I not but an hour ago stood upon this very common, vainly, so it\nseemed, invoking the spirits of passion and romance, and the grim old\ncommon had never made a sign.  And now I stood in the very dingle where\nthey had so often and so wildly met; and it was all gone, quite gone\naway for ever.  The hours that had seemed so real, the kisses that had\nseemed like to last for ever, the vows, the tears, all now as if they\nhad never been, gone on the four winds, lost in the abysses of time and\nspace.\n\nAnd to think of all the thousands and thousands of lovers who had loved\nno less wildly and tenderly, made sweet these lanes with their vows,\nmade green these meadows with their feet; and they, too, all gone,\ntheir bright eyes fallen to dust, their sweet voices for ever put to\nsilence.\n\nTo which I would add, for the benefit of the profane, that I sought in\nvain for those broken bottles.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XII\n\nTHE TRUTH ABOUT THE GIPSIES\n\nI felt lonely after losing my companion, and I met nobody to take his\nplace.  In fact, for a couple of hours I met nothing worth mentioning,\nmale or female, with the exception of a gipsy caravan, which I suppose\nwas both; but it was a poor show. Borrow would have blushed for it.  In\nfact, it is my humble opinion that the gipsies have been overdone, just\nas the Alps have been over-climbed.  I have no great desire to see\nSwitzerland, for I am sure the Alps must be greasy with being climbed.\n\nBesides, the Alps and the gipsies, in common with waterfalls and ruined\ncastles, belong to the ready-made operatic poetry of the world, from\nwhich the last thrill has long since departed.  They are, so to say,\npublic poetry, the public property of the emotions, and no longer touch\nthe private heart or stir the private imagination.  Our fathers felt so\nmuch about them that there is nothing left for us to feel.  They are as\na rose whose fragrance has been exhausted by greedy and indiscriminate\nsmelling.  I would rather find a little Surrey common for myself and\nidle about it a summer day, with the other geese and donkeys, than\nclimb the tallest Alp.\n\nMost gipsies are merely tenth-rate provincial companies, travelling\nwith and villainously travestying Borrow's great pieces of \"Lavengro\"\nand \"Romany Rye.\"  Dirty, ill-looking, scowling men; dirty, slovenly,\nand wickedly ugly women; children to match, snarling, filthy little\ncurs, with a ready beggar's whine on occasion.  A gipsy encampment\nto-day is little more than a moving slum, a scab of squalor on the fair\nface of the countryside.\n\nBut there was one little trifle of an incident that touched me as I\npassed this particular caravan.  Evidently one of the vans had come to\ngrief, and several men of the party were making a great show of\nrepairing it.  After I had run the gauntlet of the begging children,\nand was just out of ear-shot of the group, I turned round to survey it\nfrom a distance.  It was encamped on a slight rise of the undulating\nroad, and from where I stood tents and vans and men were clearly\nsilhouetted against the sky.  The road ran through and a little higher\nthan the encampment, which occupied both sides of it.  Presently the\nfigure of a young man separated itself from the rest, stept up on to\nthe smooth road, and standing in the middle of it, in an absorbed\nattitude, began to make a movement with his hands as though winding\nstring round a top.  That in fact was his occupation, and for the next\nfive minutes he kept thus winding the cord, flinging the top to the\nground, and intently bending down to catch it on his hand, none of the\nothers, not even the children, taking the slightest notice of him,--he\nentirely alone there with his poor little pleasure. There seemed to me\npathos in his loneliness.  Had some one spun the top with him, it would\nhave vanished; and presently, no doubt at the bidding of an oath I\ncould not hear, he hurriedly thrust the top into his pocket, and once\nmore joined the straining group of men.  The snatched pleasure must be\nput by at the call of reality; the world and its work must rush in upon\nhis dream.  I have often thought about the top and its spinner, as I\nhave noted the absorbed faces of other people's pleasures in the\nstreets,--two lovers passing along the crowded Strand with eyes only\nfor each other; a student deep in his book in the corner of an omnibus;\na young mother glowing over the child in her arms; the wild-eyed\nmusician dreamily treading on everybody's toes, and begging nobody's\npardon; the pretty little Gaiety Girl hurrying to rehearsal with no\nthought but of her own sweet self and whether there will be a letter\nfrom Harry at the stage-door,--yes, if we are alone in our griefs, we\nare no less alone in our pleasures.  We spin our tops as in an\nenchanted circle, and no one sees or heeds save ourselves,--as how\nshould they with their own tops to spin? Happy indeed is he, who has\nhis top and cares still to spin it; for to be tired of our tops is to\nbe tired of life, saith the preacher.\n\nAs the young gipsy's little holiday came to an end, I turned with a\nsigh upon my way; and here, while still on the subject, may I remark on\nthe curious fact that probably Borrow has lived and died without a\nsingle gipsy having heard of him, just as the expertest anglers know\nnothing of Izaak Walton.\n\nHas the British soldier, one wonders, yet discovered Rudyard Kipling,\nor is the Wessex peasant aware of Thomas Hardy? It is odd to think that\nthe last people to read such authors are the very people they most\nconcern.  For you might spend your life, say, in studying the London\nstreet boy, and write never so movingly and humourously about him, yet\nwould he never know your name; and though Whitechapel makes novelists,\nit does so without knowing it,--makes them to be read in Mayfair,--just\nas it never wears the dainty hats and gowns its weary little milliners\nand seamstresses make through the day and night.  It is Capital and\nLabour over again, for in literature also we reap in gladness what\nothers have sown in tears.\n\nAnd now, after these admirable reflections, I am about to make such\n\"art\" as I can of another man's tragedy, as will appear in the next\nchapter.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XIII\n\nA STRANGE WEDDING\n\nMy moralisings were cut short by my entering a village, and, it being\nabout the hour of noon, finding myself in the thick of a village\nwedding.\n\nUndoubtedly the nicest way to get married is on the sly, and indeed it\nis at present becoming quite fashionable.  Many young couples of my\nacquaintance, who have had no other reason for concealing the fact\nbeyond their own whim, have thus slipped off without saying a word to\nanybody, and returned full-blown housekeepers, with \"at home\" days of\ntheir own, and everything else like real married people,--for, as said\nan old lady to me, \"one can never be sure of married people nowadays\nunless you have been at the wedding.\"\n\nMy friend George Muncaster, who does everything charmingly different\nfrom any one else, hit upon one of the quaintest plans for his\nmarriage.  It was simple, and some may say prosaic enough.  His days\nbeing spent at a great office in the city, he got leave of absence for\na couple of hours, met his wife, went with her to the registrar's,\nreturned to his office, worked the rest of the day as usual, and then\nwent to his new home to find his wife and dinner awaiting him,--all\njust as it was going to be every night for so many happy years.\nProsaic, you say! Not your idea of poetry, perhaps, but, after a new\nand growing fashion in poetry, truly poetic.  George Muncaster's\nmarriage is a type of the new poetry, the poetry of essentials. The old\npoetry, as exemplified in the old-fashioned marriage, is a poetry of\nexternals, and certainly it has the advantage of picturesqueness.\n\nThere is perhaps more to be said for it than that.  Indeed, if I were\never to get married, I am at a loss to know which way I should\nchoose,--George Muncaster's way or the old merry fashion, with the rice\nand the old shoes and the orange-blossom.  No doubt the old cheery\npublicity is a little embarrassing to the two most concerned, and the\nold marriage customs, the singing of the bride and bridegroom to their\nnuptial couch, the frank jests, the country horse-play, must have\nfretted the souls of many a lover before Shelley, who, it will be\nremembered, resented the choral celebrations of his Scotch landlord and\nfriends by appearing at his bedroom door with a brace of pistols.\n\nHow like Shelley!  The Scotch landlord meant well, we may be sure, and\na very small pinch of humour, or even mere ordinary humanity, as\ndistinct from humanitarianism, would have taken in the situation. Of\ncourse Shelley's mind was full of the sanctity of the moment, and\nindignant that \"the hour for which the years did sigh\" should thus be\nbroken in upon by vulgar revelry; but while we may sympathise with his\nview, and admit to the full the sacredness, not to say the solemnity,\nof the marriage ceremony, yet it is to be hoped that it still retains a\nnaturally mirthful side, of which such public merriment is but the\ncrude expression.\n\nWith all its sweet and mystical significance, surely the prevailing\nfeeling in the hearts of bride and bridegroom is, or should be, that of\nhappiness,--happiness bubbling and dancing, all sunny ripples from\nheart to heart.\n\nSurely they can spare a little of it, just one day's sight of it, to a\nless happy world,--a world long since married and done for, and with\nlittle happiness in it save the spectacle of other people's happiness.\nIt is good for us to see happy people, good for the symbols of\nhappiness to be carried high amidst us on occasion; for if they serve\nno other purpose, they inspire in us the hope that we too may some day\nbe happy, or remind our discontented hearts that we have been.\n\nIf it were only for the sake of those quaint old women for whom life\nwould be entirely robbed of interest were it not for other people's\nweddings and funerals, one feels the public ceremony of marriage a sort\nof public duty, the happiness tax, so to say, due to the somewhat\nimpoverished revenues of public happiness.  Other forms of happiness\nare taxed; why not marriage?\n\nIn a village, particularly, two people who robbed the community of its\nperquisites in this respect would be looked upon as \"enemies of the\npeople,\" and their joint life would begin under a social ban which it\nwould cost much subsequent hospitality to remove.  The dramatic\ninstinct to which the life of towns is necessarily unfavourable, is\nkept alive in the country by the smallness of the stage and the fewness\nof the actors.  A village is an organism, conscious of its several\nparts, as a town is not.\n\nIn a village everybody is a public man.  The great events of his life\nare of public as well as private significance, appropriately,\ntherefore, invested with public ceremonial.  Thus used to living in the\npublic eye, the actors carry off their parts at weddings and other\ndramatic ceremonials, with more spirit than is easy to a townsman, who\nis naturally made self-conscious by being suddenly called upon to fill\nfor a day a public position for which he has had no training.  That no\ndoubt is the real reason for the growth of quiet marriages; and the\ndesire for them, I suspect, comes first from the man, for there are few\nwomen who at heart do not prefer the old histrionic display.\n\nHowever, the village wedding at which I suddenly found myself a\nspectator was, for a village, a singularly quiet one.  There was no\nbell-ringing, and there were no bridesmaids. The bride drove up quietly\nwith her father, and there was a subdued note even in the murmur of\nrecognition which ran along the villagers as they stood in groups near\nthe church porch.  There was an absence of the usual hilarity which\nstruck me.  One might almost have said that there was a quite ominous\nsilence.\n\nSeating myself in a corner of the transept where I could see all and be\nlittle seen, I with the rest awaited the coming of the overdue\nbridegroom.  Meanwhile the usual buzzing and bobbing of heads went on\namongst the usual little group near the foot of the altar.  Now and\nthen one caught a glisten of tears through a widow's veil, and the\nlittle bride, dressed quietly in grey, talked with the usual nervous\ngaiety to her girl friends, and made the usual whispered confidences\nabout her trousseau.  The father, in occasional conversation with one\nand another, appeared to be avoiding the subject with the usual\nself-conscious solemnity, and occasionally he looked, somewhat\nanxiously, I thought, towards the church door.  The bridegroom did not\nkeep us waiting long,--I noticed that he had a rather delicate sad\nface,--and presently the service began.\n\nI don't know myself what getting married must feel like, but it cannot\nbe much more exciting than watching other people getting married.\nProbably the spectators are more conscious of the impressive meaning of\nit all than the brave young people themselves. I say brave, for I am\nalways struck by the courage of the two who thus gaily leap into the\ngulf of the unknown together, thus join hands over the inevitable, and\nput their signatures to the irrevocable.  Indeed, I always get\nsomething like a palpitation of the heart just before the priest utters\nthose final fateful words, \"I declare you man and--wife.\" Half a second\nbefore you were still free, half a second after you are bound for the\nterm of your natural life.  Half a second before you had only to dash\nthe book from the priest's hands, and put your hand over his mouth, and\nthough thus giddily swinging on the brink of the precipice, you are\nsaved.  Half a second after\n\n  Not all the king's horses and all the king's men\n    Can make you a bachelor ever again.\n\n\nIt is the knife-edge moment 'twixt time and eternity.\n\nAnd, curiously enough, while my thoughts were thus running on towards\nthe rapids of that swirling moment, the very thing happened which I had\noften imagined might happen to myself. Suddenly, with a sob, the\nbridegroom covered his face with his hands, and crying, \"I cannot!  I\ncannot!\" hurriedly left the church, tears streaming down his cheeks, to\nthe complete dismay of the sad little group at the altar, and the\nconsternation of all present.\n\n\"Poor young man!  I thought he would never go through with it,\" said an\nold woman half to herself, who was sitting near me.  I involuntarily\nlooked my desire of explanation.\n\n\"Well, you see,\" she said, \"he had been married before.  His first wife\ndied four years ago, and he loved her beyond all heaven and earth.\"\n\nThat evening, I afterwards heard, the young bridegroom's body was found\nby some boys as they went to bathe in the river.  As I recalled once\nmore that sad yearning face, and heard again that terrible \"I cannot!\nI cannot!\"  I thought of Heine's son of Asra, who loved the Sultan's\ndaughter.\n\n\"What is thy name, slave?\" asked the princess, \"and what thy race and\nbirthplace?\"\n\n\"My name,\" the young slave answered, \"is Mahomet.  I come from Yemen.\nMy race is that of Asra, and when we love, we die.\"\n\nAnd likewise a voice kept saying in my heart, \"If ever you find your\nGolden Bride, be sure she will die.\"\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XIV\n\nTHE MYSTERIOUS PETTICOAT\n\nThe sad thoughts with which this incident naturally left me were at\nlength and suddenly dispersed, as sad thoughts not infrequently are, by\na petticoat.  When I say petticoat, I use the word in its literal\nsense, not colloquially as a metaphor for its usual wearer, meaning\nthereby a dainty feminine undergarment seen only by men on rainy days,\nand one might add washing-days. It was indeed to the fortunate accident\nof its being washing-day at the pretty cottage near which in the course\nof my morning wanderings I had set me down to rest, that I owed the\nsight of the petticoat in question.\n\nBut first allow me to describe a little more fully my surroundings at\nthe moment.  Not indeed that I can hope to put into words the charm of\nthose embowered cottages, like nests in the armpits of great trees,\ntucked snugly in the hollows of those narrow, winding, almost\nsubterranean lanes which burrow their way beneath the warm-hearted\nSurrey woodlands.\n\nNothing can be straighter and smoother than a Surrey road--when it is\non the king's business; then it is a high-road and behaves accordingly:\nbut a Surrey bye-road is the most whimsical companion in the world.  It\nis like a sheep-dog, always running backwards and forwards, poking into\nthe most out-of-the-way corners, now climbing at a run some steep\nhummock of the down, and now leisurely going miles about to escape an\nant-hill; and all the time (here, by the way, ends the sheep-dog) it is\nstopping to gossip with rillets vagabond as itself, or loitering to\nbedeck itself with flowers.  It seems as innocent of a destination as a\nboy on an errand; but, after taking at least six times as long as any\nother road in the kingdom for its amount of work, you usually find it\ndip down of a sudden into some lovely natural cul-de-sac, a\nmeadow-bottom surrounded by trees, with a stream spreading itself in\nfantastic silver shallows through its midst, and a cottage half hidden\nat the end. Had the lane been going to some great house, it would have\nmade more haste, we may be sure.\n\nThe lane I had been following had finally dropped me down at something\nof a run upon just such a scene.  The cottage, built substantially of\ngrey stone, stood upon the side of the slope, and a broad strip of\ngarden, half cultivated and half wild, began near the house with\ncabbages, and ended in a jungle of giant bulrushes as it touched the\nstream. Golden patches of ragwort blazed here and there among a tangled\nmass of no doubt worthier herbage,--such even in nature is the power of\ngold,--and there were the usual birds.\n\nHowever, my business is with the week's washing, which in various\nshades of white, with occasional patches of scarlet, fluttered\nfantastically across a space of the garden, thereby giving unmistakable\nwitness to human inhabitants, male and female.\n\nAs I lounged upon the green bank, I lazily watched these parodies of\nhumanity as they were tossed hither and thither with humourous\nindignity by the breeze, remarking to myself on the quaint\nshamelessness with which we thus expose to the public view garments\nwhich at other times we are at such bashful pains to conceal.  And thus\nphilosophising, like a much greater philosopher, upon clothes, I found\nmyself involuntarily deducing the cottage family from the family\nwashing.  I soon decided that there must be at least one woman say of\nthe age of fifty, one young woman, one little child, sex doubtful, and\none man probably young. Further than this it was impossible to\nconjecture.  Thus I made the rough guess that a young man and his wife,\na child, and a mother-in-law were among the inhabitants of this idyllic\ncottage.\n\nBut the clothes-line presented charming evidence of still another\noccupant; and here, though so far easy to read, came in something of a\npuzzle.  Who in this humble out-of-the-way cottage could afford to wear\nthat exquisite cambric petticoat edged with a fine and very expensive\nlace?  And surely it was on no country legs that those delicately\nclocked and open-worked silk stockings walked invisible through the\nworld.\n\nNor was the lace any ordinary expensive English lace, such as any good\nshop can supply.  Indeed, I recognised it as being of a Parisian design\nas yet little known in England; while on the tops of the stockings I\nlaughingly suspected a border designed by a certain eccentric artist,\nwho devotes his strange gifts to decorating with fascinating miniatures\nthe under-world of woman. I have seen corsets thus made beautiful by\nhim valued at five hundred pounds, and he never paints a pair of\ngarters for less than a hundred.  His name is not yet a famous one, as,\nfor obvious reasons, his works are not exhibited at public galleries,\nthough they are occasionally to be seen at private views.\n\nI am far from despising an honest red-flannel country petticoat. There\nis no warmer kinder-looking garment in the world.  It suggests country\nlaps and country breasts, with sturdy country babes greedy for the warm\nwhite milk, and it seems dyed in country blushes.  Yet, for all that,\none could not be insensible to the exotic race and distinction of that\nfrivolous town petticoat, daintily disporting itself there among its\ncountry cousins, like a queen among milkmaids.\n\nWhat numberless suggestions of romance it awoke!  What strange perfumes\nseemed to waft across from it, perfumes laden with associations of a\nworld so different from the green world where it now was, a charming\nworld of gay intrigue and wanton pleasure. No wonder the wind chose it\nso often for its partner as it danced through the garden, scorning to\nnotice the heavy homespun things about it.  It was not every day that\nthat washing-day wind met so fine a lady, and it was charming to see\nhow gently he played about her stockings.  \"Ah, wind,\" I said,\n\"evidently you are a gallant born; but tell us the name of the lady.\nIt is somewhere on that pretty petticoat, I'll be bound.\"\n\nIs she some little danseuse with the whim to be romantically rustic for\na week? or is she somebody else's pretty wife run away with somebody\nelse's man? or is she some naughty little grisette with an extravagant\nlover? or is she just the usual lady landscape artist, with a more than\nusual taste in lingerie?\n\nAt all events, it was fairly obvious that, for one reason or another,\nthe wearer of the petticoat and stockings which have now occupied us\nfor perhaps a sufficient number of pages, was a visitor at the cottage.\n\nThe next thing was to get a look at her. So, remembering how fond I was\nof milk from the cow, I pushed open the gate and advanced to the\ncottage door.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XV\n\nSTILL OCCUPIED WITH THE PETTICOAT\n\nThe door was opened by a comely young woman, with ruddy cheeks and a\nbright kind eye that promised conversation.  But \"H'm,\" said I to\nmyself, as she went to fetch my milk, \"evidently not yours, my dear.\"\n\n\"A nice drying day for your washing,\" I said, as I slowly sipped my\nmilk, with a half-inclination of my head towards the clothes-line.\n\n\"Very fine, indeed, sir,\" she returned, with something of a blush, and\na shy deprecating look that seemed to beg me not to notice the\npeculiarly quaint antics which the wind, evidently a humourist, chose\nat that moment to execute with the female garments upon the line.\nHowever, I was for once cased in triple brass and inexorable.\n\n\"And who,\" I ventured, smiling, \"may be the owner of those fine things?\"\n\n\"Not those,\" I continued, pointing to an odd garment which the wind was\nwantonly puffing out in the quaintest way, \"but that pretty petticoat\nand those silk stockings?\"\n\nThe poor girl had gone scarlet, scarlet as the petticoat which I was\nsure WAS hers, with probably a fellow at the moment keeping warm her\nbuxom figure.\n\n\"You are very bold, sir,\" she stammered through her blushes, but I\ncould see that she was not ill-pleased that the finery should attract\nattention.\n\n\"But won't you tell me?\" I urged; \"I have a reason for asking.\"\n\nAnd here I had better warn the reader that, as the result of a whim\nthat presently seized me, I must be content to appear mad in his eyes\nfor the next few pages, till I get an opportunity of explanation.\n\n\"Well, what if they should be mine?\" at length I persuaded her into\nsaying.\n\nI made the obvious gallant reply, but, \"All the same,\" I added, \"you\nknow they are not yours.  They belong to some lady visitor, who, I'll\nbe bound, isn't half so pretty; now, don't they?\"\n\n\"Well, they just don't then.  They're mine, as I tell you.\"\n\n\"H'm,\" I continued, a little nonplussed, \"but do you really mean there\nis no lady staying with you?\"\n\n\"Certainly,\" she replied, evidently enjoying my bewilderment.\n\n\"Well, then, some lady must have stayed here once,\" I retorted, with a\nsudden inspiration, \"and left them behind--\"\n\n\"You might be a detective after stolen goods,\" she interrupted.\n\n\"I tell you the things are mine; and what I should like to know does a\ngentleman want bothering himself about a lady's petticoat! No wonder\nyou blush,\" for, in fact, as was easy to foresee, the situation was\nbecoming a little ridiculous for me.\n\n\"Now, look here,\" I said with an affectation of gravity, \"if you'll\ntell me how you came by those things, I'll make it worth your while.\nThey were given to you by a lady who stayed here not so long ago, now,\nweren't they?\"\n\n\"Well, then, they were.\"\n\n\"The lady stayed here with a gentleman?\"\n\n\"Yes, she did.\"\n\n\"H'm!  I thought so,\" I said.  \"Yes! that lady, it pains me to say, was\nmy wife!\"\n\nThis unblushing statement was not, I could see, without its effect upon\nthe present owner of the petticoat.\n\n\"But she said they were brother and sister,\" she replied.\n\n\"Of course she did,\" I returned, with a fine assumption of scorn,--\"of\ncourse she did.  They always do.\"\n\n\"Dear young woman,\" I continued, when I was able to control my emotion,\n\"you are happily remote from the sin and wickedness of the town, and I\nam sorry to speak of such things in so peaceful a spot--but as a\nstrange chance has led me here, I must speak, must tell you that all\nwives are not so virtuous and faithful as you, I am sure, are. There\nare wives who forsake their husbands and--and go off with a handsomer\nman, as the poet says; and mine, mine, alas! was one of them.  It is\nnow some months ago that my wife left me in this way, and since then I\nhave spent every day in searching for her; but never till this moment\nhave I come upon the least trace of her.  Strange, is it not? that\nhere, in this peaceful out-of-the-way garden, I should come upon her\nvery petticoat, her very stockings--\"\n\nBy this my grief had become such that the kind girl put her hand on my\narm. \"Don't take on so,\" she said kindly, and then remembering her\ntreasured property, and probably fearing a counterclaim on my part to\nits possession, \"But how can you be sure she was here?  There are lots\nof petticoats like that--\"\n\n\"What was she like?\" I asked through my agitation.\n\n\"Middle height, slim and fair, with red goldy hair and big blue eyes;\nabout thirty, I should say.\"\n\n\"The very same,\" I groaned, \"there is no mistake; and now,\" I\ncontinued, \"I want you to sell me that petticoat and those stockings,\"\nand I took a couple of sovereigns from my purse. \"I want to have them\nto confront her with, when I do find her. Perhaps it will touch her\nheart to think of the strange way in which I came by them; and you can\nbuy just as pretty ones again with the money,\" I added, as I noticed\nthe disappointment on her face at the prospect of thus losing her\nfinery.\n\n\"Well, it's a funny business, to be sure,\" she said, as still half\nreluctantly she unpegged the coveted garments from the line; \"but if\nwhat you say 's true, I suppose you must have them.\"\n\nThe wanton wind had been so busily kissing them all the morning that\nthey were quite dry, so I was able to find room for them in my knapsack\nwithout danger to the other contents; and, with a hasty good-day to\ntheir recent possessor, I set off at full speed to find a secure nook\nwhere I could throw myself down on the grass, and let loose the absurd\nlaughter that was dangerously bottled up within me; but even before I\ndo that it behoves me if possible to vindicate my sanity to the reader.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XVI\n\nCLEARS UP MY MYSTERIOUS BEHAVIOUR OF THE LAST CHAPTER\n\nWhat a sane man should be doing carrying about with him a woman's\npetticoat and silk stockings, may well be a puzzle to the most\nintelligent reader.\n\nWhim, sir, whim! and few human actions admit of more satisfactory\nsolution.  Like Shylock, I'll say \"It is my humour.\"  But no! I'll be\nmore explanatory.  This madcap quest of mine, was it not understood\nbetween us from the beginning to be a fantastic whim, a poetical\nwild-goose chase, conceived entirely as an excuse for being some time\nin each other's company?  To be whimsical, therefore, in pursuit of a\nwhim, fanciful in the chase of a fancy, is surely but to maintain the\nspirit of the game.  Now, for the purpose, therefore, of a romance that\nmakes no pretence to reasonableness, I had very good reasons for buying\nthat petticoat, which (the reasons, not the petticoat) I will now lay\nbefore you.\n\nI have been conscious all the way along through this pilgrimage of its\ninevitable vagueness of direction, of my need of something definite,\nsome place, some name, anything at all, however slight, which I might\nassociate, if only for a time, with the object of my quest, a definite\nsomething to seek, a definite goal for my feet.\n\nNow, when I saw that mysterious petticoat, and realised that its wearer\nwould probably be pretty and young and generally charming, and that\nprobably her name was somewhere on the waistband, the spirit of whim\nrejoiced within me.  \"Why not,\" it said, \"buy the petticoat, find out\nthe name of its owner, and, instead of seeking a vague Golden Girl,\nmake up your mind doggedly to find and marry her, or, failing that,\ncarry the petticoat with you, as a sort of Cinderella's slipper, try it\non any girl you happen to fancy, and marry her it exactly fits?\"\n\nNow, I confess, that seemed to me quite  a pretty idea, and I hope the\nreader will think so too.  If not, I'm afraid I can offer him no better\nexplanation; and in fact I am all impatience to open my knapsack, and\ninform myself of the name of her to the discovery of whom my wanderings\nare henceforth to be devoted.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XVII\n\nTHE NAME UPON THE PETTICOAT\n\nSo imagine me seated in a grassy corner, with my knapsack open on the\nground and my petticoat and silk stockings spread out in front of\nme,--an odd picture, to be sure, for any passer by to come upon.  I\nsuppose I could have passed for a pedlar, but undoubtedly it would have\nbeen very embarrassing.  However, as it happened, I remained\nundisturbed, and was able to examine my purchases at leisure.  I had\nnever seen a petticoat so near before,--at all events I had never given\none such close attention.  What delicious dainty things they are!  How\nessentially womanly--as I hope no one would call a pair of trousers\nessentially manly.\n\nHow pretty it looked spread out on the grass in front of me!  How soft!\nhow wondrously dainty the finish of every little seam! And the lace!\nIt almost tempts one to change one's sex to wear such things.  There\nwas a time indeed, and not so long ago, when brave men wore garments no\nless dainty.\n\nRupert's Cavaliers were every bit as particular about their lace\ncollars and frills as the lady whose pretty limbs once warmed this\ncambric.\n\nBut where is the name?  Ah! here it is! What sweet writing! \"Sylvia\nJoy, No. 6.\"\n\nSylvia Joy!  What a perfectly enchanting name! and as I repeated it\nenthusiastically, it seemed to have a certain familiarity for my\near,--as though it were the name of some famous beauty or some popular\nactress,--yet the exact association eluded me, and obviously it was\nbetter it should remain a name of mystery. Sylvia Joy!  Who could have\nhoped for such a pretty name! Indeed, to tell the truth, I had dreaded\nto find a \"Mary Jones\" or an \"Ann Williams\"--but Sylvia Joy!  The name\nwas a romance in itself.  I already felt myself falling in love with\nits unseen owner.  With such a petticoat and such a name, Sylvia\nherself could not be otherwise than delightful too. Already, you see, I\nwas calling her by her Christian name!  And the more I thought of her,\nthe stronger grew the conviction--which has no doubt already forced\nitself upon the romantic reader--that we were born for each other.\n\nBut who is Sylvia, who is she? and likewise where is Sylvia, where is\nshe? Obviously they were questions not to be answered off-hand.  Was\nnot my future--at all events my immediate future--to be spent in\nanswering them?\n\nIndeed, curiously enough, my recent haste to have them answered had\nsuddenly died down.  A sort of matrimonial security possessed me.  I\nfelt as I imagine a husband may feel on a solitary holiday--if there\nare husbands unnatural enough to go holidaying without their\nwives--pleasantly conscious of a home tucked somewhere beneath the\ndistant sunset, yet in no precipitate hurry to return there before the\nappointed day.\n\nIn fact, a chill tremor went through me as I realised that, to all\nintent, I was at length respectably settled down, with quite a\nconsiderable retrospect of happy married life. To come to a decision is\nalways to bring something to an end.  And, with something of a pang,\nresolutely stifled, I realised for a moment the true blessedness of the\nsingle state I was so soon to leave behind.  At all events, a little\ngolden fragment of bachelorhood remained.  There was yet a fertile\nstrip of time wherein to sow my last handful of the wild oats of youth.\nSo festina lente, my destined Sylvia, festina lente!\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XVIII\n\nIN WHICH THE NAME OF A GREAT POET IS CRIED OUT IN A SOLITARY PLACE\n\nAs I once more shouldered my pack and went my way, the character of the\ncountry side began to change, and, from a semi-pastoral heathiness and\nfurziness, took on a wildness of aspect, which if indeed melodramatic\nwas melodrama carried to the point of genius.\n\nIt was a scene for which the nineteenth century has no worthy use.  It\nfinds ignoble occupation as a gaping-ground for the vacuous\ntourist,--somewhat as Heine might have imagined Pan carrying the\ngentleman's luggage from the coach to the hotel. It suffers teetotal\npicnic-parties to encamp amid its savage hollows, and it humbly allows\nitself to be painted by the worst artists. Like a lion in a menagerie,\nit is a survival of the extinct chaos entrapped and exhibited amid the\nsmug parks and well-rolled downs of England.\n\nI came upon it by a winding ledge of road, which clung to the bare side\nof the hill like the battlements of some huge castle. Some two hundred\nfeet below, a brawling upland stream stood for the moat, and for the\nenemy there was on the opposite side of the valley a great green\ncompany of trees, settled like a cloud slope upon slope, making all\nhaste to cross the river and ascend the heights where I stood.  Some\nintrepid larches waved green pennons in the very midst of the turbulent\nwater, here and there a veteran lay with his many-summered head abased\nin the rocky course of the stream, and here was a young foolhardy beech\nthat had climbed within a dozen yards of the rampart.  All was wild and\nsolitary, and one might have declared it a scene untrodden by the foot\nof man, but for the telegraph posts and small piles of broken \"macadam\"\nat punctual intervals, and the ginger-beer bottles and paper bags of\nlocal confectioners that lent an air of civilisation to the road.\n\nIt was a place to quote Alastor in, and nothing but a bad memory\nprevented my affrighting the oaks and rills with declamation. As it\nwas, I could only recall the lines\n\n  \"The Poet wandering on, through Arabie\n  And Persia, and the wild Carmanian waste,\n  And o'er the aerial mountains which pour down\n  Indus and Oxus from their icy caves--\"\n\nand that other passage beginning\n\n  \"At length upon the lone Chorasmian shore\n  He paused--\"\n\n\nThis last I mouthed, loving the taste of its thunder; mouthed thrice,\nas though it were an incantation,--and, indeed, from what immediately\nfollowed, it might reasonably have seemed so.\n\n\n  \"At length upon the lone Chorasmian shore\n  He paused--\"\n\nI mouthed for the fourth time.  And lo! advancing to me eagerly along\nthe causeway seemed the very sprite of Alastor himself! There was a\nstar upon his forehead, and around his young face there glowed an\naureole of gold and roses--to speak figuratively, for the star upon his\nbrow was hope, and the gold and roses encircling his head, a miniature\nrainbow, were youth and health. His longish golden hair had no doubt\nits share in the effect, as likewise the soft yellow silk tie that\nfluttered like a flame in the speed of his going.  His blue eyes were\ntragically fresh and clear,--as though they had as yet been little\nused.  There were little wings of haste upon his feet, and he came\nstraight to me, with the air of the Angel Gabriel about to make his\ndivine announcement.  For a moment I thought that he was an apparition\nof prophecy charged to announce the maiden of the Lord for whom I was\nseeking.  However, his brief flushed question was not of these things.\nHe desired first to ask the time of day, and next--here, after a bump\nto the earth, one's thoughts ballooned again heavenwards--\"had I seen a\ngreen copy of Shelley lying anywhere along the road?\"\n\nNothing so good had happened to me, I replied--but I believed that I\nhad seen a copy of Alastor!  For a moment my meaning was lost on him;\nthen he flushed and smiled, thanked me and was off again, saying that\nhe must find his Shelley, as he wouldn't lose it for the world!\n\nHe had presently disappeared as suddenly as he had come, but he had\nleft me a companion, a radiant reverberant name; and for some little\nspace the name of Shelley clashed silvery music among the hills.\n\nIts seven letters seemed to hang right across the clouds like the Seven\nStars, an apocalyptic constellation, a veritable sky sign; and again\nthe name was an angel standing with a silver trumpet, and again it was\na song.  The heavens opened, and across the blue rift it hung in a\nglory of celestial fire, while from behind and above the clouds came a\nwarbling as of innumerable larks.\n\nHow strange was this miracle of fame, I pondered, this strange\napotheosis by which a mere private name becomes a public symbol!\nShelley was once a private person whose name had no more universal\nmeaning than my own, and so were Byron and Cromwell and Shakespeare;\nyet now their names are facts as stubborn as the Rocky Mountains, or\nthe National Gallery, or the circulation of the blood.  From their\noriginal inch or so of private handwriting they have spread and spread\nout across the world, and now whole generations of men find\nintellectual accommodation within them,--drinking fountains and other\npublic institutions are erected upon them; yea, Carlyle has become a\nChelsea swimming-bath, and \"Highland Mary\" is sold for whiskey, while\nMr. Gladstone is to be met everywhere in the form of a bag.\n\nDoes Mr. Gladstone, I wonder, instruct his valet \"to pack his\nGladstone\"?  How strange it must seem!  Try it yourself some day and\nits effect on your servant.  Ask him, for example, to \"pack your ----\"\nand see how he'll stare.\n\nComing nearer and nearer to earth, I wondered if Colonel Boycott ever\nuses the word \"boycott,\" and how strange it must have seemed to the\nlate MacAdam to walk for miles and miles upon his own name, like a\ncarpet spread out before him.\n\nThen I once more rebounded heavenwards, at the vision of the eager\ndreamy lad whose question had set going all this odd clockwork of\nassociation.  He wouldn't lose his Shelley for the world!  How like\ntwenty! And how many things that he wouldn't lose for the world will he\nhave to give up before he is thirty, I reflected sententiously,--give\nup at last, maybe, with a stony indifference, as men on a sinking ship\ntake no thought of the gold and specie in the hold.\n\nAnd then, all of a sudden, a little way up the ferny grassy hillside, I\ncaught sight of the end of a book half hidden among the ferns.  I\nclimbed up to it.  Of course it was that very green Shelley which the\nyoung stranger wouldn't lose for the world.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XIX\n\nWHY THE STRANGER WOULD NOT LOSE HIS SHELLEY FOR THE WORLD\n\nPicking up the book, I opened it involuntarily at the titlepage, and\nthen--I resisted a great temptation!  I shut it again. A little flowery\nplot of girl's handwriting had caught my eye, and a girl's pretty name.\nWhen Love and Beauty meet, it is hard not to play the eavesdropper, and\nit was easy to guess that Love and Beauty met upon that page.  St.\nAnthony had no harder fight with the ladies he was unpolite enough to\ncall demons, than I in resisting the temptation to take another look at\nthat pen-and-ink love making.  Now, as I look back, I think it was\nsheer priggishness to resist so human and yet so reverent an impulse.\nThere is nothing sacred from reverence, and love's lovers have a right\nto regard themselves as the confidants of lovers, whenever they may\nchance to surprise either them or their letters.\n\nWhile I was still hesitating, and wondering how I could get the book\nconveyed to its romantic owner, suddenly a figure turned the corner of\nthe road, and there was Alastor coming back again.  I slipped the book,\nin distracted search for which he was evidently still engaged, under\nthe ferns, and, leisurely lighting a pipe, prepared to tease him.  He\nwas presently within hail, and, looking up, caught sight of me.\n\n\"Have you found your Shelley yet?\" I called down to him, as he stood a\nmoment in the road.\n\nHe shook his head.  No!  But he meant to find it, if he had to hunt\nevery square foot of the valley inch by inch.\n\nWouldn't any other book do, I asked him. Would he take a Boccaccio, or\na \"Golden Ass,\" or a \"Tom Jones,\" in exchange?--for of such consisted\nmy knapsack library.  He laughed a negative, and it seemed a shame to\ntease him.\n\n\"It is not so much the book itself,\" he said.\n\n\"But the giver?\" I suggested.\n\n\"Of course,\" he blushingly replied.\n\n\"Well, suppose I have found it?\" I continued.\n\n\"You don't mean it--\"\n\n\"But suppose I have--I'm only supposing--will you give me the pleasure\nof your company at dinner at the next inn and tell me its story?\"\n\n\"Indeed I will, gladly,\" he replied.\n\n\"Well, then,\" I said, \"catch, for here it is!\"\n\nThe joy with which he recovered it was pretty to behold, and the\neagerness with which he ran through the leaves, to see that the violets\nand the primroses and a spray of meadowsweet, young love's bookmarkers,\nwere all in their right places, touched my heart.\n\nHe could not thank me enough; and as we stepped out to the inn, some\nthree or four miles on the road, I elicited something of his story.\n\nHe was a clerk in a city office, he said, but his dreams were not\ncommercial.  His one dream was to be a great poet, or a great writer of\nsome sort, and this was one of his holidays.  As I looked at his\nsensitive young face, unmarred by pleasure and unscathed by sorrow,\nbathed daily, I surmised, in the may-dew of high philosophies--ah, so\nhigh! washed from within by a constant radiancy of pure thoughts, and\nfrom without by a constant basking in the shine of every beautiful and\nnoble and tender thing,--I thought it not unlikely that he might fulfil\nhis dream.\n\nBut, alas! as he talked on, with lighted face and chin in the air, how\ncruelly I realised how little I had fulfilled mine.\n\nAnd how hard it was to talk to him, without crushing some flower of his\nfancy or casting doubt upon his dreams.  Oh, the gulf between twenty\nand thirty!  I had never quite comprehended it before.  And how\ninexpressibly sad it was to hear him prattling on of the ideal life, of\nsocialism, of Walt Whitman and what not,--all the dear old\nquackeries,--while I was already settling down comfortably to a\nconservative middle age.  He had no hope that had not long been my\ndespair, no aversion that I had not accepted among the more or less\ncomfortable conditions of the universe.  He was all for nature and\nliberty, whereas I had now come to realise the charm of the artificial,\nand the social value of constraint.\n\n\"Young man,\" I cried in my heart, \"what shall I do to inherit Eternal\nYouth?\"\n\nThe gulf between us was further revealed when, at length coming to our\ninn, we sat down to dinner.  To me it seemed the most natural thing in\nthe world to call for the wine-list and consult his choice of wine;\nbut, will you believe me, he asked to be allowed to drink water!  And\nwhen he quoted the dear old stock nonsense out of Thoreau about being\nable to get intoxicated on a glass of water, I could have laughed and\ncried at the same time.\n\n\"Happy Boy!\" I cried, \"still able to turn water into wine by the divine\npower of your youth\"; and then, turning to the waiter, I ordered a\nbottle of No. 37.\n\n\"Wine is the only youth granted to middle age,\" I continued,--\"in vino\njuventus, one might say; and may you, my dear young friend, long remain\nso proudly independent of that great Elixir--though I confess that I\nhave met no few young men under thirty who have been excellent critics\nof the wine-list.\"\n\nAs the water warmed him, he began to expand into further confidence,\nand then he told me the story of his Shelley, if a story it can be\ncalled.  For, of course, it was simple enough, and the reader has long\nsince guessed that the reason why he wouldn't lose his Shelley for the\nworld was the usual simple reason.\n\nI listened to his rhapsodies of HER and HER and HER with an aching\nheart.  How good it was to be young!  No wonder men had so desperately\nsought the secret of Eternal Youth!  Who would not be young for ever,\nfor such dreams and such an appetite?\n\nHere of course was the very heaven-sent confidant for such an\nenterprise as mine. I told him all about my whim, just for the pleasure\nof watching his face light up with youth's generous worship of all such\nfantastic nonsense.  You should have seen his enthusiasm and heard all\nthe things he said. Why, to encounter such a whimsical fellow as myself\nin this unimaginative age was like meeting a fairy prince, or coming\nunexpectedly upon Don Quixote attacking the windmill.  I offered him\nthe post of Sancho Panza; and indeed what would he not give, he said,\nto leave all and follow me!  But then I reminded him that he had\nalready found his Golden Girl.\n\n\"Of course, I forgot,\" he said, with I'm afraid something of a sigh.\nFor you see he was barely twenty, and to have met your ideal so early\nin life is apt to rob the remainder of the journey of something of its\nzest.\n\nI asked him to give me his idea of what the Blessed Maid should be, to\nwhich he replied, with a smile, that he could not do better than\ndescribe Her, which he did for the sixth time.  It was, as I had\nforeseen, the picture of a Saint, a Goddess, a Dream, very lovely and\npure and touching; but it was not a woman, and it was a woman I was in\nsearch of, with all her imperfections on her head.  I suppose no boy of\ntwenty really loves a WOMEN, but loves only his etherealised extract of\nwoman, entirely free from earthy adulteration.  I noticed the words\n\"pure\" and \"natural\" in constant use by my young friend.  Some lines\nwent through my head, but I forbore to quote them:--\n\n  Alas I your so called purity\n  Is merely immaturity,\n  And woman's nature plays its part\n  Sincerely but in woman's art.\n\n\nBut I couldn't resist asking him, out of sheer waggery, whether he\ndidn't think a touch of powder, and even, very judiciously applied, a\ntouch of rouge, was an improvement to woman.  His answer went to my\nheart.\n\n\"Paint--a WOMAN!\" he exclaimed.\n\nIt was as though you had said--paint an angel!\n\nI could bear no more of it.  The gulf yawned shiveringly wide at\nremarks like that; so, with the privilege of an elder, I declared it\ntime for bed, and yawned off to my room.\n\nNext morning we bade good-bye, and went our several ways.  As we\nparted, he handed me a letter which I was not to open till I was well\non my journey.  We waved good-bye to each other till the turnings of\nthe road made parting final, and then, sitting down by the roadside, I\nopened the letter.  It proved to be not a letter, but a poem, which he\nhad evidently written after I had left him for bed.  It was entitled,\nwith twenty's love for a tag of Latin, Ad Puellam Auream, and it ran\nthus:--\n\n  The Golden Girl in every place\n  Hides and reveals her lovely face;\n  Her neither skill nor strength may find--\n  'T is only loving moves her mind.\n  If but a pretty face you seek,\n  You'll find one any day or week;\n  But if you look with deeper eyes,\n  And seek her lovely, pure, and wise,\n  Then must you wear the pilgrim's shoon\n  For many a weary, wandering moon.\n\n  Only the pure in heart may see\n  That lily of all purity,\n  Only in clean unsullied thought\n  The image of her face is caught,\n  And only he her love may hold\n  Who buys her with the spirit's gold.\n\n  Thus only shall you find your pearl,\n  O seeker of the Golden Girl!\n  She trod but now the grassy way,\n  A vision of eternal May.\n\n\nThe devil take his impudence!  \"Only the pure in heart,\" \"clean,\nunsullied thought.\"  How like the cheek of twenty!  And all the same\nhow true!  Dear lad, how true!  Certainly, the child is father to the\nman.  Dirige nos!  O sage of the Golden Twenties!\n\nAs I meditatively folded up the pretty bit of writing, I made a\nresolution; but it was one of such importance that not only is another\nchapter needed to do it honour, but it may well inaugurate another book\nof this strange uneventful history.\n\n\n\n\nBOOK II\n\n\n\nCHAPTER I\n\nIN WHICH I DECIDE TO BE YOUNG AGAIN\n\nYes, I said to myself, the lad is quite right; I will follow his\nadvice.  I'm afraid I was in danger of developing into a sad cynic,\nwith a taste for the humour of this world. What should have been a\nlofty high-souled pilgrimage, only less transcendental than that of the\nHoly Grail itself, has so far failed, no doubt, because I have\nundertaken it too much in the wanton spirit of a troubadour.\n\nI will grow young and serious again. Yes, why not?  I will take a vow\nof Youth. One's age is entirely a matter of the imagination. From this\nmoment I am no longer thirty.  Thirty falls from me like a hideous\ndream.  My back straightens again at the thought; my silvering hair\nblackens once more; my eyes, a few moments ago lacklustre and sunken,\ngrow bright and full again, and the whites are clear as the finest\nporcelain.  Veni, veni, Mephistophile! your Faust is young\nagain,--young, young, and, with a boy's heart, open once more to all\nthe influences of the mighty world.\n\nI bring down my stick upon the ground with a mighty ring of resolution,\nand the miracle is done.  Who would take me for thirty now?  From this\nmoment I abjure pessimism and cynicism in all their forms, put from my\nmind all considerations of the complexities of human life, unravel all\nby a triumphant optimism which no statistics can abash or criticism\ndishearten.  I likewise undertake to divest myself entirely of any\nsense of humour that may have developed within me during the baneful\nexperiences of the last ten years, and, in short, will consent for the\nfuture to be nothing that is not perfectly perfect and pure.  These, I\ntake it, are the fundamental conditions of being young again.\n\nAnd as for the Quest, it shall forthwith be undertaken in an entirely\nserious and high-minded spirit.  From this moment I am on the look-out\nfor a really transcendental attachment.  No \"bright-eyed bar-maids,\"\nhowever \"refined,\" need apply. Ladies who are prodigal of their white\npetticoats are no longer fit company for me.  Indeed I shall no longer\nlook upon a petticoat, unless I am able first entirely to spiritualise\nit. It must first be disinfected of every earthly thought.\n\nYes, I am once more a young man, sound in wind and limb, with not a\ntooth or an illusion lost, my mind tabula rasa, my heart to be had for\nthe asking.  Oh, come, ye merry, merry maidens!  The fairy prince is on\nthe fairy road.\n\nIncipit vita nuova!\n\nSo in the lovely rapture of a new-born resolution--and is there any\nrapture like it?--nature has no more intoxicating illusion than that of\nturning over a new leaf, or beginning a new life from to-day--I sprang\nalong the road with a carolling heart; quite forgetting that Apuleius\nand Fielding and Boccaccio were still in my knapsack--not to speak of\nthe petticoat.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER II\n\nAT THE SIGN OF THE SINGING STREAM\n\nApuleius and Fielding and Boccaccio, bad companions for a petticoat,\nI'm afraid, bad companions too for so young a man as I had now become.\nHowever, as I say, I had for the time forgotten that pagan company, or,\nin my puritanic zeal, I might have thrown them all to be washed clean\nin the upland stream, whose pure waters one might fancy were fragrant\nfrom their sunny day among the ferns and the heather, fragrant to the\neye, indeed, if one may so speak, with the shaken meal of the\nmeadowsweet. This stream had been the good angel of my thoughts all the\nday, keeping them ever moving and ever fresh, cleansing and burnishing\nthem, quite an open-air laundry of the mind.\n\nWe were both making for the same little town, it appeared, and as the\nsun was setting we reached it together.  I entered the town over the\nbridge, and the stream under it, washing the walls of the high-piled,\nmany-gabled old inn where I proposed to pass the night.  I should hear\nit still rippling on with its gentle harpsichord tinkle, as I stretched\nmyself down among the cool lavendered sheets, and little by little let\nslip the multifarious world.\n\nThe inn windows beamed cheerily, a home of ruddy rest.  Having ordered\nmy dinner and found my room, I threw down my knapsack and then came out\nagain to smoke an ante-prandial pipe, listen to the evensong of the\nstream, and think great thoughts.  The stream was still there, and\nsinging the same sweet old song.  You could hear it long after it was\nout of sight, in the gathering darkness, like an old nurse humming\nlullabies in the twilight.\n\nThe dinner was good, the wine was old, and oh! the rest was sweet!\nNothing fills one with so exquisite a weariness as a day spent in good\nresolutions and great thoughts. There is something perilously sensuous\nin the relaxation of one's muscles, both of mind and body, after a day\nthus well spent.\n\nLighting up my pipe once more, and drawing to the fire, I suddenly\nrealised a sense of loneliness.  Of course, I was lonely for a\nbook,--Apuleius or Fielding or Boccaccio!\n\nAn hour ago they had seemed dangerous companions for so lofty a mood;\nbut now, under the gentle influences of dinner, the mood had not indeed\nchanged--but mellowed. So to say, we would split the difference between\nthe ideal and the human, and be, say, twenty-five.\n\nIt was in this genial attitude of mind that I strode up the quaint\ncircular staircase to fetch Fielding from my room, and, shade of Tom\nJones! what should be leaving my room, as I advanced to enter it,\nbut--well, it's no use, resolutions are all very well, but facts are\nfacts, especially when they're natural, and here was I face to face\nwith the most natural little natural fact, and withal the most charming\nand merry-eyed, that--well, in short, as I came to enter my room I was\nconfronted by the roundest, ruddiest little chambermaid ever created\nfor the trial of mortal frailty.\n\nAnd the worst of it was that her merry eye was in partnership with a\nmerry tongue. Indeed, for some unexplained reason, she was bubbling\nover with congested laughter, the reason for which mere embarrassment\nset one inquiring.  At last, between little gushes of laughter which\nshook her plump shoulders in a way that aroused wistful memories of\nHebe, she archly asked me, with mock solemnity, if I should need a\nlady's maid.\n\n\n\"Certainly,\" I replied with inane promptitude, for I had no notion of\nher drift; but then she ran off in a scurry of laughter, and still\npuzzled I turned into my room, TO FIND, neatly hung over the end of the\nbed, nothing less than the dainty petticoat and silk stockings of\nSylvia Joy.\n\nYou can imagine the colour of my cheeks at the discovery.  No doubt I\nwas already the laughing-stock of the whole inn.  What folly!  What a\nyoung vixen!  Oh, what's to be done?  Pay my bill and sneak off at once\nto the next town; but how pass through the grinning line of boots, and\nwaiter, and chambermaid, and ironically respectful landlord and\nlandlady, in the hall...\n\nBut while I thus deliberated, something soft pressed in at the door;\nand, making a sudden dart, I had the little baggage who had brought\nabout my dilemma a prisoner in my arms.\n\nI stayed some days at this charming old inn, for Amaryllis--oh, yes,\nyou may be sure her name was Amaryllis--had not betrayed me; and indeed\nshe may have some share in my retrospect of the inn as one of the most\ndelightful which I encountered anywhere in my journeying.  Would you\nlike to know its name?  Well, I know it as The Singing Stream.  If you\ncan find it under that name, you are welcome.  And should you chance to\nbe put into bedroom No. 26, you can think of me, and how I used to lie\nawake, listening to the stream rippling beneath the window, with its\ngentle harpsichord tinkle, and little by little letting slip the\nmultifarious world.\n\nAnd if anything about this chapter should seem to contradict the high\nideals of the chapter preceding it, I can only say that, though the\nepisode should not rigidly fulfil the conditions of the transcendental,\nnothing could have been more characteristic of that early youth to\nwhich I had vowed myself.  Indeed, I congratulated myself, as I looked\nmy last at the sign of The Singing Stream, that this had been quite in\nmy early manner.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER III\n\nIN WHICH I SAVE A USEFUL LIFE\n\nThough I had said good-bye to the inn, the stream and I did not part\ncompany at the inn-door, but continued for the best part of a morning\nto be fellow-travellers.  Indeed, having led me to one pleasant\nadventure, its purpose, I afterwards realised, was to lead me to\nanother, and then to go about its own bright business.\n\nI don't think either of us had much idea where we were or whither we\nwere bound.  Our guiding principle seemed to be to get as much sunshine\nas possible, and to find the easiest road.  We avoided dull sandy\nlevels and hard rocky places, with the same instinctive dexterity.  We\ngloomed together through dark dingles, and came out on sunny reaches\nwith the same gilded magnificence. There are days when every stream is\nPactolus and every man is Croesus, and thanks to that first and\ngreatest of all alchemists, the sun, the morning I write of was a\nmorning when to breathe was gold and to see was silver.  And to breathe\nand see was all one asked.  It was the first of May, and the world\nshone like a great illuminated letter with which that father of\nartists, the sun, was making splendid his missal of the seasons.\n\nThe month of May was ever his tour de force.  Each year he has strained\nand stimulated his art to surpass himself, seeking ever a finer and a\nbrighter gold, a more celestial azure.  Never had his gold been so\ngolden, his azure so dazzlingly clear and deep as on this particular\nMay morning; while his fancy simply ran riot in the marginal\ndecorations of woodland and spinney, quaint embroidered flowers and\ncopses full of exquisitely painted and wonderfully trained birds of\nsong.  It was indeed a day for nature to be proud of.  So seductive was\nthe sunshine that even the shy trout leapt at noonday, eager apparently\nto change his silver for gold.\n\n\n  O silver fish in the silver stream,\n  O golden fish in the golden gleam,\n  Tell me, tell me, tell me true,\n  Shall I find my girl if I follow you?\n\n\nI suppose the reader never makes nonsense rhymes from sheer gladness of\nheart,--nursery doggerel to keep time with the rippling of the stream,\nor the dancing of the sun, or the beating of his heart; the gibberish\nof delight.  As I hummed this nonsense, a trout at least three pounds\nin weight, whom you would know again anywhere, leapt a yard out of the\nwater, and I took it, in my absurd, sun-soaked heart, as a good omen,\nas though he had said, \"Follow and see.\"\n\nI had no will but to follow, no desire but to see.  All the same,\nthough I affected to take him seriously, I had little suspicion how\nmuch that trout was to mean to me,--yes, within the course of a very\nfew moments. Indeed, I had hardly strolled on for another quarter of a\nmile, when I was suddenly aroused from wool-gathering by his loud cries\nfor help.  Looking up, I saw him flashing desperately in mid-air, a\nlovely foot of writhing silver.  In another second he was swung through\nthe sunlight, and laid out breathing hard in a death-bed of buttercups\nand daisies.\n\nThere was not a moment to be lost, if I were to repay the debt of\ngratitude which in a flash I had seen that I owed him.\n\n\"Madam,\" I said, breathlessly springing forward, as a heavenly being\nwas coldly tearing the hook from the gills of the unlucky trout,\n\"though I am a stranger, will you do me a great favour? It is a matter\nof life or death...\"\n\nShe looked up at me with some surprise, but with a fine fearless\nglance, and almost immediately said, \"Certainly, what can I do?\"\n\n\"Spare the life of that trout--\"\n\n\"It is a singular request,\" she replied, \"and one,\" she smiled,\n\"self-sacrificing indeed for an angler to grant, for he weighs at least\nthree pounds.  However, since he seems a friend of yours, here goes--\"\nAnd with the gladdest, most grateful sound in the world, the happy\nsmack of a fish back home again in the water, after an appalling three\nminutes spent on land, that prophetic trout was once more an active\nunit in God's populous universe.\n\n\"Now that's good of you,\" I said, with thankful eyes, \"and shows a kind\nheart.\"\n\n\"And kind hearts, they say, are more than coronets,\" she replied\nmerrily, indulging in that derisive quotation which seems to be the\nfinal reward of the greatest poets.\n\nFor a moment there was a silence, during which I confess to wondering\nwhat I should say next.  However, she supplied my place.\n\n\"But of course,\" she said, \"you owe it to me, after this touching\ndisplay of humanitarianism, to entertain me with your reason for\ninterposing between me and my just trout.  Was it one of those\nwonderful talking fishes out of the Arabian Nights, or are you merely\nan angler yourself, and did you begrudge such a record catch to a girl?\"\n\n\"I see,\" I replied, \"that you will understand me.  That trout was, so\nto speak, out of the Arabian Nights.  Only five minutes ago it was a\nMay-day madness of mine to think that he leaped out of the water and\ngave me a highly important message.  So I begged his life from a mere\nfancy.  It was just a whim, which I trust you will excuse.\"\n\n\"A whim!  So you are a follower of the great god Whim,\" she replied,\nwith somewhat of an eager interest in her voice.  \"How nice it is to\nmeet a fellow-worshipper!\"\n\n\"Do women ever have whims?\" I respectfully asked.\n\n\"I don't know about other women,\" she replied.  \"Indeed, I'm afraid I'm\nunnatural enough to take no interest in them at all. But, as for\nme,--well, what nonsense!  Tell me some more about the trout.  What was\nthe wonderful message he seemed to give you? Or perhaps I oughtn't to\nask?\"\n\n\"I'm afraid,\" I said, \"it would hardly translate into anything\napproaching common-sense.\"\n\n\"Did I ask for common-sense?\" she retorted.  It was true, she hadn't.\nBut then I couldn't, with any respect for her, tell her the trout's\nmessage, or, with any respect for myself, recall those atrocious\ndoggerel lines.  In my dilemma, I caught sight of a pretty book lying\nnear her fishing-basket, and diverted the talk by venturing to ask its\nname.\n\n\"'T is of Aucassin and Nicolete,\" she replied, with something in her\nvoice which seemed to imply that the tender old story would be familiar\nto me.  My memory served me for once gallantly.\n\nI answered by humming half to myself the lines from the prologue,--\n\n  \"Sweet the song, the story sweet,\n  There is no man hearkens it,\n  No man living 'neath the sun,\n  So outwearied, so foredone,\n  Sick and woful, worn and sad,\n  But is healed, but is glad\n       'T is so sweet.\"\n\n\n\"How charming of you to know it!\" she laughed.  \"You are the only man\nin this county, or the next, or the next, who knows it, I'm sure.\"\n\n\"Are the women of the county more familiar with it?\" I replied.\n\n\"But tell me about the trout,\" she once more persisted.\n\nAt the same moment, however, there came from a little distance the\nmusical tinkle of a bell that sounded like silver, a fairy-like and\nalmost startling sound.\n\n\"It is my lunch,\" she explained.  \"I'm a worshipper of the great god\nWhim too, and close by here I have a little summer-house, full of books\nand fishing-lines and other childishness, where, when my whim is to be\nlonely, I come and play at solitude.  If you'll be content with rustic\nfare, and promise to be amusing, it would be very pleasant if you'd\njoin me.\"\n\nO! most prophetic and agreeable trout! Was it not like the old fairy\ntales, the you-help-us and we'll-help-you of Psyche and the ants?\n\nIt had been the idlest whim for me to save the life of that poor trout.\nThere was no real pity in it.  For two pins, I had been just as ready\nto cut it open, to see if by chance it carried in its belly the golden\nring wherewith I was to wed the Golden--\n\nHowever, such is the gratitude of nature to man, that this little\nthoughtless act of kindness had brought me face to face with--was it\nthe Golden Girl?\n\n\n\nCHAPTER IV\n\n'T IS OF NICOLETE AND HER BOWER IN THE WILDWOOD\n\nBut I have all this time left the reader without any formal descriptive\nintroduction to this whimsical young lady angler. Not without reason,\nfor, like any really charming personality, she was very difficult to\npicture.  Paint a woman! as our young friend Alastor said.\n\nFaces that fall into types you can describe, or at all events label in\nsuch a way that the reader can identify them; but those faces that\nconsist mainly of spiritual effect and physical bloom, that change with\neverything they look upon, the light in which ebbs and flows with every\nchanging tide of the soul,--these you have to love to know, and to\nworship to portray.\n\nNow the face of Nicolete, as I learnt in time to call her, was just\nsoul and bloom, perhaps mainly bloom.  I never noticed whether she had\nany other features except her eyes.  I suppose she had a nose; a little\nlace pocket-handkerchief I have by me at the moment is almost too small\nto be evidence on that important point.\n\nAs I walked by her side that May morning, I was only conscious of her\nvoice and her exquisite girlhood; for though she talked with the APLOMB\nof a woman of the world, a passionate candour and simple ardour in her\nmanner would have betrayed her, had her face not plainly declared her\nthe incarnation of twenty.  But if she were twenty years young, she was\nequally twenty years OLD; and twenty years old, in some respects, is\nthe greatest age attained to by man or woman.  In this she rather\ndiffered from Alastor, of whom otherwise she was the female\ncounterpart.  Her talk, and something rather in her voice than her\ntalk, soon revealed her as a curious mixture of youth and age, of\ndreamer and desillusionee.\n\nOne soon realised that she was too young, was hoping too much from\nlife, to spend one's days with.  Yet she had just sufficiently that\ntouch of languor which puts one at one's ease, though indeed it was\nrather the languor of waiting for what was going to happen than the\nweariness of experience gone by.  She was weary, not because of the\npast, but because the fairy theatre of life still kept its curtain\ndown, and forced her to play over and over again the impatient overture\nof her dreams.\n\nI have no doubt that it was largely nervousness that kept the\nmysterious playwright so long fumbling behind the scenes, for it was\nobvious that it would be no ordinary sort of play, no every-day\ndomestic drama, that would satisfy this young lady, to whom life had\ngiven, by way of prologue, the inestimable blessing of wealth, and the\nprivilege, as a matter of course, of choosing as she would among the\ngrooms (that is, the bride-grooms) of the romantic British aristocracy.\n\nShe had made youth's common mistake of beginning life with books, which\ncan only be used without danger by those who are in a position to test\ntheir statements.  Youth naturally believes everything that is told it,\nespecially in books.\n\nNow, books are simply professional liars about life, and the books that\nare best worth reading are those which lie the most beautifully. Yet,\nin fairness, we must add that they are liars, not with intent to\nmislead, but merely with the tenderest purpose to console.  They are\nthe good Samaritans that find us robbed of all our dreams by the\nroadside of life, bleeding and weeping and desolate; and such is their\nskill and wealth and goodness of heart, that they not only heal up our\nwounds, but restore to us the lost property of our dreams, on one\ncondition,--that we never travel with them again in the daylight.\n\nA library is a better world, built by the brains and hearts of poets\nand dreamers, as a refuge from the real world outside; and in it alone\nis to be found the land of milk and honey which it promises.\n\n\"Milk and honey\" would have been an appropriate inscription for the\ndelicious little library which parents who, I surmised, doted on\nNicolete in vain, had allowed her to build in a wild woodland corner of\nher ancestral park, half a mile away from the great house, where, for\nall its corridors and galleries, she could never feel, at all events,\nspiritually alone.  All that was most sugared and musical and generally\ndelusive in the old library of her fathers had been brought out to this\nlittle woodland library, and to that nucleus of old leather-bound poets\nand romancers, long since dead, yet as alive and singing on their\nshelves as any bird on the sunny boughs outside, my young lady's\nprivate purse had added all that was most sugared and musical and\ngenerally delusive in the vellum bound Japanese-paper literature of our\nown luxurious day.  Nor were poets and romancers from over sea--in\ntheir seeming simple paper covers, but with, oh, such complicated and\nsubtle insides!--absent from the court which Nicolete held here in the\ngreenwood.  Never was such a nest of singing-birds. All day long, to\nthe ear of the spirit, there was in this little library a sound of\nharping and singing and the telling of tales,--songs and tales of a\nworld that never was, yet shall ever be.  Here day by day Nicolete fed\nher young soul on the nightingale's-tongues of literature, and put down\nher book only to listen to the nightingale's-tongues outside.  Yea,\nsun, moon, and stars were all in the conspiracy to lie to her of the\nloveliness of the world and the good intentions of life.  And now, thus\nunexpectedly, I found myself joining the nefarious conspiracy.  Ah,\nwell! was I not twenty myself, and full of dreams!\n\n\n\nCHAPTER V\n\n'T IS OF AUCASSIN AND NICOLETE\n\nThus it was that we lunched together amid the books and birds, in an\nexquisite solitude a deux; for the ringer of the silver bell had\ndisappeared, having left a dainty meal in readiness--for two.\n\n\"You see you were expected,\" said Nicolete, with her pretty laugh.  \"I\ndreamed I should have a visitor to-day, and told Susan to lay the lunch\nfor two.  You mustn't be surprised at that,\" she added mischievously;\n\"it has often happened before. I dream that dream every other night,\nand Susan lays for two every day.  She knows my whims,--knows that the\nextra knife and fork are for the fairy knight that may turn up any\nafternoon, as I tell her--\"\n\n\"To find the sleepless princess,\" I added, thinking at the same time\none of those irrelevant asides that will go through the brain of\nthirty, that the woman who would get her share of kisses nowadays must\nneither slumber nor sleep.\n\nA certain great poet, I think it was Byron, objected to seeing women in\nthe act of eating. He thought their eating should be done in private.\nWhat a curiously perverse opinion!  For surely woman never shows to\nbetter advantage than in the dainty exercises of a dainty repast, and\nthere is nothing more thrilling to man than a meal alone with a woman\nhe loves or is about to love.  Perhaps, deep down, the reason is that\nthere still vibrates in the masculine blood the thrilling surprise of\nthe moment when man first realised that the angel woman was built upon\nthe same carnivorous principles as his grosser self.\n\nThat is one of the first heart-beating surprises that come upon the boy\nColumbus, as he sets out to discover the New World of woman; and indeed\nhis surprise has not seldom deepened into admiration, as he has found\nthat not only does woman eat, but frequently eats a lot.\n\nThis privilege of seeing woman eat is the earliest granted of those\ndelicate animal intimacies, the fuller and fuller confiding of which\nplays not the least important part, and ever such a sweet one, even in\na highly transcendental affection.  It is this gradual humanising of\nthe divine female that brings about the spiritualising of the\nunregenerate male.\n\nIn the earliest stages of love the services are small that we are\nprivileged to do for the loved one.  But if we are allowed to sit at\nmeat with her,--ever a royal condescension,--it is ours at least to\npass her the salt, to see that she is never kept waiting a moment for\nthe mustard or the pepper, to cut the bread for her with geometrical\nprecision, and to lean as near her warm shoulder as we dare to pour out\nfor her the sacred wine.\n\nYes! for sure I was twenty again, for the performance of these simple\nservices for Nicolete gave me a thrill of pure boyish pleasure such as\nI had never expected to feel again.  And did she not make a knight of\nme by gently asking if I would be so kind as to carve the chicken, and\nhow she laughed quite disproportionally at my school-boy story of the\nman who, being asked to carve a pigeon, said he thought they had better\nsend for a wood-carver, as it seemed to be a wood pigeon.\n\nAnd while we ate and drank and laughed and chatted, the books around us\nwere weaving their spells.  Even before the invention of printing books\nwere \"love's purveyors.\" Was it not a book that sent Paolo and\nFrancesca for ever wandering on that stormy wind of passion and of\ndeath?  And nowadays the part played by books in human drama is greater\nthan we perhaps realise. Apart from their serious influence as\ndetermining destinies of the character, what endless opportunities they\nafford to lovers, who perhaps are denied all other meeting-places than\nmay be found on the tell-tale pages of a marked volume.  The method is\nso easy and so unsuspect.  You have only to put faint pencil-marks\nagainst the tenderest passages in your favourite new poet, and lend the\nvolume to Her, and She has only to leave here and there the dropped\nviolet of a timid confirmatory initial, for you to know your fate.  And\nwhat a touchstone books thus become!  Indeed they simplify love-making,\nfrom every point of view.  With books so inexpensive and accessible to\nall as they are to-day, no one need run any risks of marrying the wrong\nwoman.  He has only to put her through an unconscious examination by\ngetting her to read and mark a few of his favourite authors, and he is\nthus in possession of the master clues of her character.  With a list\nof her month's reading and a photograph, a man ought to be able to make\nup his mind about any given woman, even though he has never spoken to\nher.  \"Name your favourite writer\" should be one of the first questions\nin the Engagement Catechism.\n\nThere is, indeed, no such short cut to knowledge of each other as a\ntalk about books.  One short afternoon is enough for any two\nbook-lovers, though they may have met for the first time in the\nmorning, to make up their minds whether or not they have been born for\neach other.  If you are agreed, say, in admiring Meredith, Hardy, Omar\nKhayyam, and Maeterlinck,--to take four particularly\ntest-authors,--there is nothing to prevent your marrying at once.\nIndeed, a love for any one of these significant writers will be enough,\nnot to speak of an admiration for \"Aucassin and Nicolete.\"\n\nNow, Nicolete and I soon found that we had all these and many another\nwriter in common, and before our lunch was ended we were nearer to each\nother than many old friends.  The heart does not more love the heart\nthat loves it than the brain loves the brain that comprehends it; and,\nwhatever else was to befall us, Nicolete and I were already in love\nwith each other's brains. Whether or not the malady would spread till\nit reached the heart is the secret of some future chapter.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VI\n\nA FAIRY TALE AND ITS FAIRY TAILORS\n\nAs this is not a realistic novel, I do not hold myself bound, as I have\nsaid before, to account reasonably for everything that is done--least\nof all, said--within its pages. I simply say, So it happened, or So it\nis, and expect the reader to take my word.  If he be uncivil enough to\ndoubt it, we may as well stop playing this game of fancy.  It is one of\nthe first conditions of enjoying a book, as it is of all successful\nhypnotism, that the reader surrenders up his will to the writer, who,\nof course, guarantees to return it to him at the close of the volume.\nIf you say that no young lady would have behaved as I have presently to\nrelate of Nicolete, that no parents were ever so accommodating in the\nworld of reality, I reply,--No doubt you are right, but none the less\nwhat I have to tell is true and really did happen, for all that. And\nnot only did it happen, but to the whimsically minded, to the true\nchildren of fancy, it will seem the most natural thing in the world.\nNo doubt they will wonder why I have made such a preamble about it, as\nindeed, now I think of it, so do I.\n\nAgain I claim exemption in this wandering history from all such\ndescriptive drudgery upon second, third, and fourth dramatis\npersonsonae as your thorough-going novelist must undertake with a good\ngrace.  Like a host and hostess at a reception, the poor novelist has\nto pretend to be interested in everybody,--in the dull as in the\nbrilliant, in the bore as in the beauty.  I'm afraid I should never do\nas a novelist, for I should waste all my time with the heroine; whereas\nthe true novelist is expected to pay as much attention to the heroine's\nparents as though he were a suitor for her hand.  Indeed, there is no\nrelative of hero or heroine too humble or stupid for such a novelist as\nthe great Balzac.  He will invite the dullest of them to stay with him\nfor quite prolonged visits, and without a murmur set apart a suite of\nchapters for their accommodation.  I'm not sure that the humanity of\nthe reader in these cases is of such comprehensive sympathy as the\nnovelist's, and it may well be that the novelist undertakes all such\nhard labour under a misapprehension of the desires of the reader, who,\nas a rule, I fancy, is as anxious to join the ladies as the novelist\nhimself.  Indeed, I believe that there is an opportunity for a new form\nof novel, in which the novelist, as well as the reader, will skip all\nthe dull people, and merely indicate such of them as are necessary to\nthe action by an outline or a symbol, compressing their familiar\npsychology, and necessary plot-interferences with the main characters,\ninto recognised formulae.  For the benefit of readers voracious for\neverything about everybody, schedule chapters might be provided by\ninferior novelists, good at painting say tiresome bourgeois fathers,\ngouty uncles and brothers in the army, as sometimes in great pictures\nwe read that the sheep in the foreground have been painted by Mr.\nSo-and-so, R.A.\n\nThe Major-General and his Lady were taking the waters at Wiesbaden.\nThat was all I knew of Nicolete's parents, and all I needed to know;\nwith the exception of one good action,--at her urgent entreaty they had\nleft Nicolete behind them, with no other safeguard than a charming\nyoung lady companion, whose fitness for her sacred duties consisted in\na temperament hardly less romantic and whimsical than Nicolete's own.\nShe was too charming to deserve the name of obstacle; and as there was\nno other--\n\nBut I admit that the cart has got a little in front of the horse, and I\ngrow suddenly alarmed lest the reader should be suspecting me of an\nelopement, or some such romantic vulgarity.  If he will only put any\nsuch thoughts from his mind, I promise to proceed with the story in a\nbrief and business-like manner forthwith.\n\nWe are back once more at the close of the last chapter, in Nicolete's\nbook-bower in the wildwood.  It is an hour or two later, and the\nafternoon sun is flooding with a searching glory all the secret places\nof the woodland.  Hidden nooks and corners, unused to observation,\nsuddenly gleam and blush in effulgent exposure,--like lovers whom the\nunexpected turning on of a light has revealed kissing in the dark,--and\nare as suddenly, unlike the lovers, left in their native shade again.\nIt was that rich afternoon sunlight that loves to flash into teacups as\nthough they were crocuses, that loves to run a golden finger along the\nbeautiful wrinkles of old faces and light up the noble hollows of\nage-worn eyes; the sunlight that loves to fall with transfiguring beam\non the once dear book we never read, or, with malicious\ninquisitiveness, expose to undreamed-of detection the undusted picture,\nor the gold-dusted legs of remote chairs, which the poor housemaid has\nforgotten.\n\nSo in Nicolete's bower it illuminated with strange radiancy the dainty\ndisorder of deserted lunch, made prisms out of the wine-glasses,\npainted the white cloth with wedge-shaped rainbows, and flooded the\ncavernous interiors of the half-eaten fowl with a pathetic yellow\ntorchlight.\n\nLeaving that melancholy relic of carnivorous appetite, it turned its\nbold gold gaze on Nicolete.  No need to transfigure her! But, heavens!\nhow grandly her young face took the great kiss of the god!  Then it\nfell for a tender moment on the jaundiced page of my old Boccaccio,--a\nrare edition, which I had taken from my knapsack to indulge myself with\nthe appreciation of a connoisseur. Next minute \"the unobstructed beam\"\nwas shining right into the knapsack itself, for all the world like one\nof those little demon electric lights with which the dentist makes a\nmomentary treasure-cave of your distended jaws, flashing with startled\nstalactite. At the same moment Nicolete's starry eyes took the same\ndirection; then there broke from her her lovely laughter, merry and\ninextinguishable.\n\nOnce more, need I say, my petticoat had played me false--or should I\nnot say true? For there was its luxurious lace border, a thing for the\nsoft light of the boudoir, or the secret moonlight of love's permitted\neyes, alone to see, shamelessly brazening it out in this terrible\nsunlight.  Obviously there was but one way out of the dilemma, to\nconfess my pilgrimage to Nicolete, and reveal to her all the fanciful\nabsurdity to which, after all, I owed the sight of her.\n\n\"So that is why you pleaded so hard for that poor trout,\" she said,\nwhen I had finished.  \"Well, you are a fairy prince indeed! Now, do you\nknow what the punishment of your nonsense is to be?\"\n\n\"Is it very severe and humiliating?\" I asked.\n\n\"You must judge of that.  It is--to take me with you!\"\n\n\"You,--what do you mean?\"\n\n\"Yes,--not for good and all, of course, but just for, say, a fortnight,\njust a fortnight of rambles and adventures, and then to deliver me safe\nhome again where you found me--\"\n\n\"But it is impossible,\" I almost gasped in surprise.  \"Of course you\nare not serious?\"\n\n\"I am, really, and you will take me, won't you?\" she continued\npleadingly. \"You don't know how we women envy you men those wonderful\nwalking-tours we can only read about in Hazlitt or Stevenson. We are\nnot allowed to move without a nurse or a footman.  From the day we are\nborn to the day we die, we are never left a moment to ourselves.  But\nyou--you can go out into the world, the mysterious world, do as you\nwill, go where you will, wander here, wander there, follow any bye-way\nthat takes your fancy, put up at old inns, make strange acquaintances,\nhave all kinds of romantic experiences--  Oh, to be a man for a\nfortnight, your younger brother for a fortnight!\"\n\n\"It is impossible!\" I repeated.\n\n\"It isn't at all,\" she persisted, with a fine blush.  \"If you will only\nbe nice and kind, and help me to some Rosalind's clothes. You have only\nto write to your tailors, or send home for a spare suit of\nclothes,--with a little managing yours would just fit me, you're not so\nmuch taller,--and then we could start, like two comrades, seeking\nadventures.  Oh, how glorious it would be!\"\n\nIt was in vain that I brought the batteries of common-sense to bear\nupon her whim.  I raised every possible objection in vain.\n\nI pointed out the practical difficulties. There were her parents.\n\nWeren't they drinking the waters at Wiesbaden, and weren't they to go\non drinking them for another three weeks?  My fancy made a picture of\nthem distended with three weeks' absorption of mineral springs.  Then\nthere was her companion.  Nicolete was confident of her assistance.\nThen I tried vilifying myself.  How could she run the risk of trusting\nherself to such intimate companionship with a man whom she hadn't known\nhalf a dozen hours?  This she laughed to scorn.  Presently I was silent\nfrom sheer lack of further objections; and need I say that all the\nwhile there had been a traitor impulse in my heart, a weak sweetness\nurging me on to accept the pretty chance which the good genius of my\npilgrimage had so evidently put in my way,--for, after all, what harm\ncould it do?  With me Nicolete was, indeed, safe,--that, of course, I\nknew,--and safely she should come back home again after her little\nfrolic.  All that was true enough.  And how charming it would be to\nhave such a dainty companion! then the fun, the fancy, the whim of it\nall.  What was the use of setting out to seek adventures if I didn't\npursue them when found.\n\nWell, the long and short of it was that I agreed to undertake the\nadventure, provided that Nicolete could win over the lady whom at the\nbeginning of the chapter I declared too charming to be described as an\nobstacle.\n\nBy nine o'clock the following morning the fairy tailors, as Nicolete\ncalled them, were at work on the fairy clothes, and, at the end of\nthree days, there came by parcel-post a bulky unromantic-looking\nbrown-paper parcel, which it was my business to convey to Nicolete\nunder cover of the dark.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VII\n\nFROM THE MORNING STAR TO THE MOON\n\nI quite realise that this book is written perhaps only just in time for\nthe motive of these two or three chapters to be appreciated in its\nancient piquancy.  Very soon, alas! the sexes will be robbed of one of\nthe first and most thrilling motives of romance, the motive of As You\nLike It, the romance of wearing each other's clothes.  Alas, that every\nadvance of reason should mean a corresponding retreat of romance!  It\nis only reasonable that woman, being--have you yet realised the\nfact?--a biped like her brothers, should, when she takes to her\nbrothers' recreations, dress as those recreations demand; and yet the\ndeath of Rosalind is a heavy price to pay for the lady bicyclist. So\nsoon as the two sexes wear the same clothes, they may as well wear\nnothing; the game of sex is up.  In this matter, as in others, we\ncannot both have our cake and eat it.  All romance, like all\ntemptation, is founded on the Fascination of the Exception. So soon as\nthe exception becomes, instead of merely proving, the rule, that\nparticular avenue of romance is closed. The New Woman of the future\nwill be the woman with the petticoats, she who shall restore the\nancient Eleusinian mysteries of the silk skirt and the tea-gown.\n\nHappily for me, my acquaintance among the Rosalinds of the bicycle, at\nthis period of my life, was but slight, and thus no familiarity with\nthe tweed knickerbocker feminine took off the edge of my delight on\nfirst beholding Nicolete clothed in like manhood with ourselves, and\nyet, delicious paradox! looking more like a woman than ever.\n\nDuring those three days while the fairy tailors were at work our\nfriendship had not been idle.  Indeed, some part of each day we had\nspent diligently learning each other, as travellers to distant lands\nacross the Channel work hard at phrase-book and Baedeker the week\nbefore their departure. Meanwhile too I had made the acquaintance of\nthe charming lady Obstacle,--as it proved so unfair to call her,--and\nby some process of natural magnetism we had immediately won each\nother's hearts, so that on the moonlight night on which I took the\nriver path with my brown-paper parcel there was no misgiving in my\nheart,--nothing but harping and singing, and blessings on the river\nthat seemed all silver with the backs of magic trout.  As I thought of\nall I owed that noble fish, I kneeled by the river's bearded lip, among\nthe nettles and the meadowsweet, and swore by the inconstant moon that\ntrout and I were henceforth kinsmen, and that between our houses should\nbe an eternal amity.  The chub and the dace and the carp, not to speak\nof that Chinese pirate the pike, might still look to it, when I came\nforth armed with rod and line; but for me and my house the trout is\nhenceforth sacred. By the memory of the Blessed Saint Izaak, I swore it!\n\nMy arrival at Beaucaire was one of great excitement.  Nicolete and the\nObstacle were both awaiting me, for the mysteries of masculine attire\nwere not to be explored alone. The parcel was snatched quite\nunceremoniously from my hands, the door shut upon me, and I laughingly\nbidden go listen to the nightingale.  I was not long in finding one,\nnor, being an industrious phrase-maker, did I waste my time, for,\nbefore I was summoned to behold Nicolete in all her boyhood, I had\nfound occasion and moonlight to remark to my pocket-book that, Though\nall the world has heard the song of the Nightingale to the Rose, only\nthe Nightingale has heard the answer of the Rose.  This I hurriedly hid\nin my heart for future conversation, as the pre-arranged tinkle of the\nsilver bell called me to the rose.\n\nWould, indeed, that I were a nightingale to sing aright the beauty of\nthat rose with which, think of it, I was to spend a whole\nfortnight,--yes, no less than fourteen wonderful days.\n\nThe two girls were evidently proud of themselves at having succeeded so\nwell with the mysterious garments.  There were one or two points on\nwhich they needed my guidance, but they were unimportant; and when at\nlast Nicolete would consent to stand up straight and let me have a good\nlook at her,--for, poor child! she was as shy and shrinking as though\nshe had nothing on,--she made a very pretty young man indeed.\n\nShe didn't, I'm afraid, look like a young man of our degenerate day.\nShe was far too beautiful and distinguished for that. Besides, her dark\ncurling hair, quite short for a woman, was too long, and her eyes--like\nthe eyes of all poets--were women's eyes.  She looked, indeed, like one\nof those wonderful boys of the Italian Renaissance, whom you may still\nsee at the National Gallery, whose beauty is no denial, but rather the\nstamp of their slender, supple strength, young painters and sculptors\nwho held the palette for Leonardo, or wielded the chisel for\nMichelangelo, and anon threw both aside to take up sword for Guelf or\nGhibelline in the narrow streets of Florence.\n\nHer knapsack was already packed, and its contents included a serge\nskirt \"in case of emergencies.\"  Already, she naughtily reminded me, we\npossessed a petticoat between us.\n\nThe brief remainder of the evening passed in excited chatter and\ncigarettes, and in my instructing Nicolete in certain tricks of\nmasculine deportment.  The chief difficulty I hardly like mentioning;\nand if the Obstacle had not been present, I certainly dare not have\nspoken of it to Nicolete.  I mean that she was so shy about her pretty\nlegs.  She couldn't cross them with any successful nonchalance.\n\n\"You must take your legs more for granted, dear Nicolete,\" I summoned\ncourage to say.  \"The nonchalance of the legs is the first lesson to be\nlearnt in such a masquerade as this.  You must regard them as so much\nbone and iron, rude skeleton joints and shins, as though they were the\nbones of the great elk or other extinct South Kensington\nspecimen,\"--\"not,\" I added in my heart, \"as the velvet and ivory which\nthey are.\"\n\nWe had agreed to start with the sun on the morrow, so as to get clear\nof possible Peeping Toms; and when good-nights had been said, and I was\nonce more swinging towards my inn, it seemed but an hour or two, as\nindeed it was, before I heard four o'clock drowsily announced through\nmy bedroom door, and before I was once more striding along that\nriver-bank all dew-silvered with last night's moonlight, the sun\nrubbing his great eye on the horizon, the whole world yawning through\ndainty bed-clothes of mist, and here and there a copse-full of birds\ncongratulating themselves on their early rising.\n\nNicolete was not quite ready, so I had to go listen to the lark, about\nwhom, alas! I could find nothing to say to my pocket-book, before\nNicolete, armed cap-a-pie with stick and knapsack, appeared at the door\nof her chalet.\n\nThe Obstacle was there to see us start. She and Nicolete exchanged many\nkisses which were hard to bear, and the first quarter of an hour of our\njourney was much obstructed by the farewells of her far-fluttering\nhandkerchief.  When at last we were really alone, I turned and looked\nat Nicolete striding manfully at my side, just to make sure that it was\nreally true.\n\n\"Well, we're in for it now,\" I said; \"aren't you frightened?\"\n\n\"Oh, it's wonderful,\" she replied; \"don't spoil it by talking.\"\n\nAnd I didn't; for who could hope to compete with the sun, who was\nmaking the whole dewy world shake with laughter at his brilliancy, or\nwith the birds, any one of whom was a poet at least equal to Herrick?\n\nPresently we found ourselves at four crossroads, with a four-fingered\npost in the centre. We had agreed to leave our destination to chance.\nWe read the sign-post.\n\n\"Which shall we choose?\" I said,--\n\n\"Aucassin, true love and fair, To what land do we repair?\"\n\n\n\"Don't you think this one,\" she replied, \"this one?--To the Moon!\"\n\n\"Certainly, we couldn't find a prettier place; but it's a long way,\" I\nreplied, looking up at the sky, all roses and pearls,--\"a long way from\nthe Morning Star to the Moon.\"\n\n\"All the longer to be free,\" cried Nicolete, recklessly.\n\n\"So be it,\" I assented.  \"Allons--to the Moon!\"\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VIII\n\nTHE KIND OF THING THAT HAPPENS IN THE MOON\n\nTwo friends of my youth, with whom it would be hopeless to attempt\ncompetition, have described the star-strewn journey to the moon.  It is\nnot for me to essay again where the ingenious M. Jules Verne and Mr.\nWilliam Morris have preceded me. Besides, the journey is nowadays much\nmore usual, and therefore much less adventurous, than when those\nrevered writers first described it. In the middle ages a journey to the\nmoon with a woman you loved was a very perilous matter indeed.  Even in\nthe last century the roads were much beset with danger; but in our own\nday, like most journeys, it is accomplished with ease and safety in a\nfew hours.\n\nHowever, to the latter-day hero, whose appetite for dragons is not\nkeen, this absence of adventure is perhaps rather pleasurable than\notherwise; and I confess that I enjoyed the days I spent on foot with\nNicolete none the less because they passed in tranquil\nuneventfulness,--that is, without events of the violent kind.  Of\ncourse, all depends on what you call an event.  We were not waylaid by\nrobbers, we fed and slept unchallenged at inns, we escaped collision\nwith the police, and we encountered no bodily dangers of any kind; yet\nshould I not call the journey uneventful, nor indeed, I think, would\nNicolete.\n\nTo me it was one prolonged divine event, and, with such daily\nintercourse with Nicolete, I never dreamed of craving for any other\nexcitement.  To walk from morning to evening by her side, to minister\nto her moods, to provide such entertainment as I might for her brain,\nand watch like a father over her physical needs; to note when she was\nweary and too proud to show it, and to pretend to be done up myself; to\nchoose for her the easiest path, and keep my eyes open for wayside\nflowers and every country surprise,--these, and a hundred other\nattentions, kept my heart and mind in busy service.\n\nTo picnic by some lonely stream-side on a few sandwiches, a flask of\nclaret, and a pennyworth of apples; to talk about the books we loved;\nto exchange our hopes and dreams,--we asked nothing better than this\nsimple fare.\n\nAnd so a week went by.  But, though so little had seemed to happen, and\nthough our walking record was shamefully modest, yet, imperceptible as\nthe transition had been, we were, quite insensibly indeed, and\nunacknowledged, in a very different relation to each other than when we\nhad started out from the Morning Star.  In fact, to make no more words\nabout it, I was head over heels in love with Nicolete, and I think,\nwithout conceit, I may say that Nicolete was rapidly growing rather\nfond of me.  Apart from anything else, we were such excellent chums. We\ngot along together as if indeed we had been two brothers, equable in\nour tempers and one in our desires.\n\nAt last the feeling on my side became so importunate that I could no\nlonger keep silence.\n\nWe were seated together taking tea at a small lonely inn, whose windows\nlooked out over a romantic little lake, backed by Salvator Rosa\npine-woods.  The sun was beginning to grow dreamy, and the whole world\nto wear a dangerously sentimental expression.\n\nI forget exactly what it was, but something in our talk had set us\nglowing, had touched tender chords of unexpected sympathy, and\ninvoluntarily I stretched out my hand across the corner of the table\nand pressed Nicolete's hand as it rested on the cloth.  She did not\nwithdraw it, and our eyes met with a steady gaze of love.\n\n\"Nicolete,\" I said presently, when I could speak, \"it is time for you\nto be going back home.\"\n\n\"Why?\" she asked breathlessly.\n\n\"Because,\" I answered, \"I must love you if you stay.\"\n\n\"Would you then bid me go?\" she said.\n\n\"Nicolete,\" I said, \"don't tempt me.  Be a good girl and go home.\"\n\n\"But supposing I don't want to go home,\" she said; \"supposing--oh,\nsupposing I love you too?  Would you still bid me go?\"\n\n\"Yes,\" I said.  \"In that case it would be even more imperative.\"\n\n\"Aucassin!\"\n\n\"It is true, it is true, dear Nicolete.\"\n\n\"Then, Aucassin,\" she replied, almost sternly, in her great girlish\nlove, \"this is true also,--I love you.  I have never loved, shall never\nlove, any man but you!\"\n\n\"Nicolete!\"\n\n\"Aucassin!\"\n\nThere were no more words spoken between us for a full hour that\nafternoon.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER IX\n\nWRITTEN BY MOONLIGHT\n\nI knew deep down in my heart that it couldn't last, yet how deny myself\nthese roses, while the opportunity of gathering them was mine!--the\nmore so, as I believed it would do no harm to Nicolete.  At all events,\na day or two more or less of moonshine would make no matter either way.\nAnd so all next day we walked hand in hand through Paradise.\n\nIt has been said by them of old time, and our fathers have told us,\nthat the kiss of first love, the first kiss of the first woman we love,\nis beyond all kisses sweet; and true it is.  But true is it also that\nno less sweet is the first kiss of the last woman we love.\n\nPutting my faith in old saws, as a young man will, I had never dreamed\nto know again a bliss so divinely passionate and pure as came to me\nwith every glance of Nicolete's sweet eyes, with every simple pressure\nof her hand; and the joy that was mine when sometimes, stopping on our\nway, we would press together our lips ever so gravely and tenderly,\nseems too holy even to speak of.\n\nThe holy angels could not have loved Nicolete with a purer love, a love\nfreer from taint of any earthly thought, than I, a man of thirty,\nblase, and fed from my youth upon the honeycomb of woman.\n\nIt was curious that the first difficulty of our pilgrimage should\nbefall us the very next day.  Coming towards nightfall to a small inn\nin a lonely unpopulated countryside, we found that the only\naccommodation the inn afforded was one double-bedded room, and there\nwas no other inn for at least ten miles.  I think I was more troubled\nthan Nicolete.  When, after interviewing the landlady, I came and told\nher of the dilemma, where she sat in the little parlour wearied out\nwith the day's walk, she blushed, it is true, but seemed little put\nabout.  Indeed, she laughed, and said it was rather fun, \"like\nsomething out of Sterne,\"--of such comfort is a literary reference in\nall seasons and circumstances,--and then she added, with a sweet look\nthat sent the blood rioting about my heart, \"It won't matter so much,\nwill it, love, NOW?\"\n\nThere proved nothing for it but to accept the situation, and we made\nthe arrangement that Nicolete was to slip off to bed first, and then\nput out the light and go to sleep.  However, when I followed her,\nhaving sat up as long as the landlady's patience would endure, I found\nthat, though she had blown out the candle, she had forgotten to put out\nthe moon, which shone as though it were St. Agnes' Eve across half the\nroom.\n\nI stole in very shyly, kept my eyes sternly from Nicolete's white bed,\nthough, as I couldn't shut my ears, the sound of her breathing came to\nme with indescribable sweetness.  After I had lain among the sheets\nsome five or ten minutes, I was suddenly startled by a little voice\nwithin the room saying,--\n\n\"I'm not asleep.\"\n\n\"Well, you should be, naughty child. Now shut your eyes and go to\nsleep,--and fair dreams and sweet repose,\" I replied.\n\n\"Won't you give me one little good-night kiss?\"\n\n\"I gave you one downstairs.\"\n\n\"Is it very wicked to want another?\"\n\nThere was not a foot between our two beds, so I bent over and took her\nsoft white shoulders in my arms and kissed her. All the heaped-up\nsweetness of the whitest, freshest flowers of the spring seemed in my\nembrace as I kissed her, so soft, so fragrant, so pure; and as the\nmoonlight was the white fire in our blood.  Softly I released her,\nstroked her brown hair, and turned again to my pillow.  Presently the\nlittle voice was in the room again,--\n\n\"Mayn't I hold your hand?  Somehow I feel lonely and frightened.\"\n\nSo our hands made a bridge across which our dreams might pass through\nthe night, and after a little while I knew that she slept.\n\nAs I lay thus holding her hand, and listening to her quiet breathing, I\nrealised once more what my young Alastor had meant by the purity of\nhigh passion.  For indeed the moonlight that fell across her bosom was\nnot whiter than my thoughts, nor could any kiss--were it even such a\nkiss as Venus promised to the betrayer of Psyche--even in its fiercest\ndelirium, be other than dross compared with the wild white peace of\nthose silent hours when we lay thus married and maiden side by side.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER X\n\nHOW ONE MAKES LOVE AT THIRTY\n\nMy sleeplessness while Nicolete slept had not been all ecstasy, for I\nhad come to a bitter resolution; and next morning, when we were once\nmore on our way, I took a favourable opportunity of conveying it to\nNicolete.\n\n\"Nicolete,\" I said, as we rested awhile by the roadside, \"I have\nsomething serious to say to you.\"\n\n\"Yes, dear,\" she said, looking rather frightened.\n\n\"Well, dear, it is this,--our love must end with our holiday. No good\ncan come of it.\"\n\n\"But oh, why?  I love you.\"\n\n\"Yes, and I love you,--love you as I never thought I could love again.\nYet I know it is all a dangerous dream,--a trick of our brains, an\nillusion of our tastes.\"\n\n\"But oh, why?  I love you.\"\n\n\"Yes, you do to-day, I know; but it couldn't last.  I believe I could\nlove you for ever; but even so, it wouldn't be right. You couldn't go\non loving me.  I am too old, too tired, too desillusione, perhaps too\nselfish.\"\n\n\"I will love you always!\" said girl Nicolete.\n\n\"Whereas you,\" I continued, disregarding the lovely refrain of her\ntear-choked voice, \"are standing on the wonderful threshold of life,\nwaiting in dreamland for the dawn. And it will come, and with it the\nfairy prince, with whom you shall wander hand in hand through all its\nfairy rose-gardens; but I, dear Nicolete,--I am not he.\"\n\nNicolete did not speak.\n\n\"I know,\" I continued, pressing her hand, \"that I may seem young enough\nto talk like this, but some of us get through life quicker than others,\nand when we say, 'It is done,' it is no use for onlookers to say, 'Why,\nit is just beginning!'  Believe me, Nicolete, I am not fit husband for\nyou.\"\n\n\"Then shall I take no other,\" said Nicolete, with set face.\n\n\"Oh, yes, you will,\" I rejoined; \"let but a month or two pass, and you\nwill see how wise I was, after all.  Besides, there are other reasons,\nof which there is no need to speak--\"\n\n\"What reasons?\"\n\n\"Well,\" I said, half laughing, \"there is the danger that, after all, we\nmightn't agree.  There is nothing so perilously difficult as the daily\nintercourse of two people who love each other.  You are too young to\nrealise its danger.  And I couldn't bear to see our love worn away by\nthe daily dropping of tears, not to speak of its being rent by the\ndynamite of daily quarrels. We know each other's tastes, but we know\nhardly anything of each other's natures.\"\n\nNicolete looked at me strangely.  'Troth, it was a strange way to make\nlove, I knew.\n\n\"And what else?\" she asked somewhat coldly.\n\n\"Well, then, though it's not a thing one cares to speak of, I'm a poor\nman--\"\n\nNicolete broke through my sentence with a scornful exclamation.\n\n\"You,\" I continued straight on,--\"well, you have been accustomed to a\ncertain spaciousness and luxury of life.  This it would be out of my\npower to continue for you.  These are real reasons, very real reasons,\ndear Nicolete, though you may not think so now.  The law of the world\nin these matters is very right.  For the rich and the poor to marry is\nto risk, terribly risk, the very thing they would marry for--their\nlove.  Love is better an unmarried than a married regret.\"\n\nNicolete was silent again.\n\n\"Think of your little woodland chalet, and your great old trees in the\npark,--you couldn't live without them.  I have, at most, but one tree\nworth speaking of to offer you--\"\n\nI purposely waived the glamour which my old garden had for my mind, and\nwhich I wouldn't have exchanged for fifty parks.\n\n\"Trees!\" retorted Nicolete,--\"what are trees?\"\n\n\"Ah, my dear girl, they are a good deal,--particularly when they are\ngenealogical, as my one tree is not.\"\n\n\"Aucassin,\" she said suddenly, almost fiercely, \"can you really jest?\nTell me this,--do you love me?\"\n\n\"I love you,\" I said simply; \"and it is just because I love you so much\nthat I have talked as I have done.  No man situated as I am who loved\nyou could have talked otherwise.\"\n\n\"Well, I have heard it all, weighed it all,\" said Nicolete, presently;\n\"and to me it is but as thistledown against the love within my heart.\nWill you cast away a woman who loves you for theories?  You know you\nlove me, know I love you.  We should have our trials, our ups and\ndowns, I know; but surely it is by those that true love learns how to\ngrow more true and strong.  Oh, I cannot argue!  Tell me again, do you\nlove me?\"\n\nAnd there she broke down and fell sobbing into my arms.  I consoled her\nas best I might, and presently she looked up at me through her tears.\n\n\"Tell me again,\" she said, \"that you love me, just as you did\nyesterday, and promise never to speak of all those cruel things again.\nAh! have you thought of the kind of men you would give me up to?\"\n\nAt that I confess I shuddered, and I gave her the required assurance.\n\n\"And you won't be wise and reasonable and ridiculous any more?\"\n\n\"No,\" I answered; adding in my mind, \"not, at all events, for the\npresent.\"\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XI\n\nHOW ONE PLAYS THE HERO AT THIRTY\n\nHad we only been able to see a day into the future, we might have\nspared ourselves this agonising, for all our doubts and fears were\nsuddenly dispersed in an entirely unexpected manner. Happily these\ninterior problems are not infrequently resolved by quite exterior\nforces.\n\nWe were sitting the following afternoon in one of those broad bay\nwindows such as one finds still in some old country inns, just thinking\nabout starting once more on our way, when suddenly Nicolete, who had\nbeen gazing out idly into the road, gave a little cry.  I followed her\nglance.  A carriage with arms on its panels had stopped at the inn, and\nas a smart footman opened the door, a fine grey-headed military-looking\nman stepped out and strode hurriedly up the inn steps.\n\n\"Aucassin,\" gasped Nicolete, \"it is my father!\"\n\nIt was too true.  The old man's keen eye had caught sight of Nicolete\nat the window also, and in another moment we were all three face to\nface.  I must do the Major-General the justice of saying that he made\nas little of a \"scene\" of it as possible.\n\n\"Now, my girl,\" he said, \"I have come to put an end to this nonsense.\nHave you a petticoat with you?  Well, go upstairs and get it on.  I\nwill wait for you here...  On you, sir, I shall waste no words.  From\nwhat I have heard, you are as moonstruck as my daughter.\"\n\n\"Of course,\" I stammered, \"I cannot expect you to understand the\nsituation, though I think, if you would allow me, I could in a very few\nwords make it somewhat clearer,--make you realise that, after all, it\nhas been a very innocent and childish escapade, in which there has been\nno harm and a great deal of pleasure--\"\n\nBut the Major-General cut me short.\n\n\"I should prefer,\" he said, \"not to discuss the matter.  I may say that\nI realise that my daughter has been safe in your hands, however\nfoolish,\"--for this I thanked him with a bow,--\"but I must add that\nyour eccentric acquaintance must end here--\"\n\nI said him neither yea nor nay; and while we stood in armed and\nembarrassed silence, Nicolete appeared with white face at the door,\nclothed in her emergency petticoat. Alas! it was for no such emergency\nas this that it had been destined that merry night when she had packed\nit in her knapsack. With a stern bow her father turned from me to join\nher; but she suddenly slipped past him, threw her arms round me, and\nkissed me one long passionate kiss.\n\n\"Aucassin, be true,\" she cried, \"I will never forget you,--no one shall\ncome between us;\" and then bursting into tears, she buried her face in\nher hands and followed her father from the room.\n\nIn another moment she had been driven away, and I sat as one stupefied\nin the inn window.  But a few short minutes ago she had been sitting\nmerrily prattling by my side, and now I was once more as lonely as if\nwe had never met.  Presently I became conscious in my reverie of a\nlittle crumpled piece of paper on the floor.  I picked it up. It was a\nlittle note pencilled in her bedroom at the last moment.  \"Aucassin,\"\nit ran, just like her last passionate words, \"be true. I will never\nforget you.  Stay here till I write to you, and oh, write to me soon!--\nYour broken-hearted Nicolete.\"\n\nAs I read, I saw her lovely young face, radiant with love and sorrow as\nI had last seen it, and pressing the precious little letter to my lips,\nI said fervently, \"Yes, Nicolete, I will be true.\"\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XII\n\nIN WHICH I REVIEW MY ACTIONS AND RENEW MY RESOLUTIONS\n\nNo doubt the youthful reader will have but a poor opinion of me after\nthe last two chapters.  He will think that in the scene with the\nMajor-General I acted with lamentably little spirit, and that generally\nmy friend Alastor would have proved infinitely more worthy of the\nsituation.  It is quite true, I confess it. The whole episode was made\nfor Alastor.  Nicolete and he were born for each other.  Alas! it is\none of the many drawbacks of experience that it frequently prevents our\nbehaving with spirit.\n\nI must be content to appeal to the wiser and therefore sadder reader,\nof whom I have but a poor opinion if he too fails to understand me.\nHe, I think, will understand why I didn't promptly assault the\nMajor-General, seize Nicolete by the waist, thrust her into her\nancestral carriage, haul the coachman from his box, and, seizing the\nreins, drive away in triumph before astonishment had time to change\ninto pursuit. Truly it had been but the work of a moment, and there was\nonly one consideration which prevented my following this\nnow-I-call-that-heroic course. It is a consideration I dare hardly\nventure to write, and the confession of which will, I know, necessitate\nmy changing my age back again to thirty on the instant.  Oh, be\nmerciful, dear romantic reader!  I didn't strike the Major-General,\nbecause, oh, because I AGREED WITH HIM!\n\nI loved Nicolete, you must have felt that. She was sweet to me as the\nbunch of white flowers that, in their frail Venetian vase, stand so\ndaintily on my old bureau as I write, doing their best to sweeten my\nthoughts. Dear was she to me as the birds that out in the old garden\nyonder sing and sing their best to lift up my leaden heart.  She was\ndear as the Spring itself, she was only less dear than Autumn.\n\nYes, black confession! after the first passion of her loss, the\nimmediate ache of her young beauty had passed, and I was able to\nanalyse what I really felt, I not only agreed with him, I thanked God\nfor the Major-General!  He had saved me from playing the terrible part\nof executioner. He had just come in time to behead the Lady Jane Grey\nof our dreams.\n\nI should have no qualms about tightening the rope round the neck of\nsome human monster, or sticking a neat dagger or bullet into a\ndangerous, treacherous foe, but to kill a dream is a sickening\nbusiness.  It goes on moaning in such a heart-breaking fashion, and you\nnever know when it is dead.  All on a sudden some night it will come\nwailing in the wind outside your window, and you must blacken your\nheart and harden your face with another strangling grip of its slim\nappealing throat, another blow upon its angel eyes.  Even then it will\nrecover, and you will go on being a murderer, making for yourself day\nby day a murderer's face, without the satisfaction of having really\nmurdered.\n\nBut what of Nicolete? do you exclaim. Have you no thought for her,\nbleeding her heart away in solitude?  Can you so soon forget those\nappealing eyes?  Yes, I have thought for her.  Would God that I could\nbear for her those growing pains of the heart! and I shall never forget\nthose farewell eyes.  But then, you see, I had firmly realised this,\nthat she would sooner recover from our separation than from our\nmarriage; that her love for me, pretty and poignant and dramatic while\nit lasted, was a book-born, book-fed dream, which must die soon or\nlate,--the sooner the better for the peace of the dreams that in the\ncourse of nature would soon spring up to take its place.\n\nBut while I realised all this, and, with a veritable aching of the\nheart at the loss of her, felt a curious satisfaction at the turn of\nevents, still my own psychology became all the more a puzzle to me, and\nI asked myself, with some impatience, what I would be at, and what it\nwas I really wanted.\n\nHere had I but a few moments ago been holding in my hands the very\ndream I had set out to find, and here was I secretly rejoicing to be\nrobbed of it!  If Nicolete did not fulfil the conditions of that\nmystical Golden Girl, in professed search for whom I had set out that\nspring morning, well, the good genius of my pilgrimage felt it time to\nresign.  Better give it up at once, and go back to my books and my\nbachelorhood, if I were so difficult to please.  No wonder my kind\nprovidence felt provoked. It had provided me with the sweetest\npink-and-porcelain dream of a girl, and might reasonably have concluded\nthat his labours on my behalf were at an end.\n\nBut, really, there is no need to lecture me upon the charms and virtues\nof Nicolete, for I loved them from the first moment of our strange\nintroduction, and I dream of them still.  There was indeed only one\nquality of womanhood in which she was lacking, and in which, after much\nserious self-examination, I discovered the reason of my instinctive\nself-sacrifice of her,--SHE HAD NEVER SUFFERED.  As my heart had warned\nme at the beginning, \"she was hoping too much from life to spend one's\ndays with.\" She lacked the subtle half-tones of experience. She lacked\nall that a pretty wrinkle or two might have given.  There was no\nshadowy melancholy in her sky-clear eyes.  She was gay indeed, and had\na certain childish humour; but she had none of that humour which comes\nof the resigned perception that the world is out of joint, and that you\nwere never born to set it right. These characteristics I had yet to\nfind in woman.  There was still, therefore, an object to my quest.\nIndeed my experience had provided me with a formula.  I was in search\nof a woman who, in addition to every other feminine charm and virtue,\nwas a woman who had suffered.\n\nWith this prayer I turned once more to the genius of my pilgrimage.\n\"Grant me,\" I asked, \"but this--A WOMAN WHO HAS SUFFERED!\" and,\napparently as a consequence, he became once more quite genial.  He\nseemed to mean that a prayer so easy to grant would put any god into a\ngood temper; and possibly he smiled with a deeper meaning too.\n\n\n\n\nBOOK III\n\n\n\nCHAPTER I\n\nIN WHICH I RETURN TO MY RIGHT AGE AND ENCOUNTER A COMMON OBJECT OF THE\nCOUNTRY\n\nAnd so when the days of my mourning for Nicolete were ended (and in\nthis sentence I pass over letters to and fro,--letters wild from\nNicolete, letters wise from Aucassin, letters explanatory and\napologetic from the Obstacle--how the Major-General had suddenly come\nhome quite unexpectedly and compelled her to explain Nicolete's\nabsence, etc., etc.  Dear Obstacle! I should rather have enjoyed a\npilgrimage with her too)--I found myself one afternoon again upon the\nroad.  The day had been very warm and dusty, and had turned sleepy\ntowards tea-time.\n\nI had now pretty clearly in my mind what I wanted.  This time it was,\nall other things equal, to be \"a woman who had suffered,\" and to this\nend, I had, before starting out once more, changed my age back again at\nthe inn and written \"Aetat. 30\" after my name in the visitors' book.\nAs a young man I was an evident failure, and so, having made the\ncountersign, I was speedily transformed to my old self; and I must say\nthat it was a most comfortable feeling, something like getting back\nagain into an old coat or an old pair of shoes.  I never wanted to be\nyoung again as long as I lived.  Youth was too much like the Sunday\nclothes of one's boyhood.  Moreover, I had a secret conviction that the\nwoman I was now in search of would prefer one who had had some\nexperience at being a man, who would bring her not the green plums of\nhis love, but the cunningly ripened nectarines, a man to whom love was\nsomething of an art as well as an inspiration.\n\nIt was in this frame of mind that I came upon the following scene.\n\nThe lane was a very cloistral one, with a ribbon of gravelly road,\nbordered on each side with a rich margin of turf and a scramble of\nblackberry bushes, green turf banks and dwarf oak-trees making a rich\nand plenteous shade.  My attention was caught firstly by a bicycle\nlying carelessly on the turf, and secondly and lastly by a graceful\nwoman's figure, recumbent and evidently sleeping against the turf bank,\nwell tucked in among the afternoon shadows.  My coming had not aroused\nher, and so I stole nearer to her on tiptoe.\n\nShe was a pretty woman, of a striking modern type, tall,\nwell-proportioned, strong, I should say, with a good complexion that\nhad evidently been made just a little better.  But her most striking\nfeature was an opulent mass of dark red hair, which had fallen in some\ndisorder and made quite a pillow for her head. Her hat was off, lying\nin its veil by her side, and a certain general abandon of her\nfigure,--which was clothed in a short cloth skirt, cut with that\nunmistakable touch which we call style--betokened weariness that could\nno longer wait for rest.\n\nPoor child! she was tired out.  She must never be left to sleep on\nthere, for she seemed good to sleep till midnight.\n\nI turned to her bicycle, and, examining it with the air of a man who\nhad won silver cups in his day, I speedily discovered what had been the\nmischief.  The tire of the front wheel had been pierced, and a great\nthorn was protruding from the place. Evidently this had been too much\nfor poor Rosalind, and it was not unlikely that she had cried herself\nto sleep.\n\nI bent over her to look--yes, there were traces of tears.  Poor thing!\nThen I had a kindly human impulse.  I would mend the tire, having\nattended ambulance classes, do it very quietly so that she wouldn't\nhear, like the fairy cobblers who used to mend people's boots while\nthey slept, and then wait in ambush to watch the effect upon her when\nshe awoke.\n\nWhat do you think of the idea?\n\nBut one important detail I have omitted from my description of the\nsleeper.  Her left hand lay gloveless, and of the four rings on her\nthird finger one was a wedding-ring.\n\n\"Such red hair,--and a wedding-ring!\" I exclaimed inwardly. \"How this\nwoman must have suffered!\"\n\n\n\nCHAPTER II\n\nIN WHICH I HEAL A BICYCLE AND COME TO THE WHEEL OF PLEASURE\n\nMoving the bicycle a little away, so that my operations upon it might\nnot arouse her, I had soon made all right again, and when I laid it\nonce more where she had left it, she was still sleeping as sound as\never.  She had only to sleep long enough, a sly thought suggested, to\nnecessitate her ending her day's journey at the same inn as myself,\nsome five miles on the road.  One virtue at least the reader will allow\nto this history,--we are seldom far away from an inn in its pages.\nWhen I thought of that I sat stiller than ever, hardly daring to turn\nover the pages of Apuleius, which I had taken from my knapsack to\nbeguile the time, and, I confess, to give my eyes some other occupation\nthan the dangerous one of gazing upon her face, dangerous in more ways\nthan one, but particularly dangerous at the moment, because, as\neverybody knows, a steady gaze on a sleeping face is apt to awake the\nsleeper.  And she wasn't to be disturbed!\n\n\"No! she mustn't waken before seven at the latest,\" I said to myself,\nholding my breath and starting in terror at every noise. Once a great\nnoisy bee was within an ace of waking her, but I caught him with\ninspired dexterity, and he buzzed around her head no more.\n\nBut despite the providential loneliness of the road, there were one or\ntwo terrors that could not be disposed of so summarily. The worst of\nall was a heavy miller's cart which one could hardly crush to silence\nin one's handkerchief; but it went so slowly, and both man and horses\nwere so sleepy, that they passed unheard and unnoticing.\n\nA sprightly tramp promised greater difficulty, and nothing but some\nferocious pantomime and a shilling persuaded him to forego a choice\nfantasia of cockney humour.\n\nA poor tired Italian organ-grinder, tramping with an equally tired\nmonkey along the dusty roads, had to be bought off in a similar\nmanner,--though he only cost sixpence.  He gave me a Southern smile and\nshrug of comprehension, as one acquainted with affairs of the\nheart,--which was a relief after the cockney tramp's impudent\nexpression of, no doubt, a precisely similar sentiment.\n\nAnd then at last, just as my watch pointed to 6.50 (how well I remember\nthe exact moment!)  Rosalind awoke suddenly, as women and children do,\nsitting straight up on the instant, and putting up her hands to her\ntousled hair, with a half-startled \"Where am I?\"  When her hair was\nonce more \"respectable,\" she gave her skirts a shake, bent sideways to\npull up her stockings and tighten her garters, looked at her watch, and\nthen with an exclamation at the lateness of the hour, went over, with\nan air of desperate determination, to her bicycle.\n\n\"Now for this horrid puncture!\" were the first words I was to hear fall\nfrom her lips.\n\nShe sought for the wound in the india-rubber with growing bewilderment.\n\n\"Goodness!\" was her next exclamation, \"why, there's nothing wrong with\nit.  Can I have been dreaming?\"\n\n\"I hope your dreams have been pleasanter than that,\" I ventured at this\nmoment to stammer, rising, a startling apparition, from my ambush\nbehind a mound of brambles; and before she had time to take in the\nsituation I added that I hoped she'd excuse my little pleasantry, and\ntold her how I had noticed her and the wounded bicycle, et cetera, et\ncetera, as the reader can well imagine, without giving me the trouble\nof writing it all out.\n\nShe was sweetness itself on the instant.\n\n\"Excuse you!\" she said, \"I should think so.  Who wouldn't? You can't\ntell the load you've taken off my mind.  I'm sure I must have groaned\nin my sleep--for I confess I cried myself to sleep over it.\"\n\n\"I thought so,\" I said with gravity, and eyes that didn't dare to smile\noutright till they had permission, which, however, was not long\nwithheld them.\n\n\"How did you know?\"\n\n\"Oh, intuition, of course--who wouldn't have cried themselves to sleep,\nand so tired too!\"\n\n\"You're a nice sympathetic man, anyhow,\" she laughed; \"what a pity you\ndon't bicycle!\"\n\n\"Yes,\" I said, \"I would give a thousand pounds for a bicycle at this\nmoment.\"\n\n\"You ought to get a good one for that,\" she laughed,--\"all bright parts\nnickel, I suppose; indeed, you should get a real silver frame and gold\nhandle-bars for that, don't you think? Well, it would be nice all the\nsame to have your company a few miles, especially as it's growing\ndark,\" she added.\n\n\"Especially as it's growing dark,\" I repeated.\n\n\"You won't be going much farther to-night.  Have you fixed on your\ninn?\" I continued innocently.  She had--but that was in a town too far\nto reach to-night, after her long sleep.\n\n\"You might have wakened me,\" she said.\n\n\"Yes, it was stupid of me not to have thought of it,\" I answered,\noffering no explanation of the dead bee which at the moment I espied a\nlittle away in the grass, and saying nothing of the merry tramp and the\nmelancholy musician.\n\nThen we talked inns, and thus she fell beautifully into the pit which I\nhad digged for her; and it was presently arranged that she should ride\non to the Wheel of Pleasure and order a dinner, which she was to do me\nthe honour of sharing with me.\n\nI was to follow on foot as speedily as might be, and it was with a high\nheart that I strode along the sunset lanes, hearing for some time the\nchiming of her bell in front of me, till she had wheeled it quite out\nof hearing, and it was lost in the distance.\n\nI never did a better five miles in my life.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER III\n\nTWO TOWN MICE AT A COUNTRY INN.\n\nWhen I reached the Wheel of Pleasure, I found Rosalind awaiting me in\nthe coffee-room, looking fresh from a traveller's toilette, and with\nthe welcome news that dinner was on the way. By the time I had washed\noff the day's dust it was ready, and a merry meal it proved.  Rosalind\nhad none of Alastor's objections to the wine-list, so we drank an\nexcellent champagne; and as there seemed to be no one in the hotel but\nourselves, we made ourselves at home and talked and laughed, none\ndaring to make us afraid.\n\nAt first, on sitting down to table, we had grown momentarily shy, with\none of those sudden freaks of self-consciousness which occasionally\nsurprise one, when, midway in some slightly unconventional situation to\nwhich the innocence of nature has led us, we realise it--\"for an\ninstant and no more.\"\n\nPositively, I think that in the embarrassment of that instant I had\nmade some inspired remark to Rosalind about the lovely country which\nlay dreamy in the afterglow outside our window. Oh, yes, I remember the\nvery words.  They were \"What a heavenly landscape!\" or something\nequally striking.\n\n\"Yes,\" Rosalind had answered, \"it is almost as beautiful as the Strand!\"\n\nIf I'd known her better, I should have exclaimed, \"You dear!\" and I\nthink it possible that I did say something to that effect,--perhaps\n\"You dear woman!\"  At all events, the veil of self-consciousness was\nrent in twain at that remark, and our spirits rushed together at this\ntouch of London nature thus unexpectedly revealed.\n\nLondon!  I hadn't realised till this moment how I had been missing it\nall these days of rustication, and my heart went out to it with a vast\nhomesickness.\n\n\"Yes! the Strand,\" I repeated tenderly, \"the Strand--at night!\"\n\n\"Indeed, yes! what is more beautiful in the whole world?\" she joined in\nardently.\n\n\"The wild torrents of light, the passionate human music, the hansoms,\nthe white shirts and shawled heads, the theatres--\"\n\n\"Don't speak of them or you'll make me cry,\" said Rosalind.\n\n\"The little suppers after the theatre--\"\n\n\"Please don't,\" she cried, \"it is cruel;\" and I saw that her eyes were\nindeed glistening with tears.\n\n\"But, of course,\" I continued, to give a slight turn aside in our talk,\n\"it is very wrong of us to have such sophisticated tastes. We ought to\nlove these lonely hills and meadows far more. The natural man revels in\nsolitude, and wants no wittier company than birds and flowers.\nWordsworth made a constant companion of a pet daisy.  He seldom went\nabroad without one or two trotting at his side, and a skylark would\nkeep Shelley in society for a week.\"\n\n\"But they were poets,\" retorted Rosalind; \"you don't call poets\nnatural.  Why, they are the most unnatural of men.  The natural person\nloves the society of his kind, whereas the poet runs away from it.\"\n\n\"Well, of course, there are poets and poets, poets sociable and poets\nvery unsociable.  Wordsworth made the country, but Lamb made the town;\nand there is quite a band of poets nowadays who share his distaste for\nmountains, and take London for their muse. If you'll promise not to cry\nagain, I'll recall some lines by a friend of mine which were written\nfor town-tastes like ours.  But perhaps you know them?\"\n\nIt will gratify my friend to learn that Rosalind had the verses I refer\nto by heart, and started off humming,--\n\n  \"Ah, London, London, our delight,\n  Great flower that opens but at night,\n  Great city of the midnight sun,\n  Whose day begins when day is done...\n  Like dragon-flies the hansoms hover\n  With jewelled eyes to catch the lover;\"\n\nand so on, with a gusto of appreciation that must have been very\ngratifying to the author had he been present.\n\nThus perceiving a taste for a certain modern style of poetry in my\ncompanion, I bethought me of a poem which I had written on the roadside\na few days before, and which, I confess, I was eager to confide to some\nsympathetic ear.  I was diffident of quoting it after such lines as\nRosalind had recalled, but by the time we had reached our coffee, I\nplucked up courage to mention it.  I had, however, the less diffidence\nin that it would have a technical interest for her, being indeed no\nother than a song of cycling a deux which had been suggested by one of\nthose alarmist danger-posts always placed at the top of the pleasantest\nhills, sternly warning the cyclist that \"this hill is dangerous,\"--just\nas in life there is always some minatory notice-board frowning upon us\nin the direction we most desire to take.\n\nBut I omit further preface and produce the poem:--\n\n  \"This hill is dangerous,\" I said,\n       As we rode on together\n  Through sunny miles and sunny miles\n       Of Surrey heather;\n      \"This hill is dangerous--don't you think\n  We'd better walk it?\"\n      \"Or sit it out--more danger still!\"\n       She smiled--\"and talk it?\"\n\n  \"Are you afraid?\" she turned and cried\n        So very brave and sweetly,--\n  Oh that brave smile that takes the heart\n        Captive completely!\n\n  \"Afraid?\" I said, deep in her eyes\n        Recklessly gazing;\n  \"For you I'd ride into the sun\n        And die all blazing!\"\n\n  \"I never yet saw hill,\" I said,\n        \"And was afraid to take it;\n  I never saw a foolish law,\n        And feared to break it.\n  Who fears a hill or fears a law\n        With you beside him?\n  Who fears, dear star, the wildest sea\n        With you to guide him?\"\n\n  Then came the hill--a cataract,\n        A dusty swirl, before us;\n  The world stood round--a village world--\n       In fearful chorus.\n  Sure to be killed!  Sure to be killed!\n       O fools, how dare ye!\n  Sure to be killed--and serve us right!\n       Ah! love, but were we?\n\n  The hill was dangerous, we knew,\n       And knew that we must take it;\n  The law was strong,--that too we knew\n       Yet dared to break it.\n  And those who'd fain know how we fared\n       Follow and find us,\n  Safe on the hills, with all the world\n       Safely behind us.\n\n\nRosalind smiled as I finished.  \"I'm afraid,\" she said, \"the song is as\ndangerous as the hill.  Of course it has more meanings than one?\"\n\n\"Perhaps two,\" I assented.\n\n\"And the second more important than the first.\"\n\n\"Maybe,\" I smiled; \"however, I hope you like it.\"\n\nRosalind was very reassuring on that point, and then said musingly, as\nif half to herself, \"But that hill is dangerous, you know; and young\npeople would do well to pay attention to the danger-board!\"\n\nHer voice shook as she spoke the last two or three words, and I looked\nat her in some surprise.\n\n\"Yes, I know it,\" she added, her voice quite broken; and before I\nrealised what was happening, there she was with her beautiful head down\nupon the table, and sobbing as if her heart would break.\n\n\"Forgive me for being such a fool,\" she managed to wring out.\n\nNow, usually I never interrupt a woman when she is crying, as it only\nencourages her to continue; but there was something so unexpected and\nmysterious about Rosalind's sudden outburst that it was impossible not\nto be sympathetic.  I endeavoured to soothe her with such words as\nseemed fitting; and as she was crying because she really couldn't help\nit, she didn't cry long.\n\nThese tears proved, what certain indications of manner had already\nhinted to me, that Rosalind was more artless than I had at first\nsupposed.  She was a woman of the world, in that she lived in it, and\nloved its gaieties, but there was still in her heart no little of the\nchild, as is there not in the hearts of all good women--or men?\n\nAnd this you will realise when I tell you the funny little story which\nshe presently confided to me as the cause of her tears.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER IV\n\nMARRIAGE A LA MODE\n\nFor Rosalind was no victim of the monster man, as you may have supposed\nher, no illustration of his immemorial perfidies. On the contrary, she\nwas one half of a very happy marriage, and, in a sense, her sufferings\nat the moment were merely theoretical, if one may so describe the\nsufferings caused by a theory.  But no doubt the reader would prefer a\nlittle straightforward narrative.\n\nWell, Rosalind and Orlando, as we may as well call them, are two newly\nmarried young people who've been married, say, a year, and who find\nthemselves at the end of it loving each other more than at the\nbeginning,--for you are to suppose two of the tenderest, most devoted\nhearts that ever beat as one.  However, they are young people of the\nintrospective modern type, with a new theory for everything.\n\nAbout marriage and the law of happiness in that blessed estate, they\nboasted the latest philosophical patents.  To them, among other\nmatters, the secret of unhappy marriages was as simple as can be.  It\nwas in nothing more or less than the excessive \"familiarity\" of\nordinary married life, and the lack of personal freedom allowed both\nparties to the contract.  Thus love grew commonplace, and the unhappy\nones to weary of each other by excessive and enforced association.\nThis was obvious enough, and the remedy as obvious,--separate bedrooms,\nand a month's holiday in each year to be spent apart (notoriously all\npeople of quality had separate bedrooms, and see how happy they were!).\nThese and similar other safeguards of individual liberty they had in\nmock-earnest drawn up and signed on their marriage eve, as a sort of\nsupplemental wedding service.\n\nIt would not be seemly to inquire how far certain of these conditions\nhad been kept,--how often, for example, Orlando's little hermit's bed\nhad really needed remaking during those twelve months!  Answer, ye\nbirds of the air that lie in your snug nests, so close, so close,\nthrough the tender summer nights, and maybe with two or three little\nones besides,--unless, indeed, ye too have felt the influence of the\nZeit-geist, and have taken to sleeping in separate nests.\n\nThe condition with which alone we have here to concern ourselves was\none which provided that each of the two lovers, hereafter to be called\nthe husband of the one part and the wife of the other part, solemnly\nbound themselves to spend one calendar month of each year out of each\nother's society, with full and free liberty to spend it wheresoever,\nwith whomsoever, and howsoever they pleased; and that this condition\nwas rigidly to be maintained, whatever immediate effort it might cost,\nas the parties thereto believed that so would their love the more\nlikely maintain an enduring tenderness and an unwearied freshness.  And\nto this did Orlando and his Rosalind set their hands and hearts and\nlips.\n\nNow, wisdom is all very well till the time comes to apply it; and as\nthat month of June approached in which they had designed to give their\nlove a holiday, they had found their courage growing less and less.\nTheir love didn't want a holiday; and when Orlando had referred to the\nmatter during the early days of May, Rosalind had burst into tears, and\nbegged him to reconsider a condition which they had made before they\nreally knew what wedded love was.  But Orlando, though in tears himself\n(so Rosalind averred), had a higher sense of their duty to their ideal,\nand was able, though in tears, to beg her look beyond the moment, and\nrealise what a little self-denial now might mean in the years to come.\nThey hadn't kept any other of their resolutions,--thus Rosalind let it\nout!--this must be kept.\n\nAnd thus it had come about that Orlando had gone off for his month's\nholiday with a charming girl, who, with the cynic, will no doubt\naccount for his stern adherence to duty; and Rosalind had gone off for\nhers with a pretty young man whom she'd liked well enough to go to the\ntheatre and to supper with,--a young man who was indeed a dear friend,\nand a vivacious, sympathetic companion, but whom, as a substitute for\nOrlando, she immediately began to hate. Such is the female heart!\n\nThe upshot of the experiment, so far as she was concerned, was that she\nhad quarrelled with her companion, and had gone off in search of her\nhusband, on which search she was embarked at the moment of my\nencountering her.  The tears, therefore,--that is, the first lot of\ntears by the roadside,--had not been all on account of the injured\nbicycle, you see.\n\nNow the question was, How had Orlando been getting on?  I had an\nintuition that in his case the experiment had proved more enjoyable,\nbut I am not one to break the bruised reed by making such a suggestion.\nOn the contrary, I expressed my firm conviction that Orlando was\nprobably even more miserable than she was.\n\n\"Do you really think so?\" she asked eagerly, her poor miserable face\ngrowing bright a moment with hope and gratitude.\n\n\"Undoubtedly,\" I answered sententiously. \"To put the case on the most\ngeneral principles, apart from Orlando's great love for you, it is an\neternal truth of masculine sentiment that man always longs for the\nabsent woman.\"\n\n\"Are you quite sure?\" asked Rosalind, with an unconvinced half-smile.\n\n\"Absolutely.\"\n\n\"I thought,\" she continued, \"that it was just the other way about; that\nit was presence and not absence that made the heart of man grow fonder,\nand that if a man's best girl, so to say, was away, he was able to make\nhimself very comfortable with his second-best!\"\n\n\"In some cases, of course, it's true,\" I answered, unmoved; \"but with a\nlove like yours and Orlando's, it's quite different.\"\n\n\"Oh, do you really mean it?\"\n\n\"Certainly I do; and your mistake has been in supposing that an\nexperiment which no few every-day married couples would be only too\nglad to try, was ever meant for two such love-birds as you. Laws and\nsystems are meant for the unhappy and the untractable, not for people\nlike you, for whom Love makes its own laws.\"\n\n\"Yes, that is what we used to say; and indeed, we thought that this was\none of love's laws,--this experiment, as you call it.\"\n\n\"But it was quite a mistake,\" I went on in my character as matrimonial\noracle. \"Love never made a law so cruel, a law that would rob true\nlovers of each other's society for a whole month in a year, stretching\nthem on the rack of absence--\"  There my period broke down, so I began\nanother less ambitiously planned.\n\n\"A whole month in a year!  Think what that would mean in a lifetime.\nHow long do you expect to live and love together?  Say another fifty\nyears at the most.  Well, fifty ones are fifty. Fifty months\nequal--four twelves are forty-eight and two over--four years and two\nmonths.  Yes, out of the short life God allows even for the longest\nlove you would voluntarily throw away four years and two months!\"\n\nThis impressive calculation had a great effect on poor Rosalind; and it\nis a secondary matter that it and its accompanying wisdom may have less\nweight with the reader, as for the moment Rosalind was my one concern.\n\n\"But, of course, we have perfect trust in each other,\" said Rosalind\npresently, with charming illogicality.\n\n\"No doubt,\" I said; \"but Love, like a good householder (ahem!), does\nwell not to live too much on trust.\"\n\n\"But surely love means perfect trust,\" said Rosalind.\n\n\"Theoretically, yes; practically, no.  On the contrary, it means\nexactly the opposite. Trust, perfect trust, with loved ones far away!\nNo, it is an inhuman ideal, and the more one loves the less one lives\nup to it. If not, what do these tears mean?\"\n\n\"Oh, no!\" Rosalind retorted, with a flush, \"you mustn't say that.  I\ntrust Orlando absolutely.  It isn't that; it's simply that I can't bear\nto be away from him.\"\n\nWhat women mean by \"trusting\" might afford a subject for an interesting\ndisquisition. However, I forbore to pursue the matter, and answered\nRosalind's remark in a practical spirit.\n\n\"Well, then,\" I said, \"if that's all, the thing to do is to find\nOrlando, tell him that you cannot bear it, and spend the rest of your\nholiday, you and he, together.\"\n\n\"That's what I thought,\" said Rosalind.\n\n\"Unfortunately,\" I continued, \"owing to your foolish arrangement not to\ntell each other where you were going and not to write, as being\nincompatible with Perfect Trust, you don't know where Orlando is at the\npresent moment.\"\n\n\"No; but I have a good guess,\" said Rosalind.  \"There's a smart little\nwatering-place, not so many miles from here, called Yellowsands, a sort\nof secret little Monaco, which not many people know of, a\nwicked-innocent gay little place, where we've often talked of going.  I\nthink it's very likely that Orlando has gone there; and that's just\nwhere I was going when we met.\"\n\nI will tell the reader more about Yellowsands in the next chapter.\nMeanwhile, let us complete Rosalind's arrangements. The result of our\nconversation was that she was to proceed to Yellowsands on the morrow,\nand that I was to follow as soon as possible, so as to be available\nshould she chance to need any advice, and at all events to give myself\nthe pleasure of meeting her again.\n\nThis arranged, we said good-night, Rosalind with ever such a\nbrightened-up face, of which I thought for half an hour and then fell\nasleep to dream of Yellowsands.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER V\n\nCONCERNING THE HAVEN OF YELLOWSANDS\n\nOn the morrow, at the peep of day, Rosalind was off to seek her lord.\nAn hour or so after I started in leisurely pursuit.\n\nYellowsands!  I had heard in a vague way of the place, as a whim of a\ncertain young nobleman who combined brains with the pursuit of\npleasure.  Like most ideas, it was simple enough when once conceived.\nAny one possessing a mile or two of secluded seaboard, cut off on the\nland side by precipitous approaches, and including a sheltered river\nmouth ingeniously hidden by nature, in the form of a jutting wall of\nrock, from the sea, might have made as good use of these natural\nopportunities as the nobleman in question, had they only been as wise\nand as rich.  William Blake proposed to rebuild Jerusalem in this green\nand pleasant land.  My lord proposed to erect a miniature Babylon amid\nsimilar pleasant surroundings, a little dream-city by the sea, a home\nfor the innocent pleasure-seeker stifled by the puritanism of the great\ntowns, refugium peccatorum in this island of the saints.\n\n\"Once it was the Puritan Fathers who left our coasts,\" he is recorded\nto have said; \"nowadays it is our Prodigal Sons.\"\n\nNo doubt it was in further elaboration of this aphorism that the little\nsteamboat that sailed every other day from Yellowsands to the beckoning\nshores of France was called \"the Mayflower.\"\n\nMy lord's plan had been simple.  By the aid of cunning architects he\nhad first blasted his harbour into shape, then built his hotels and\npleasure-palaces, and then leased them to dependants of his who knew\nthe right sort of people, and who knew that it was as much as their\nlease was worth to find accommodation for teetotal amateur\nphotographers or wistful wandering Sunday-school treats.  As,\nunfortunately, the Queen's highway ran down in tortuous descent to the\nhandful of fishermen's cottages that had clung there limpet-like for\nages, there was always a chance of such a stray visitation; but it was\nremote, and the whole place, hand and heart, was in the pocket of my\nlord.\n\nSo much to give the reader some idea of the secret watering-place of\nYellowsands, situated at the mouth of that romantic little torrent, the\nriver Sly.  Such further description as may be needed may be kept till\nwe come within sight of its gilded roofs and marble terraces.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VI\n\nTHE MOORLAND OF THE APOCALYPSE\n\nI reckoned that it would take me two or three days, leisurely walking,\nto reach Yellowsands.  Rosalind would, of course, arrive there long\nbefore me; but that I did not regret, as I was in a mood to find\ncompany in my own thoughts.\n\nHer story gave me plenty to think of.  I dwelt particularly on the\ncareless extravagance of the happy.  Here were two people to whom life\nhad given casually what I was compelled to go seeking lonely and\nfootsore through the world, and with little hope of finding it at the\nend; and yet were they so little aware of their good fortune as to risk\nit over a trumpery theory, a shadow of pseudo-philosophy.  Out of the\ndeep dark ocean of life Love had brought them his great moon-pearl, and\nthey sat on the boat's edge carelessly tossing it from one to the\nother, unmindful of the hungry fathoms on every side.  A sudden slip,\nand they had lost it for ever, and might only watch its shimmering fall\nto the bottom of the world. Theories!  Theories are for the unknown and\nthe unhappy.  Who will trouble to theorise about Heaven when he has\nfound Heaven itself?  Theories are for the poor-devil outcast,--for him\nwho stands outside the confectioner's shop of life without a penny in\nhis pocket, while the radiant purchasers pass in and out through the\ndoors,--for him who watches with wistful eyes this and that sugared\nmarvel taken out of the window by mysterious hands, to bless some happy\ncustomer inside.  He is not fool enough even to hope for one of those\nglistering masterpieces of frosted sugar and silk flowers, which rise\nto pinnacles of snowy sweetness, white mountains of blessedness, rich\ninside, they say, with untold treasures for the tooth that is sweet.\nNo! he craves nothing but a simple Bath-bun of happiness, and even that\nis denied him.\n\nWould I ever find my Bath-bun?  I disconsolately asked myself.  I had\nbeen seeking it now for some little time, and seemed no nearer than\nwhen I set out.  I had seen a good many Bath-buns on my pilgrimage, it\nis true.  Some I have not had space to confide to the reader; but\nsomehow or other they had not seemed the unmistakably predestined for\nwhich I was seeking.\n\nAnd oh, how I could love a girl, if she would only give me the\nchance,--that is, be the right girl!  Oh, Sylvia Joy! where art thou?\nWhy so long dost thou remain hidden \"in shady leaves of destiny\"?\n\n\n    \"Seest thou thy lover lowly laid,\n  Hear'st thou the sighs that rend his breast?\"\n\n\nAnd then, as the novelists say, \"a strange thing happened.\"\n\nThe road I was tramping at the moment was somewhat desolate.  It ran up\nfrom a small market town through a dreary undulating moorland, forking\noff here and there to unknown villages of which the horizon gave no\nhint.  Its cheerless hillocks were all but naked of vegetation, for a\nnever very flourishing growth of heather had recently been burnt right\ndown to the unkindly-looking earth, leaving a dwarf black forest of\ncharred sticks very grim to the eye and heart; while the dull surface\nof a small lifeless-looking lake added the final touch to the Dead-Sea\nmournfulness of the prospect.\n\nSuddenly I became aware of the fluttering of a grey dress a little\nahead of me. Unconsciously I had been overtaking a tall young woman\nwalking in the same direction as myself, with a fine athletic carriage\nof her figure and a noble movement of her limbs.\n\nShe walked manfully, and as I neared her I could hear the sturdy ring\nof her well-shod feet upon the road.  There was an air of expectancy\nabout her walk, as though she looked to be met presently by some one\ndue from the opposite direction.\n\nIt was curious that I had not noticed her before, for she must have\nbeen in sight for some time.  No doubt my melancholy abstraction\naccounted for that, and perhaps her presence there was to be explained\nby a London train which I had listlessly observed come in to the town\nan hour before.  This surmise was confirmed, as presently,--over the\nbrow of a distant undulation in the road, I descried a farmer's gig\ndriven by another young woman.  The gig immediately hoisted a\nhandkerchief; so did my pedestrian.  At this moment I was within a yard\nor two of overtaking her.  And it was then the strange thing happened.\n\nDistance had lent no enchantment which nearness did not a hundred times\nrepay. The immediate impression of strength and distinction which the\nfirst glimpse of her had made upon me was more and more verified as I\ndrew closer to her.  The carriage of her head was no whit less noble\nthan the queenly carriage of her limbs, and her glorious chestnut hair,\nfull of warm tints of gold, was massed in a sumptuous simplicity above\na neck that would have made an average woman's fortune.  This glowing\ndescription, however, must be lowered or heightened in tone by the\nassociation of these characteristics with an undefinable simplicity of\nmien, a certain slight rusticity of effect.  The town spoke in her\nwell-cut gown and a few simple adornments, but the dryad still moved\ninside.\n\nI suppose most men, even in old age, feel a certain anxiety, conscious\nor not, as they overtake a woman whose back view is in the least\nattractive.  I confess that I felt a more than usual, indeed a quite\nirrational, perturbation of the blood, as, coming level with her, I\ndared to look into her face.  As I did so she involuntarily turned to\nlook at me--turned to look at me, did I say?  \"To look\" is a feeble\nverb indeed to express the unexpected shock of beauty to which I was\nsuddenly exposed.  I cannot describe her features, for somehow features\nalways mean little to me.  They were certainly beautifully moulded, and\nher skin was of a lovely pale olive, but the life of her face was in\nher great violet eyes and her wonderful mouth.  Thus suddenly to look\ninto her face was like unexpectedly to come upon moon and stars\nreflected in some lonely pool.  I suppose the look lasted only a second\nor two; but it left me dazzled as that king in the Eastern tale, who\nseemed to have lived whole dream-lives between dipping his head into a\nbowl of water and taking it out again. Similarly in that moment I\nseemed to have dived into this unknown girl's eyes, to have walked\nthrough the treasure palaces of her soul, to have stood before the\nflaming gates of her heart, to have gathered silver flowers in the\nfairy gardens of her dreams. I had followed her white-robed spirit\nacross the moonlit meadows of her fancy, and by her side had climbed\nthe dewy ladder of the morning star, and then suddenly I had been\nwhirled up again to the daylight through the magic fountains of her\neyes.\n\nI'll tell you more about that look presently!  Meanwhile the gig\napproached, and the two girls exchanged affectionate greetings.\n\n\"Tom hasn't come with you, then?\" said the other girl, who was\nevidently her sister, and who was considerably more rustic in style and\naccent.  She said it with a curious mixture of anxiety and relief.\n\n\"No,\" answered the other simply, and I thought I noticed a slight\ndarkening of her face.  Tom was evidently her husband.  So she was\nmarried!\n\n\"Yes!\" said a fussy hypocrite of reason within me, \"and what's that to\ndo with you?\"\n\n\"Everything, you fool!\" answered a robuster voice in my soul, kicking\nthe feeble creature clean out of my head on the instant.\n\nFor, absurd as it may sound, with that look into those Arabian Nights'\neyes, had come somewhere out of space an overwhelming intuition, nay,\nan unshakable conviction, that the woman who was already being rolled\naway from me down the road in that Dis's car of a farmer's gig, was now\nand for ever and before all worlds the woman God had created for me,\nand that, unless I could be hers and she mine, there would be no home,\nno peace for either of us so long as we lived.\n\nAnd yet she was being carried away further and further every moment,\nwhile I gazed after her, aimlessly standing in the middle of the road.\nWhy did I not call to her, overtake her?  In a few moments she would be\nlost to me for ever--\n\nThough I was unaware of it, this hesitation was no doubt owing to a\nstealthy return of reason by the back-door of my mind.  In fact, he\npresently dared to raise his voice again.  \"I don't deny,\" he ventured,\nready any moment to flee for his life, \"that she is written yours in\nall the stars, and particularly do I see it written on the face of the\nmoon; but you mustn't forget that many are thus meant for each other\nwho never meet, not to speak of marrying.  It is such contradictions\nbetween the purposes and performance of the Creator that make\nlife--life; you'll never see her again, so make your mind easy--\"\n\nAt that moment the gig was on the point of turning a corner into a dark\npine-wood; but just ere it disappeared,--was it fancy?--I seemed to\nhave caught the flash of a momentarily fluttering handkerchief.  \"Won't\nI?  you fool!\" I exclaimed, savagely smiting reason on the cheek, as I\nsprang up wildly to wave mine; but the road was already blank.\n\nAt this a sort of panic possessed me, and like a boy I raced down the\nroad after her. To lose her like this, at the very moment that she had\nbeen revealed to me.  It was more than I could bear.\n\nPast the dreary lake, through the little pine-wood I ran, and then I\nwas brought to a halt, panting, by cross-roads and a finger-post.  An\ninvoluntary memory of Nicolete sang to me as I read the quaint names of\nthe villages to one of which the Vision was certainly wending. Yes!  I\nwas bound on one more journey to the moon, but alas! there was no\nheavenly being by my side to point the way.  Oh, agony, which was the\nroad she had taken?\n\nIt never occurred to me till the following day that I might have been\nable to track her by the wheel-marks of the gig on the dusty summer\nroad.  Instead I desperately resorted to the time-honoured expedient of\nsetting up a stick and going in the direction of its fall. Like most\nancient guide-posts, it led me quite wrong, down into a pig's-trough of\na hamlet whither I felt sure she couldn't have been bound.  Then I ran\nback in a frenzy, and tried the other road,--as if it could be any use,\nwith at least three quarters of an hour gone since I had lost sight of\nher.  Of course I had no luck; and finally, hot and worn out with\nabsurd excitement, I threw myself down in a meadow and called myself an\nass,--which I undoubtedly was.\n\nFor of all the fancies that had obsessed my moonstruck brain, this was\nsurely the maddest.  Suppose I had overtaken the girl, what could I\nhave said to her?  And, suppose she had listened to me, how did I know\nshe was the girl I imagined her to be? But this was sheer reason again,\nand has no place in a fantastic romance.  So I hasten to add that the\nmood was one of brief duration, and that no cold-water arguments were\nable to quench the fire which those eyes had set aflame within me, no\ndaylight philosophy had any power to dispel the dream of a face which\nwas now my most precious possession, as I once more took up my stick\nand listlessly pursued my way to Yellowsands.\n\nFor I had one other reason than my own infatuation, or thought I had.\nYes, brief and rapid as our glance at each other had been, I had\nfancied in her eyes a momentary kindling as they met mine, a warm\nsummer-lightning which seemed for a second to light up for me the inner\nheaven of her soul.\n\nOf one feeling, however, I was sure,--that on my side this apocalyptic\nrecognition of her, as it had seemed, was no mere passionate\ncorrespondence of sex, no mere spell of a beautiful face (for such\npassion and such glamour I had made use of opportunities to study), but\nwas indeed the flaming up of an elemental affinity, profounder than\nsex, deeper than reason, and ages older than speech.\n\nBut it was a fancy, for all that?  Yes, one of those fancies that are\nfancies on earth, but facts in heaven.  Perhaps you don't believe in\nthem.  Well, I'm afraid that cannot be helped.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VII\n\n\"COME UNTO THESE YELLOW SANDS!\"\n\nNothing further happened to me till I reached Yellowsands, except an\nexciting ride on the mail-coach, which connected it with the nearest\nrailway-station some twenty miles away.  For the last three or four\nmiles the road ran along the extreme precipitous verge of cliffs that\nsloped, a giant's wall of grassy mountain, right away down to a dreamy\namethystine floor of sea, miles and miles, as it seemed, below.  To\nride on that coach, as it gallantly staggered betwixt earth and heaven,\nwas to know all the ecstasy of flying, with an added touch of danger,\nwhich birds and angels, and others accustomed to fly, can never\nexperience.  And then at length the glorious mad descent down three\nplunging cataracts of rocky road, the exciting rattling of the harness,\nthe grinding of the strong brakes, the driver's soothing calls to his\nhorses, and the long burnished horn trailing wild music behind us, like\ninvisible banners of aerial brass,--oh, it stirred the dullest blood\namongst us thus as it were to tear down the sky towards the white roofs\nof Yellowsands, glittering here and there among the clouds of trees\nwhich filled the little valley almost to the sea's edge, while floating\nup to us came soft strains of music, silken and caressing, as though\nthe sea itself sang us a welcome.  Had you heard it from aboard the\nArgo, you would have declared it to be the sirens singing, and it would\nhave been found necessary to lash you to the mast.  But there were no\nmasts to lash you to in Yellowsands--and of the sirens it is not yet\ntime to speak.\n\nIt was the golden end of afternoon as the coach stopped in front of the\nmain hotel, The Golden Fortune; and for the benefit of any with not too\nlong purses who shall hereafter light on Yellowsands, and be alarmed at\nthe name and the marble magnificence of that delightful hotel, I may\nsay that the charges there were surprisingly \"reasonable,\" owing to one\nother wise provision of the young lord and master of that happy place,\nwho had had the wit to realise that the nicest and brightest and\nprettiest people were often the poorest.  Yellowsands, therefore, was\ncarried on much like a club, to which you had only to be the right sort\nof person to belong.  I was relieved to find that the hotel people\nevidently considered me the right sort of person, and didn't take me\nfor a Sunday-school treat,--for presently I found myself in a charming\nlittle corner bedroom, whence I could survey the whole extent of the\nlittle colony of pleasure. The Golden Fortune was curiously situated,\nperched at the extreme sea-end of a little horse-shoe bay hollowed out\nbetween two headlands, the points of which approached each other so\nclosely that the river Sly had but a few yards of rocky channel through\nwhich to pour itself into the sea. The Golden Fortune, therefore,\nbacked by towering woodlands, looked out to sea at one side, across to\nthe breakwater headland on another, and on its land side commanded a\ncomplete view of the gay little haven, with its white houses built\nterrace on terrace upon its wooded slopes, connected by flights of\nzigzag steps, by which the apparently inaccessible shelves and\nplatforms circulated their gay life down to the gay heart of the\nplace,--the circular boulevard, exquisitely leafy and cool, where one\nfound the great casino and the open-air theatre, the exquisite\norchestra, into which only the mellowest brass and the subtlest strings\nwere admitted, and the Cafe du Ciel, charmingly situated among the\ntrees, where the boulevard became a bridge, for a moment, at the mouth\nof the river Sly. Here one might gaze up the green rocky defile through\nwhich the Sly made pebbly music, and through which wound romantic walks\nand natural galleries, where far inland you might wander\n\n  \"From dewy dawn to dewy night,\n  And have one with you wandering,\"\n\nor where you might turn and look across the still lapping harbour, out\nthrough the little neck of light between the headlands to the\nshimmering sea beyond,--your ears filled with a melting tide of sweet\nsounds, the murmur of the streams and the gentle surging of the sea,\nthe rippling of leaves, the soft restless whisper of women's gowns, and\nthe music of their vowelled voices.  It was here I found myself sitting\nat sunset, alone, but so completely under the spell of the place that I\nneeded no companion.  The place itself was companion enough.  The\nelectric fairy lamps had popped alight; and as the sun sank lower,\nYellowsands seemed like a glowing crown of light floating upon the\nwater.\n\nI had as yet failed to catch any sight of Rosalind; so I sat alone, and\nso far as I had any thoughts or feelings, beyond a consciousness of\nheavenly harmony with my surroundings, they were for that haunting\nunknown face with the violet eyes and the heavy chestnut hair.\n\nPresently, close by, the notes of a guitar came like little gold\nbutterflies out of the twilight, and then a woman's voice rose like a\nsilver bird on the air.  It was a gay wooing measure to which she sang.\nI listened with ears and heart.  \"All ye,\" it went,--\n\n  All ye who seek for pleasure,\n  Here find it without measure--\n       No one to say\n       A body nay,\n  And naught but love and leisure.\n\n  All ye who seek forgetting,\n  Leave frowns and fears and fretting,\n       Here by the sea\n       Are fair and free\n  To give you peace and petting.\n\n  All ye whose hearts are breaking\n  For somebody forsaking,\n       We'll count you dear,\n       And heal you here,\n  And send you home love-making.\"\n\n\n\"Bravo!\" I cried involuntarily, as the song ended amid multitudinous\napplause; and I thus attracted the attention of another who sat near me\nas lonely as myself, but evidently quite at home in the place.\n\n\"You haven't heard our sirens sing before?\" he said, turning to me with\na pleasant smile, and thus we fell into talk of the place and its\npleasures.\n\n\"There's one feature of the place I might introduce you to if you care\nfor a stroll,\" he said presently.  \"Have you heard of The Twelve\nGolden-Haired Bar-maids?\"  I hadn't, but the fantastic name struck my\nfancy.  It was, he explained, the name given to a favourite buffet at\nthe Hotel Aphrodite, which was served by twelve wonderful girls, not\none under six feet in height, and all with the most glorious golden\nhair.  It was a whim of the management, he said.\n\nSo, of course, we went.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VIII\n\nTHE TWELVE GOLDEN-HAIRED BAR-MAIDS.\n\nNow it was not without some boyish nervousness that I followed my newly\nmade friend, for I confess that I have ever been a poor hand at talking\nto bar-maids.  It is, I am convinced, an art apart, an art like any\nother,--needing first the natural gift, then the long patient training,\nand finally the courageous practice.  Alas for me, I possessed neither\ngift, training, nor courage.  Courage I lacked most of all.  It was in\nvain that I said to myself that it was like swimming,--all that was\nneeded was \"confidence.\"  That was the very thing I couldn't muster. No\ndoubt I am handicapped by a certain respectful homage which I always\nfeel involuntarily to any one in the shape of woman, for anything\nsavouring of respect is the last thing to win the bar-maid heart\ndivine.  The man to win her is he who calls loudly for his drink,\nwithout a \"Please\" or a \"Thank you,\" throws his hat at the back of his\nhead, gulps down half his glass, and, while drawing breath for the\nother half, takes a hard, indifferent look at her, and in an off-hand\nvoice throws her some fatuous, mirthless jest.\n\nNow, I've never been able to do this in the convincing grand manner of\nthe British male; and whatever I have said, the effect has been the\nsame.  I've talked about theatres and music-halls, of events of the\nday, I've even--Heaven help me--talked of racing and football, but I\nmight as well have talked of Herbert Spencer.  I suppose I didn't talk\nabout them in the right way. I'm sure it must be my fault somewhere,\nfor certainly they seem easy enough to please, poor things! However, my\nfailure remains, and sometimes even I find it extremely hard to attract\ntheir attention in the ordinary way of business.  I don't mind my\nneighbour being preferred before me, but I do object to his being\nserved before me!\n\nSo, I say, I couldn't but tremble at the vision of those golden-haired\ngoddesses, standing with immobile faces by their awful altars. Indeed,\nhad I realised how superbly impressive they were going to be, I think I\nmust have declined the adventure altogether,--for, robed in lustrous\nivory-white linen were those figures of undress marble, the wealth of\ntheir glorious bodies pressing out into bosoms magnificent as magnolias\n(nobler lines and curves Greece herself has never known), towering in\nthroats of fluted alabaster, and flowering in coiffures of imperial\ngold.\n\nNor was their temple less magnificent.  To make it fair, Ruskin had\nrelit the seven lamps of architecture, and written the seven labours of\nHercules; for these windows through a whole youth Burne Jones had\nworshipped painted glass at Oxford, and to breathe romance into these\nfrescos had Rossetti been born, and Dante born again.  Men had gone to\nprison and to death that this temple of Whiskey-and-Soda might be fair.\n\nStrange, in truth, are the ministrations to which Beauty is called.\nOut of the high heaven is she summoned, from mystic communion with her\nown perfection, from majestic labours in the Sistine Chapel of the\nStars,--yea, she must put aside her gold-leaf and purples and leave\nunfinished the very panels of the throne of God,--that Circe shall have\nher palace, and her worshippers their gilded sty.\n\nAs there were at least a score of \"worshippers\" round each Circe, my\nnervousness became unimportant, and therefore passed. Thus, as my\ncompanion and I sat at one of the little tables, from which we might\ngaze upon the sea without and Aphrodite within, my eyes were able to\nfly like bees from one fair face to another. Finally, they settled upon\na Circe less besieged of the hoarse and grunting mob.  She was\nconspicuously less in height, her hair was rather bright red than\ngolden, and her face had more meanings than the faces of her fellows.\n\n\"Why,\" in a flash it came to me, \"it's Rosalind!\" and clean forgetting\nto be shy, or polite to my companion, I hastened across to her, to be\ngreeted instantly in a manner so exclusively intimate that the little\ncrowd about her presently spread itself among the other crowds, and we\nwere left to talk alone.\n\n\"Well,\" I said, \"you're a nice girl! Whatever are you doing here?\"\n\n\"Yes, I'm afraid you'll have but a strange opinion of me,\" she said;\n\"but I love all experience,--it's such fun,--and when I heard that\nthere was a sudden vacancy for a golden-haired beauty in this place, I\ncouldn't resist applying, and to my surprise they took me--and here I\nam!  Of course I shall only stay till Orlando appears--which,\" she\nadded mournfully--\"he hasn't done yet.\"\n\nHer hours were long and late, but she had two half-days free in the\nweek, and for these of course I engaged myself.\n\nMeanwhile I spent as much time as I decently could at her side; but it\nwas impossible to monopolise her, and the rest of my time there was no\ndifficulty in filling up, you may be sure, in so gay a place.\n\nTwo or three nights after this, a little before dinner-time, while I\nwas standing talking to her, she suddenly went very white, and in a\nfluttering voice gasped, \"Look yonder!\"  I looked.  A rather slight\ndark-haired young man was entering the bar, with a very stylish pretty\nwoman at his side.  As they sat down and claimed the waiter, some\ndistance away, Rosalind whispered, \"That's my husband!\"\n\n\"Oh!\" I said; \"but that's no reason for your fainting.  Pull yourself\ntogether.  Take a drop of brandy.\"  But woman will never take the most\nobvious restorative, and Rosalind presently recovered without the\nbrandy. She looked covertly at her husband, with tragic eyes.\n\n\"He's much younger than I imagined him,\" I said,--reserving for myself\nthe satisfaction which this discovery had for me.\n\n\"Oh, yes, he's really quite a boy,\" said Rosalind; adding under her\nbreath, \"Dear fellow! how I love him!\"\n\n\"And hate him too!\" she superadded, as she observed his evident\nsatisfaction with his present lot.  Indeed the experiment appeared to\nbe working most successfully with him; nor, looking at his companion,\ncould I wonder.  She was a sprightly young woman, very smart and merry\nand decorously voluptuous, and of that fascinating prettiness that wins\nthe hearts of boys and storms the footlights.  One of her\ncharacteristics soothed the heart of Rosalind.  She had splendid red\nhair, almost as good as her own.\n\n\"He's been faithful to my hair, at all events,\" she said, trying to be\nnonchalant.\n\n\"And the eyes are not unlike,\" I added, meaning well.\n\n\"I'm sorry you think so,\" said Rosalind, evidently piqued.\n\n\"Well, never mind,\" I tried to make peace, \"she hasn't your hands,\"--I\nknew that women cared more about their hands than their faces.\n\n\"How do you know?\" she retorted; \"you cannot see through her gloves.\"\n\n\"Would any gloves disguise your hands?\" I persisted.  \"They would shine\nthrough the mittens of an Esquimau.\"\n\n\"Well, enough of that!  See--I know it's wickedly mean of me--but\ncouldn't you manage to sit somewhere near them and hear what they are\nsaying?  Of course you needn't tell me anything it would be mean to\nhear, but only what--\"\n\n\"You would like to know.\"\n\nBut this little plot died at its birth, for that very minute the\nthreatened couple arose, and went out arm in arm, apparently as\nabsurdly happy as two young people can be.\n\nAs they passed out, one of Rosalind's fellow bar-maids turned to her\nand said,--\n\n\"You know who that was?\"\n\n\"Who?\" said Rosalind, startled.\n\n\"That pretty woman who went out with that young Johnny just now?\"\n\n\"No; who is she?\"\n\n\"Why, that's\"--and readers with heart-disease had better brace\nthemselves up for a great shock--\"that's SYLVIA JOY, the famous dancer!\"\n\n\n\nCHAPTER IX\n\nSYLVIA JOY\n\nSylvia Joy!  And I hadn't so much as looked at her petticoat for weeks!\nBut I would now.  The violet eyes and the heavy chestnut hair rose up\nin moralising vision. Yes!  God knows, they were safe in my heart, but\npetticoats were another matter. Sylvia Joy!\n\nWell, did you ever?  Well, I'm d----d!  Sylvia Joy!\n\nI should have been merely superhuman had I been able to control the\nexpression of surprise which convulsed my countenance at the sound of\nthat most significant name.\n\n\"The name seems familiar to you,\" said Rosalind, a little surprised and\na little eagerly; \"do you know the lady?\"\n\n\"Slightly,\" I prevaricated.\n\n\"How fortunate!\" exclaimed Rosalind; \"you'll be all the better able to\nhelp me!\"\n\n\"Yes,\" I said; \"but since things have turned out so oddly, I may say\nthat our relations are of so extremely delicate a nature that I shall\nhave very carefully to think out what is best to be done.  Meanwhile,\ndo you mind lending me that ring for a few hours?\"\n\nIt was a large oblong opal set round with small diamonds,--a ring of\ndistinguished design you could hardly help noticing, especially on a\nman's hand, for which it was too conspicuously dainty.  I slipped it on\nthe little finger of my left hand, and, begging Rosalind to remain\nwhere she was meanwhile, and to take no steps without consulting me, I\nmysteriously, not to say officiously, departed.\n\nI left the twelfth Golden-Haired Bar-maid not too late to stalk her\nhusband and her under-study to their hotel, where they evidently\nproposed to dine.  There was, therefore, nothing left for me but to\ndine also. So I dined; and when the courses of my dining were ended, I\nfound myself in a mellow twilight at the Cafe du Ciel.  And it was\nabout the hour of the sirens' singing. Presently the little golden\nbutterflies flitted once more through the twilight, and again the\nwoman's voice rose like a silver bird on the air.\n\nAs I have a partiality for her songs, I transcribe this Hymn of the\nDaughters of Aphrodite, which you must try to imagine transfigured by\nher voice and the sunset.\n\n\n    Queen Aphrodite's\n  Daughters are we,\n    She that was born\n    Of the morn\n  And the sea;\n    White are our limbs\n  As the foam on the wave,\n    Wild are our hymns\n    And our lovers are brave!\n\n           Queen Aphrodite,\n             Born of the sea,\n  Beautiful dutiful daughters\n           Are we!\n\n\n    You who would follow,\n  Fear not to come,\n    For love is for love\n    As dove is for dove;\n    The harp of Apollo\n  Shall lull you to rest,\n    And your head find its home\n  On this beautiful breast.\n\n\n          Queen Aphrodite,\n            Born of the sea,\n  Beautiful dutiful daughters\n          Are we!\n\n\n  Born of the Ocean,\n  Wave-like are we!\n  Rising and falling\n  Like waves of the sea;\n  Changing for ever,\n  Yet ever the same,\n  Music in motion\n  And marble in flame.\n\n\n          Queen Aphrodite,\n            Born of the sea,\n  Beautiful dutiful daughters\n          Are we!\n\n\nWhen I alighted once more upon the earth from the heaven of this song,\nwho should I find seated within a table of me but the very couple I was\nat the moment so unexpectedly interested in?  But they were far too\nabsorbed in each other to notice me, and consequently I was able to\nhear all of importance that was said. I regret that I cannot gratify\nthe reader with a report of their conversation, for the excuse I had\nfor listening was one that is not transferable.  A woman's happiness\nwas at stake.  No other consideration could have persuaded me to means\nso mean save an end so noble.  I didn't even tell Rosalind all I heard.\nMercifully for her, the candour of fools is not among my superstitions.\nSuffice it for all third persons to know--what Rosalind indeed has\nnever known, and what I hope no reader will be fool enough to tell\nher--that Orlando was for the moment hopelessly and besottedly\nfaithless to his wife, and that my services had been bespoken in the\nvery narrowest nick of time.\n\nHaving, as the reader has long known, a warm personal interest in his\nattractive companion, and desiring, therefore, to think as well of her\nas possible, I was pleased to deduce, negatively, from their\nconversation, that Sylvia Joy knew nothing of Rosalind, and believed\nOrlando to be a free, that is, an unmarried man.  From the point of\nview, therefore, of her code, there was no earthly reason why she\nshould not fall in with Orlando's proposal that they should leave for\nParis by the \"Mayflower\" on the following morning.  Orlando, I could\nhear, wished to make more extended arrangements, and references to that\nwell-known rendezvous, \"Eternity,\" fell on my ears from time to time.\nEvidently Sylvia had no very saving belief in Eternity, for I heard her\nsay that they might see how they got on in Paris for a start.  Then it\nwould be time enough to talk of Eternity. This and other remarks of\nSylvia's considerably predisposed me towards her.  Having concluded\ntheir arrangements for the heaven of the morrow, they rose to take a\nstroll along the boulevards. As they did so, I touched Orlando's\nshoulder and begged his attention for a moment.  Though an entire\nstranger to him, I had, I said, a matter of extreme importance to\ncommunicate to him, and I hoped, therefore, that it would suit his\nconvenience to meet me at the same place in an hour and a half.  As I\nsaid this, I flashed his wife's ring in the light so obviously that he\nwas compelled to notice it.\n\n\"Wherever did you get that?\" he gasped, no little surprised and\nagitated.\n\n\"From your wife,\" I answered, rapidly moving away.  \"Be sure to be here\nat eleven.\"\n\nI slipped away into the crowd, and spent my hour and a half in\npersuading Rosalind that her husband was no doubt a little infatuated,\nbut nevertheless the most faithful husband in the world.  If she would\nonly leave all to me, by this time to-morrow night, if not a good many\nhours before, he should be in her arms as safe as in the Bank. It did\nmy heart good to see how happy this artistic adaptation of the truth\nmade her; and I must say that she never had a wiser friend.\n\nWhen eleven came, I was back in my seat at the Cafe du Ciel. Orlando\ntoo was excitedly punctual.\n\n\"Well, what is it?\" he hurried out, almost before he had sat down.\n\n\"What will you do me the honour of drinking?\" I asked calmly.\n\n\"Oh, drink be d----d!\" he said; \"what have you to tell me?\"\n\n\"I'm glad to hear you rap out such a good honest oath,\" I said; \"but I\nshould like a drink, for all that, and if I may say so, you would be\nnone the worse for a brandy and soda, late as it is.\"\n\nWhen the drinks had come, I remarked to him quietly, but not without\nsignificance: \"The meaning of this ring is that your wife is here, and\nvery wretched.  By an accident I have been privileged with her\nfriendship; and I may say, to save time, that she has told me the whole\nstory.\n\n\"What happily she has not been able to tell me, and what I need hardly\nsay she will never know from me, I overheard, in the interests of your\njoint happiness, an hour or so ago.\"\n\nThe man who is telling the story has a proverbial great advantage; but\nI hope the reader knows enough of me by this to believe that I am far\nfrom meanly availing myself of it in this narrative.  I am well and\ngratefully aware that in this interview with Orlando my advantages were\nmany and fortunate.  For example, had he been bigger and older, or had\nhe not been a gentleman, my task had been considerably more arduous,\nnot to say dangerous.\n\nBut, as Rosalind had said, he was really quite a boy, and I confess I\nwas a little ashamed for him, and a little piqued, that he showed so\nlittle fight.  The unexpectedness of my attack had, I realised, given\nme the whip-hand.  So I judged, at all events, from the fact that he\nforbore to bluster, and sat quite still, with his head in his hands,\nsaying never a word for what seemed several minutes.  Then presently he\nsaid very quietly,--\n\n\"I love my wife all the same.\"\n\n\"Of course you do,\" I answered, eagerly welcoming the significant\nannouncement; \"and if you'll allow me to say so, I think I understand\nmore about the whole situation than either of you, bachelor though\nunfortunately I am.  As a famous friend of mine is fond of saying,\nlookers-on see most of the game.\"\n\nThen I rapidly told him the history of my meeting with his wife, and\ndepicted, in harrowing pigments of phrase, the distress of her mind.\n\n\"I love my wife all the same,\" he repeated, as I finished; \"and,\" he\nadded, \"I love Sylvia too.\"\n\n\"But not quite in the same way?\" I suggested.\n\n\"I love Sylvia very tenderly,\" he said.\n\n\"Yes, I know; I don't think you could do anything else.  No man worth\nhis salt could be anything but tender to a dainty little woman like\nthat.  But tenderness, gentleness, affection, even\nself-sacrifice,--these may be parts of love; but they are merely the\ncrude untransformed ingredients of a love such as you feel for your\nwife, and such as I know she feels for you.\"\n\n\"She still loves me, then,\" he said pitifully; \"she hasn't fallen in\nlove with you.\"\n\n\"No fear,\" I answered; \"no such luck for me.  If she had, I'm afraid I\nshould hardly have been talking to you as I am at this moment.  If a\nwoman like Rosalind, as I call her, gave me her love, it would take\nmore than a husband to rob me of it, I can tell you.\"\n\n\"Yes,\" he repeated, \"on my soul, I love her.  I have never been false\nto her, in my heart; but--\"\n\n\"I know all about it,\" I said; \"may I tell you how it all\nwas,--diagnose the situation?\"\n\n\"Do,\" he replied; \"it is a relief to hear you talk.\"\n\n\"Well,\" I said, \"may I ask one rather intimate question?  Did you ever\nbefore you were married sow what are known as wild oats?\"\n\n\"Never,\" he answered indignantly, flashing for a moment.\n\n\"Well, you should have done,\" I said; \"that's just the whole trouble.\nWild oats will get sown some time, and one of the arts of life is to\nsow them at the right time,--the younger the better.  Think candidly\nbefore you answer me.\"\n\n\"I believe you are right,\" he replied, after a long pause.\n\n\"You are a believer in theories,\" I continued, \"and so am I; but you\ncan take my word that on these matters not all, but some, of the old\ntheories are best.  One of them is that the man who does not sow his\nwild oats before marriage will sow them afterwards, with a whirlwind\nfor the reaping.\"\n\nOrlando looked up at me, haggard with confession.\n\n\"You know the old story of the ring given to Venus?  Well, it is the\nruin of no few men to meet Venus for the first time on their marriage\nnight.  Their very chastity, paradoxical as it may seem, is their\ndestruction. No one can appreciate the peace, the holy satisfaction of\nmonogamy till he has passed through the wasting distractions, the\nunrest of polygamy.  Plunged right away into monogamy, man,\nunexperienced in his good fortune, hankers after polygamy, as the\nmonotheistic Jew hankered after polytheism; and thus the monogamic\nyoung man too often meets Aphrodite for the first time, and makes\nfuture appointments with her, in the arms of his pure young wife.  If\nyou have read Swedenborg, you will remember his denunciation of the\nlust of variety.  Now, that is a lust every young man feels, but it is\none to be satisfied before marriage.  Sylvia Joy has been such a\nvariant for you; and I'm afraid you're going to have some little\ntrouble to get her off your nerves.  Tell me frankly,\" I said, \"have\nyou had your fill of Aphrodite?  It is no use your going back to your\nwife till you have had that.\"\n\n\"I'm not quite a beast,\" he retorted. \"After all, it was an experiment\nwe both agreed to try.\"\n\n\"Certainly,\" I answered, \"and I hope it may have the result of\npersuading you of the unwisdom of experimenting with happiness. You\nhave the realities of happiness; why should you trouble about its\ntheories?  They are for unhappy people, like me, who must learn to\ndistil by learned patience the aurum potabile from the husks of life,\nthe peace which happier mortals find lying like manna each morn upon\nthe meadows.\"\n\n\"Well,\" I continued, \"enough of the abstract; let us have another\ndrink, and tell me what you propose to do.\"\n\n\"Poor Sylvia!\" sighed Orlando.\n\n\"Shall I tell you about Sylvia?\" I said. \"On second thoughts, I won't.\nIt would hardly be fair play; but this, I may say, relying on your\nhonour, that if you were to come to my hotel, I could show you\nindisputable proof that I know at least as much about Sylvia Joy as\neven such a privileged intimate as yourself.\"\n\n\"It is strange, then, that she never recognised you just now,\" he\nretorted, with forlorn alertness.\n\n\"Of course she didn't.  How young you are!  It is rather too bad of a\nwoman of Sylvia's experience.\"\n\n\"And I've bought our passages for to-morrow.  I cannot let her go\nwithout some sort of good-bye.\"\n\n\"Give the tickets to me.  I can make use of them.  How much are they?\nLet's see.\"\n\nThe calculation made and the money passed across, I said abruptly,--\n\n\"Now supposing we go and see your wife.\"\n\n\"You have saved my life,\" he said hoarsely, pressing my hand as we rose.\n\n\"I don't know about that,\" I said inwardly; \"but I do hope I have saved\nyour wife.\"\n\nAs I thought of that, a fear occurred to me.\n\n\"Look here,\" I said, as we strolled towards the Twelve Golden-Haired,\n\"I hope you have no silly notions about confession, about telling the\nliteral truth and so on. Because I want you to promise me that you will\nlie stoutly to your wife about Sylvia Joy.  You must swear the whole\nthing has been platonic.  It's the only chance for your happiness.\nYour wife, no doubt, will lure you on to confession by saying that she\ndoesn't mind this, that, and the other, so long as you don't keep it\nfrom her; and no doubt she will mean it till you have confessed.  But,\nhowever good their theories, women by nature cannot help confusing body\nand soul, and what to a man is a mere fancy of the senses, to them is a\nspiritual tragedy. Promise me to lie stoutly on this point. It is, I\nrepeat, the only chance for your future happiness.  As has been wisely\nsaid, a lie in time saves nine; and such a lie as I advise is but one\nof the higher forms of truth.  Such lying, indeed, is the art of\ntelling the truth.  The truth is that you love her body, soul, and\nspirit; any accidental matter which should tend to make her doubt that\nwould be the only real lie. Promise me, won't you?\"\n\n\"Yes, I will lie,\" said Orlando.\n\n\"Well, there she is,\" I said; \"and God bless you both.\"\n\n\n\nCHAPTER X\n\nIN WHICH ONCE MORE I BECOME OCCUPIED IN MY OWN AFFAIRS\n\nDuring a pause in my matrimonial lecture, Orlando had written a little\nfarewell note to Sylvia,--a note which, of course, I didn't read, but\nwhich it is easy to imagine \"wild with all regret.\"  This I undertook\nto have delivered to her the same night, and promised to call upon her\non the morrow, further to illuminate the situation, and to offer her\nevery consolation in my power.  To conclude the history of Orlando and\nhis Rosalind, I may say that I saw them off from Yellowsands by the\nearly morning coach. There was a soft brightness in their faces, as\nthough rain had fallen in the night; but it was the warm sweet rain of\njoy that brings the flowers, and is but sister to the sun. They are, at\nthe time of my writing, quite old friends of mine, and both have an\nexcessive opinion of my wisdom and good-nature.\n\n\"That lie,\" Orlando once said to me long after, \"was the truest thing I\never said in my life,\"--a remark which may not give the reader a very\nexalted idea of his general veracity.\n\nAs the coach left long before pretty young actresses even dreamed of\ngetting up, I had to control my impatient desire to call on\nMademoiselle Sylvia Joy till it was fully noon.  And even then she was\nnot to be seen.  I tried again in the afternoon with better success.\n\nRain had been falling in the night with her too, I surmised, but it had\nfailed to dim her gay eyes, and had left her complexion unimpaired.  Of\ncourse her little affair with Orlando had never been very serious on\nher side.  She genuinely liked him.  \"He was a nice kind boy,\" was the\nheight of her passionate expression, and she was, naturally, a little\ndisappointed at having an affectionate companion thus unexpectedly\nwhisked off into space.  Her only approach to anger was on the subject\nof his deceiving her about his wife.  Little Sylvia Joy had no very\nlong string of principles; but one generous principle she did hold\nby,--never, if she knew it, to rob another woman of her husband. And\nthat did make her cross with Orlando.  He had not played the game fair.\n\nThere is no need to follow, step by step, the progression by which\nSylvia Joy and I, though such new acquaintances, became in the course\nof a day or two even more intimate than many old friends.  We took to\neach other instinctively, even on our first rather difficult interview,\nand very gently and imperceptibly I bid for the vacant place in her\nheart.\n\nThat night we dined together.\n\nThe next day we lunched and dined together.\n\nThe next day we breakfasted, lunched, and dined together.\n\nAnd on the next I determined to venture on the confession which, as you\nmay imagine, it had needed no little artistic control not to make on\nour first meeting.\n\nShe looked particularly charming this evening, in a black silk gown,\nexceedingly simple and distinguished in style, throwing up the lovely\nfirm whiteness of her throat and bosom, and making a fine contrast with\nher lurid hair.\n\nIt was sheer delight to sit opposite her at dinner, and quietly watch\nher without a word.  Shall I confess that I had an exceedingly boyish\nvanity in thus being granted her friendship? It is almost too boyish to\nconfess at my time of life.  It was simply in the fact that she was an\nactress,--a real, live, famous actress, whose photographs made shop\nwindows beautiful,--come right out of my boy's fairyland of the\ntheatre, actually to sit eating and drinking, quite in a real way, at\nmy side.  This, no doubt, will seem pathetically naive to most modern\nyoung men, who in this respect begin where I leave off.  An actress!\nGreat heavens! an actress is the first step to a knowledge of life.\nBesides, actresses off the stage are either brainless or soulful, and\nthe choice of evils is a delicate one.  Well, I have never set up for a\nman of the world, though sometimes when I have heard the Lovelaces of\nthe day hinting mysteriously at their secret sins or boasting of their\nflorid gallantries, I have remembered the last verse of Suckling's\n\"Ballad of a Wedding,\" which, no doubt, the reader knows as well as I,\nand if not, it will increase his acquaintance with our brave old poetry\nto look it up.\n\n\"You are very beautiful to-night,\" I said, in one of the meditative\npauses between the courses.\n\n\"Thank you, kind sir,\" she said, making a mock courtesy; \"but the\ncompliment is made a little anxious for me by your evident implication\nthat I didn't look so beautiful this morning.  You laid such a marked\nemphasis on to-night.\"\n\n\"Nay,\" I returned, \"'for day and night are both alike to thee.'  I\nthink you would even be beautiful--well, I cannot imagine any moment or\nstation of life you would not beautify.\"\n\n\"I must get you to write that down, and then I'll have it framed.  It\nwould cheer me of a morning when I curl my hair,\" laughed Sylvia.\n\n\"But you are beautiful,\" I continued, becoming quite impassioned.\n\n\"Yes, and as good as I'm beautiful.\"\n\nAnd she was too, though perhaps the beauty occasionally predominated.\n\nWhen the serious business of dining was dispatched, and we were\ntrifling with our coffee and liqueurs, my eyes, which of course had\nseldom left her during the whole meal, once more enfolded her little\nivory and black silk body with an embrace as real as though they had\nbeen straining passionate arms; and as I thus nursed her in my eyes, I\nsmiled involuntarily at a thought which not unnaturally occurred to me.\n\n\"What is that sly smile about?\" she asked.  Now I had smiled to think\nthat underneath that stately silk, around that tight little waist, was\na dainty waistband bearing the legend \"Sylvia Joy,\" No. 4, perhaps, or\n5, but NOT No. 6; and a whole wonderful underworld of lace and linen\nand silk stockings, the counterpart of which wonders, my clairvoyant\nfancy laughed to think, were at the moment--so entirely unsuspected of\ntheir original owner--my delicious possessions.\n\nEverything a woman wears or touches immediately incarnates something of\nherself. A handkerchief, a glove, a flower,--with a breath she endues\nthem with immortal souls.  How much, therefore, of herself must inhere\nin a garment so confidential as a petticoat, or so close and constant a\ncompanion as a stocking!\n\nNow that I knew Sylvia Joy, I realised how absolutely true my instinct\nhad been, when on that far afternoon in that Surrey garden I had said,\n\"With such a petticoat and such a name, Sylvia herself cannot be\notherwise than charming.\"\n\nIndeed, now I could see that the petticoat was nothing short of a\nportrait of her, and that any one learned in the physiognomy of clothes\nwould have been able to pick Sylvia out of a thousand by that spirited,\nspoilt, and petted garment.\n\n\"What is that sly smile about?\" she repeated presently.\n\n\"I only chanced to think of an absurd little fairy story I read the\nother day,\" I said, \"which is quite irrelevant at the moment.  You know\nthe idle way things come and go through one's head.\"\n\n\"I don't believe you,\" she replied, \"but tell me the story.  I love\nfairy tales.\"\n\n\"Certainly,\" I said, for I wasn't likely to get a better opportunity.\n\"There's nothing much in it; it's merely a variation of Cinderella's\nslipper.  Well, once upon a time there was an eccentric young prince\nwho'd had his fling in his day, but had arrived at the lonely age of\nthirty without having met a woman whom he could love enough to make his\nwife.  He was a rather fanciful young prince, accustomed to follow his\nwhims; and one day, being more than usually bored with existence, he\ntook it into his head to ramble incognito through his kingdom in search\nof his ideal wife,--'The Golden Girl,' as he called her.  He had hardly\nset out when in a country lane he came across a peasant girl hanging\nout clothes to dry, and he fell to talk with her while she went on with\nher charming occupation.  Presently he observed, pegged on the line,\nstrangely incongruous among the other homespun garments, a wonderful\npetticoat, so exquisite in material and design that it aroused his\ncuriosity.  At the same moment he noticed a pair of stockings, round\nthe tops of which one of the daintiest artists in the land had wrought\nan exquisite little frieze.  The prince was learned in every form of\nart, and had not failed to study this among other forms of decoration.\nNo sooner did he see this petticoat than the whim seized him that he\nwould find and marry the wearer, whoever she might be--\"\n\n\"Rather rash of him,\" interrupted Sylvia, \"for it is usually old ladies\nwho have the prettiest petticoats.  They can best afford them--\"\n\n\"He questioned the girl as to their owner,\" I continued, \"and after\nvainly pretending that they were her own, she confessed that they had\nbelonged to a young and beautiful lady who had once lodged there and\nleft them behind.  Then the prince gave her a purse of gold in exchange\nfor the finery, and on the waistband of the petticoat he read a\nbeautiful name, and he said, 'This and no other shall be my wife, this\nunknown beautiful woman, and on our marriage night she shall wear this\npetticoat.'  And then the prince went forth seeking--\"\n\n\"There's not much point in it,\" interrupted Sylvia.\n\n\"No,\" I said, \"I'm afraid I've stupidly missed the point.\"\n\n\"Why, what was it?\"\n\n\"The name upon the petticoat!\"\n\n\"Why, what name was it?\" she asked, somewhat mystified.\n\n\"The inscription upon the petticoat was, to be quite accurate, 'Sylvia\nJoy, No. 6.'\"\n\n\"Whatever are you talking about?\" she said with quite a stormy blush.\n\"I'm afraid you've had more than your share of the champagne.\"\n\nAs I finished, I slipped out of my pocket a dainty little parcel softly\nfolded in white tissue paper.  Very softly I placed it on the table.\nIt contained one of the precious stockings; and half opening it, I\nrevealed to Sylvia's astonished eyes the cunning little frieze of\nBacchus and Ariadne, followed by a troop of Satyrs and Bacchantes,\nwhich the artist had designed to encircle one of the white columns of\nthat little marble temple which sat before me.\n\n\"You know,\" I said, \"how in fairy tales, when the wandering hero or the\nmaiden in distress has a guiding dream, the dream often leaves\nsomething behind on the pillow to assure them of its authenticity.\n'When you wake up,' the dream will say, 'you will find a rose or an\noak-leaf or an eagle's feather, or whatever it may be, on your pillow.'\nWell, I have brought this stocking--for which, if I might but use them,\nI have at the moment a stock of the most appropriately endearing\nadjectives--for the same purpose.  By this token you will know that the\nfairy tale I have been telling you is true, and to-morrow, if you will,\nyou shall see your autograph petticoat.\"\n\n\"Why, wherever did you come across them?  And what a mad creature you\nmust be! and what an odd thing that you should really meet me, after\nall!\" exclaimed Sylvia, all in a breath. \"Of course, I remember,\" she\nsaid frankly, and with a shade of sadness passing over her face.  \"I\nwas spending a holiday with Jack Wentworth,--why, it must be nearly two\nyears ago.  Poor Jack! he was killed in the Soudan,\" and poor Jack\ncould have wished no prettier resurrection than the look of tender\nmemory that came into her face as she spoke of him, and the soft baby\ntears filled her eyes.\n\n\"I'm so sorry,\" I said.  \"Of course I didn't know.  Let's come for a\nlittle stroll. There seems to be a lovely moon.\"\n\n\"Of course you didn't,\" she said, patting my cheek with a kind little\nhand.  \"Yes, do let us go for a stroll.\"\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XI\n\n\"THE HOUR FOR WHICH THE YEARS DID SIGH\"\n\nThis unexpected awakening of an old tenderness naturally prevented my\nspeaking any more of my mind to Sylvia that evening. No doubt the\nreader may be a little astonished to hear that I had decided to offer\nher marriage,--not taking my serious view of a fanciful vow.  Doubtless\nSylvia was not entirely suitable to me, and to marry her was to be\nfaithless to that vision of the highest, that wonderful unknown woman\nof the apocalyptic moorland, whose face Sylvia had not even momentarily\nbanished from my dreams, and whom, with an unaccountable certitude, I\nstill believed to be the woman God had destined for me; but, all things\nconsidered, Sylvia was surely as pretty an answer to prayer as a man\ncould reasonably hope for.  Many historic vows had met with sadly less\nlucky fulfilment.\n\nSo, after dinner the following evening, I suggested that we should for\nonce take a little walk up along the river-side; and when we were quiet\nin the moonlight, dappling the lovers' path we were treading, and\nmaking sharp contrasts of ink and silver down in the river-bed,--I\nspoke.\n\n\"Sylvia,\" I said, plagiarising a dream which will be found in Chapter\nIV.,--\"Sylvia, I have sought you through the world and found you at\nlast; and with your gracious permission, having found you, I mean to\nstick to you.\"\n\n\"What do you mean, silly boy?\" she said, as an irregularity in the road\nthrew her soft weight the more fondly upon my arm.\n\n\"I mean, dear, that I want you to be my wife.\"\n\n\"Your wife?  Not for worlds!--no, forgive me, I didn't mean that.\nYou're an awful dear boy, and I like you very much, and I think you're\nrather fond of me; but--well, the truth is, I was never meant to be\nmarried, and don't care about it--and when you think of it, why should\nI?\"\n\n\"You mean,\" I said, \"that you are fortunate in living in a society\nwhere, as in heaven, there is neither marrying nor giving in marriage,\nwhere in fact nobody minds whether you're married or not, and where\nmorals are very properly regarded as a personal and private matter--\"\n\n\"Yes, that's what I mean,\" said Sylvia; \"the people I care about--dear\ngood people--will think no more of me for having a wedding-ring, and no\nless for my being without; and why should one put a yoke round one's\nneck when nobody expects it?  A wedding-ring is like a top-hat,--you\nonly wear it when you must--But it's very sweet of you, all the same,\nand you can kiss me if you like.  Here's a nice sentimental patch of\nmoonlight.\"\n\nI really felt very dejected at this not of course entirely unexpected\nrejection,--if one might use the word for a situation on which had just\nbeen set the seal of so unmistakable a kiss; but the vision in my heart\nseemed to smile at me in high and happy triumph.  To have won Sylvia\nwould have been to have lost her.  My ideal had, as it were, held her\nbreath till Sylvia answered; now she breathed again.\n\n\"At all events, we can go on being chums, can't we?\" I said.\n\nFor answer Sylvia hummed the first verse of that famous song writ by\nKit Marlowe.\n\n\"Yes!\" she said presently.  \"I will sing for you, dance for you,\nand--perhaps--flirt with you; but marry you--no! it's best not, for\nboth of us.\"\n\n\"Well, then,\" I said, \"dance for me!  You owe me some amends for an\naching heart.\" As I said this, the path suddenly broadened into a\nlittle circular glade into which the moonlight poured in a silver\nflood.  In the centre of the space was a boulder some three or four\nfeet high, and with a flat slab-like surface of some six feet or so.\n\n\"I declare I will,\" said Sylvia, giving me an impulsive kiss, and\nspringing on to the stone; \"why, here is a ready-made stage.\"\n\n\"And there,\" I said, \"are the nightingale and the nightjar for\norchestra.\"\n\n\"And there is the moon,\" said she, \"for lime-light man.\"\n\n\"Yes,\" I said; \"and here is a handful of glow-worms for the footlights.\"\n\nThen lifting up her heavy silk skirt about her, and revealing a\nparadise of chiffons, Sylvia swayed for a moment with her face full in\nthe moon, and then slowly glided into the movements of a mystical dance.\n\nIt was thus the fountains were dancing to the moon in Arabia; it was\nthus the Nixies shook their white limbs on the haunted banks of the\nRhine; it was thus the fairy women flashed their alabaster feet on the\nfairy hills of Connemara; it was thus the Houris were dancing for\nMahomet on the palace floors of Paradise.\n\n\"It was over such dancing,\" I said, \"that John the Baptist lost his\nhead.\"\n\n\"Give me a kiss,\" she said, nestling exhausted in my arms.  \"I always\nwant some one to kiss when I have danced with my soul as well as my\nbody.\"\n\n\"I think we always do,\" I said, \"when we've done anything that seems\nwonderful, that gives us the thrill of really doing--\"\n\n\"And a poor excuse is better than none, isn't it, dear?\" said Sylvia,\nher face full in the cataract of the moonlight.\n\nAs a conclusion for this chapter I will copy out a little song which I\nextemporised for Sylvia on our way home to Yellowsands--too artlessly\nhappy, it will be observed, to rhyme correctly:--\n\n  Sylvia's dancing 'neath the moon,\n    Like a star in water;\n  Sylvia's dancing to a tune\n    Fairy folk have taught her.\n\n  Glow-worms light her little feet\n    In her fairy theatre;\n  Oh, but Sylvia is sweet!\n    Tell me who is sweeter!\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XII\n\nAT THE CAFE DE LA PAIX\n\nAs love-making in which we have no share is apt to be either\ntantalising or monotonous, I propose to skip the next fortnight and\nintroduce myself to the reader at a moment when I am once more alone.\nIt is about six o'clock on a summer afternoon, I am in Paris, and\nseated at one of the little marble tables of the Cafe de la Paix,\ndreamily watching the glittering tide of gay folk passing by,--\n\n  \"All happy people on their way\n  To make a golden end of day.\"\n\n\nMeditatively I smoke a cigarette and sip a pale greenish liquor\nsmelling strongly of aniseed, which isn't half so interesting as a\ncommonplace whiskey and soda, but which, I am told, has the\nrecommendation of being ten times as wicked.  I sip it with a delicious\nthrill of degeneration, as though I were Eve tasting the apple for the\nfirst time,--for \"such a power hath white simplicity.\"  Sin is for the\ninnocent,--a truth which sinners will be the first to regret.  It was\nso, I said to myself, Alfred de Musset used to sit and sip his absinthe\nbefore a fascinated world.  It is a privilege for the world to look on\ngreatness at any moment, even when it is drinking. So I sat, and\nprivileged the world.\n\nIt will readily be surmised from this exordium that--incredible as it\nmay seem in a man of thirty--this was my first visit to Paris.  You may\nremember that I had bought Orlando's tickets, and it had occurred to\nSylvia and me to use them.  Sylvia was due in London to fulfil a\ndancing engagement within a fortnight after our arrival; so after a\ntender good-bye, which there was no earthly necessity to make final, I\nhad remained behind for the purposes of study.  Though, logically, my\npilgrimage had ended with the unexpected discovery of Sylvia Joy, yet\nthere were two famous feminine types of which, seeing that I was in\nParis, I thought I might as well make brief studies, before I returned\nto London and finally resumed the bachelorhood from which I had\nstarted.  These were the grisette of fiction and the American girl of\nfact.  Pending these investigations, I meditated on the great city in\nthe midst of which I sat.\n\nA city!  How much more it was than that! Was it not the most portentous\nsymbol of modern history?  Think what the word \"Paris\" means to the\nemancipated intellect, to the political government, to the humanised\nmorals, of the world; not to speak of the romance of its literature,\nthe tradition of its manners, and the immortal fame of its women.\nFrance is the brain of the world, as England is its heart, and Russia\nits fist.  Strange is the power, strange are the freaks and revenges,\nof association, particularly perhaps of literary association.  Here\npompous official representatives may demur; but who can doubt that it\nis on its literature that a country must rely for its permanent\nrepresentation? The countries that are forgotten, or are of no\nimportance in the councils of the world, are countries without\nliterature.  Greece and Rome are more real in print than ever they were\nin marble.  Though, as we know, prophets are not without honour save in\ntheir own countries and among their own kindred, the time comes when\ntheir countries and kindred are entirely without honour save by reason\nof those very prophets they once despised, rejected, stoned, and\ncrucified. Subtract its great men from a nation, and where is its\ngreatness?\n\nSimilarly, everything, however trifling, that has been written about,\nso long as it has been written about sufficiently well, becomes\nrelatively enduring and representative of the country in which it is\nfound.  To an American, for example, the significance of a skylark is\nthat Shelley sang it to skies where even it could never have mounted;\nand any one who has heard the nightingale must, if he be open-minded,\nconfess its tremendous debt to Keats: a tenth part genuine song, the\nrest moon, stars, silence, and John Keats,--such is the nightingale.\nThe real truth about a country will never be known till every\nrepresentative type and condition in it have found their inspired\nliterary mouthpiece. Meanwhile one country takes its opinion of another\nfrom the apercus of a few brilliant but often irresponsible or\nprejudiced writers,--and really it is rather in what those writers\nleave out than in what they put in that one must seek the more reliable\ndata of national character.\n\nA quaint example of association occurs to me from the experience of a\nfriend of mine, \"rich enough to lend to the poor.\"  Having met an\nAmerican friend newly landed at Liverpool, and a hurried quarter of an\nhour being all that was available for lunch, \"Come let us have a\npork-pie and a bottle of Bass\" he had suggested.\n\n\"Pork-pies!\" said the American, with a delighted sense of discovering\nthe country,--\"why, you read about them in Dickens!\" Who shall say but\nthat this instinctive association was an involuntary severe, but not\ninapplicable, criticism?  A nightingale suggests Keats; a pork-pie,\nDickens.\n\nSimilarly with absinthe, grisettes, the Latin Quarter, and so on.\n\nWhy, you read about them in Murger, in Musset, in Balzac, and in\nFlaubert; and the fact of your having read about them is, I may add,\ntheir chief importance.\n\nSo rambled my after-dinner reflections as I sat that evening smoking\nand sipping, sipping and smoking, at the Cafe de la Paix.\n\nPresently in my dream I became aware of English voices near me, one of\nwhich seemed familiar, and which I couldn't help overhearing.  The\nvoice of the husband said,--you can never mistake the voice of the\nhusband,--\n\n  'T was the voice of the husband,\n  I heard him complain,--\n\nthe voice of the husband said:  \"Dora, I forbid you!  I will NOT allow\nmy wife to be seen again in the Latin Quarter.  I permitted you to go\nonce, as a concession, to the Cafe d'Harcourt; but once is enough. You\nwill please respect my wishes!\"\n\n\"But,\" pleaded the dear little woman, whom I had an immediate impulse,\nPerseus-like, to snatch from the jaws of her monster, and turning to\nthe other lady of the party of four,--\"but Mrs. ---- has never been,\nand she cannot well go without a chaperone. Surely it cannot matter for\nonce.  It isn't as if I were there constantly.\"\n\n\"No!\" said the husband, with the absurd pomposity of his tribe.\n\n\"I'm very sorry. Mrs. ---- will, of course, act as she pleases; but I\ncannot allow you to do it, Dora.\"\n\nAt last the little wife showed some spirit.\n\n\"Don't talk to me like that, Will,\" she said.  \"I shall go if I please.\nSurely I am my own property.\"\n\n\"Not at all!\" at once flashed out the husband, wounded in that most\nvital part of him, his sense of property.  \"There you mistake.  You are\nmy property, MY chattel; you promised obedience to me; I bought you,\nand you do my bidding!\"\n\n\"Great heavens!\" I ejaculated, and, springing up, found myself face to\nface with a well-known painter whom you would have thought the most\nBohemian fellow in London. And Bohemian he is; but Bohemians are seldom\nBohemians for any one save themselves. They are terrible sticklers for\nconvention and even etiquette in other people.\n\nWe recognised each other with a laugh, and presently were at it, hammer\nand tongs. I may say that we were all fairly intimate friends, and thus\nhad the advantage of entire liberty of speech. I looked daggers at the\nhusband; he looked daggers at me, and occasionally looking at his wife,\ngave her a glance which was like the opening of Bluebeard's closet.\nYou could see the poor murdered bodies dangling within the shadowy\ncupboard of his eye. Of course we got no further.  Additional\nopposition but further enraged him.  He recapitulated what he would no\ndoubt call his arguments,--they sounded more like threats,--and as he\nspoke I saw dragons fighting for their dams in the primeval ooze, and\nheard savage trumpetings of masculine monsters without a name.\n\nI told him so.\n\n\"You are,\" I said,--\"and you will forgive my directness of\nexpression,--you are the Primeval Male!  You are the direct descendant\nof those Romans who carried off the Sabine women. Nay! you have a much\nlonger genealogy.  You come of those hairy anthropoid males who hunted\ntheir mates through the tangle of primeval forests, and who finally\nobtained their consent--shall we say?--by clubbing them on the head\nwith a stone axe.  You talk a great deal of nonsense about the New\nWoman, but you, Sir, are THE OLD MALE; and,\" I continued, \"I have only\nto obtain your wife's consent to take her under my protection this\ninstant.\"\n\nCuriously enough, \"The Old Male,\" as he is now affectionately called,\nbecame from this moment quite a bosom friend.  Nothing would satisfy us\nbut that we should all lodge at the same pension together, and there\nmany a day we fought our battles over again. But that poor little wife\nnever, to my knowledge, went to the Cafe d'Harcourt again.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XIII\n\nTHE INNOCENCE OF PARIS\n\nThis meeting with William and Dora was fortunate from the point of view\nof my studies; for that very night, as I dined with them en pension, I\nfound that providence, with his usual foresight, had placed me next to\na very charming American girl of the type that I was particularly\nwishful to study.  She seemed equally wishful to be studied, and we got\non amazingly from the first moment of our acquaintance.  By the middle\nof dinner we were pressing each other's feet under the table, and when\ncoffee and cigarettes had come, we were affianced lovers.  \"Why should\nI blush to own I love?\" was evidently my quaint little companion's\nmotto; and indeed she didn't blush to own it to the whole table, and\npublicly to announce that I was the dearest boy, and absolutely the\nmost lovable man she had  met.  There was nothing she wouldn't do for\nme.  Would she brave the terrors of the Latin Quarter with me, I asked,\nand introduce me to the terrible Cafe d'Harcourt, about which William\nand Dora had suffered such searchings of heart?  \"Why, certainly; there\nwas nothing in that,\" she said.  So we went.\n\nNothing is more absurd and unjust than those crude labels of national\ncharacter which label one country virtuous and another vicious, one\nmusical and another literary.  Thus France has an unjust reputation for\nvice, and England an equally unjust reputation for virtue.\n\nI had always, I confess, been brought up to think of Paris as a sort of\nSodom and Gomorrah in one.  Good Americans might go to Paris, according\nto the American theory of a future state; but, certainly I had thought,\nno good Englishman ever went there--except, maybe, on behalf of the\nVigilance Society.  Well, it may sound an odd thing to say, but what\nimpressed me most of all was the absolute innocence of the place.\n\nI mean this quite seriously.  For surely one important condition of\ninnocence is unconsciousness of doing wrong.  The poor despised\nParisian may be a very wicked and depraved person, but certainly he\ngoes about with an absolute unconsciousness of it upon his gay and\nkindly countenance.\n\n\"Seeing the world\" usually means seeing everything in it that most\ndecent people won't look at; but when you come to look at these\nterrible things and places, what do you find?  Why, absolute\ndisappointment!\n\nHave you ever read that most amusing book, \"Baedeker on Paris\"?\n\nI know nothing more delightful than the notes to the Montmartre and\nLatin Quarters.  The places to which you, as a smug Briton, may or may\nnot take a lady!  The scale of wickedness allowed to the waxwork\nBritish lady is most charmingly graduated.  I had read that the cafe\nwhere we were sitting was one of the most terrible places in\nParis,--the Cafe d'Harcourt, where the students of the Latin Quarter\ntake their nice little domestic mistresses to supper.  But Baedeker was\ndreadfully Pecksniffian about these poor innocent etudiantes, many of\nwhom love their lovers much more truly than many a British wife loves\nher husband, and are much better loved in return.  If you doubt it,\ndare to pay attention to one of these young ladies, and you will\nprobably have to fight a duel for it.  In fact, these romantic\nrelations are much more careful of honour than conventional ones; for\nlove, and not merely law, keeps guard.\n\nI looked around me.  Where were those terrible things I had read of?\nWhere was this hell which I had reasonably expected would gape leagues\nof sulphur and blue flame beneath the little marble table?  I mentally\nresolved to bring an action against Baedeker for false information.\nFor what did I see?  Simply pairs and groups of young men and women\nchattering amiably in front of their \"bocks\" or their \"Americains.\"\nHere and there a student would have his arm round a waist every one\nelse envied him.  One student was prettily trying a pair of new gloves\nupon his little woman's hand.  Here and there blithe songs would spring\nup, from sheer gladness of heart; and never was such a buzz of happy\nyoung people, not even at a Sunday-school treat. To me it seemed\nabsolutely Arcadian, and I thought of Daphnis and Chloe and the early\nworld.  Nothing indecorous or gross; all perfectly pretty and seemly.\n\nOn our way home Semiramis was so sweet to me, in her innocent, artless\nfrankness, that I went to bed with an intoxicating feeling that I must\nbe irresistible indeed, to have so completely conquered so true a heart\nin so few hours.  I was the more flattered because I am not a vain man,\nand am not, like some, accustomed to take hearts as the Israelites took\nJericho with the blast of one's own trumpet.\n\nBut, alas! my dream of universal irresistibility was but short-lived,\nfor next afternoon, as William and I sat out at some cafe together, I\nfound myself the object of chaff.\n\n\"Well,\" said William, \"how goes the love-affair?\"\n\nI flushed somewhat indignantly at his manner with sanctities.\n\n\"I see!\" he said, \"I see!  You are already corded and labelled, and\nwill be shipped over by the next mail,--'To Miss Semiramis Wilcox, 1001\n99th St., Philadelphia, U.S.A.  Man with care.'  Well, I did think\nyou'd got an eye in your head. Look here, don't be a fool!  I suppose\nshe said you were the first and last.  The last you certainly were.\nThere are limits even to the speed of American girls; but the first, my\nboy!  You are more like the twelfth, to my ocular knowledge.  Here\ncomes Dubois the poet.  He can tell you something about Miss Semiramis.\nEh!  Dubois, you know Miss Semiramis Wilcox, don't you?\"\n\nThe Frenchman smiled and shrugged.\n\n\"Un peu,\" he said.\n\n\"Don't be an ass and get angry,\" William continued; \"it's all for your\nown good.\"\n\n\"The little Semiramis has been seducing my susceptible friend here.\nLike many of us, he has been captivated by her naturalness, her\nnaivete, her clear good eyes,--that look of nature that is always art!\nMay I relate the idyl of your tragic passion, dear Dubois, as an object\nlesson?\"\n\nThe Frenchman bowed, and signed William to proceed.\n\n\"You dined with us one evening, and you thus met for the first time.\nYou sat together at table.  What happened with the fish?\"\n\n\"She swore I was the most beautiful man she had ever seen,--and I am\nnot beautiful, as you perceive.\"\n\nIf not beautiful, the poet was certainly true.\n\n\"What happened at the entree?\"\n\n\"Oh, long before that we were pressing our feet under the table.\"\n\n\"And the coffee--\"\n\n\"Mon Dieu! we were Tristram and Yseult, we were all the great lovers in\nthe Pantheon of love.\"\n\n\"And what then?\"\n\n\"Oh, we went to the Cafe d'Harcourt--mon ami.\"\n\n\"Did she wear a veil?\" I asked.\n\n\"Oui, certainement!\"\n\n\"And did you say, 'Why do you wear a veil,--setting a black cloud\nbefore the eyes and gates of heaven'?\"\n\n\"The very words,\" said the Frenchman.\n\n\"And did she say, 'Yes, but the veil can be raised?'\"\n\n\"She did, mon pauvre ami,\" said the poet.\n\n\"And did you raise it?\"\n\n\"I did,\" said the poet.\n\n\"And so did I,\" I answered.  And as I spoke, there was a crash of white\nmarble in my soul, and lo!  Love had fallen from his pedestal and been\nbroken into a thousand pieces,--a heavy, dead thing he lay upon the\nthreshold of my heart.\n\nWe had appointed a secret meeting in the salon of the pension that\nafternoon.  I was not there!  (Nor, as I afterwards learnt, was\nSemiramis.)  When we did meet, I was brutally cold.  I evaded all her\nmoves; but when at last I decided to give her a hearing, I confess it\nneeded all my cynicism to resist her air of innocence, of pathetic\ndevotion.\n\nIf I couldn't love her, she said, might she go on loving me? Might she\nwrite to me sometimes?  She would be content if now and again I would\nsend her a little word. Perhaps in time I would grow to believe in her\nlove, etc.\n\nThe heart-broken abandonment with which she said this was a sore trial\nto me; but though love may be deceived, vanity is ever vigilant, and\nvanity saved me.  Yet I left her with an aching sense of having been a\nbrute, and on the morning of my departure from Paris, as I said\ngood-bye to William and Dora, I spoke somewhat seriously of Semiramis.\nDora, Dora-like, had believed in her all along,--not having enjoyed\nWilliam's opportunities of studying her,--and she reproached me with\nbeing rather hard-hearted.\n\n\"Nonsense,\" said William, \"if she really cared, wouldn't she have been\nup to bid you good-bye?\"\n\nThe words were hardly gone from his lips when there came a little knock\nat the door. It was Semiramis; she had come to say good-bye. Was it in\nnature not to be touched? \"Good-bye,\" she said, as we stood a moment\nalone in the hall.  \"I shall always think of you; you shall not be to\nme as a ship that has passed in the night, though to me you have\nbehaved very like an iceberg.\"\n\nWe parted in tears and kisses, and I lived for some weeks with that\nsense of having been a Nero, till two months after I received a much\nglazed and silvered card to the usual effect.\n\nAnd so I ceased to repine for the wound I had made in the heart of\nSemiramis Wilcox.\n\nOf another whom I met and loved in that brief month in Paris, I cherish\ntenderer memories.  Prim little Pauline Deschapelles! How clearly I can\nstill see the respectable brass plate on the door of your little\nflat--\"Mademoiselle Deschapelles--Modes et Robes;\" and indeed the\n\"modes et robes\" were true enough.  For you were in truth a very\nhard-working little dressmaker, and I well remember how impressed I was\nto sit beside you, as you plied your needle on some gown that must be\nfinished by the evening, and meditate on the quaint contrast between\nyour almost Puritanic industry and your innocent love of pleasure.  I\ndon't think I ever met a more conscientious little woman than little\nPauline Deschapelles.\n\nThere was but one drawback to our intercourse.  She didn't know a word\nof English, and I couldn't speak a word of French.  So we had to make\nshift to love without either language.  But sometimes Pauline would\nthrow down her stitching in amused impatience, and, going to her dainty\nsecretaire, write me a little message in the simplest baby\nFrench--which I would answer in French which would knit her brows for a\nmoment or two, and then send her off in peals of laughter.\n\nIt WAS French!  I know.  Among the bric-a-brac of my heart I still\ncherish some of those little slips of paper with which we made\ninternational love--question and answer.\n\n\"Vous allez m'oublier, et ne plus penser a moi--ni me voir.  Les\nhommes--egoistes--menteurs, pas dire la verite...\" so ran the\nquestions, considerably devoid of auxiliary verbs and such details of\nconstruction.\n\n\"Je serais jamais t'oublier,\" ran the frightful answers!\n\nDear Pauline!  Shall I ever see her again?  She was but twenty-six.\nShe may still live.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XIV\n\nEND OF BOOK THREE\n\nSo ended my pilgrimage.  I had wandered far, had loved many, but I came\nback to London without the Golden Girl.  I had begun my pilgrimage with\na vision, and it was with a vision that I ended it.  From all my goings\nto and fro upon the earth, I had brought back only the image of a\nwoman's face,--the face of that strange woman of the moorland, still\nhaunting my dreams of the night and the day.\n\nIt was autumn in my old garden, damp and forsaken, and the\nmulberry-tree was hung with little yellow shields.  My books looked\nweary of awaiting me, and they and the whole lonely house begged me to\ntake them where sometimes they might be handled by human fingers,\nmellowed by lamplight, cheered by friendly laughter.\n\nThe very chairs begged mutely to be sat upon, the chill white beds to\nbe slept in.  Yes, the very furniture seemed even lonelier than myself.\n\nSo I took heed of their dumb appeal.\n\n\"I know,\" I answered them tenderly,--\"I too, with you, have looked on\nbetter days, I too have been where bells have knoll'd to church, I too\nhave sat at many a good man's feast,--yes!  I miss human society, even\nas you, my books, my bedsteads, and my side-boards,--so let it be.  It\nis plain our little Margaret is not coming back, our little Margaret,\ndear haunted rooms, will never come back; no longer shall her little\nsilken figure flit up and down your quiet staircases, her hands filled\nwith flowers, and her heart humming with little songs.  Yes, let us go,\nit is very lonely; we shall die if we stay here all so lonely together;\nit is time, let us go.\"\n\nSo thereon I wrote to a furniture-remover, and went out to walk round\nthe mossy old garden for the last time, and say good-bye to the great\nmulberry, under whose Dodonaesque shade we had sat half frightened on\nstarry nights, to the apple-trees whose blossom had seemed like\nfairy-land to Margaret and me, town-bred folk, to the apricots and the\npeaches and the nectarines that it had seemed almost wicked to own,--as\nthough we had gone abroad in silk and velvet,--to the little grassy\norchard, and to the little green corner of it, where Margaret had\nfallen asleep that summer afternoon, in the great wicker-chair, and I\nhad brought a dear friend on tiptoe to gaze on her asleep, with her\nolive cheeks delicately flushed, her great eyelids closed like the\ncheeks of roses, and her gold hair tumbled about her neck...\n\nWell, well, good-bye,--tears are foolish things.  They will not bring\nMargaret back. Good-bye, old garden, good-bye, I shall never see you\nagain,--good-bye.\n\n\n\n\nBOOK IV\n\nTHE POSTSCRIPT TO A PILGRIMAGE\n\n\n\nCHAPTER I\n\nSIX YEARS AFTER\n\nThis book is like a woman's letter.  The most important part of it is\nthe postscript.\n\nSix years lie between the end of the last chapter and the beginning of\nthis. Meanwhile, I had moved to sociable chambers within sound of the\ncity clocks, and had lived the life of a lonely man about town, sinking\nmore and more into the comfortable sloth of bachelorhood.  I had long\ncome to look back upon my pilgrimage as a sort of Indian-summer youth,\nbeing, as the reader can reckon for himself, just on thirty-seven.  As\none will, with one's most serious experiences, hastening to laugh lest\none should weep, as the old philosopher said, I had made some fun out\nof my quest, in the form of a paper for a bookish society to which I\nbelonged, on \"Woman as a Learned Pursuit.\"  It is printed among the\ntransactions of the society, and is accessible to the curious only by\nloan from the members, and I regret that I am unable to print any\nextracts here.  Perhaps when I am dead the society will see the\ncriminal selfishness of reserving for itself what was meant for mankind.\n\nMeanwhile, however, it is fast locked and buried deep in the archives\nof the club. I have two marriages to record in the interval: one that\nof a young lady whom I must still think of as 'Nicolete' to Sir\nMarmaduke Pettigrew, Bart., of Dultowers Hall, and the other the\nwell-known marriage of Sylvia Joy...\n\nSylvia Joy married after all her fine protestations!  Yes! but I'm sure\nyou will forgive her, for she was married to a lord. When one is twenty\nand romantic one would scorn a woman who would jilt us for wealth and\nposition; at thirty, one would scorn any woman who didn't.  Ah me! how\none changes!  No one, I can honestly say, was happier over these two\nweddings than I, and I sent Sylvia her petticoat as a wedding present.\n\n\nBut it was to tell of other matters that I reopen this book and once\nmore take up my pen--matters so near to my heart that I shrink from\nwriting of them, and am half afraid that the attempt may prove too hard\nfor me after all, and my book end on a broken cry of pain.  Yet, at the\nsame time, I want to write of them, for they are beautiful and solemn,\nand good food for the heart.\n\nBesides, though my pilgrimage had been ended so long, they are really a\npart, yea, the part for which, though I knew it not, all the rest has\nbeen written--for they tell how I came to find by accident her whom so\nlong I had sought of design.\n\nHow shall I tell of Thee who, first and last of all women, gave and\nawoke in me that love which is the golden key of the world, the mystic\nrevelation of the holy meaning of life, love that alone may pass\nthrough the awful gates of the stars, and gaze unafraid into the blue\nabysses beyond?\n\nAh!  Love, it seemed far away indeed from the stars, the place where we\nmet, and only by the light of love's eyes might we have found each\nother--as only by the light of love's eyes...  But enough, my Heart,\nthe world waits to hear our story,--the world once so unloving to you,\nthe world with a heart so hard and anon so soft for love. When the\nstory is ended, my love, when the story is ended--\n\n\n\nCHAPTER II\n\nGRACE O' GOD\n\nIt was a hard winter's night four years ago, lovely and merciless; and\ntowards midnight I walked home from a theatre to my rooms in St.\nJames's Street.  The Venusberg of Piccadilly looked white as a nun with\nsnow and moonlight, but the melancholy music of pleasure, and the sad\ndaughters of joy, seemed not to heed the cold.  For another hour death\nand pleasure would dance there beneath the electric lights.\n\nThrough the strange women clustering at the corners I took my\nway,--women of the Moabites, Ammonites, Edomites, Zidonians, and\nHittites,--and I thought, as I looked into their poor painted\nfaces,--faces but half human, vampirish faces, faces already waxen with\nthe look of the grave,--I thought, as I often did, of the poor little\ngirl whom De Quincey loved, the good-hearted little 'peripatetic' as he\ncalled her, who had succoured him during those nights, when, as a young\nman, he wandered homeless about these very streets,--that good, kind\nlittle Ann whom De Quincey had loved, then so strangely lost, and for\nwhose face he looked into women's faces as long as he lived.  Often\nhave I stood at the corner of Titchfield Street, and thought how De\nQuincey had stood there night after night waiting for her to come, but\nall in vain, and how from the abyss of oblivion into which some cruel\nchance had swept her, not one cry from her ever reached him again.\n\nI thought, too, as I often did, what if the face I seek should be here\namong these poor outcasts,--golden face hidden behind a mask of shame,\ntrue heart still beating true even amidst this infernal world!\n\nThus musing, I had walked my way out of the throng, and only a figure\nhere and there in the shadows of doorways waited and waited in the cold.\n\nIt was something about one of these waiting figures,--some movement,\nsome chance posture,--that presently surprised my attention and\nawakened a sudden sense of half recognition.  She stood well in the\nshadow, seeming rather to shrink from than to court attention.  As I\nwalked close by her and looked keenly into her face, she cast down her\neyes and half turned away.  Surely, I had seen that tall, noble figure\nsomewhere before, that haughty head; and then with the apparition a\nthought struck me--but, no! it couldn't be she! not HERE!\n\n\"It is,\" said my soul, as I turned and walked past her again; \"you\nmissed her once, are you going to miss her again?\"\n\n\"It is,\" said my eyes, as they swept her for the third time; \"but she\nhad glorious chestnut hair, and the hair of this woman is--gilded.\"\n\n\"It is she,\" said my heart; \"thank God, it is she!\"\n\nSo it was that I went up to that tall, shy figure.\n\n\"It must be very cold here,\" I said; \"will you not join me in some\nsupper?\"\n\nShe assented, and we sought one of the many radiating centres of\nfestivity in the neighbourhood.  She was very tired and cold,--so tired\nshe seemed hardly to have the spirit to eat, and evidently the cold had\ntaken tight clutch of her lungs, for she had a cough that went to my\nheart to hear, and her face was ghastly pale.  When I had persuaded her\nto drink a little wine, she grew more animated and spots of suspicious\ncolour came into her cheeks.  So far she had seemed all but oblivious\nof my presence, but now she gave me a sweet smile of gratitude, one of\nthose irradiating transfiguring smiles that change the whole face, and\nbelong to few faces, the heavenly smile of a pure soul.\n\nYes, it was she!  The woman who sat in front of me was the woman whom I\nhad met so strangely that day on that solitary moorland, and whom in\nprophecy still more strange my soul had declared to be, \"now and for\never and before all worlds the woman God had created for me, and that\nunless I could be hers and she mine, there could be no home, no peace,\nfor either of us so long as we lived--\" and now so strangely met again.\n\nYes, it was she!\n\nFor the moment my mind had room for no other thought.  I cared not to\nconjecture by what devious ways God had brought her to my side.  I\ncared not what mire her feet had trodden.  She had carried her face\npure as a lily through all the foul and sooty air.  There was a pure\nheart in her voice.  Sin is of the soul, and this soul had not sinned!\nLet him that is without sin amongst you cast the first stone.\n\n\"Why did you dye that wonderful chestnut hair?\" I asked her\npresently--and was sorry next minute for the pain that shot across her\nface, but I just wanted to hint at what I designed not to reveal fully\ntill later on, and thus to hint too that it was not as one of the\nnumber of her defilers that I had sought her.\n\n\"Why,\" she said, \"how do you know the colour of my hair?  We have never\nmet before.\"\n\n\"Yes, we have,\" I said, \"and that was why I spoke to you to-night.\nI'll tell you where it was another time.\"\n\nBut after all I could not desist from telling her that night, for, as\nafterwards at her lodging we sat over the fire, talking as if we had\nknown each other all our lives, there seemed no reason for an arbitrary\ndelay.\n\nI described to her the solitary moorland road, and the grey-gowned\nwoman's figure in front of me, and the gig coming along to meet her,\nand the salutation of the two girls, and I told her all one look of her\nface had meant for me, and how I had wildly sought her in vain, and\nfrom that day to this had held her image in my heart.\n\nAnd as I told her, she sobbed with her head against my knees and her\ngreat hair filling my lap with gold.  In broken words she drew for me\nthe other side of the picture of that long-past summer day.\n\nYes, the girl in the gig was her sister, and they were the only\ndaughters of a farmer who had been rich once, but had come to ruin by\ndrink and misfortune.  They had been brought up from girls by an old\ngrandmother, with whom the sister was living at the time of my seeing\nthem.  Yes, Tom was her husband. He was a doctor in the neighbourhood\nwhen he married her, and a man, I surmised, of some parts and promise,\nbut, moving to town, he had fallen into loose ways, taken to drinking\nand gambling, and had finally deserted her for another woman--at the\nvery moment when their first child was born.  The child died \"Thank\nGod!\" she added with sudden vehemence, and \"I--well, you will wonder\nhow I came to this, I wonder myself--it has all happened but six months\nago, and yet I seem to have forgotten--only the broken-hearted and the\nhungry would understand, if I could remember--and yet it was not life,\ncertainly not life I wanted--and yet I couldn't die--\"\n\nThe more I came to know Elizabeth and realise the rare delicacy of her\nnature, the simplicity of her mind, and the purity of her soul, the\nless was I able to comprehend the psychology of that false step which\nher great misery had forced her to take.  For hers was not a sensual,\npleasure-loving nature.  In fact, there was a certain curious\nPuritanism about her, a Puritanism which found a startlingly\nincongruous and almost laughable expression in the Scripture almanac\nwhich hung on the wall at the end of her bed, and the Bible, and two or\nthree Sunday-school stories which, with a copy of \"Jane Eyre,\" were the\nonly books that lay upon the circular mahogany table.\n\nOnce I ventured gently to chaff her about this religiosity of hers.\n\n\"But surely you believe in God, dear,\" she had answered, \"you're not an\natheist!\"\n\nI think an atheist, with all her experience of human monsters, was for\nher the depth of human depravity.\n\n\"No, dear,\" I had answered; \"if you can believe in God, surely I can!\"\n\nI repeat that this gap in Elizabeth's psychology puzzled me, and it\npuzzles me still, but it puzzled me only as the method of working out\nsome problem which after all had \"come out right\" might puzzle one. It\nwas only the process that was obscure. The result was gold, whatever\nthe dark process might be.  Was it simply that Elizabeth was one of\nthat rare few who can touch pitch and not be defiled?--or was it, I\nhave sometimes wondered, an unconscious and after all a sound casuistry\nthat had saved Elizabeth's soul, an instinctive philosophy that taught\nher, so to say, to lay a Sigurd's sword between her soul and body, and\nto argue that nothing can defile the body without the consent of the\nsoul.\n\nIn deep natures there is always what one might call a lover's leap to\nbe taken by those that would love them--something one cannot understand\nto be taken on trust, something even that one fears to be gladly\nadventured ... all this, and more, I knew that I could safely venture\nfor Elizabeth's sake, ere I kissed her white brow and stole away in the\nearly hours of that winter's morning.\n\nAs I did so I had taken one of the sumptuous strands of her hair into\nmy hand and kissed it too.\n\n\"Promise me to let this come back to its own beautiful colour,\" I had\nsaid, as I nodded to a little phial labelled \"Peroxide of Hydrogen\" on\nher mantelshelf.\n\n\"Would you like to?\" she had said.\n\n\"Yes, do it for me.\"\n\nOne day some months after I cut from her dear head one long thick lock,\none half of which was gold and the other half chestnut. I take it out\nand look at it as I write, and, as when I first cut it, it seems still\na symbol of Elizabeth's life, the sun and the shadow, only that the\ngold was the shadow, and the chestnut was the sun.\n\nThe time came when the locks, from crown to tip, were all chestnut--but\nwhen it came I would have given the world for them to be gold again;\nfor Elizabeth had said a curious thing when she had given me her\npromise.\n\n\"All right, dear,\" she had said, \"but something tells me that when they\nare all brown again our happiness will be at an end.\"\n\n\"How long will that take?\" I had said, trying to be gay, though an\ninvoluntary shudder had gone through me, less at her words than because\nof the strange conviction of her manner.\n\n\"About two years,--perhaps a little more,\" she said, answering me quite\nseriously, as she gravely measured the shining tresses, half her body's\nlength, with her eye.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER III\n\nTHE GOLDEN GIRL\n\nOne fresh and sunny morning, some months after this night, Elizabeth\nand I stood before the simple altar of a little country church, for the\nnews had come to us that her husband was dead, and thus we were free to\nbelong to each other before all the world.  The exquisite stillness in\nthe cool old church was as the peace in our hearts, and the rippling\nsound of the sunlit leaves outside seemed like the very murmur of the\nstream of life down which we dreamed of gliding together from that hour.\n\nIt was one of those moments which sometimes come and go without any\napparent cause, when life suddenly takes a mystical aspect of\ncompleteness, all its discords are harmonised by some unseen hand of\nthe spirit, and all its imperfections fall away. The lover of beauty\nand the lover of God alike know these strange moments, but none know\nthem with such a mighty satisfaction as a man and a woman who love as\nloved Elizabeth and I.\n\nLove for ever completes the world, for it is no future of higher\nachievement, no expectation of greater joy.  It lives for ever in a\npresent made perfect by itself.  Love can dream of no greater\nblessedness than itself, of no heaven but its own.  God himself could\nhave added no touch of happiness to our happy hearts that grave and\nsunny morning. You philosophers who go searching for the meaning of\nlife, thinkers reading so sadly, and let us hope so wrongly, the riddle\nof the world--life has but one meaning, the riddle but one\nanswer--which is Love.  To love is to put yourself in harmony with the\nspheral music of creation, to stand in the centre of the universe, and\nsee it good and whole as it appears in the eye of God.\n\nEven Death himself, the great and terrible King of kings, though he may\nbreak the heart of love with agonies and anguish and slow tortures of\nseparation, may break not his faith.  No one that has loved will dream\neven death too terrible a price to pay for the revelation of love.  For\nthat revelation once made can never be recalled.  As a little sprig of\nlavender will perfume a queen's wardrobe, so will a short year of love\nkeep sweet a long life. And love's best gifts death can never take\naway.  Nay, indeed, death does not so much rob as enrich the gifts of\nlove.  The dead face that was fair grows fairer each spring, sweet\nmemories grow more sweet, what was silver is now gold, and as years go\nby, the very death of love becomes its immortality.\n\nI think I shall never hear Elizabeth's voice again, never look into her\neyes, never kiss her dear lips--but Elizabeth is still mine, and I am\nhers, as in that morning when we kissed in that little chancel amid the\nflickering light, and passed out into the sun and down the lanes, to\nour little home among the meadow-sweet.\n\nShe is still as real to me as the stars,--and, alas, as far away!  I\nthink no thought that does not fly to her, I have no joys I do not\nshare with her, I tell her when the spring is here, and we sit beneath\nthe moon and listen to the nightjar together. Sometimes we are merry\ntogether as in the old time, and our laughter makes nightfaring folk to\ncross themselves; my work, my dreams, my loves, are all hers, and my\nvery sins are sinned for her sake.\n\nTwo years did Elizabeth and I know the love that passeth all\nunderstanding, and day by day the chestnut upon her head was more and\nthe gold less, till the day came that she had prophesied, and with the\nday a little child, whose hair had stolen all her mother's gold, as her\nheart had drained away her mother's life.\n\nAh! reader, may it be long before you kneel at the bedside of her you\nlove best in the world, and know that of all your love is left but a\nhundred heart-beats, while opposite sits Death, watch in hand, and\nfingers upon her wrist.\n\n\"Husband,\" whispered Elizabeth, as we looked at each other for the last\ntime, \"let her be your little golden girl...\"\n\nAnd then a strange sweetness stole over her face, and the dream of\nElizabeth's life was ended.\n\nAs I write I hear in the still house the running of little feet, a\nfairy patter sweet and terrible to the heart.\n\nLittle feet, little feet--perhaps if I follow you I shall find again\nour mother that is lost. Perhaps Elizabeth left you with me that I\nshould not miss the way.\n\nTout par soullas.",
