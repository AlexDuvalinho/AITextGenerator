All the\nother parts are but members, important in themselves, yet more important\nin their relations to this. Exclusive of the Lake basin and of 300,000\nsquare miles in Texas and New Mexico, which in many aspects form a part\nof it, this basin contains about 1,250,000 square miles. In extent it is\nthe second great valley of the world, being exceeded only by that of the\nAmazon. The valley of the frozen Obi approaches it in extent; that of\nLa Plata comes next in space, and probably in habitable capacity, having\nabout eight-ninths of its area; then comes that of the Yenisei, with\nabout seven-ninths; the Lena, Amoor, Hoang-ho, Yang-tse-kiang, and\nNile, five-ninths; the Ganges, less than one-half; the Indus, less\nthan one-third; the Euphrates, one-fifth; the Rhine, one-fifteenth. It\nexceeds in extent the whole of Europe, exclusive of Russia, Norway,\nand Sweden. _It would contain austria four times, germany or spain\nfive times, france six times, the british islands or italy ten times._\nConceptions formed from the river-basins of Western Europe are rudely\nshocked when we consider the extent of the valley of the Mississippi;\nnor are those formed from the sterile basins of the great rivers of\nSiberia, the lofty plateaus of Central Asia, or the mighty sweep of\nthe swampy Amazon more adequate. Latitude, elevation, and rainfall\nall combine to render every part of the Mississippi Valley capable of\nsupporting a dense population. _As a dwelling-place for civilized man it\nis by far the first upon our globe_.\n\nEDITOR'S TABLE, HARPER'S MAGAZINE, FEBRUARY 1863\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 1\n\nThe River and Its History\n\nTHE Mississippi is well worth reading about. It is not a commonplace\nriver, but on the contrary is in all ways remarkable. Considering the\nMissouri its main branch, it is the longest river in the world--four\nthousand three hundred miles. It seems safe to say that it is also the\ncrookedest river in the world, since in one part of its journey it uses\nup one thousand three hundred miles to cover the same ground that the\ncrow would fly over in six hundred and seventy-five. It discharges three\ntimes as much water as the St. Lawrence, twenty-five times as much\nas the Rhine, and three hundred and thirty-eight times as much as the\nThames. No other river has so vast a drainage-basin: it draws its water\nsupply from twenty-eight States and Territories; from Delaware, on the\nAtlantic seaboard, and from all the country between that and Idaho on\nthe Pacific slope--a spread of forty-five degrees of longitude. The\nMississippi receives and carries to the Gulf water from fifty-four\nsubordinate rivers that are navigable by steamboats, and from some\nhundreds that are navigable by flats and keels. The area of its\ndrainage-basin is as great as the combined areas of England, Wales,\nScotland, Ireland, France, Spain, Portugal, Germany, Austria, Italy,\nand Turkey; and almost all this wide region is fertile; the Mississippi\nvalley, proper, is exceptionally so.\n\nIt is a remarkable river in this: that instead of widening toward its\nmouth, it grows narrower; grows narrower and deeper. From the junction\nof the Ohio to a point half way down to the sea, the width averages a\nmile in high water: thence to the sea the width steadily diminishes,\nuntil, at the 'Passes,' above the mouth, it is but little over half\na mile. At the junction of the Ohio the Mississippi's depth is\neighty-seven feet; the depth increases gradually, reaching one hundred\nand twenty-nine just above the mouth.\n\nThe difference in rise and fall is also remarkable--not in the upper,\nbut in the lower river. The rise is tolerably uniform down to Natchez\n(three hundred and sixty miles above the mouth)--about fifty feet.\nBut at Bayou La Fourche the river rises only twenty-four feet; at New\nOrleans only fifteen, and just above the mouth only two and one half.\n\nAn article in the New Orleans 'Times-Democrat,' based upon reports of\nable engineers, states that the river annually empties four hundred and\nsix million tons of mud into the Gulf of Mexico--which brings to mind\nCaptain Marryat's rude name for the Mississippi--'the Great Sewer.' This\nmud, solidified, would make a mass a mile square and two hundred and\nforty-one feet high.\n\nThe mud deposit gradually extends the land--but only gradually; it has\nextended it not quite a third of a mile in the two hundred years which\nhave elapsed since the river took its place in history. The belief of\nthe scientific people is, that the mouth used to be at Baton Rouge,\nwhere the hills cease, and that the two hundred miles of land between\nthere and the Gulf was built by the river. This gives us the age of that\npiece of country, without any trouble at all--one hundred and twenty\nthousand years. Yet it is much the youthfullest batch of country that\nlies around there anywhere.\n\nThe Mississippi is remarkable in still another way--its disposition to\nmake prodigious jumps by cutting through narrow necks of land, and thus\nstraightening and shortening itself. More than once it has shortened\nitself thirty miles at a single jump! These cut-offs have had curious\neffects: they have thrown several river towns out into the rural\ndistricts, and built up sand bars and forests in front of them. The town\nof Delta used to be three miles below Vicksburg: a recent cutoff has\nradically changed the position, and Delta is now _two miles above_\nVicksburg.\n\nBoth of these river towns have been retired to the country by that\ncut-off. A cut-off plays havoc with boundary lines and jurisdictions:\nfor instance, a man is living in the State of Mississippi to-day, a\ncut-off occurs to-night, and to-morrow the man finds himself and his\nland over on the other side of the river, within the boundaries and\nsubject to the laws of the State of Louisiana! Such a thing, happening\nin the upper river in the old times, could have transferred a slave from\nMissouri to Illinois and made a free man of him.\n\nThe Mississippi does not alter its locality by cut-offs alone: it\nis always changing its habitat _bodily_--is always moving bodily\n_sidewise_. At Hard Times, La., the river is two miles west of the\nregion it used to occupy. As a result, the original _site _of that\nsettlement is not now in Louisiana at all, but on the other side of\nthe river, in the State of Mississippi. _Nearly the whole of that one\nthousand three hundred miles of old mississippi river which la salle\nfloated down in his canoes, two hundred years ago, is good solid dry\nground now_. The river lies to the right of it, in places, and to the\nleft of it in other places.\n\nAlthough the Mississippi's mud builds land but slowly, down at the\nmouth, where the Gulfs billows interfere with its work, it builds fast\nenough in better protected regions higher up: for instance, Prophet's\nIsland contained one thousand five hundred acres of land thirty years\nago; since then the river has added seven hundred acres to it.\n\nBut enough of these examples of the mighty stream's eccentricities for\nthe present--I will give a few more of them further along in the book.\n\nLet us drop the Mississippi's physical history, and say a word about its\nhistorical history--so to speak. We can glance briefly at its slumbrous\nfirst epoch in a couple of short chapters; at its second and wider-awake\nepoch in a couple more; at its flushest and widest-awake epoch in a good\nmany succeeding chapters; and then talk about its comparatively tranquil\npresent epoch in what shall be left of the book.\n\nThe world and the books are so accustomed to use, and over-use, the word\n'new' in connection with our country, that we early get and permanently\nretain the impression that there is nothing old about it. We do of\ncourse know that there are several comparatively old dates in American\nhistory, but the mere figures convey to our minds no just idea, no\ndistinct realization, of the stretch of time which they represent.\nTo say that De Soto, the first white man who ever saw the Mississippi\nRiver, saw it in 1542, is a remark which states a fact without\ninterpreting it: it is something like giving the dimensions of a sunset\nby astronomical measurements, and cataloguing the colors by their\nscientific names;--as a result, you get the bald fact of the sunset, but\nyou don't see the sunset. It would have been better to paint a picture\nof it.\n\nThe date 1542, standing by itself, means little or nothing to us; but\nwhen one groups a few neighboring historical dates and facts around it,\nhe adds perspective and color, and then realizes that this is one of the\nAmerican dates which is quite respectable for age.\n\nFor instance, when the Mississippi was first seen by a white man, less\nthan a quarter of a century had elapsed since Francis I.'s defeat at\nPavia; the death of Raphael; the death of Bayard, _Sans Peur Et Sans\nReproche_; the driving out of the Knights-Hospitallers from Rhodes by\nthe Turks; and the placarding of the Ninety-Five Propositions,--the act\nwhich began the Reformation. When De Soto took his glimpse of the river,\nIgnatius Loyola was an obscure name; the order of the Jesuits was not\nyet a year old; Michael Angelo's paint was not yet dry on the Last\nJudgment in the Sistine Chapel; Mary Queen of Scots was not yet born,\nbut would be before the year closed. Catherine de Medici was a child;\nElizabeth of England was not yet in her teens; Calvin, Benvenuto\nCellini, and the Emperor Charles V. were at the top of their fame, and\neach was manufacturing history after his own peculiar fashion; Margaret\nof Navarre was writing the 'Heptameron' and some religious books,--the\nfirst survives, the others are forgotten, wit and indelicacy being\nsometimes better literature preservers than holiness; lax court morals\nand the absurd chivalry business were in full feather, and the joust and\nthe tournament were the frequent pastime of titled fine gentlemen who\ncould fight better than they could spell, while religion was the passion\nof their ladies, and classifying their offspring into children of full\nrank and children by brevet their pastime.\n\nIn fact, all around, religion was in a peculiarly blooming condition:\nthe Council of Trent was being called; the Spanish Inquisition was\nroasting, and racking, and burning, with a free hand; elsewhere on the\ncontinent the nations were being persuaded to holy living by the sword\nand fire; in England, Henry VIII. had suppressed the monasteries,\nburnt Fisher and another bishop or two, and was getting his English\nreformation and his harem effectively started. When De Soto stood on the\nbanks of the Mississippi, it was still two years before Luther's death;\neleven years before the burning of Servetus; thirty years before the St.\nBartholomew slaughter; Rabelais was not yet published; 'Don Quixote' was\nnot yet written; Shakespeare was not yet born; a hundred long years must\nstill elapse before Englishmen would hear the name of Oliver Cromwell.\n\nUnquestionably the discovery of the Mississippi is a datable fact which\nconsiderably mellows and modifies the shiny newness of our country, and\ngives her a most respectable outside-aspect of rustiness and antiquity.\n\nDe Soto merely glimpsed the river, then died and was buried in it by his\npriests and soldiers. One would expect the priests and the soldiers\nto multiply the river's dimensions by ten--the Spanish custom of the\nday--and thus move other adventurers to go at once and explore it. On\nthe contrary, their narratives when they reached home, did not excite\nthat amount of curiosity. The Mississippi was left unvisited by whites\nduring a term of years which seems incredible in our energetic days. One\nmay 'sense' the interval to his mind, after a fashion, by dividing it\nup in this way: After De Soto glimpsed the river, a fraction short of\na quarter of a century elapsed, and then Shakespeare was born; lived a\ntrifle more than half a century, then died; and when he had been in his\ngrave considerably more than half a century, the _second _white man saw\nthe Mississippi. In our day we don't allow a hundred and thirty years to\nelapse between glimpses of a marvel. If somebody should discover a creek\nin the county next to the one that the North Pole is in, Europe and\nAmerica would start fifteen costly expeditions thither: one to explore\nthe creek, and the other fourteen to hunt for each other.\n\nFor more than a hundred and fifty years there had been white settlements\non our Atlantic coasts. These people were in intimate communication\nwith the Indians: in the south the Spaniards were robbing, slaughtering,\nenslaving and converting them; higher up, the English were trading beads\nand blankets to them for a consideration, and throwing in civilization\nand whiskey, 'for lagniappe;' and in Canada the French were schooling\nthem in a rudimentary way, missionarying among them, and drawing whole\npopulations of them at a time to Quebec, and later to Montreal, to buy\nfurs of them. Necessarily, then, these various clusters of whites must\nhave heard of the great river of the far west; and indeed, they did\nhear of it vaguely,--so vaguely and indefinitely, that its course,\nproportions, and locality were hardly even guessable. The mere\nmysteriousness of the matter ought to have fired curiosity and compelled\nexploration; but this did not occur. Apparently nobody happened to want\nsuch a river, nobody needed it, nobody was curious about it; so, for\na century and a half the Mississippi remained out of the market and\nundisturbed. When De Soto found it, he was not hunting for a river, and\nhad no present occasion for one; consequently he did not value it or\neven take any particular notice of it.\n\nBut at last La Salle the Frenchman conceived the idea of seeking out\nthat river and exploring it. It always happens that when a man seizes\nupon a neglected and important idea, people inflamed with the same\nnotion crop up all around. It happened so in this instance.\n\nNaturally the question suggests itself, Why did these people want the\nriver now when nobody had wanted it in the five preceding generations?\nApparently it was because at this late day they thought they had\ndiscovered a way to make it useful; for it had come to be believed\nthat the Mississippi emptied into the Gulf of California, and therefore\nafforded a short cut from Canada to China. Previously the supposition\nhad been that it emptied into the Atlantic, or Sea of Virginia.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 2\n\nThe River and Its Explorers\n\nLA SALLE himself sued for certain high privileges, and they were\ngraciously accorded him by Louis XIV of inflated memory. Chief among\nthem was the privilege to explore, far and wide, and build forts, and\nstake out continents, and hand the same over to the king, and pay the\nexpenses himself; receiving, in return, some little advantages of one\nsort or another; among them the monopoly of buffalo hides. He spent\nseveral years and about all of his money, in making perilous and painful\ntrips between Montreal and a fort which he had built on the Illinois,\nbefore he at last succeeded in getting his expedition in such a shape\nthat he could strike for the Mississippi.\n\nAnd meantime other parties had had better fortune. In 1673 Joliet the\nmerchant, and Marquette the priest, crossed the country and reached the\nbanks of the Mississippi. They went by way of the Great Lakes; and from\nGreen Bay, in canoes, by way of Fox River and the Wisconsin. Marquette\nhad solemnly contracted, on the feast of the Immaculate Conception, that\nif the Virgin would permit him to discover the great river, he would\nname it Conception, in her honor. He kept his word. In that day, all\nexplorers traveled with an outfit of priests. De Soto had twenty-four\nwith him. La Salle had several, also. The expeditions were often out of\nmeat, and scant of clothes, but they always had the furniture and other\nrequisites for the mass; they were always prepared, as one of the quaint\nchroniclers of the time phrased it, to 'explain hell to the savages.'\n\nOn the 17th of June, 1673, the canoes of Joliet and Marquette and\ntheir five subordinates reached the junction of the Wisconsin with the\nMississippi. Mr. Parkman says: 'Before them a wide and rapid current\ncoursed athwart their way, by the foot of lofty heights wrapped thick\nin forests.' He continues: 'Turning southward, they paddled down the\nstream, through a solitude unrelieved by the faintest trace of man.'\n\nA big cat-fish collided with Marquette's canoe, and startled him; and\nreasonably enough, for he had been warned by the Indians that he was\non a foolhardy journey, and even a fatal one, for the river contained\na demon 'whose roar could be heard at a great distance, and who would\nengulf them in the abyss where he dwelt.' I have seen a Mississippi\ncat-fish that was more than six feet long, and weighed two hundred and\nfifty pounds; and if Marquette's fish was the fellow to that one, he had\na fair right to think the river's roaring demon was come.\n\n'At length the buffalo began to appear, grazing in herds on the great\nprairies which then bordered the river; and Marquette describes the\nfierce and stupid look of the old bulls as they stared at the intruders\nthrough the tangled mane which nearly blinded them.'\n\nThe voyagers moved cautiously: 'Landed at night and made a fire to cook\ntheir evening meal; then extinguished it, embarked again, paddled some\nway farther, and anchored in the stream, keeping a man on the watch till\nmorning.'\n\nThey did this day after day and night after night; and at the end of two\nweeks they had not seen a human being. The river was an awful solitude,\nthen. And it is now, over most of its stretch.\n\nBut at the close of the fortnight they one day came upon the footprints\nof men in the mud of the western bank--a Robinson Crusoe experience\nwhich carries an electric shiver with it yet, when one stumbles on it in\nprint. They had been warned that the river Indians were as ferocious and\npitiless as the river demon, and destroyed all comers without waiting\nfor provocation; but no matter, Joliet and Marquette struck into the\ncountry to hunt up the proprietors of the tracks. They found them, by\nand by, and were hospitably received and well treated--if to be received\nby an Indian chief who has taken off his last rag in order to appear\nat his level best is to be received hospitably; and if to be treated\nabundantly to fish, porridge, and other game, including dog, and have\nthese things forked into one's mouth by the ungloved fingers of Indians\nis to be well treated. In the morning the chief and six hundred of his\ntribesmen escorted the Frenchmen to the river and bade them a friendly\nfarewell.\n\nOn the rocks above the present city of Alton they found some rude and\nfantastic Indian paintings, which they describe. A short distance below\n'a torrent of yellow mud rushed furiously athwart the calm blue current\nof the Mississippi, boiling and surging and sweeping in its course logs,\nbranches, and uprooted trees.' This was the mouth of the Missouri, 'that\nsavage river,' which 'descending from its mad career through a vast\nunknown of barbarism, poured its turbid floods into the bosom of its\ngentle sister.'\n\nBy and by they passed the mouth of the Ohio; they passed cane-brakes;\nthey fought mosquitoes; they floated along, day after day, through the\ndeep silence and loneliness of the river, drowsing in the scant shade\nof makeshift awnings, and broiling with the heat; they encountered and\nexchanged civilities with another party of Indians; and at last\nthey reached the mouth of the Arkansas (about a month out from their\nstarting-point), where a tribe of war-whooping savages swarmed out to\nmeet and murder them; but they appealed to the Virgin for help; so in\nplace of a fight there was a feast, and plenty of pleasant palaver and\nfol-de-rol.\n\nThey had proved to their satisfaction, that the Mississippi did not\nempty into the Gulf of California, or into the Atlantic. They believed\nit emptied into the Gulf of Mexico. They turned back, now, and carried\ntheir great news to Canada.\n\nBut belief is not proof. It was reserved for La Salle to furnish the\nproof. He was provokingly delayed, by one misfortune after another, but\nat last got his expedition under way at the end of the year 1681. In the\ndead of winter he and Henri de Tonty, son of Lorenzo Tonty, who invented\nthe tontine, his lieutenant, started down the Illinois, with a\nfollowing of eighteen Indians brought from New England, and twenty-three\nFrenchmen. They moved in procession down the surface of the frozen\nriver, on foot, and dragging their canoes after them on sledges.\n\nAt Peoria Lake they struck open water, and paddled thence to the\nMississippi and turned their prows southward. They plowed through the\nfields of floating ice, past the mouth of the Missouri; past the mouth\nof the Ohio, by-and-by; 'and, gliding by the wastes of bordering swamp,\nlanded on the 24th of February near the Third Chickasaw Bluffs,' where\nthey halted and built Fort Prudhomme.\n\n'Again,' says Mr. Parkman, 'they embarked; and with every stage of their\nadventurous progress, the mystery of this vast new world was more and\nmore unveiled. More and more they entered the realms of spring. The\nhazy sunlight, the warm and drowsy air, the tender foliage, the opening\nflowers, betokened the reviving life of nature.'\n\nDay by day they floated down the great bends, in the shadow of the dense\nforests, and in time arrived at the mouth of the Arkansas. First, they\nwere greeted by the natives of this locality as Marquette had before\nbeen greeted by them--with the booming of the war drum and the flourish\nof arms. The Virgin composed the difficulty in Marquette's case; the\npipe of peace did the same office for La Salle. The white man and the\nred man struck hands and entertained each other during three days. Then,\nto the admiration of the savages, La Salle set up a cross with the\narms of France on it, and took possession of the whole country for the\nking--the cool fashion of the time--while the priest piously consecrated\nthe robbery with a hymn. The priest explained the mysteries of the faith\n'by signs,' for the saving of the savages; thus compensating them with\npossible possessions in Heaven for the certain ones on earth which they\nhad just been robbed of. And also, by signs, La Salle drew from these\nsimple children of the forest acknowledgments of fealty to Louis the\nPutrid, over the water. Nobody smiled at these colossal ironies.\n\nThese performances took place on the site of the future town of\nNapoleon, Arkansas, and there the first confiscation-cross was raised\non the banks of the great river. Marquette's and Joliet's voyage\nof discovery ended at the same spot--the site of the future town of\nNapoleon. When De Soto took his fleeting glimpse of the river, away back\nin the dim early days, he took it from that same spot--the site of the\nfuture town of Napoleon, Arkansas. Therefore, three out of the four\nmemorable events connected with the discovery and exploration of the\nmighty river, occurred, by accident, in one and the same place. It is a\nmost curious distinction, when one comes to look at it and think about\nit. France stole that vast country on that spot, the future Napoleon;\nand by and by Napoleon himself was to give the country back again!--make\nrestitution, not to the owners, but to their white American heirs.\n\nThe voyagers journeyed on, touching here and there; 'passed the sites,\nsince become historic, of Vicksburg and Grand Gulf,' and visited an\nimposing Indian monarch in the Teche country, whose capital city was a\nsubstantial one of sun-baked bricks mixed with straw--better houses than\nmany that exist there now. The chiefs house contained an audience room\nforty feet square; and there he received Tonty in State, surrounded by\nsixty old men clothed in white cloaks. There was a temple in the town,\nwith a mud wall about it ornamented with skulls of enemies sacrificed to\nthe sun.\n\nThe voyagers visited the Natchez Indians, near the site of the\npresent city of that name, where they found a 'religious and political\ndespotism, a privileged class descended from the sun, a temple and a\nsacred fire.' It must have been like getting home again; it was home\nwith an advantage, in fact, for it lacked Louis XIV.\n\nA few more days swept swiftly by, and La Salle stood in the shadow of\nhis confiscating cross, at the meeting of the waters from Delaware, and\nfrom Itaska, and from the mountain ranges close upon the Pacific,\nwith the waters of the Gulf of Mexico, his task finished, his prodigy\nachieved. Mr. Parkman, in closing his fascinating narrative, thus sums\nup:\n\n'On that day, the realm of France received on parchment a stupendous\naccession. The fertile plains of Texas; the vast basin of the\nMississippi, from its frozen northern springs to the sultry borders of\nthe Gulf; from the woody ridges of the Alleghanies to the bare peaks\nof the Rocky Mountains--a region of savannas and forests, sun-cracked\ndeserts and grassy prairies, watered by a thousand rivers, ranged by\na thousand warlike tribes, passed beneath the scepter of the Sultan of\nVersailles; and all by virtue of a feeble human voice, inaudible at half\na mile.'\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 3\n\nFrescoes from the Past\n\nAPPARENTLY the river was ready for business, now. But no, the\ndistribution of a population along its banks was as calm and deliberate\nand time-devouring a process as the discovery and exploration had been.\n\nSeventy years elapsed, after the exploration, before the river's borders\nhad a white population worth considering; and nearly fifty more before\nthe river had a commerce. Between La Salle's opening of the river and\nthe time when it may be said to have become the vehicle of anything like\na regular and active commerce, seven sovereigns had occupied the throne\nof England, America had become an independent nation, Louis XIV. and\nLouis XV. had rotted and died, the French monarchy had gone down in\nthe red tempest of the revolution, and Napoleon was a name that was\nbeginning to be talked about. Truly, there were snails in those days.\n\nThe river's earliest commerce was in great barges--keelboats,\nbroadhorns. They floated and sailed from the upper rivers to New\nOrleans, changed cargoes there, and were tediously warped and poled back\nby hand. A voyage down and back sometimes occupied nine months. In time\nthis commerce increased until it gave employment to hordes of rough and\nhardy men; rude, uneducated, brave, suffering terrific hardships with\nsailor-like stoicism; heavy drinkers, coarse frolickers in moral sties\nlike the Natchez-under-the-hill of that day, heavy fighters, reckless\nfellows, every one, elephantinely jolly, foul-witted, profane; prodigal\nof their money, bankrupt at the end of the trip, fond of barbaric\nfinery, prodigious braggarts; yet, in the main, honest, trustworthy,\nfaithful to promises and duty, and often picturesquely magnanimous.\n\nBy and by the steamboat intruded. Then for fifteen or twenty years,\nthese men continued to run their keelboats down-stream, and the steamers\ndid all of the upstream business, the keelboatmen selling their boats in\nNew Orleans, and returning home as deck passengers in the steamers.\n\nBut after a while the steamboats so increased in number and in speed\nthat they were able to absorb the entire commerce; and then keelboating\ndied a permanent death. The keelboatman became a deck hand, or a mate,\nor a pilot on the steamer; and when steamer-berths were not open to him,\nhe took a berth on a Pittsburgh coal-flat, or on a pine-raft constructed\nin the forests up toward the sources of the Mississippi.\n\nIn the heyday of the steamboating prosperity, the river from end to end\nwas flaked with coal-fleets and timber rafts, all managed by hand,\nand employing hosts of the rough characters whom I have been trying to\ndescribe. I remember the annual processions of mighty rafts that used\nto glide by Hannibal when I was a boy,--an acre or so of white,\nsweet-smelling boards in each raft, a crew of two dozen men or more,\nthree or four wigwams scattered about the raft's vast level space for\nstorm-quarters,--and I remember the rude ways and the tremendous talk\nof their big crews, the ex-keelboatmen and their admiringly patterning\nsuccessors; for we used to swim out a quarter or third of a mile and get\non these rafts and have a ride.\n\nBy way of illustrating keelboat talk and manners, and that now-departed\nand hardly-remembered raft-life, I will throw in, in this place, a\nchapter from a book which I have been working at, by fits and starts,\nduring the past five or six years, and may possibly finish in the course\nof five or six more. The book is a story which details some passages in\nthe life of an ignorant village boy, Huck Finn, son of the town drunkard\nof my time out west, there. He has run away from his persecuting\nfather, and from a persecuting good widow who wishes to make a nice,\ntruth-telling, respectable boy of him; and with him a slave of the\nwidow's has also escaped. They have found a fragment of a lumber raft\n(it is high water and dead summer time), and are floating down the river\nby night, and hiding in the willows by day,--bound for Cairo,--whence\nthe negro will seek freedom in the heart of the free States. But in a\nfog, they pass Cairo without knowing it. By and by they begin to suspect\nthe truth, and Huck Finn is persuaded to end the dismal suspense by\nswimming down to a huge raft which they have seen in the distance ahead\nof them, creeping aboard under cover of the darkness, and gathering the\nneeded information by eavesdropping:--\n\nBut you know a young person can't wait very well when he is impatient to\nfind a thing out. We talked it over, and by and by Jim said it was such\na black night, now, that it wouldn't be no risk to swim down to the big\nraft and crawl aboard and listen--they would talk about Cairo, because\nthey would be calculating to go ashore there for a spree, maybe, or\nanyway they would send boats ashore to buy whiskey or fresh meat or\nsomething. Jim had a wonderful level head, for a nigger: he could most\nalways start a good plan when you wanted one.\n\nI stood up and shook my rags off and jumped into the river, and struck\nout for the raft's light. By and by, when I got down nearly to her,\nI eased up and went slow and cautious. But everything was all\nright--nobody at the sweeps. So I swum down along the raft till I was\nmost abreast the camp fire in the middle, then I crawled aboard and\ninched along and got in amongst some bundles of shingles on the weather\nside of the fire. There was thirteen men there--they was the watch on\ndeck of course. And a mighty rough-looking lot, too. They had a jug, and\ntin cups, and they kept the jug moving. One man was singing--roaring,\nyou may say; and it wasn't a nice song--for a parlor anyway. He roared\nthrough his nose, and strung out the last word of every line very long.\nWhen he was done they all fetched a kind of Injun war-whoop, and then\nanother was sung. It begun:--\n\n'There was a woman in our towdn, In our towdn did dwed'l (dwell,) She\nloved her husband dear-i-lee, But another man twysteas wed'l.\n\nSinging too, riloo, riloo, riloo, Ri-too, riloo, rilay--She loved her\nhusband dear-i-lee, But another man twyste as wed'l.\n\nAnd so on--fourteen verses. It was kind of poor, and when he was going\nto start on the next verse one of them said it was the tune the old cow\ndied on; and another one said, 'Oh, give us a rest.' And another one\ntold him to take a walk. They made fun of him till he got mad and jumped\nup and begun to cuss the crowd, and said he could lame any thief in the\nlot.\n\nThey was all about to make a break for him, but the biggest man there\njumped up and says--\n\n'Set whar you are, gentlemen. Leave him to me; he's my meat.'\n\nThen he jumped up in the air three times and cracked his heels together\nevery time. He flung off a buckskin coat that was all hung with fringes,\nand says, 'You lay thar tell the chawin-up's done;' and flung his hat\ndown, which was all over ribbons, and says, 'You lay thar tell his\nsufferin's is over.'\n\nThen he jumped up in the air and cracked his heels together again and\nshouted out--\n\n'Whoo-oop! I'm the old original iron-jawed, brass-mounted,\ncopper-bellied corpse-maker from the wilds of Arkansaw!--Look at me!\nI'm the man they call Sudden Death and General Desolation! Sired by a\nhurricane, dam'd by an earthquake, half-brother to the cholera, nearly\nrelated to the small-pox on the mother's side! Look at me! I take\nnineteen alligators and a bar'l of whiskey for breakfast when I'm in\nrobust health, and a bushel of rattlesnakes and a dead body when I'm\nailing! I split the everlasting rocks with my glance, and I squench the\nthunder when I speak! Whoo-oop! Stand back and give me room according\nto my strength! Blood's my natural drink, and the wails of the dying is\nmusic to my ear! Cast your eye on me, gentlemen!--and lay low and hold\nyour breath, for I'm bout to turn myself loose!'\n\nAll the time he was getting this off, he was shaking his head and\nlooking fierce, and kind of swelling around in a little circle, tucking\nup his wrist-bands, and now and then straightening up and beating his\nbreast with his fist, saying, 'Look at me, gentlemen!' When he got\nthrough, he jumped up and cracked his heels together three times, and\nlet off a roaring 'Whoo-oop! I'm the bloodiest son of a wildcat that\nlives!'\n\nThen the man that had started the row tilted his old slouch hat down\nover his right eye; then he bent stooping forward, with his back sagged\nand his south end sticking out far, and his fists a-shoving out and\ndrawing in in front of him, and so went around in a little circle\nabout three times, swelling himself up and breathing hard. Then he\nstraightened, and jumped up and cracked his heels together three times,\nbefore he lit again (that made them cheer), and he begun to shout like\nthis--\n\n'Whoo-oop! bow your neck and spread, for the kingdom of sorrow's\na-coming! Hold me down to the earth, for I feel my powers a-working!\nwhoo-oop! I'm a child of sin, don't let me get a start! Smoked\nglass, here, for all! Don't attempt to look at me with the naked\neye, gentlemen! When I'm playful I use the meridians of longitude and\nparallels of latitude for a seine, and drag the Atlantic Ocean for\nwhales! I scratch my head with the lightning, and purr myself to sleep\nwith the thunder! When I'm cold, I bile the Gulf of Mexico and bathe\nin it; when I'm hot I fan myself with an equinoctial storm; when I'm\nthirsty I reach up and suck a cloud dry like a sponge; when I range the\nearth hungry, famine follows in my tracks! Whoo-oop! Bow your neck and\nspread! I put my hand on the sun's face and make it night in the earth;\nI bite a piece out of the moon and hurry the seasons; I shake myself\nand crumble the mountains! Contemplate me through leather--don't use the\nnaked eye! I'm the man with a petrified heart and biler-iron bowels! The\nmassacre of isolated communities is the pastime of my idle moments,\nthe destruction of nationalities the serious business of my life! The\nboundless vastness of the great American desert is my enclosed property,\nand I bury my dead on my own premises!' He jumped up and cracked his\nheels together three times before he lit (they cheered him again), and\nas he come down he shouted out: 'Whoo-oop! bow your neck and spread, for\nthe pet child of calamity's a-coming!'\n\nThen the other one went to swelling around and blowing again--the first\none--the one they called Bob; next, the Child of Calamity chipped in\nagain, bigger than ever; then they both got at it at the same time,\nswelling round and round each other and punching their fists most into\neach other's faces, and whooping and jawing like Injuns; then Bob called\nthe Child names, and the Child called him names back again: next, Bob\ncalled him a heap rougher names and the Child come back at him with the\nvery worst kind of language; next, Bob knocked the Child's hat off, and\nthe Child picked it up and kicked Bob's ribbony hat about six foot; Bob\nwent and got it and said never mind, this warn't going to be the last\nof this thing, because he was a man that never forgot and never forgive,\nand so the Child better look out, for there was a time a-coming, just\nas sure as he was a living man, that he would have to answer to him with\nthe best blood in his body. The Child said no man was willinger than\nhe was for that time to come, and he would give Bob fair warning, now,\nnever to cross his path again, for he could never rest till he had waded\nin his blood, for such was his nature, though he was sparing him now on\naccount of his family, if he had one.\n\nBoth of them was edging away in different directions, growling and\nshaking their heads and going on about what they was going to do; but a\nlittle black-whiskered chap skipped up and says--\n\n'Come back here, you couple of chicken-livered cowards, and I'll thrash\nthe two of ye!'\n\nAnd he done it, too. He snatched them, he jerked them this way and that,\nhe booted them around, he knocked them sprawling faster than they could\nget up. Why, it warn't two minutes till they begged like dogs--and\nhow the other lot did yell and laugh and clap their hands all the way\nthrough, and shout 'Sail in, Corpse-Maker!' 'Hi! at him again, Child of\nCalamity!' 'Bully for you, little Davy!' Well, it was a perfect pow-wow\nfor a while. Bob and the Child had red noses and black eyes when they\ngot through. Little Davy made them own up that they were sneaks and\ncowards and not fit to eat with a dog or drink with a nigger; then Bob\nand the Child shook hands with each other, very solemn, and said they\nhad always respected each other and was willing to let bygones be\nbygones. So then they washed their faces in the river; and just then\nthere was a loud order to stand by for a crossing, and some of them went\nforward to man the sweeps there, and the rest went aft to handle the\nafter-sweeps.\n\nI laid still and waited for fifteen minutes, and had a smoke out of a\npipe that one of them left in reach; then the crossing was finished, and\nthey stumped back and had a drink around and went to talking and singing\nagain. Next they got out an old fiddle, and one played and another\npatted juba, and the rest turned themselves loose on a regular\nold-fashioned keel-boat break-down. They couldn't keep that up very long\nwithout getting winded, so by and by they settled around the jug again.\n\nThey sung 'jolly, jolly raftman's the life for me,' with a rousing\nchorus, and then they got to talking about differences betwixt hogs, and\ntheir different kind of habits; and next about women and their different\nways: and next about the best ways to put out houses that was afire; and\nnext about what ought to be done with the Injuns; and next about what\na king had to do, and how much he got; and next about how to make cats\nfight; and next about what to do when a man has fits; and next about\ndifferences betwixt clear-water rivers and muddy-water ones. The man\nthey called Ed said the muddy Mississippi water was wholesomer to drink\nthan the clear water of the Ohio; he said if you let a pint of this\nyaller Mississippi water settle, you would have about a half to\nthree-quarters of an inch of mud in the bottom, according to the stage\nof the river, and then it warn't no better than Ohio water--what you\nwanted to do was to keep it stirred up--and when the river was low, keep\nmud on hand to put in and thicken the water up the way it ought to be.\n\nThe Child of Calamity said that was so; he said there was nutritiousness\nin the mud, and a man that drunk Mississippi water could grow corn in\nhis stomach if he wanted to. He says--\n\n'You look at the graveyards; that tells the tale. Trees won't grow worth\nchucks in a Cincinnati graveyard, but in a Sent Louis graveyard they\ngrow upwards of eight hundred foot high. It's all on account of the\nwater the people drunk before they laid up. A Cincinnati corpse don't\nrichen a soil any.'\n\nAnd they talked about how Ohio water didn't like to mix with Mississippi\nwater. Ed said if you take the Mississippi on a rise when the Ohio is\nlow, you'll find a wide band of clear water all the way down the east\nside of the Mississippi for a hundred mile or more, and the minute you\nget out a quarter of a mile from shore and pass the line, it is all\nthick and yaller the rest of the way across. Then they talked about how\nto keep tobacco from getting moldy, and from that they went into ghosts\nand told about a lot that other folks had seen; but Ed says--\n\n'Why don't you tell something that you've seen yourselves? Now let me\nhave a say. Five years ago I was on a raft as big as this, and right\nalong here it was a bright moonshiny night, and I was on watch and boss\nof the stabboard oar forrard, and one of my pards was a man named Dick\nAllbright, and he come along to where I was sitting, forrard--gaping and\nstretching, he was--and stooped down on the edge of the raft and washed\nhis face in the river, and come and set down by me and got out his pipe,\nand had just got it filled, when he looks up and says--\n\n'“Why looky-here,” he says, “ain't that Buck Miller's place, over yander\nin the bend.”\n\n'“Yes,” says I, “it is--why.” He laid his pipe down and leant his head\non his hand, and says--\n\n'“I thought we'd be furder down.” I says--\n\n'“I thought it too, when I went off watch”--we was standing six hours on\nand six off--“but the boys told me,” I says, “that the raft didn't seem\nto hardly move, for the last hour,” says I, “though she's a slipping\nalong all right, now,” says I. He give a kind of a groan, and says--\n\n'“I've seed a raft act so before, along here,” he says, “'pears to me\nthe current has most quit above the head of this bend durin' the last\ntwo years,” he says.\n\n'Well, he raised up two or three times, and looked away off and around\non the water. That started me at it, too. A body is always doing what he\nsees somebody else doing, though there mayn't be no sense in it. Pretty\nsoon I see a black something floating on the water away off to stabboard\nand quartering behind us. I see he was looking at it, too. I says--\n\n'“What's that?” He says, sort of pettish,--\n\n'“Tain't nothing but an old empty bar'l.”\n\n'“An empty bar'l!” says I, “why,” says I, “a spy-glass is a fool to your\neyes. How can you tell it's an empty bar'l?” He says--\n\n'“I don't know; I reckon it ain't a bar'l, but I thought it might be,”\n says he.\n\n'“Yes,” I says, “so it might be, and it might be anything else, too; a\nbody can't tell nothing about it, such a distance as that,” I says.\n\n'We hadn't nothing else to do, so we kept on watching it. By and by I\nsays--\n\n'“Why looky-here, Dick Allbright, that thing's a-gaining on us, I\nbelieve.”\n\n'He never said nothing. The thing gained and gained, and I judged it\nmust be a dog that was about tired out. Well, we swung down into\nthe crossing, and the thing floated across the bright streak of the\nmoonshine, and, by George, it was bar'l. Says I--\n\n'“Dick Allbright, what made you think that thing was a bar'l, when it\nwas a half a mile off,” says I. Says he--\n\n'“I don't know.” Says I--\n\n'“You tell me, Dick Allbright.” He says--\n\n'“Well, I knowed it was a bar'l; I've seen it before; lots has seen it;\nthey says it's a haunted bar'l.”\n\n'I called the rest of the watch, and they come and stood there, and\nI told them what Dick said. It floated right along abreast, now, and\ndidn't gain any more. It was about twenty foot off. Some was for having\nit aboard, but the rest didn't want to. Dick Allbright said rafts that\nhad fooled with it had got bad luck by it. The captain of the watch\nsaid he didn't believe in it. He said he reckoned the bar'l gained on us\nbecause it was in a little better current than what we was. He said it\nwould leave by and by.\n\n'So then we went to talking about other things, and we had a song, and\nthen a breakdown; and after that the captain of the watch called for\nanother song; but it was clouding up, now, and the bar'l stuck right\nthar in the same place, and the song didn't seem to have much warm-up to\nit, somehow, and so they didn't finish it, and there warn't any cheers,\nbut it sort of dropped flat, and nobody said anything for a minute. Then\neverybody tried to talk at once, and one chap got off a joke, but it\nwarn't no use, they didn't laugh, and even the chap that made the joke\ndidn't laugh at it, which ain't usual. We all just settled down glum,\nand watched the bar'l, and was oneasy and oncomfortable. Well, sir, it\nshut down black and still, and then the wind begin to moan around, and\nnext the lightning begin to play and the thunder to grumble. And pretty\nsoon there was a regular storm, and in the middle of it a man that was\nrunning aft stumbled and fell and sprained his ankle so that he had\nto lay up. This made the boys shake their heads. And every time the\nlightning come, there was that bar'l with the blue lights winking around\nit. We was always on the look-out for it. But by and by, towards dawn,\nshe was gone. When the day come we couldn't see her anywhere, and we\nwarn't sorry, neither.\n\n'But next night about half-past nine, when there was songs and high\njinks going on, here she comes again, and took her old roost on the\nstabboard side. There warn't no more high jinks. Everybody got solemn;\nnobody talked; you couldn't get anybody to do anything but set around\nmoody and look at the bar'l. It begun to cloud up again. When the watch\nchanged, the off watch stayed up, 'stead of turning in. The storm ripped\nand roared around all night, and in the middle of it another man tripped\nand sprained his ankle, and had to knock off. The bar'l left towards\nday, and nobody see it go.\n\n'Everybody was sober and down in the mouth all day. I don't mean the\nkind of sober that comes of leaving liquor alone--not that. They was\nquiet, but they all drunk more than usual--not together--but each man\nsidled off and took it private, by himself.\n\n'After dark the off watch didn't turn in; nobody sung, nobody talked;\nthe boys didn't scatter around, neither; they sort of huddled together,\nforrard; and for two hours they set there, perfectly still, looking\nsteady in the one direction, and heaving a sigh once in a while. And\nthen, here comes the bar'l again. She took up her old place. She staid\nthere all night; nobody turned in. The storm come on again, after\nmidnight. It got awful dark; the rain poured down; hail, too; the\nthunder boomed and roared and bellowed; the wind blowed a hurricane; and\nthe lightning spread over everything in big sheets of glare, and showed\nthe whole raft as plain as day; and the river lashed up white as milk\nas far as you could see for miles, and there was that bar'l jiggering\nalong, same as ever. The captain ordered the watch to man the after\nsweeps for a crossing, and nobody would go--no more sprained ankles for\nthem, they said. They wouldn't even walk aft. Well then, just then the\nsky split wide open, with a crash, and the lightning killed two men of\nthe after watch, and crippled two more. Crippled them how, says you?\nWhy, sprained their ankles!\n\n'The bar'l left in the dark betwixt lightnings, towards dawn. Well, not\na body eat a bite at breakfast that morning. After that the men loafed\naround, in twos and threes, and talked low together. But none of them\nherded with Dick Allbright. They all give him the cold shake. If he come\naround where any of the men was, they split up and sidled away. They\nwouldn't man the sweeps with him. The captain had all the skiffs hauled\nup on the raft, alongside of his wigwam, and wouldn't let the dead men\nbe took ashore to be planted; he didn't believe a man that got ashore\nwould come back; and he was right.\n\n'After night come, you could see pretty plain that there was going to be\ntrouble if that bar'l come again; there was such a muttering going on. A\ngood many wanted to kill Dick Allbright, because he'd seen the bar'l on\nother trips, and that had an ugly look. Some wanted to put him ashore.\nSome said, let's all go ashore in a pile, if the bar'l comes again.\n\n'This kind of whispers was still going on, the men being bunched\ntogether forrard watching for the bar'l, when, lo and behold you, here\nshe comes again. Down she comes, slow and steady, and settles into her\nold tracks. You could a heard a pin drop. Then up comes the captain, and\nsays:--\n\n'“Boys, don't be a pack of children and fools; I don't want this bar'l\nto be dogging us all the way to Orleans, and _you _don't; well, then,\nhow's the best way to stop it? Burn it up,--that's the way. I'm going\nto fetch it aboard,” he says. And before anybody could say a word, in he\nwent.\n\n'He swum to it, and as he come pushing it to the raft, the men spread\nto one side. But the old man got it aboard and busted in the head,\nand there was a baby in it! Yes, sir, a stark naked baby. It was Dick\nAllbright's baby; he owned up and said so.\n\n'“Yes,” he says, a-leaning over it, “yes, it is my own lamented darling,\nmy poor lost Charles William Allbright deceased,” says he,--for he could\ncurl his tongue around the bulliest words in the language when he was a\nmind to, and lay them before you without a jint started, anywheres. Yes,\nhe said he used to live up at the head of this bend, and one night he\nchoked his child, which was crying, not intending to kill it,--which was\nprob'ly a lie,--and then he was scared, and buried it in a bar'l, before\nhis wife got home, and off he went, and struck the northern trail and\nwent to rafting; and this was the third year that the bar'l had chased\nhim. He said the bad luck always begun light, and lasted till four men\nwas killed, and then the bar'l didn't come any more after that. He\nsaid if the men would stand it one more night,--and was a-going on like\nthat,--but the men had got enough. They started to get out a boat to\ntake him ashore and lynch him, but he grabbed the little child all of a\nsudden and jumped overboard with it hugged up to his breast and shedding\ntears, and we never see him again in this life, poor old suffering soul,\nnor Charles William neither.'\n\n'_Who _was shedding tears?' says Bob; 'was it Allbright or the baby?'\n\n'Why, Allbright, of course; didn't I tell you the baby was dead. Been\ndead three years--how could it cry?'\n\n'Well, never mind how it could cry--how could it _keep _all that time?'\nsays Davy. 'You answer me that.'\n\n'I don't know how it done it,' says Ed. 'It done it though--that's all I\nknow about it.'\n\n'Say--what did they do with the bar'l?' says the Child of Calamity.\n\n'Why, they hove it overboard, and it sunk like a chunk of lead.'\n\n'Edward, did the child look like it was choked?' says one.\n\n'Did it have its hair parted?' says another.\n\n'What was the brand on that bar'l, Eddy?' says a fellow they called\nBill.\n\n'Have you got the papers for them statistics, Edmund?' says Jimmy.\n\n'Say, Edwin, was you one of the men that was killed by the lightning.'\nsays Davy.\n\n'Him? O, no, he was both of 'em,' says Bob. Then they all haw-hawed.\n\n'Say, Edward, don't you reckon you'd better take a pill? You look\nbad--don't you feel pale?' says the Child of Calamity.\n\n'O, come, now, Eddy,' says Jimmy, 'show up; you must a kept part of that\nbar'l to prove the thing by. Show us the bunghole--do--and we'll all\nbelieve you.'\n\n'Say, boys,' says Bill, 'less divide it up. Thar's thirteen of us. I can\nswaller a thirteenth of the yarn, if you can worry down the rest.'\n\nEd got up mad and said they could all go to some place which he ripped\nout pretty savage, and then walked off aft cussing to himself, and they\nyelling and jeering at him, and roaring and laughing so you could hear\nthem a mile.\n\n'Boys, we'll split a watermelon on that,' says the Child of Calamity;\nand he come rummaging around in the dark amongst the shingle bundles\nwhere I was, and put his hand on me. I was warm and soft and naked; so\nhe says 'Ouch!' and jumped back.\n\n'Fetch a lantern or a chunk of fire here, boys--there's a snake here as\nbig as a cow!'\n\nSo they run there with a lantern and crowded up and looked in on me.\n\n'Come out of that, you beggar!' says one.\n\n'Who are you?' says another.\n\n'What are you after here? Speak up prompt, or overboard you go.\n\n'Snake him out, boys. Snatch him out by the heels.'\n\nI began to beg, and crept out amongst them trembling. They looked me\nover, wondering, and the Child of Calamity says--\n\n'A cussed thief! Lend a hand and less heave him overboard!'\n\n'No,' says Big Bob, 'less get out the paint-pot and paint him a sky blue\nall over from head to heel, and then heave him over!'\n\n'Good, that 's it. Go for the paint, Jimmy.'\n\nWhen the paint come, and Bob took the brush and was just going to begin,\nthe others laughing and rubbing their hands, I begun to cry, and that\nsort of worked on Davy, and he says--\n\n''Vast there! He 's nothing but a cub. 'I'll paint the man that tetches\nhim!'\n\nSo I looked around on them, and some of them grumbled and growled, and\nBob put down the paint, and the others didn't take it up.\n\n'Come here to the fire, and less see what you're up to here,' says Davy.\n'Now set down there and give an account of yourself. How long have you\nbeen aboard here?'\n\n'Not over a quarter of a minute, sir,' says I.\n\n'How did you get dry so quick?'\n\n'I don't know, sir. I'm always that way, mostly.'\n\n'Oh, you are, are you. What's your name?'\n\nI warn't going to tell my name. I didn't know what to say, so I just\nsays--\n\n'Charles William Allbright, sir.'\n\nThen they roared--the whole crowd; and I was mighty glad I said that,\nbecause maybe laughing would get them in a better humor.\n\nWhen they got done laughing, Davy says--\n\n'It won't hardly do, Charles William. You couldn't have growed this much\nin five year, and you was a baby when you come out of the bar'l, you\nknow, and dead at that. Come, now, tell a straight story, and nobody'll\nhurt you, if you ain't up to anything wrong. What _is_ your name?'\n\n'Aleck Hopkins, sir. Aleck James Hopkins.'\n\n'Well, Aleck, where did you come from, here?'\n\n'From a trading scow. She lays up the bend yonder. I was born on her.\nPap has traded up and down here all his life; and he told me to swim off\nhere, because when you went by he said he would like to get some of you\nto speak to a Mr. Jonas Turner, in Cairo, and tell him--'\n\n'Oh, come!'\n\n'Yes, sir; it's as true as the world; Pap he says--'\n\n'Oh, your grandmother!'\n\nThey all laughed, and I tried again to talk, but they broke in on me and\nstopped me.\n\n'Now, looky-here,' says Davy; 'you're scared, and so you talk wild.\nHonest, now, do you live in a scow, or is it a lie?'\n\n'Yes, sir, in a trading scow. She lays up at the head of the bend. But I\nwarn't born in her. It's our first trip.'\n\n'Now you're talking! What did you come aboard here, for? To steal?'\n\n'No, sir, I didn't.--It was only to get a ride on the raft. All boys\ndoes that.'\n\n'Well, I know that. But what did you hide for?'\n\n'Sometimes they drive the boys off.'\n\n'So they do. They might steal. Looky-here; if we let you off this time,\nwill you keep out of these kind of scrapes hereafter?'\n\n''Deed I will, boss. You try me.'\n\n'All right, then. You ain't but little ways from shore. Overboard with\nyou, and don't you make a fool of yourself another time this way.--Blast\nit, boy, some raftsmen would rawhide you till you were black and blue!'\n\nI didn't wait to kiss good-bye, but went overboard and broke for shore.\nWhen Jim come along by and by, the big raft was away out of sight around\nthe point. I swum out and got aboard, and was mighty glad to see home\nagain.\n\nThe boy did not get the information he was after, but his adventure has\nfurnished the glimpse of the departed raftsman and keelboatman which I\ndesire to offer in this place.\n\nI now come to a phase of the Mississippi River life of the flush times\nof steamboating, which seems to me to warrant full examination--the\nmarvelous science of piloting, as displayed there. I believe there has\nbeen nothing like it elsewhere in the world.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 4\n\nThe Boys' Ambition\n\nWHEN I was a boy, there was but one permanent ambition among my comrades\nin our village {footnote [1. Hannibal, Missouri]} on the west bank of\nthe Mississippi River. That was, to be a steamboatman. We had transient\nambitions of other sorts, but they were only transient. When a circus\ncame and went, it left us all burning to become clowns; the first negro\nminstrel show that came to our section left us all suffering to try that\nkind of life; now and then we had a hope that if we lived and were good,\nGod would permit us to be pirates. These ambitions faded out, each in\nits turn; but the ambition to be a steamboatman always remained.\n\nOnce a day a cheap, gaudy packet arrived upward from St. Louis, and\nanother downward from Keokuk. Before these events, the day was glorious\nwith expectancy; after them, the day was a dead and empty thing. Not\nonly the boys, but the whole village, felt this. After all these years I\ncan picture that old time to myself now, just as it was then: the white\ntown drowsing in the sunshine of a summer's morning; the streets empty,\nor pretty nearly so; one or two clerks sitting in front of the Water\nStreet stores, with their splint-bottomed chairs tilted back against\nthe wall, chins on breasts, hats slouched over their faces, asleep--with\nshingle-shavings enough around to show what broke them down; a sow and\na litter of pigs loafing along the sidewalk, doing a good business in\nwatermelon rinds and seeds; two or three lonely little freight piles\nscattered about the 'levee;' a pile of 'skids' on the slope of the\nstone-paved wharf, and the fragrant town drunkard asleep in the shadow\nof them; two or three wood flats at the head of the wharf, but nobody to\nlisten to the peaceful lapping of the wavelets against them; the great\nMississippi, the majestic, the magnificent Mississippi, rolling its\nmile-wide tide along, shining in the sun; the dense forest away on the\nother side; the 'point' above the town, and the 'point' below, bounding\nthe river-glimpse and turning it into a sort of sea, and withal a very\nstill and brilliant and lonely one. Presently a film of dark smoke\nappears above one of those remote 'points;' instantly a negro drayman,\nfamous for his quick eye and prodigious voice, lifts up the cry,\n'S-t-e-a-m-boat a-comin'!' and the scene changes! The town drunkard\nstirs, the clerks wake up, a furious clatter of drays follows, every\nhouse and store pours out a human contribution, and all in a twinkling\nthe dead town is alive and moving.\n\nDrays, carts, men, boys, all go hurrying from many quarters to a common\ncenter, the wharf. Assembled there, the people fasten their eyes upon\nthe coming boat as upon a wonder they are seeing for the first time. And\nthe boat _is_ rather a handsome sight, too. She is long and sharp and\ntrim and pretty; she has two tall, fancy-topped chimneys, with a gilded\ndevice of some kind swung between them; a fanciful pilot-house, a glass\nand 'gingerbread', perched on top of the 'texas' deck behind them; the\npaddle-boxes are gorgeous with a picture or with gilded rays above the\nboat's name; the boiler deck, the hurricane deck, and the texas deck\nare fenced and ornamented with clean white railings; there is a flag\ngallantly flying from the jack-staff; the furnace doors are open and the\nfires glaring bravely; the upper decks are black with passengers; the\ncaptain stands by the big bell, calm, imposing, the envy of all; great\nvolumes of the blackest smoke are rolling and tumbling out of the\nchimneys--a husbanded grandeur created with a bit of pitch pine just\nbefore arriving at a town; the crew are grouped on the forecastle; the\nbroad stage is run far out over the port bow, and an envied deckhand\nstands picturesquely on the end of it with a coil of rope in his hand;\nthe pent steam is screaming through the gauge-cocks, the captain lifts\nhis hand, a bell rings, the wheels stop; then they turn back, churning\nthe water to foam, and the steamer is at rest. Then such a scramble as\nthere is to get aboard, and to get ashore, and to take in freight and to\ndischarge freight, all at one and the same time; and such a yelling\nand cursing as the mates facilitate it all with! Ten minutes later the\nsteamer is under way again, with no flag on the jack-staff and no black\nsmoke issuing from the chimneys. After ten more minutes the town is dead\nagain, and the town drunkard asleep by the skids once more.\n\nMy father was a justice of the peace, and I supposed he possessed\nthe power of life and death over all men and could hang anybody that\noffended him. This was distinction enough for me as a general thing; but\nthe desire to be a steamboatman kept intruding, nevertheless. I first\nwanted to be a cabin-boy, so that I could come out with a white apron\non and shake a tablecloth over the side, where all my old comrades could\nsee me; later I thought I would rather be the deckhand who stood on the\nend of the stage-plank with the coil of rope in his hand, because he was\nparticularly conspicuous. But these were only day-dreams,--they were too\nheavenly to be contemplated as real possibilities. By and by one of our\nboys went away. He was not heard of for a long time. At last he turned\nup as apprentice engineer or 'striker' on a steamboat. This thing shook\nthe bottom out of all my Sunday-school teachings. That boy had been\nnotoriously worldly, and I just the reverse; yet he was exalted to this\neminence, and I left in obscurity and misery. There was nothing generous\nabout this fellow in his greatness. He would always manage to have a\nrusty bolt to scrub while his boat tarried at our town, and he would sit\non the inside guard and scrub it, where we could all see him and envy\nhim and loathe him. And whenever his boat was laid up he would come home\nand swell around the town in his blackest and greasiest clothes, so that\nnobody could help remembering that he was a steamboatman; and he used\nall sorts of steamboat technicalities in his talk, as if he were so used\nto them that he forgot common people could not understand them. He would\nspeak of the 'labboard' side of a horse in an easy, natural way that\nwould make one wish he was dead. And he was always talking about 'St.\nLooy' like an old citizen; he would refer casually to occasions when\nhe 'was coming down Fourth Street,' or when he was 'passing by the\nPlanter's House,' or when there was a fire and he took a turn on the\nbrakes of 'the old Big Missouri;' and then he would go on and lie about\nhow many towns the size of ours were burned down there that day. Two\nor three of the boys had long been persons of consideration among\nus because they had been to St. Louis once and had a vague general\nknowledge of its wonders, but the day of their glory was over now. They\nlapsed into a humble silence, and learned to disappear when the ruthless\n'cub'-engineer approached. This fellow had money, too, and hair oil.\nAlso an ignorant silver watch and a showy brass watch chain. He wore\na leather belt and used no suspenders. If ever a youth was cordially\nadmired and hated by his comrades, this one was. No girl could withstand\nhis charms. He 'cut out' every boy in the village. When his boat blew up\nat last, it diffused a tranquil contentment among us such as we had not\nknown for months. But when he came home the next week, alive, renowned,\nand appeared in church all battered up and bandaged, a shining hero,\nstared at and wondered over by everybody, it seemed to us that the\npartiality of Providence for an undeserving reptile had reached a point\nwhere it was open to criticism.\n\nThis creature's career could produce but one result, and it speedily\nfollowed. Boy after boy managed to get on the river. The minister's son\nbecame an engineer. The doctor's and the post-master's sons became 'mud\nclerks;' the wholesale liquor dealer's son became a barkeeper on a\nboat; four sons of the chief merchant, and two sons of the county judge,\nbecame pilots. Pilot was the grandest position of all. The pilot, even\nin those days of trivial wages, had a princely salary--from a hundred\nand fifty to two hundred and fifty dollars a month, and no board to pay.\nTwo months of his wages would pay a preacher's salary for a year. Now\nsome of us were left disconsolate. We could not get on the river--at\nleast our parents would not let us.\n\nSo by and by I ran away. I said I never would come home again till I was\na pilot and could come in glory. But somehow I could not manage it.\nI went meekly aboard a few of the boats that lay packed together like\nsardines at the long St. Louis wharf, and very humbly inquired for the\npilots, but got only a cold shoulder and short words from mates and\nclerks. I had to make the best of this sort of treatment for the time\nbeing, but I had comforting daydreams of a future when I should be a\ngreat and honored pilot, with plenty of money, and could kill some of\nthese mates and clerks and pay for them.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 5\n\nI Want to be a Cub-pilot\n\nMONTHS afterward the hope within me struggled to a reluctant death, and\nI found myself without an ambition. But I was ashamed to go home. I was\nin Cincinnati, and I set to work to map out a new career. I had\nbeen reading about the recent exploration of the river Amazon by an\nexpedition sent out by our government. It was said that the expedition,\nowing to difficulties, had not thoroughly explored a part of the country\nlying about the head-waters, some four thousand miles from the mouth of\nthe river. It was only about fifteen hundred miles from Cincinnati to\nNew Orleans, where I could doubtless get a ship. I had thirty dollars\nleft; I would go and complete the exploration of the Amazon. This was\nall the thought I gave to the subject. I never was great in matters of\ndetail. I packed my valise, and took passage on an ancient tub called\nthe 'Paul Jones,' for New Orleans. For the sum of sixteen dollars I had\nthe scarred and tarnished splendors of 'her' main saloon principally\nto myself, for she was not a creature to attract the eye of wiser\ntravelers.\n\nWhen we presently got under way and went poking down the broad Ohio,\nI became a new being, and the subject of my own admiration. I was a\ntraveler! A word never had tasted so good in my mouth before. I had an\nexultant sense of being bound for mysterious lands and distant climes\nwhich I never have felt in so uplifting a degree since. I was in such a\nglorified condition that all ignoble feelings departed out of me, and I\nwas able to look down and pity the untraveled with a compassion that had\nhardly a trace of contempt in it. Still, when we stopped at villages and\nwood-yards, I could not help lolling carelessly upon the railings of the\nboiler deck to enjoy the envy of the country boys on the bank. If\nthey did not seem to discover me, I presently sneezed to attract their\nattention, or moved to a position where they could not help seeing me.\nAnd as soon as I knew they saw me I gaped and stretched, and gave other\nsigns of being mightily bored with traveling.\n\nI kept my hat off all the time, and stayed where the wind and the sun\ncould strike me, because I wanted to get the bronzed and weather-beaten\nlook of an old traveler. Before the second day was half gone I\nexperienced a joy which filled me with the purest gratitude; for I saw\nthat the skin had begun to blister and peel off my face and neck. I\nwished that the boys and girls at home could see me now.\n\nWe reached Louisville in time--at least the neighborhood of it. We stuck\nhard and fast on the rocks in the middle of the river, and lay there\nfour days. I was now beginning to feel a strong sense of being a part\nof the boat's family, a sort of infant son to the captain and younger\nbrother to the officers. There is no estimating the pride I took in this\ngrandeur, or the affection that began to swell and grow in me for those\npeople. I could not know how the lordly steamboatman scorns that sort\nof presumption in a mere landsman. I particularly longed to acquire the\nleast trifle of notice from the big stormy mate, and I was on the alert\nfor an opportunity to do him a service to that end. It came at last. The\nriotous powwow of setting a spar was going on down on the forecastle,\nand I went down there and stood around in the way--or mostly skipping\nout of it--till the mate suddenly roared a general order for somebody to\nbring him a capstan bar. I sprang to his side and said: 'Tell me where\nit is--I'll fetch it!'\n\nIf a rag-picker had offered to do a diplomatic service for the Emperor\nof Russia, the monarch could not have been more astounded than the mate\nwas. He even stopped swearing. He stood and stared down at me. It took\nhim ten seconds to scrape his disjointed remains together again. Then\nhe said impressively: 'Well, if this don't beat hell!' and turned to his\nwork with the air of a man who had been confronted with a problem too\nabstruse for solution.\n\nI crept away, and courted solitude for the rest of the day. I did not go\nto dinner; I stayed away from supper until everybody else had finished.\nI did not feel so much like a member of the boat's family now as before.\nHowever, my spirits returned, in installments, as we pursued our way\ndown the river. I was sorry I hated the mate so, because it was not in\n(young) human nature not to admire him. He was huge and muscular, his\nface was bearded and whiskered all over; he had a red woman and a blue\nwoman tattooed on his right arm,--one on each side of a blue anchor with\na red rope to it; and in the matter of profanity he was sublime. When he\nwas getting out cargo at a landing, I was always where I could see and\nhear. He felt all the majesty of his great position, and made the world\nfeel it, too. When he gave even the simplest order, he discharged\nit like a blast of lightning, and sent a long, reverberating peal of\nprofanity thundering after it. I could not help contrasting the way in\nwhich the average landsman would give an order, with the mate's way\nof doing it. If the landsman should wish the gang-plank moved a foot\nfarther forward, he would probably say: 'James, or William, one of you\npush that plank forward, please;' but put the mate in his place and he\nwould roar out: 'Here, now, start that gang-plank for'ard! Lively, now!\n_what_'re you about! Snatch it! SNATCH it! There! there! Aft again! aft\nagain! don't you hear me. Dash it to dash! are you going to _sleep _over\nit! '_Vast _heaving. 'Vast heaving, I tell you! Going to heave it clear\nastern? _Where_'re you going with that barrel! _For'ard_ with it 'fore\nI make you swallow it, you dash-dash-dash-_dashed _split between a tired\nmud-turtle and a crippled hearse-horse!'\n\nI wished I could talk like that.\n\nWhen the soreness of my adventure with the mate had somewhat worn off,\nI began timidly to make up to the humblest official connected with\nthe boat--the night watchman. He snubbed my advances at first, but I\npresently ventured to offer him a new chalk pipe; and that softened him.\nSo he allowed me to sit with him by the big bell on the hurricane deck,\nand in time he melted into conversation. He could not well have helped\nit, I hung with such homage on his words and so plainly showed that\nI felt honored by his notice. He told me the names of dim capes and\nshadowy islands as we glided by them in the solemnity of the night,\nunder the winking stars, and by and by got to talking about himself.\nHe seemed over-sentimental for a man whose salary was six dollars a\nweek--or rather he might have seemed so to an older person than I. But\nI drank in his words hungrily, and with a faith that might have moved\nmountains if it had been applied judiciously. What was it to me that he\nwas soiled and seedy and fragrant with gin? What was it to me that his\ngrammar was bad, his construction worse, and his profanity so void\nof art that it was an element of weakness rather than strength in his\nconversation? He was a wronged man, a man who had seen trouble, and that\nwas enough for me. As he mellowed into his plaintive history his tears\ndripped upon the lantern in his lap, and I cried, too, from sympathy.\n\nHe said he was the son of an English nobleman--either an earl or an\nalderman, he could not remember which, but believed was both; his\nfather, the nobleman, loved him, but his mother hated him from the\ncradle; and so while he was still a little boy he was sent to 'one of\nthem old, ancient colleges'--he couldn't remember which; and by and by\nhis father died and his mother seized the property and 'shook' him as\nhe phrased it. After his mother shook him, members of the nobility with\nwhom he was acquainted used their influence to get him the position of\n'loblolly-boy in a ship;' and from that point my watchman threw off all\ntrammels of date and locality and branched out into a narrative that\nbristled all along with incredible adventures; a narrative that was so\nreeking with bloodshed and so crammed with hair-breadth escapes and\nthe most engaging and unconscious personal villainies, that I sat\nspeechless, enjoying, shuddering, wondering, worshipping.\n\nIt was a sore blight to find out afterwards that he was a low, vulgar,\nignorant, sentimental, half-witted humbug, an untraveled native of the\nwilds of Illinois, who had absorbed wildcat literature and appropriated\nits marvels, until in time he had woven odds and ends of the mess into\nthis yarn, and then gone on telling it to fledglings like me, until he\nhad come to believe it himself.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 6\n\nA Cub-pilot's Experience\n\nWHAT with lying on the rocks four days at Louisville, and some other\ndelays, the poor old 'Paul Jones' fooled away about two weeks in making\nthe voyage from Cincinnati to New Orleans. This gave me a chance to get\nacquainted with one of the pilots, and he taught me how to steer the\nboat, and thus made the fascination of river life more potent than ever\nfor me.\n\nIt also gave me a chance to get acquainted with a youth who had taken\ndeck passage--more's the pity; for he easily borrowed six dollars of me\non a promise to return to the boat and pay it back to me the day after\nwe should arrive. But he probably died or forgot, for he never came. It\nwas doubtless the former, since he had said his parents were wealthy,\nand he only traveled deck passage because it was cooler.{footnote [1.\n'Deck' Passage, i.e. steerage passage.]}\n\nI soon discovered two things. One was that a vessel would not be likely\nto sail for the mouth of the Amazon under ten or twelve years; and the\nother was that the nine or ten dollars still left in my pocket would not\nsuffice for so imposing an exploration as I had planned, even if I could\nafford to wait for a ship. Therefore it followed that I must contrive\na new career. The 'Paul Jones' was now bound for St. Louis. I planned\na siege against my pilot, and at the end of three hard days he\nsurrendered. He agreed to teach me the Mississippi River from New\nOrleans to St. Louis for five hundred dollars, payable out of the\nfirst wages I should receive after graduating. I entered upon the small\nenterprise of 'learning' twelve or thirteen hundred miles of the great\nMississippi River with the easy confidence of my time of life. If I had\nreally known what I was about to require of my faculties, I should not\nhave had the courage to begin. I supposed that all a pilot had to do was\nto keep his boat in the river, and I did not consider that that could be\nmuch of a trick, since it was so wide.\n\nThe boat backed out from New Orleans at four in the afternoon, and it\nwas 'our watch' until eight. Mr. Bixby, my chief, 'straightened her\nup,' plowed her along past the sterns of the other boats that lay at the\nLevee, and then said, 'Here, take her; shave those steamships as close\nas you'd peel an apple.' I took the wheel, and my heart-beat fluttered\nup into the hundreds; for it seemed to me that we were about to scrape\nthe side off every ship in the line, we were so close. I held my breath\nand began to claw the boat away from the danger; and I had my own\nopinion of the pilot who had known no better than to get us into such\nperil, but I was too wise to express it. In half a minute I had a wide\nmargin of safety intervening between the 'Paul Jones' and the ships; and\nwithin ten seconds more I was set aside in disgrace, and Mr. Bixby was\ngoing into danger again and flaying me alive with abuse of my cowardice.\nI was stung, but I was obliged to admire the easy confidence with which\nmy chief loafed from side to side of his wheel, and trimmed the ships so\nclosely that disaster seemed ceaselessly imminent. When he had cooled a\nlittle he told me that the easy water was close ashore and the current\noutside, and therefore we must hug the bank, up-stream, to get the\nbenefit of the former, and stay well out, down-stream, to take advantage\nof the latter. In my own mind I resolved to be a down-stream pilot and\nleave the up-streaming to people dead to prudence.\n\nNow and then Mr. Bixby called my attention to certain things. Said\nhe, 'This is Six-Mile Point.' I assented. It was pleasant enough\ninformation, but I could not see the bearing of it. I was not conscious\nthat it was a matter of any interest to me. Another time he said, 'This\nis Nine-Mile Point.' Later he said, 'This is Twelve-Mile Point.' They\nwere all about level with the water's edge; they all looked about alike\nto me; they were monotonously unpicturesque. I hoped Mr. Bixby would\nchange the subject. But no; he would crowd up around a point, hugging\nthe shore with affection, and then say: 'The slack water ends here,\nabreast this bunch of China-trees; now we cross over.' So he crossed\nover. He gave me the wheel once or twice, but I had no luck. I either\ncame near chipping off the edge of a sugar plantation, or I yawed too\nfar from shore, and so dropped back into disgrace again and got abused.\n\nThe watch was ended at last, and we took supper and went to bed. At\nmidnight the glare of a lantern shone in my eyes, and the night watchman\nsaid--\n\n'Come! turn out!'\n\nAnd then he left. I could not understand this extraordinary procedure;\nso I presently gave up trying to, and dozed off to sleep. Pretty soon\nthe watchman was back again, and this time he was gruff. I was annoyed.\nI said:--\n\n'What do you want to come bothering around here in the middle of the\nnight for. Now as like as not I'll not get to sleep again to-night.'\n\nThe watchman said--\n\n'Well, if this an't good, I'm blest.'\n\nThe 'off-watch' was just turning in, and I heard some brutal laughter\nfrom them, and such remarks as 'Hello, watchman! an't the new cub turned\nout yet? He's delicate, likely. Give him some sugar in a rag and send\nfor the chambermaid to sing rock-a-by-baby to him.'\n\nAbout this time Mr. Bixby appeared on the scene. Something like a minute\nlater I was climbing the pilot-house steps with some of my clothes on\nand the rest in my arms. Mr. Bixby was close behind, commenting. Here\nwas something fresh--this thing of getting up in the middle of the night\nto go to work. It was a detail in piloting that had never occurred to\nme at all. I knew that boats ran all night, but somehow I had never\nhappened to reflect that somebody had to get up out of a warm bed to run\nthem. I began to fear that piloting was not quite so romantic as I had\nimagined it was; there was something very real and work-like about this\nnew phase of it.\n\nIt was a rather dingy night, although a fair number of stars were out.\nThe big mate was at the wheel, and he had the old tub pointed at a star\nand was holding her straight up the middle of the river. The shores on\neither hand were not much more than half a mile apart, but they seemed\nwonderfully far away and ever so vague and indistinct. The mate said:--\n\n'We've got to land at Jones's plantation, sir.'\n\nThe vengeful spirit in me exulted. I said to myself, I wish you joy\nof your job, Mr. Bixby; you'll have a good time finding Mr. Jones's\nplantation such a night as this; and I hope you never _will _find it as\nlong as you live.\n\nMr. Bixby said to the mate:--\n\n'Upper end of the plantation, or the lower?'\n\n'Upper.'\n\n'I can't do it. The stumps there are out of water at this stage: It's no\ngreat distance to the lower, and you'll have to get along with that.'\n\n'All right, sir. If Jones don't like it he'll have to lump it, I\nreckon.'\n\nAnd then the mate left. My exultation began to cool and my wonder to\ncome up. Here was a man who not only proposed to find this plantation on\nsuch a night, but to find either end of it you preferred. I dreadfully\nwanted to ask a question, but I was carrying about as many short answers\nas my cargo-room would admit of, so I held my peace. All I desired\nto ask Mr. Bixby was the simple question whether he was ass enough to\nreally imagine he was going to find that plantation on a night when all\nplantations were exactly alike and all the same color. But I held in. I\nused to have fine inspirations of prudence in those days.\n\nMr. Bixby made for the shore and soon was scraping it, just the same as\nif it had been daylight. And not only that, but singing--\n\n'Father in heaven, the day is declining,' etc.\n\nIt seemed to me that I had put my life in the keeping of a peculiarly\nreckless outcast. Presently he turned on me and said:--\n\n'What's the name of the first point above New Orleans?'\n\nI was gratified to be able to answer promptly, and I did. I said I\ndidn't know.\n\n'Don't _know_?'\n\nThis manner jolted me. I was down at the foot again, in a moment. But I\nhad to say just what I had said before.\n\n'Well, you're a smart one,' said Mr. Bixby. 'What's the name of the\n_next_ point?'\n\nOnce more I didn't know.\n\n'Well, this beats anything. Tell me the name of _any _point or place I\ntold you.'\n\nI studied a while and decided that I couldn't.\n\n'Look here! What do you start out from, above Twelve-Mile Point, to\ncross over?'\n\n'I--I--don't know.'\n\n'You--you--don't know?' mimicking my drawling manner of speech. 'What\n_do_ you know?'\n\n'I--I--nothing, for certain.'\n\n'By the great Caesar's ghost, I believe you! You're the stupidest\ndunderhead I ever saw or ever heard of, so help me Moses! The idea of\nyou being a pilot--you! Why, you don't know enough to pilot a cow down a\nlane.'\n\nOh, but his wrath was up! He was a nervous man, and he shuffled from one\nside of his wheel to the other as if the floor was hot. He would boil a\nwhile to himself, and then overflow and scald me again.\n\n'Look here! What do you suppose I told you the names of those points\nfor?'\n\nI tremblingly considered a moment, and then the devil of temptation\nprovoked me to say:--\n\n'Well--to--to--be entertaining, I thought.'\n\nThis was a red rag to the bull. He raged and stormed so (he was crossing\nthe river at the time) that I judge it made him blind, because he ran\nover the steering-oar of a trading-scow. Of course the traders sent up\na volley of red-hot profanity. Never was a man so grateful as Mr. Bixby\nwas: because he was brim full, and here were subjects who would\n_talk back_. He threw open a window, thrust his head out, and such an\nirruption followed as I never had heard before. The fainter and farther\naway the scowmen's curses drifted, the higher Mr. Bixby lifted his voice\nand the weightier his adjectives grew. When he closed the window he was\nempty. You could have drawn a seine through his system and not caught\ncurses enough to disturb your mother with. Presently he said to me in\nthe gentlest way--\n\n'My boy, you must get a little memorandum book, and every time I tell\nyou a thing, put it down right away. There's only one way to be a pilot,\nand that is to get this entire river by heart. You have to know it just\nlike A B C.'\n\nThat was a dismal revelation to me; for my memory was never loaded with\nanything but blank cartridges. However, I did not feel discouraged long.\nI judged that it was best to make some allowances, for doubtless Mr.\nBixby was 'stretching.' Presently he pulled a rope and struck a few\nstrokes on the big bell. The stars were all gone now, and the night was\nas black as ink. I could hear the wheels churn along the bank, but I\nwas not entirely certain that I could see the shore. The voice of the\ninvisible watchman called up from the hurricane deck--\n\n'What's this, sir?'\n\n'Jones's plantation.'\n\nI said to myself, I wish I might venture to offer a small bet that it\nisn't. But I did not chirp. I only waited to see. Mr. Bixby handled the\nengine bells, and in due time the boat's nose came to the land, a torch\nglowed from the forecastle, a man skipped ashore, a darky's voice on the\nbank said, 'Gimme de k'yarpet-bag, Mars' Jones,' and the next moment we\nwere standing up the river again, all serene. I reflected deeply awhile,\nand then said--but not aloud--'Well, the finding of that plantation was\nthe luckiest accident that ever happened; but it couldn't happen again\nin a hundred years.' And I fully believed it was an accident, too.\n\nBy the time we had gone seven or eight hundred miles up the river, I had\nlearned to be a tolerably plucky up-stream steersman, in daylight,\nand before we reached St. Louis I had made a trifle of progress in\nnight-work, but only a trifle. I had a note-book that fairly bristled\nwith the names of towns, 'points,' bars, islands, bends, reaches, etc.;\nbut the information was to be found only in the notebook--none of it was\nin my head. It made my heart ache to think I had only got half of the\nriver set down; for as our watch was four hours off and four hours on,\nday and night, there was a long four-hour gap in my book for every time\nI had slept since the voyage began.\n\nMy chief was presently hired to go on a big New Orleans boat, and I\npacked my satchel and went with him. She was a grand affair. When I\nstood in her pilot-house I was so far above the water that I seemed\nperched on a mountain; and her decks stretched so far away, fore and\naft, below me, that I wondered how I could ever have considered the\nlittle 'Paul Jones' a large craft. There were other differences, too.\nThe 'Paul Jones's' pilot-house was a cheap, dingy, battered rattle-trap,\ncramped for room: but here was a sumptuous glass temple; room enough to\nhave a dance in; showy red and gold window-curtains; an imposing sofa;\nleather cushions and a back to the high bench where visiting pilots sit,\nto spin yarns and 'look at the river;' bright, fanciful 'cuspadores'\ninstead of a broad wooden box filled with sawdust; nice new oil-cloth\non the floor; a hospitable big stove for winter; a wheel as high as my\nhead, costly with inlaid work; a wire tiller-rope; bright brass knobs\nfor the bells; and a tidy, white-aproned, black 'texas-tender,' to bring\nup tarts and ices and coffee during mid-watch, day and night. Now this\nwas 'something like,' and so I began to take heart once more to believe\nthat piloting was a romantic sort of occupation after all. The moment we\nwere under way I began to prowl about the great steamer and fill myself\nwith joy. She was as clean and as dainty as a drawing-room; when I\nlooked down her long, gilded saloon, it was like gazing through a\nsplendid tunnel; she had an oil-picture, by some gifted sign-painter,\non every stateroom door; she glittered with no end of prism-fringed\nchandeliers; the clerk's office was elegant, the bar was marvelous, and\nthe bar-keeper had been barbered and upholstered at incredible cost.\nThe boiler deck (i.e. the second story of the boat, so to speak) was as\nspacious as a church, it seemed to me; so with the forecastle; and\nthere was no pitiful handful of deckhands, firemen, and roustabouts down\nthere, but a whole battalion of men. The fires were fiercely glaring\nfrom a long row of furnaces, and over them were eight huge boilers!\nThis was unutterable pomp. The mighty engines--but enough of this. I had\nnever felt so fine before. And when I found that the regiment of natty\nservants respectfully 'sir'd' me, my satisfaction was complete.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 7\n\nA Daring Deed\n\nWHEN I returned to the pilot-house St. Louis was gone and I was lost.\nHere was a piece of river which was all down in my book, but I could\nmake neither head nor tail of it: you understand, it was turned around.\nI had seen it when coming up-stream, but I had never faced about to see\nhow it looked when it was behind me. My heart broke again, for it was\nplain that I had got to learn this troublesome river _both ways_.\n\nThe pilot-house was full of pilots, going down to 'look at the river.'\nWhat is called the 'upper river' (the two hundred miles between St.\nLouis and Cairo, where the Ohio comes in) was low; and the Mississippi\nchanges its channel so constantly that the pilots used to always find\nit necessary to run down to Cairo to take a fresh look, when their boats\nwere to lie in port a week; that is, when the water was at a low stage.\nA deal of this 'looking at the river' was done by poor fellows who\nseldom had a berth, and whose only hope of getting one lay in their\nbeing always freshly posted and therefore ready to drop into the shoes\nof some reputable pilot, for a single trip, on account of such pilot's\nsudden illness, or some other necessity. And a good many of them\nconstantly ran up and down inspecting the river, not because they ever\nreally hoped to get a berth, but because (they being guests of the boat)\nit was cheaper to 'look at the river' than stay ashore and pay board. In\ntime these fellows grew dainty in their tastes, and only infested boats\nthat had an established reputation for setting good tables. All visiting\npilots were useful, for they were always ready and willing, winter or\nsummer, night or day, to go out in the yawl and help buoy the channel\nor assist the boat's pilots in any way they could. They were likewise\nwelcome because all pilots are tireless talkers, when gathered together,\nand as they talk only about the river they are always understood and\nare always interesting. Your true pilot cares nothing about anything on\nearth but the river, and his pride in his occupation surpasses the pride\nof kings.\n\nWe had a fine company of these river-inspectors along, this trip. There\nwere eight or ten; and there was abundance of room for them in our great\npilot-house. Two or three of them wore polished silk hats, elaborate\nshirt-fronts, diamond breast-pins, kid gloves, and patent-leather boots.\nThey were choice in their English, and bore themselves with a dignity\nproper to men of solid means and prodigious reputation as pilots. The\nothers were more or less loosely clad, and wore upon their heads tall\nfelt cones that were suggestive of the days of the Commonwealth.\n\nI was a cipher in this august company, and felt subdued, not to say\ntorpid. I was not even of sufficient consequence to assist at the wheel\nwhen it was necessary to put the tiller hard down in a hurry; the guest\nthat stood nearest did that when occasion required--and this was pretty\nmuch all the time, because of the crookedness of the channel and the\nscant water. I stood in a corner; and the talk I listened to took the\nhope all out of me. One visitor said to another--\n\n'Jim, how did you run Plum Point, coming up?'\n\n'It was in the night, there, and I ran it the way one of the boys on the\n“Diana” told me; started out about fifty yards above the wood pile on\nthe false point, and held on the cabin under Plum Point till I raised\nthe reef--quarter less twain--then straightened up for the middle bar\ntill I got well abreast the old one-limbed cotton-wood in the bend,\nthen got my stern on the cotton-wood and head on the low place above the\npoint, and came through a-booming--nine and a half.'\n\n'Pretty square crossing, an't it?'\n\n'Yes, but the upper bar 's working down fast.'\n\nAnother pilot spoke up and said--\n\n'I had better water than that, and ran it lower down; started out from\nthe false point--mark twain--raised the second reef abreast the big snag\nin the bend, and had quarter less twain.'\n\nOne of the gorgeous ones remarked--\n\n'I don't want to find fault with your leadsmen, but that's a good deal\nof water for Plum Point, it seems to me.'\n\nThere was an approving nod all around as this quiet snub dropped on\nthe boaster and 'settled' him. And so they went on talk-talk-talking.\nMeantime, the thing that was running in my mind was, 'Now if my ears\nhear aright, I have not only to get the names of all the towns and\nislands and bends, and so on, by heart, but I must even get up a warm\npersonal acquaintanceship with every old snag and one-limbed cotton-wood\nand obscure wood pile that ornaments the banks of this river for twelve\nhundred miles; and more than that, I must actually know where these\nthings are in the dark, unless these guests are gifted with eyes that\ncan pierce through two miles of solid blackness; I wish the piloting\nbusiness was in Jericho and I had never thought of it.'\n\nAt dusk Mr. Bixby tapped the big bell three times (the signal to land),\nand the captain emerged from his drawing-room in the forward end of the\ntexas, and looked up inquiringly. Mr. Bixby said--\n\n'We will lay up here all night, captain.'\n\n'Very well, sir.'\n\nThat was all. The boat came to shore and was tied up for the night. It\nseemed to me a fine thing that the pilot could do as he pleased, without\nasking so grand a captain's permission. I took my supper and\nwent immediately to bed, discouraged by my day's observations and\nexperiences. My late voyage's note-booking was but a confusion of\nmeaningless names. It had tangled me all up in a knot every time I had\nlooked at it in the daytime. I now hoped for respite in sleep; but\nno, it reveled all through my head till sunrise again, a frantic and\ntireless nightmare.\n\nNext morning I felt pretty rusty and low-spirited. We went booming\nalong, taking a good many chances, for we were anxious to 'get out of\nthe river' (as getting out to Cairo was called) before night should\novertake us. But Mr. Bixby's partner, the other pilot, presently\ngrounded the boat, and we lost so much time in getting her off that\nit was plain that darkness would overtake us a good long way above\nthe mouth. This was a great misfortune, especially to certain of our\nvisiting pilots, whose boats would have to wait for their return, no\nmatter how long that might be. It sobered the pilot-house talk a good\ndeal. Coming up-stream, pilots did not mind low water or any kind\nof darkness; nothing stopped them but fog. But down-stream work was\ndifferent; a boat was too nearly helpless, with a stiff current pushing\nbehind her; so it was not customary to run down-stream at night in low\nwater.\n\nThere seemed to be one small hope, however: if we could get through\nthe intricate and dangerous Hat Island crossing before night, we could\nventure the rest, for we would have plainer sailing and better water.\nBut it would be insanity to attempt Hat Island at night. So there was\na deal of looking at watches all the rest of the day, and a constant\nciphering upon the speed we were making; Hat Island was the eternal\nsubject; sometimes hope was high and sometimes we were delayed in a\nbad crossing, and down it went again. For hours all hands lay under the\nburden of this suppressed excitement; it was even communicated to me,\nand I got to feeling so solicitous about Hat Island, and under such\nan awful pressure of responsibility, that I wished I might have five\nminutes on shore to draw a good, full, relieving breath, and start over\nagain. We were standing no regular watches. Each of our pilots ran such\nportions of the river as he had run when coming up-stream, because of\nhis greater familiarity with it; but both remained in the pilot house\nconstantly.\n\nAn hour before sunset, Mr. Bixby took the wheel and Mr. W----stepped\naside. For the next thirty minutes every man held his watch in his hand\nand was restless, silent, and uneasy. At last somebody said, with a\ndoomful sigh--\n\n'Well, yonder's Hat Island--and we can't make it.' All the watches\nclosed with a snap, everybody sighed and muttered something about its\nbeing 'too bad, too bad--ah, if we could only have got here half an hour\nsooner!' and the place was thick with the atmosphere of disappointment.\nSome started to go out, but loitered, hearing no bell-tap to land. The\nsun dipped behind the horizon, the boat went on. Inquiring looks passed\nfrom one guest to another; and one who had his hand on the door-knob\nand had turned it, waited, then presently took away his hand and let the\nknob turn back again. We bore steadily down the bend. More looks were\nexchanged, and nods of surprised admiration--but no words. Insensibly\nthe men drew together behind Mr. Bixby, as the sky darkened and one or\ntwo dim stars came out. The dead silence and sense of waiting became\noppressive. Mr. Bixby pulled the cord, and two deep, mellow notes from\nthe big bell floated off on the night. Then a pause, and one more note\nwas struck. The watchman's voice followed, from the hurricane deck--\n\n'Labboard lead, there! Stabboard lead!'\n\nThe cries of the leadsmen began to rise out of the distance, and were\ngruffly repeated by the word-passers on the hurricane deck.\n\n'M-a-r-k three!... M-a-r-k three!... Quarter-less three!... Half\ntwain!... Quarter twain!... M-a-r-k twain!... Quarter-less--'\n\nMr. Bixby pulled two bell-ropes, and was answered by faint jinglings far\nbelow in the engine room, and our speed slackened. The steam began to\nwhistle through the gauge-cocks. The cries of the leadsmen went on--and\nit is a weird sound, always, in the night. Every pilot in the lot was\nwatching now, with fixed eyes, and talking under his breath. Nobody was\ncalm and easy but Mr. Bixby. He would put his wheel down and stand on\na spoke, and as the steamer swung into her (to me) utterly invisible\nmarks--for we seemed to be in the midst of a wide and gloomy sea--he\nwould meet and fasten her there. Out of the murmur of half-audible talk,\none caught a coherent sentence now and then--such as--\n\n'There; she's over the first reef all right!'\n\nAfter a pause, another subdued voice--\n\n'Her stern's coming down just exactly right, by George!'\n\n'Now she's in the marks; over she goes!'\n\nSomebody else muttered--\n\n'Oh, it was done beautiful--_beautiful_!'\n\nNow the engines were stopped altogether, and we drifted with the\ncurrent. Not that I could see the boat drift, for I could not, the stars\nbeing all gone by this time. This drifting was the dismalest work; it\nheld one's heart still. Presently I discovered a blacker gloom than\nthat which surrounded us. It was the head of the island. We were closing\nright down upon it. We entered its deeper shadow, and so imminent\nseemed the peril that I was likely to suffocate; and I had the strongest\nimpulse to do _something_, anything, to save the vessel. But still Mr.\nBixby stood by his wheel, silent, intent as a cat, and all the pilots\nstood shoulder to shoulder at his back.\n\n'She'll not make it!' somebody whispered.\n\nThe water grew shoaler and shoaler, by the leadsman's cries, till it was\ndown to--\n\n'Eight-and-a-half!.... E-i-g-h-t feet!.... E-i-g-h-t feet!....\nSeven-and--'\n\nMr. Bixby said warningly through his speaking tube to the engineer--\n\n'Stand by, now!'\n\n'Aye-aye, sir!'\n\n'Seven-and-a-half! Seven feet! Six-and--'\n\nWe touched bottom! Instantly Mr. Bixby set a lot of bells ringing,\nshouted through the tube, 'NOW, let her have it--every ounce you've\ngot!' then to his partner, 'Put her hard down! snatch her! snatch her!'\nThe boat rasped and ground her way through the sand, hung upon the apex\nof disaster a single tremendous instant, and then over she went! And\nsuch a shout as went up at Mr. Bixby's back never loosened the roof of a\npilot-house before!\n\nThere was no more trouble after that. Mr. Bixby was a hero that night;\nand it was some little time, too, before his exploit ceased to be talked\nabout by river men.\n\nFully to realize the marvelous precision required in laying the great\nsteamer in her marks in that murky waste of water, one should know that\nnot only must she pick her intricate way through snags and blind\nreefs, and then shave the head of the island so closely as to brush\nthe overhanging foliage with her stern, but at one place she must pass\nalmost within arm's reach of a sunken and invisible wreck that would\nsnatch the hull timbers from under her if she should strike it, and\ndestroy a quarter of a million dollars' worth of steam-boat and cargo\nin five minutes, and maybe a hundred and fifty human lives into the\nbargain.\n\nThe last remark I heard that night was a compliment to Mr. Bixby,\nuttered in soliloquy and with unction by one of our guests. He said--\n\n'By the Shadow of Death, but he's a lightning pilot!'\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 8\n\nPerplexing Lessons\n\nAt the end of what seemed a tedious while, I had managed to pack my\nhead full of islands, towns, bars, 'points,' and bends; and a curiously\ninanimate mass of lumber it was, too. However, inasmuch as I could shut\nmy eyes and reel off a good long string of these names without leaving\nout more than ten miles of river in every fifty, I began to feel that\nI could take a boat down to New Orleans if I could make her skip those\nlittle gaps. But of course my complacency could hardly get start enough\nto lift my nose a trifle into the air, before Mr. Bixby would think of\nsomething to fetch it down again. One day he turned on me suddenly with\nthis settler--\n\n'What is the shape of Walnut Bend?'\n\nHe might as well have asked me my grandmother's opinion of protoplasm.\nI reflected respectfully, and then said I didn't know it had any\nparticular shape. My gunpowdery chief went off with a bang, of course,\nand then went on loading and firing until he was out of adjectives.\n\nI had learned long ago that he only carried just so many rounds of\nammunition, and was sure to subside into a very placable and even\nremorseful old smooth-bore as soon as they were all gone. That word\n'old' is merely affectionate; he was not more than thirty-four. I\nwaited. By and by he said--\n\n'My boy, you've got to know the _shape _of the river perfectly. It is\nall there is left to steer by on a very dark night. Everything else\nis blotted out and gone. But mind you, it hasn't the same shape in the\nnight that it has in the day-time.'\n\n'How on earth am I ever going to learn it, then?'\n\n'How do you follow a hall at home in the dark. Because you know the\nshape of it. You can't see it.'\n\n'Do you mean to say that I've got to know all the million trifling\nvariations of shape in the banks of this interminable river as well as I\nknow the shape of the front hall at home?'\n\n'On my honor, you've got to know them _better _than any man ever did\nknow the shapes of the halls in his own house.'\n\n'I wish I was dead!'\n\n'Now I don't want to discourage you, but--'\n\n'Well, pile it on me; I might as well have it now as another time.'\n\n'You see, this has got to be learned; there isn't any getting around\nit. A clear starlight night throws such heavy shadows that if you didn't\nknow the shape of a shore perfectly you would claw away from every bunch\nof timber, because you would take the black shadow of it for a solid\ncape; and you see you would be getting scared to death every fifteen\nminutes by the watch. You would be fifty yards from shore all the time\nwhen you ought to be within fifty feet of it. You can't see a snag in\none of those shadows, but you know exactly where it is, and the shape\nof the river tells you when you are coming to it. Then there's your\npitch-dark night; the river is a very different shape on a pitch-dark\nnight from what it is on a starlight night. All shores seem to be\nstraight lines, then, and mighty dim ones, too; and you'd _run _them for\nstraight lines only you know better. You boldly drive your boat right\ninto what seems to be a solid, straight wall (you knowing very well that\nin reality there is a curve there), and that wall falls back and makes\nway for you. Then there's your gray mist. You take a night when there's\none of these grisly, drizzly, gray mists, and then there isn't any\nparticular shape to a shore. A gray mist would tangle the head of the\noldest man that ever lived. Well, then, different kinds of _moonlight\n_change the shape of the river in different ways. You see--'\n\n'Oh, don't say any more, please! Have I got to learn the shape of the\nriver according to all these five hundred thousand different ways? If\nI tried to carry all that cargo in my head it would make me\nstoop-shouldered.'\n\n'_No_! you only learn _the _shape of the river, and you learn it with\nsuch absolute certainty that you can always steer by the shape that's\n_in your head_, and never mind the one that's before your eyes.'\n\n'Very well, I'll try it; but after I have learned it can I depend on it.\nWill it keep the same form and not go fooling around?'\n\nBefore Mr. Bixby could answer, Mr. W---- came in to take the watch, and\nhe said--\n\n'Bixby, you'll have to look out for President's Island and all that\ncountry clear away up above the Old Hen and Chickens. The banks are\ncaving and the shape of the shores changing like everything. Why,\nyou wouldn't know the point above 40. You can go up inside the old\nsycamore-snag, now.{footnote [1. It may not be necessary, but still it\ncan do no harm to explain that 'inside' means between the snag and the\nshore.--M.T.]}\n\nSo that question was answered. Here were leagues of shore changing\nshape. My spirits were down in the mud again. Two things seemed pretty\napparent to me. One was, that in order to be a pilot a man had got to\nlearn more than any one man ought to be allowed to know; and the other\nwas, that he must learn it all over again in a different way every\ntwenty-four hours.\n\nThat night we had the watch until twelve. Now it was an ancient river\ncustom for the two pilots to chat a bit when the watch changed. While\nthe relieving pilot put on his gloves and lit his cigar, his partner,\nthe retiring pilot, would say something like this--\n\n'I judge the upper bar is making down a little at Hale's Point; had\nquarter twain with the lower lead and mark twain {footnote [Two fathoms.\n'Quarter twain' is two-and-a-quarter fathoms, thirteen-and-a-half feet.\n'Mark three' is three fathoms.]} with the other.'\n\n'Yes, I thought it was making down a little, last trip. Meet any boats?'\n\n'Met one abreast the head of 21, but she was away over hugging the\nbar, and I couldn't make her out entirely. I took her for the “Sunny\nSouth”--hadn't any skylights forward of the chimneys.'\n\nAnd so on. And as the relieving pilot took the wheel his partner\n{footnote ['Partner' is a technical term for 'the other pilot'.]} would\nmention that we were in such-and-such a bend, and say we were abreast\nof such-and-such a man's wood-yard or plantation. This was courtesy;\nI supposed it was necessity. But Mr. W---- came on watch full twelve\nminutes late on this particular night,--a tremendous breach of\netiquette; in fact, it is the unpardonable sin among pilots. So Mr.\nBixby gave him no greeting whatever, but simply surrendered the wheel\nand marched out of the pilot-house without a word. I was appalled; it\nwas a villainous night for blackness, we were in a particularly wide\nand blind part of the river, where there was no shape or substance to\nanything, and it seemed incredible that Mr. Bixby should have left that\npoor fellow to kill the boat trying to find out where he was. But I\nresolved that I would stand by him any way. He should find that he was\nnot wholly friendless. So I stood around, and waited to be asked where\nwe were. But Mr. W---- plunged on serenely through the solid firmament\nof black cats that stood for an atmosphere, and never opened his mouth.\nHere is a proud devil, thought I; here is a limb of Satan that would\nrather send us all to destruction than put himself under obligations to\nme, because I am not yet one of the salt of the earth and privileged to\nsnub captains and lord it over everything dead and alive in a steamboat.\nI presently climbed up on the bench; I did not think it was safe to go\nto sleep while this lunatic was on watch.\n\nHowever, I must have gone to sleep in the course of time, because the\nnext thing I was aware of was the fact that day was breaking, Mr. W----\ngone, and Mr. Bixby at the wheel again. So it was four o'clock and all\nwell--but me; I felt like a skinful of dry bones and all of them trying\nto ache at once.\n\nMr. Bixby asked me what I had stayed up there for. I confessed that it\nwas to do Mr. W---- a benevolence,--tell him where he was. It took five\nminutes for the entire preposterousness of the thing to filter into Mr.\nBixby's system, and then I judge it filled him nearly up to the chin;\nbecause he paid me a compliment--and not much of a one either. He said,\n\n'Well, taking you by-and-large, you do seem to be more different kinds\nof an ass than any creature I ever saw before. What did you suppose he\nwanted to know for?'\n\nI said I thought it might be a convenience to him.\n\n'Convenience D-nation! Didn't I tell you that a man's got to know the\nriver in the night the same as he'd know his own front hall?'\n\n'Well, I can follow the front hall in the dark if I know it _is_ the\nfront hall; but suppose you set me down in the middle of it in the dark\nand not tell me which hall it is; how am I to know?'\n\n'Well you've _got _to, on the river!'\n\n'All right. Then I'm glad I never said anything to Mr. W---- '\n\n'I should say so. Why, he'd have slammed you through the window and\nutterly ruined a hundred dollars' worth of window-sash and stuff.'\n\nI was glad this damage had been saved, for it would have made me\nunpopular with the owners. They always hated anybody who had the name of\nbeing careless, and injuring things.\n\nI went to work now to learn the shape of the river; and of all the\neluding and ungraspable objects that ever I tried to get mind or hands\non, that was the chief. I would fasten my eyes upon a sharp, wooded\npoint that projected far into the river some miles ahead of me, and go\nto laboriously photographing its shape upon my brain; and just as I was\nbeginning to succeed to my satisfaction, we would draw up toward it and\nthe exasperating thing would begin to melt away and fold back into the\nbank! If there had been a conspicuous dead tree standing upon the very\npoint of the cape, I would find that tree inconspicuously merged into\nthe general forest, and occupying the middle of a straight shore, when\nI got abreast of it! No prominent hill would stick to its shape long\nenough for me to make up my mind what its form really was, but it was as\ndissolving and changeful as if it had been a mountain of butter in the\nhottest corner of the tropics. Nothing ever had the same shape when\nI was coming downstream that it had borne when I went up. I mentioned\nthese little difficulties to Mr. Bixby. He said--\n\n'That's the very main virtue of the thing. If the shapes didn't change\nevery three seconds they wouldn't be of any use. Take this place where\nwe are now, for instance. As long as that hill over yonder is only one\nhill, I can boom right along the way I'm going; but the moment it splits\nat the top and forms a V, I know I've got to scratch to starboard in a\nhurry, or I'll bang this boat's brains out against a rock; and then the\nmoment one of the prongs of the V swings behind the other, I've got to\nwaltz to larboard again, or I'll have a misunderstanding with a snag\nthat would snatch the keelson out of this steamboat as neatly as if it\nwere a sliver in your hand. If that hill didn't change its shape on bad\nnights there would be an awful steamboat grave-yard around here inside\nof a year.'\n\nIt was plain that I had got to learn the shape of the river in all the\ndifferent ways that could be thought of,--upside down, wrong end first,\ninside out, fore-and-aft, and 'thortships,'--and then know what to do on\ngray nights when it hadn't any shape at all. So I set about it. In the\ncourse of time I began to get the best of this knotty lesson, and my\nself-complacency moved to the front once more. Mr. Bixby was all fixed,\nand ready to start it to the rear again. He opened on me after this\nfashion--\n\n'How much water did we have in the middle crossing at Hole-in-the-Wall,\ntrip before last?'\n\nI considered this an outrage. I said--\n\n'Every trip, down and up, the leadsmen are singing through that tangled\nplace for three-quarters of an hour on a stretch. How do you reckon I\ncan remember such a mess as that?'\n\n'My boy, you've got to remember it. You've got to remember the exact\nspot and the exact marks the boat lay in when we had the shoalest water,\nin everyone of the five hundred shoal places between St. Louis and New\nOrleans; and you mustn't get the shoal soundings and marks of one trip\nmixed up with the shoal soundings and marks of another, either, for\nthey're not often twice alike. You must keep them separate.'\n\nWhen I came to myself again, I said--\n\n'When I get so that I can do that, I'll be able to raise the dead,\nand then I won't have to pilot a steamboat to make a living. I want to\nretire from this business. I want a slush-bucket and a brush; I'm only\nfit for a roustabout. I haven't got brains enough to be a pilot; and\nif I had I wouldn't have strength enough to carry them around, unless I\nwent on crutches.'\n\n'Now drop that! When I say I'll learn {footnote ['Teach' is not in the\nriver vocabulary.]} a man the river, I mean it. And you can depend on\nit, I'll learn him or kill him.'\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 9\n\nContinued Perplexities\n\nTHERE was no use in arguing with a person like this. I promptly put\nsuch a strain on my memory that by and by even the shoal water and the\ncountless crossing-marks began to stay with me. But the result was just\nthe same. I never could more than get one knotty thing learned before\nanother presented itself. Now I had often seen pilots gazing at the\nwater and pretending to read it as if it were a book; but it was a\nbook that told me nothing. A time came at last, however, when Mr.\nBixby seemed to think me far enough advanced to bear a lesson on\nwater-reading. So he began--\n\n'Do you see that long slanting line on the face of the water? Now,\nthat's a reef. Moreover, it's a bluff reef. There is a solid sand-bar\nunder it that is nearly as straight up and down as the side of a house.\nThere is plenty of water close up to it, but mighty little on top of it.\nIf you were to hit it you would knock the boat's brains out. Do you see\nwhere the line fringes out at the upper end and begins to fade away?'\n\n'Yes, sir.'\n\n'Well, that is a low place; that is the head of the reef. You can climb\nover there, and not hurt anything. Cross over, now, and follow along\nclose under the reef--easy water there--not much current.'\n\nI followed the reef along till I approached the fringed end. Then Mr.\nBixby said--\n\n'Now get ready. Wait till I give the word. She won't want to mount the\nreef; a boat hates shoal water. Stand by--wait--WAIT--keep her well in\nhand. NOW cramp her down! Snatch her! snatch her!'\n\nHe seized the other side of the wheel and helped to spin it around until\nit was hard down, and then we held it so. The boat resisted, and refused\nto answer for a while, and next she came surging to starboard, mounted\nthe reef, and sent a long, angry ridge of water foaming away from her\nbows.\n\n'Now watch her; watch her like a cat, or she'll get away from you. When\nshe fights strong and the tiller slips a little, in a jerky, greasy sort\nof way, let up on her a trifle; it is the way she tells you at night\nthat the water is too shoal; but keep edging her up, little by little,\ntoward the point. You are well up on the bar, now; there is a bar under\nevery point, because the water that comes down around it forms an eddy\nand allows the sediment to sink. Do you see those fine lines on the face\nof the water that branch out like the ribs of a fan. Well, those are\nlittle reefs; you want to just miss the ends of them, but run them\npretty close. Now look out--look out! Don't you crowd that slick,\ngreasy-looking place; there ain't nine feet there; she won't stand it.\nShe begins to smell it; look sharp, I tell you! Oh blazes, there you go!\nStop the starboard wheel! Quick! Ship up to back! Set her back!\n\nThe engine bells jingled and the engines answered promptly, shooting\nwhite columns of steam far aloft out of the 'scape pipes, but it was\ntoo late. The boat had 'smelt' the bar in good earnest; the foamy ridges\nthat radiated from her bows suddenly disappeared, a great dead swell\ncame rolling forward and swept ahead of her, she careened far over to\nlarboard, and went tearing away toward the other shore as if she were\nabout scared to death. We were a good mile from where we ought to have\nbeen, when we finally got the upper hand of her again.\n\nDuring the afternoon watch the next day, Mr. Bixby asked me if I knew\nhow to run the next few miles. I said--\n\n'Go inside the first snag above the point, outside the next one, start\nout from the lower end of Higgins's wood-yard, make a square crossing\nand--'\n\n'That's all right. I'll be back before you close up on the next point.'\n\nBut he wasn't. He was still below when I rounded it and entered upon a\npiece of river which I had some misgivings about. I did not know that\nhe was hiding behind a chimney to see how I would perform. I went gaily\nalong, getting prouder and prouder, for he had never left the boat in\nmy sole charge such a length of time before. I even got to 'setting'\nher and letting the wheel go, entirely, while I vaingloriously turned\nmy back and inspected the stem marks and hummed a tune, a sort of easy\nindifference which I had prodigiously admired in Bixby and other great\npilots. Once I inspected rather long, and when I faced to the front\nagain my heart flew into my mouth so suddenly that if I hadn't clapped\nmy teeth together I should have lost it. One of those frightful bluff\nreefs was stretching its deadly length right across our bows! My head\nwas gone in a moment; I did not know which end I stood on; I gasped and\ncould not get my breath; I spun the wheel down with such rapidity that\nit wove itself together like a spider's web; the boat answered and\nturned square away from the reef, but the reef followed her! I fled, and\nstill it followed, still it kept--right across my bows! I never looked\nto see where I was going, I only fled. The awful crash was imminent--why\ndidn't that villain come! If I committed the crime of ringing a bell,\nI might get thrown overboard. But better that than kill the boat. So\nin blind desperation I started such a rattling 'shivaree' down below as\nnever had astounded an engineer in this world before, I fancy. Amidst\nthe frenzy of the bells the engines began to back and fill in a furious\nway, and my reason forsook its throne--we were about to crash into the\nwoods on the other side of the river. Just then Mr. Bixby stepped calmly\ninto view on the hurricane deck. My soul went out to him in gratitude.\nMy distress vanished; I would have felt safe on the brink of Niagara,\nwith Mr. Bixby on the hurricane deck. He blandly and sweetly took\nhis tooth-pick out of his mouth between his fingers, as if it were a\ncigar--we were just in the act of climbing an overhanging big tree,\nand the passengers were scudding astern like rats--and lifted up these\ncommands to me ever so gently--\n\n'Stop the starboard. Stop the larboard. Set her back on both.'\n\nThe boat hesitated, halted, pressed her nose among the boughs a critical\ninstant, then reluctantly began to back away.\n\n'Stop the larboard. Come ahead on it. Stop the starboard. Come ahead on\nit. Point her for the bar.'\n\nI sailed away as serenely as a summer's morning. Mr. Bixby came in and\nsaid, with mock simplicity--\n\n'When you have a hail, my boy, you ought to tap the big bell three times\nbefore you land, so that the engineers can get ready.'\n\nI blushed under the sarcasm, and said I hadn't had any hail.\n\n'Ah! Then it was for wood, I suppose. The officer of the watch will tell\nyou when he wants to wood up.'\n\nI went on consuming and said I wasn't after wood.\n\n'Indeed? Why, what could you want over here in the bend, then? Did you\never know of a boat following a bend up-stream at this stage of the\nriver?'\n\n'No sir,--and I wasn't trying to follow it. I was getting away from a\nbluff reef.'\n\n'No, it wasn't a bluff reef; there isn't one within three miles of where\nyou were.'\n\n'But I saw it. It was as bluff as that one yonder.'\n\n'Just about. Run over it!'\n\n'Do you give it as an order?'\n\n'Yes. Run over it.'\n\n'If I don't, I wish I may die.'\n\n'All right; I am taking the responsibility.' I was just as anxious to\nkill the boat, now, as I had been to save her before. I impressed my\norders upon my memory, to be used at the inquest, and made a straight\nbreak for the reef. As it disappeared under our bows I held my breath;\nbut we slid over it like oil.\n\n'Now don't you see the difference? It wasn't anything but a _wind _reef.\nThe wind does that.'\n\n'So I see. But it is exactly like a bluff reef. How am I ever going to\ntell them apart?'\n\n'I can't tell you. It is an instinct. By and by you will just naturally\n_know _one from the other, but you never will be able to explain why or\nhow you know them apart'\n\nIt turned out to be true. The face of the water, in time, became a\nwonderful book--a book that was a dead language to the uneducated\npassenger, but which told its mind to me without reserve, delivering its\nmost cherished secrets as clearly as if it uttered them with a voice.\nAnd it was not a book to be read once and thrown aside, for it had a new\nstory to tell every day. Throughout the long twelve hundred miles there\nwas never a page that was void of interest, never one that you could\nleave unread without loss, never one that you would want to skip,\nthinking you could find higher enjoyment in some other thing. There\nnever was so wonderful a book written by man; never one whose interest\nwas so absorbing, so unflagging, so sparkingly renewed with every\nreperusal. The passenger who could not read it was charmed with a\npeculiar sort of faint dimple on its surface (on the rare occasions\nwhen he did not overlook it altogether); but to the pilot that was an\n_italicized _passage; indeed, it was more than that, it was a legend of\nthe largest capitals, with a string of shouting exclamation points at\nthe end of it; for it meant that a wreck or a rock was buried there that\ncould tear the life out of the strongest vessel that ever floated. It is\nthe faintest and simplest expression the water ever makes, and the most\nhideous to a pilot's eye. In truth, the passenger who could not read\nthis book saw nothing but all manner of pretty pictures in it painted by\nthe sun and shaded by the clouds, whereas to the trained eye these\nwere not pictures at all, but the grimmest and most dead-earnest of\nreading-matter.\n\nNow when I had mastered the language of this water and had come to know\nevery trifling feature that bordered the great river as familiarly as I\nknew the letters of the alphabet, I had made a valuable acquisition.\nBut I had lost something, too. I had lost something which could never be\nrestored to me while I lived. All the grace, the beauty, the poetry had\ngone out of the majestic river! I still keep in mind a certain wonderful\nsunset which I witnessed when steamboating was new to me. A broad\nexpanse of the river was turned to blood; in the middle distance the red\nhue brightened into gold, through which a solitary log came floating,\nblack and conspicuous; in one place a long, slanting mark lay sparkling\nupon the water; in another the surface was broken by boiling, tumbling\nrings, that were as many-tinted as an opal; where the ruddy flush was\nfaintest, was a smooth spot that was covered with graceful circles and\nradiating lines, ever so delicately traced; the shore on our left was\ndensely wooded, and the somber shadow that fell from this forest was\nbroken in one place by a long, ruffled trail that shone like silver;\nand high above the forest wall a clean-stemmed dead tree waved a single\nleafy bough that glowed like a flame in the unobstructed splendor that\nwas flowing from the sun. There were graceful curves, reflected images,\nwoody heights, soft distances; and over the whole scene, far and near,\nthe dissolving lights drifted steadily, enriching it, every passing\nmoment, with new marvels of coloring.\n\nI stood like one bewitched. I drank it in, in a speechless rapture. The\nworld was new to me, and I had never seen anything like this at home.\nBut as I have said, a day came when I began to cease from noting the\nglories and the charms which the moon and the sun and the twilight\nwrought upon the river's face; another day came when I ceased altogether\nto note them. Then, if that sunset scene had been repeated, I should\nhave looked upon it without rapture, and should have commented upon it,\ninwardly, after this fashion: This sun means that we are going to have\nwind to-morrow; that floating log means that the river is rising, small\nthanks to it; that slanting mark on the water refers to a bluff reef\nwhich is going to kill somebody's steamboat one of these nights, if\nit keeps on stretching out like that; those tumbling 'boils' show a\ndissolving bar and a changing channel there; the lines and circles in\nthe slick water over yonder are a warning that that troublesome place is\nshoaling up dangerously; that silver streak in the shadow of the forest\nis the 'break' from a new snag, and he has located himself in the very\nbest place he could have found to fish for steamboats; that tall dead\ntree, with a single living branch, is not going to last long, and\nthen how is a body ever going to get through this blind place at night\nwithout the friendly old landmark.\n\nNo, the romance and the beauty were all gone from the river. All the\nvalue any feature of it had for me now was the amount of usefulness it\ncould furnish toward compassing the safe piloting of a steamboat. Since\nthose days, I have pitied doctors from my heart. What does the lovely\nflush in a beauty's cheek mean to a doctor but a 'break' that ripples\nabove some deadly disease. Are not all her visible charms sown thick\nwith what are to him the signs and symbols of hidden decay? Does he ever\nsee her beauty at all, or doesn't he simply view her professionally, and\ncomment upon her unwholesome condition all to himself? And doesn't he\nsometimes wonder whether he has gained most or lost most by learning his\ntrade?\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 10\n\nCompleting My Education\n\nWHOSOEVER has done me the courtesy to read my chapters which have\npreceded this may possibly wonder that I deal so minutely with piloting\nas a science. It was the prime purpose of those chapters; and I am not\nquite done yet. I wish to show, in the most patient and painstaking way,\nwhat a wonderful science it is. Ship channels are buoyed and lighted,\nand therefore it is a comparatively easy undertaking to learn to run\nthem; clear-water rivers, with gravel bottoms, change their channels\nvery gradually, and therefore one needs to learn them but once; but\npiloting becomes another matter when you apply it to vast streams like\nthe Mississippi and the Missouri, whose alluvial banks cave and change\nconstantly, whose snags are always hunting up new quarters, whose\nsandbars are never at rest, whose channels are for ever dodging and\nshirking, and whose obstructions must be confronted in all nights and\nall weathers without the aid of a single light-house or a single buoy;\nfor there is neither light nor buoy to be found anywhere in all this\nthree or four thousand miles of villainous river.{footnote [True at the\ntime referred to; not true now (1882).]} I feel justified in enlarging\nupon this great science for the reason that I feel sure no one has ever\nyet written a paragraph about it who had piloted a steamboat himself,\nand so had a practical knowledge of the subject. If the theme were\nhackneyed, I should be obliged to deal gently with the reader; but\nsince it is wholly new, I have felt at liberty to take up a considerable\ndegree of room with it.\n\nWhen I had learned the name and position of every visible feature of the\nriver; when I had so mastered its shape that I could shut my eyes and\ntrace it from St. Louis to New Orleans; when I had learned to read the\nface of the water as one would cull the news from the morning paper;\nand finally, when I had trained my dull memory to treasure up an endless\narray of soundings and crossing-marks, and keep fast hold of them, I\njudged that my education was complete: so I got to tilting my cap to the\nside of my head, and wearing a tooth-pick in my mouth at the wheel. Mr.\nBixby had his eye on these airs. One day he said--\n\n'What is the height of that bank yonder, at Burgess's?'\n\n'How can I tell, sir. It is three-quarters of a mile away.'\n\n'Very poor eye--very poor. Take the glass.'\n\nI took the glass, and presently said--'I can't tell. I suppose that that\nbank is about a foot and a half high.'\n\n'Foot and a half! That's a six-foot bank. How high was the bank along\nhere last trip?'\n\n'I don't know; I never noticed.'\n\n'You didn't? Well, you must always do it hereafter.'\n\n'Why?'\n\n'Because you'll have to know a good many things that it tells you.\nFor one thing, it tells you the stage of the river--tells you whether\nthere's more water or less in the river along here than there was last\ntrip.'\n\n'The leads tell me that.' I rather thought I had the advantage of him\nthere.\n\n'Yes, but suppose the leads lie? The bank would tell you so, and then\nyou'd stir those leadsmen up a bit. There was a ten-foot bank here last\ntrip, and there is only a six-foot bank now. What does that signify?'\n\n'That the river is four feet higher than it was last trip.'\n\n'Very good. Is the river rising or falling?'\n\n'Rising.'\n\n'No it ain't.'\n\n'I guess I am right, sir. Yonder is some drift-wood floating down the\nstream.'\n\n'A rise starts the drift-wood, but then it keeps on floating a while\nafter the river is done rising. Now the bank will tell you about this.\nWait till you come to a place where it shelves a little. Now here; do\nyou see this narrow belt of fine sediment That was deposited while the\nwater was higher. You see the driftwood begins to strand, too. The bank\nhelps in other ways. Do you see that stump on the false point?'\n\n'Ay, ay, sir.'\n\n'Well, the water is just up to the roots of it. You must make a note of\nthat.'\n\n'Why?'\n\n'Because that means that there's seven feet in the chute of 103.'\n\n'But 103 is a long way up the river yet.'\n\n'That's where the benefit of the bank comes in. There is water enough in\n103 _now_, yet there may not be by the time we get there; but the bank\nwill keep us posted all along. You don't run close chutes on a falling\nriver, up-stream, and there are precious few of them that you are\nallowed to run at all down-stream. There's a law of the United States\nagainst it. The river may be rising by the time we get to 103, and in\nthat case we'll run it. We are drawing--how much?'\n\n'Six feet aft,--six and a half forward.'\n\n'Well, you do seem to know something.'\n\n'But what I particularly want to know is, if I have got to keep up an\neverlasting measuring of the banks of this river, twelve hundred miles,\nmonth in and month out?'\n\n'Of course!'\n\nMy emotions were too deep for words for a while. Presently I said--'\n\nAnd how about these chutes. Are there many of them?'\n\n'I should say so. I fancy we shan't run any of the river this trip as\nyou've ever seen it run before--so to speak. If the river begins to rise\nagain, we'll go up behind bars that you've always seen standing out of\nthe river, high and dry like the roof of a house; we'll cut across low\nplaces that you've never noticed at all, right through the middle of\nbars that cover three hundred acres of river; we'll creep through cracks\nwhere you've always thought was solid land; we'll dart through the woods\nand leave twenty-five miles of river off to one side; we'll see the\nhind-side of every island between New Orleans and Cairo.'\n\n'Then I've got to go to work and learn just as much more river as I\nalready know.'\n\n'Just about twice as much more, as near as you can come at it.'\n\n'Well, one lives to find out. I think I was a fool when I went into this\nbusiness.'\n\n'Yes, that is true. And you are yet. But you'll not be when you've\nlearned it.'\n\n'Ah, I never can learn it.'\n\n'I will see that you _do_.'\n\nBy and by I ventured again--\n\n'Have I got to learn all this thing just as I know the rest of the\nriver--shapes and all--and so I can run it at night?'\n\n'Yes. And you've got to have good fair marks from one end of the river\nto the other, that will help the bank tell you when there is water\nenough in each of these countless places--like that stump, you know.\nWhen the river first begins to rise, you can run half a dozen of the\ndeepest of them; when it rises a foot more you can run another dozen;\nthe next foot will add a couple of dozen, and so on: so you see you have\nto know your banks and marks to a dead moral certainty, and never get\nthem mixed; for when you start through one of those cracks, there's\nno backing out again, as there is in the big river; you've got to go\nthrough, or stay there six months if you get caught on a falling river.\nThere are about fifty of these cracks which you can't run at all except\nwhen the river is brim full and over the banks.'\n\n'This new lesson is a cheerful prospect.'\n\n'Cheerful enough. And mind what I've just told you; when you start into\none of those places you've got to go through. They are too narrow to\nturn around in, too crooked to back out of, and the shoal water is\nalways up at the head; never elsewhere. And the head of them is always\nlikely to be filling up, little by little, so that the marks you reckon\ntheir depth by, this season, may not answer for next.'\n\n'Learn a new set, then, every year?'\n\n'Exactly. Cramp her up to the bar! What are you standing up through the\nmiddle of the river for?'\n\nThe next few months showed me strange things. On the same day that we\nheld the conversation above narrated, we met a great rise coming down\nthe river. The whole vast face of the stream was black with drifting\ndead logs, broken boughs, and great trees that had caved in and been\nwashed away. It required the nicest steering to pick one's way through\nthis rushing raft, even in the day-time, when crossing from point to\npoint; and at night the difficulty was mightily increased; every now and\nthen a huge log, lying deep in the water, would suddenly appear right\nunder our bows, coming head-on; no use to try to avoid it then; we could\nonly stop the engines, and one wheel would walk over that log from one\nend to the other, keeping up a thundering racket and careening the boat\nin a way that was very uncomfortable to passengers. Now and then we\nwould hit one of these sunken logs a rattling bang, dead in the center,\nwith a full head of steam, and it would stun the boat as if she had hit\na continent. Sometimes this log would lodge, and stay right across\nour nose, and back the Mississippi up before it; we would have to do a\nlittle craw-fishing, then, to get away from the obstruction. We often\nhit _white _logs, in the dark, for we could not see them till we were\nright on them; but a black log is a pretty distinct object at night. A\nwhite snag is an ugly customer when the daylight is gone.\n\nOf course, on the great rise, down came a swarm of prodigious\ntimber-rafts from the head waters of the Mississippi, coal barges from\nPittsburgh, little trading scows from everywhere, and broad-horns from\n'Posey County,' Indiana, freighted with 'fruit and furniture'--the\nusual term for describing it, though in plain English the freight thus\naggrandized was hoop-poles and pumpkins. Pilots bore a mortal hatred to\nthese craft; and it was returned with usury. The law required all such\nhelpless traders to keep a light burning, but it was a law that was\noften broken. All of a sudden, on a murky night, a light would hop up,\nright under our bows, almost, and an agonized voice, with the backwoods\n'whang' to it, would wail out--\n\n'Whar'n the ---- you goin' to! Cain't you see nothin', you dash-dashed\naig-suckin', sheep-stealin', one-eyed son of a stuffed monkey!'\n\nThen for an instant, as we whistled by, the red glare from our furnaces\nwould reveal the scow and the form of the gesticulating orator as if\nunder a lightning-flash, and in that instant our firemen and deck-hands\nwould send and receive a tempest of missiles and profanity, one of our\nwheels would walk off with the crashing fragments of a steering-oar, and\ndown the dead blackness would shut again. And that flatboatman would be\nsure to go into New Orleans and sue our boat, swearing stoutly that he\nhad a light burning all the time, when in truth his gang had the lantern\ndown below to sing and lie and drink and gamble by, and no watch on\ndeck.\n\nOnce, at night, in one of those forest-bordered crevices (behind an\nisland) which steamboatmen intensely describe with the phrase 'as dark\nas the inside of a cow,' we should have eaten up a Posey County family,\nfruit, furniture, and all, but that they happened to be fiddling down\nbelow, and we just caught the sound of the music in time to sheer off,\ndoing no serious damage, unfortunately, but coming so near it that we\nhad good hopes for a moment. These people brought up their lantern,\nthen, of course; and as we backed and filled to get away, the precious\nfamily stood in the light of it--both sexes and various ages--and cursed\nus till everything turned blue. Once a coalboatman sent a bullet through\nour pilot-house, when we borrowed a steering oar of him in a very narrow\nplace.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 11\n\nThe River Rises\n\nDURING this big rise these small-fry craft were an intolerable nuisance.\nWe were running chute after chute,--a new world to me,--and if there was\na particularly cramped place in a chute, we would be pretty sure to meet\na broad-horn there; and if he failed to be there, we would find him in a\nstill worse locality, namely, the head of the chute, on the shoal water.\nAnd then there would be no end of profane cordialities exchanged.\n\nSometimes, in the big river, when we would be feeling our way cautiously\nalong through a fog, the deep hush would suddenly be broken by yells and\na clamor of tin pans, and all in instant a log raft would appear vaguely\nthrough the webby veil, close upon us; and then we did not wait to swap\nknives, but snatched our engine bells out by the roots and piled on all\nthe steam we had, to scramble out of the way! One doesn't hit a rock or\na solid log craft with a steamboat when he can get excused.\n\nYou will hardly believe it, but many steamboat clerks always carried\na large assortment of religious tracts with them in those old departed\nsteamboating days. Indeed they did. Twenty times a day we would be\ncramping up around a bar, while a string of these small-fry rascals\nwere drifting down into the head of the bend away above and beyond us a\ncouple of miles. Now a skiff would dart away from one of them, and come\nfighting its laborious way across the desert of water. It would 'ease\nall,' in the shadow of our forecastle, and the panting oarsmen would\nshout, 'Gimme a pa-a-per!' as the skiff drifted swiftly astern. The\nclerk would throw over a file of New Orleans journals. If these were\npicked up without comment, you might notice that now a dozen other\nskiffs had been drifting down upon us without saying anything. You\nunderstand, they had been waiting to see how No. 1 was going to fare.\nNo. 1 making no comment, all the rest would bend to their oars and\ncome on, now; and as fast as they came the clerk would heave over\nneat bundles of religious tracts, tied to shingles. The amount of hard\nswearing which twelve packages of religious literature will command when\nimpartially divided up among twelve raftsmen's crews, who have pulled a\nheavy skiff two miles on a hot day to get them, is simply incredible.\n\nAs I have said, the big rise brought a new world under my vision. By the\ntime the river was over its banks we had forsaken our old paths and were\nhourly climbing over bars that had stood ten feet out of water before;\nwe were shaving stumpy shores, like that at the foot of Madrid Bend,\nwhich I had always seen avoided before; we were clattering through\nchutes like that of 82, where the opening at the foot was an unbroken\nwall of timber till our nose was almost at the very spot. Some of these\nchutes were utter solitudes. The dense, untouched forest overhung both\nbanks of the crooked little crack, and one could believe that human\ncreatures had never intruded there before. The swinging grape-vines, the\ngrassy nooks and vistas glimpsed as we swept by, the flowering creepers\nwaving their red blossoms from the tops of dead trunks, and all the\nspendthrift richness of the forest foliage, were wasted and thrown away\nthere. The chutes were lovely places to steer in; they were deep, except\nat the head; the current was gentle; under the 'points' the water was\nabsolutely dead, and the invisible banks so bluff that where the tender\nwillow thickets projected you could bury your boat's broadside in them\nas you tore along, and then you seemed fairly to fly.\n\nBehind other islands we found wretched little farms, and wretcheder\nlittle log-cabins; there were crazy rail fences sticking a foot or two\nabove the water, with one or two jeans-clad, chills-racked, yellow-faced\nmale miserables roosting on the top-rail, elbows on knees, jaws in\nhands, grinding tobacco and discharging the result at floating chips\nthrough crevices left by lost teeth; while the rest of the family and\nthe few farm-animals were huddled together in an empty wood-flat riding\nat her moorings close at hand. In this flat-boat the family would have\nto cook and eat and sleep for a lesser or greater number of days (or\npossibly weeks), until the river should fall two or three feet and let\nthem get back to their log-cabin and their chills again--chills being\na merciful provision of an all-wise Providence to enable them to take\nexercise without exertion. And this sort of watery camping out was a\nthing which these people were rather liable to be treated to a couple\nof times a year: by the December rise out of the Ohio, and the June rise\nout of the Mississippi. And yet these were kindly dispensations, for\nthey at least enabled the poor things to rise from the dead now and\nthen, and look upon life when a steamboat went by. They appreciated the\nblessing, too, for they spread their mouths and eyes wide open and made\nthe most of these occasions. Now what _could _these banished creatures\nfind to do to keep from dying of the blues during the low-water season!\n\nOnce, in one of these lovely island chutes, we found our course\ncompletely bridged by a great fallen tree. This will serve to show how\nnarrow some of the chutes were. The passengers had an hour's recreation\nin a virgin wilderness, while the boat-hands chopped the bridge away;\nfor there was no such thing as turning back, you comprehend.\n\nFrom Cairo to Baton Rouge, when the river is over its banks, you have\nno particular trouble in the night, for the thousand-mile wall of dense\nforest that guards the two banks all the way is only gapped with a farm\nor wood-yard opening at intervals, and so you can't 'get out of the\nriver' much easier than you could get out of a fenced lane; but from\nBaton Rouge to New Orleans it is a different matter. The river is more\nthan a mile wide, and very deep--as much as two hundred feet, in places.\nBoth banks, for a good deal over a hundred miles, are shorn of their\ntimber and bordered by continuous sugar plantations, with only here and\nthere a scattering sapling or row of ornamental China-trees. The timber\nis shorn off clear to the rear of the plantations, from two to four\nmiles. When the first frost threatens to come, the planters snatch off\ntheir crops in a hurry. When they have finished grinding the cane, they\nform the refuse of the stalks (which they call _bagasse_) into great\npiles and set fire to them, though in other sugar countries the bagasse\nis used for fuel in the furnaces of the sugar mills. Now the piles of\ndamp bagasse burn slowly, and smoke like Satan's own kitchen.\n\nAn embankment ten or fifteen feet high guards both banks of the\nMississippi all the way down that lower end of the river, and this\nembankment is set back from the edge of the shore from ten to perhaps a\nhundred feet, according to circumstances; say thirty or forty feet, as\na general thing. Fill that whole region with an impenetrable gloom of\nsmoke from a hundred miles of burning bagasse piles, when the river is\nover the banks, and turn a steamboat loose along there at midnight and\nsee how she will feel. And see how you will feel, too! You find yourself\naway out in the midst of a vague dim sea that is shoreless, that fades\nout and loses itself in the murky distances; for you cannot discern\nthe thin rib of embankment, and you are always imagining you see\na straggling tree when you don't. The plantations themselves are\ntransformed by the smoke, and look like a part of the sea. All through\nyour watch you are tortured with the exquisite misery of uncertainty.\nYou hope you are keeping in the river, but you do not know. All that you\nare sure about is that you are likely to be within six feet of the bank\nand destruction, when you think you are a good half-mile from shore. And\nyou are sure, also, that if you chance suddenly to fetch up against the\nembankment and topple your chimneys overboard, you will have the small\ncomfort of knowing that it is about what you were expecting to do. One\nof the great Vicksburg packets darted out into a sugar plantation one\nnight, at such a time, and had to stay there a week. But there was no\nnovelty about it; it had often been done before.\n\nI thought I had finished this chapter, but I wish to add a curious\nthing, while it is in my mind. It is only relevant in that it is\nconnected with piloting. There used to be an excellent pilot on the\nriver, a Mr. X., who was a somnambulist. It was said that if his mind\nwas troubled about a bad piece of river, he was pretty sure to get up\nand walk in his sleep and do strange things. He was once fellow-pilot\nfor a trip or two with George Ealer, on a great New Orleans passenger\npacket. During a considerable part of the first trip George was uneasy,\nbut got over it by and by, as X. seemed content to stay in his bed when\nasleep. Late one night the boat was approaching Helena, Arkansas; the\nwater was low, and the crossing above the town in a very blind and\ntangled condition. X. had seen the crossing since Ealer had, and as the\nnight was particularly drizzly, sullen, and dark, Ealer was considering\nwhether he had not better have X. called to assist in running the place,\nwhen the door opened and X. walked in. Now on very dark nights, light is\na deadly enemy to piloting; you are aware that if you stand in a lighted\nroom, on such a night, you cannot see things in the street to any\npurpose; but if you put out the lights and stand in the gloom you can\nmake out objects in the street pretty well. So, on very dark nights,\npilots do not smoke; they allow no fire in the pilot-house stove if\nthere is a crack which can allow the least ray to escape; they order the\nfurnaces to be curtained with huge tarpaulins and the sky-lights to\nbe closely blinded. Then no light whatever issues from the boat. The\nundefinable shape that now entered the pilot-house had Mr. X.'s voice.\nThis said--\n\n'Let me take her, George; I've seen this place since you have, and it\nis so crooked that I reckon I can run it myself easier than I could tell\nyou how to do it.'\n\n'It is kind of you, and I swear _I_ am willing. I haven't got another\ndrop of perspiration left in me. I have been spinning around and around\nthe wheel like a squirrel. It is so dark I can't tell which way she is\nswinging till she is coming around like a whirligig.'\n\nSo Ealer took a seat on the bench, panting and breathless. The black\nphantom assumed the wheel without saying anything, steadied the waltzing\nsteamer with a turn or two, and then stood at ease, coaxing her a little\nto this side and then to that, as gently and as sweetly as if the time\nhad been noonday. When Ealer observed this marvel of steering, he wished\nhe had not confessed! He stared, and wondered, and finally said--\n\n'Well, I thought I knew how to steer a steamboat, but that was another\nmistake of mine.'\n\nX. said nothing, but went serenely on with his work. He rang for the\nleads; he rang to slow down the steam; he worked the boat carefully and\nneatly into invisible marks, then stood at the center of the wheel\nand peered blandly out into the blackness, fore and aft, to verify his\nposition; as the leads shoaled more and more, he stopped the engines\nentirely, and the dead silence and suspense of 'drifting' followed when\nthe shoalest water was struck, he cracked on the steam, carried her\nhandsomely over, and then began to work her warily into the next system\nof shoal marks; the same patient, heedful use of leads and engines\nfollowed, the boat slipped through without touching bottom, and entered\nupon the third and last intricacy of the crossing; imperceptibly\nshe moved through the gloom, crept by inches into her marks, drifted\ntediously till the shoalest water was cried, and then, under a\ntremendous head of steam, went swinging over the reef and away into deep\nwater and safety!\n\nEaler let his long-pent breath pour out in a great, relieving sigh, and\nsaid--\n\n'That's the sweetest piece of piloting that was ever done on the\nMississippi River! I wouldn't believed it could be done, if I hadn't\nseen it.'\n\nThere was no reply, and he added--\n\n'Just hold her five minutes longer, partner, and let me run down and get\na cup of coffee.'\n\nA minute later Ealer was biting into a pie, down in the 'texas,' and\ncomforting himself with coffee. Just then the night watchman happened\nin, and was about to happen out again, when he noticed Ealer and\nexclaimed--\n\n'Who is at the wheel, sir?'\n\n'X.'\n\n'Dart for the pilot-house, quicker than lightning!'\n\nThe next moment both men were flying up the pilot-house companion way,\nthree steps at a jump! Nobody there! The great steamer was whistling\ndown the middle of the river at her own sweet will! The watchman shot\nout of the place again; Ealer seized the wheel, set an engine back with\npower, and held his breath while the boat reluctantly swung away from\na 'towhead' which she was about to knock into the middle of the Gulf of\nMexico!\n\nBy and by the watchman came back and said--\n\n'Didn't that lunatic tell you he was asleep, when he first came up\nhere?'\n\n'_No_.'\n\n'Well, he was. I found him walking along on top of the railings just as\nunconcerned as another man would walk a pavement; and I put him to bed;\nnow just this minute there he was again, away astern, going through that\nsort of tight-rope deviltry the same as before.'\n\n'Well, I think I'll stay by, next time he has one of those fits. But I\nhope he'll have them often. You just ought to have seen him take this\nboat through Helena crossing. I never saw anything so gaudy before. And\nif he can do such gold-leaf, kid-glove, diamond-breastpin piloting when\nhe is sound asleep, what _couldn't_ he do if he was dead!'\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 12\n\nSounding\n\nWHEN the river is very low, and one's steamboat is 'drawing all the\nwater' there is in the channel,--or a few inches more, as was often\nthe case in the old times,--one must be painfully circumspect in his\npiloting. We used to have to 'sound' a number of particularly bad places\nalmost every trip when the river was at a very low stage.\n\nSounding is done in this way. The boat ties up at the shore, just above\nthe shoal crossing; the pilot not on watch takes his 'cub' or steersman\nand a picked crew of men (sometimes an officer also), and goes out in\nthe yawl--provided the boat has not that rare and sumptuous luxury, a\nregularly-devised 'sounding-boat'--and proceeds to hunt for the best\nwater, the pilot on duty watching his movements through a spy-glass,\nmeantime, and in some instances assisting by signals of the boat's\nwhistle, signifying 'try higher up' or 'try lower down;' for the surface\nof the water, like an oil-painting, is more expressive and intelligible\nwhen inspected from a little distance than very close at hand. The\nwhistle signals are seldom necessary, however; never, perhaps, except\nwhen the wind confuses the significant ripples upon the water's surface.\nWhen the yawl has reached the shoal place, the speed is slackened, the\npilot begins to sound the depth with a pole ten or twelve feet long,\nand the steersman at the tiller obeys the order to 'hold her up to\nstarboard;' or, 'let her fall off to larboard;'{footnote [The term\n'larboard' is never used at sea now, to signify the left hand; but was\nalways used on the river in my time]} or 'steady--steady as you go.'\n\nWhen the measurements indicate that the yawl is approaching the shoalest\npart of the reef, the command is given to 'ease all!' Then the men stop\nrowing and the yawl drifts with the current. The next order is, 'Stand\nby with the buoy!' The moment the shallowest point is reached, the pilot\ndelivers the order, 'Let go the buoy!' and over she goes. If the pilot\nis not satisfied, he sounds the place again; if he finds better water\nhigher up or lower down, he removes the buoy to that place. Being\nfinally satisfied, he gives the order, and all the men stand their\noars straight up in the air, in line; a blast from the boat's whistle\nindicates that the signal has been seen; then the men 'give way' on\ntheir oars and lay the yawl alongside the buoy; the steamer comes\ncreeping carefully down, is pointed straight at the buoy, husbands her\npower for the coming struggle, and presently, at the critical moment,\nturns on all her steam and goes grinding and wallowing over the buoy and\nthe sand, and gains the deep water beyond. Or maybe she doesn't; maybe\nshe 'strikes and swings.' Then she has to while away several hours (or\ndays) sparring herself off.\n\nSometimes a buoy is not laid at all, but the yawl goes ahead, hunting\nthe best water, and the steamer follows along in its wake. Often there\nis a deal of fun and excitement about sounding, especially if it is a\nglorious summer day, or a blustering night. But in winter the cold and\nthe peril take most of the fun out of it.\n\nA buoy is nothing but a board four or five feet long, with one end\nturned up; it is a reversed school-house bench, with one of the supports\nleft and the other removed. It is anchored on the shoalest part of the\nreef by a rope with a heavy stone made fast to the end of it. But for\nthe resistance of the turned-up end of the reversed bench, the current\nwould pull the buoy under water. At night, a paper lantern with a candle\nin it is fastened on top of the buoy, and this can be seen a mile or\nmore, a little glimmering spark in the waste of blackness.\n\nNothing delights a cub so much as an opportunity to go out sounding.\nThere is such an air of adventure about it; often there is danger; it is\nso gaudy and man-of-war-like to sit up in the stern-sheets and steer\na swift yawl; there is something fine about the exultant spring of the\nboat when an experienced old sailor crew throw their souls into the\noars; it is lovely to see the white foam stream away from the bows;\nthere is music in the rush of the water; it is deliciously exhilarating,\nin summer, to go speeding over the breezy expanses of the river when the\nworld of wavelets is dancing in the sun. It is such grandeur, too, to\nthe cub, to get a chance to give an order; for often the pilot will\nsimply say, 'Let her go about!' and leave the rest to the cub, who\ninstantly cries, in his sternest tone of command, 'Ease starboard!\nStrong on the larboard! Starboard give way! With a will, men!' The cub\nenjoys sounding for the further reason that the eyes of the passengers\nare watching all the yawl's movements with absorbing interest if the\ntime be daylight; and if it be night he knows that those same wondering\neyes are fastened upon the yawl's lantern as it glides out into the\ngloom and dims away in the remote distance.\n\nOne trip a pretty girl of sixteen spent her time in our pilot-house with\nher uncle and aunt, every day and all day long. I fell in love with her.\nSo did Mr. Thornburg's cub, Tom G----. Tom and I had been bosom friends\nuntil this time; but now a coolness began to arise. I told the girl a\ngood many of my river adventures, and made myself out a good deal of a\nhero; Tom tried to make himself appear to be a hero, too, and succeeded\nto some extent, but then he always had a way of embroidering. However,\nvirtue is its own reward, so I was a barely perceptible trifle ahead\nin the contest. About this time something happened which promised\nhandsomely for me: the pilots decided to sound the crossing at the head\nof 21. This would occur about nine or ten o'clock at night, when\nthe passengers would be still up; it would be Mr. Thornburg's watch,\ntherefore my chief would have to do the sounding. We had a perfect love\nof a sounding-boat--long, trim, graceful, and as fleet as a greyhound;\nher thwarts were cushioned; she carried twelve oarsmen; one of the mates\nwas always sent in her to transmit orders to her crew, for ours was a\nsteamer where no end of 'style' was put on.\n\nWe tied up at the shore above 21, and got ready. It was a foul night,\nand the river was so wide, there, that a landsman's uneducated eyes\ncould discern no opposite shore through such a gloom. The passengers\nwere alert and interested; everything was satisfactory. As I hurried\nthrough the engine-room, picturesquely gotten up in storm toggery, I met\nTom, and could not forbear delivering myself of a mean speech--\n\n'Ain't you glad _you _don't have to go out sounding?'\n\nTom was passing on, but he quickly turned, and said--\n\n'Now just for that, you can go and get the sounding-pole yourself. I was\ngoing after it, but I'd see you in Halifax, now, before I'd do it.'\n\n'Who wants you to get it? I don't. It's in the sounding-boat.'\n\n'It ain't, either. It's been new-painted; and it's been up on the\nladies' cabin guards two days, drying.'\n\nI flew back, and shortly arrived among the crowd of watching and\nwondering ladies just in time to hear the command:\n\n'Give way, men!'\n\nI looked over, and there was the gallant sounding-boat booming away, the\nunprincipled Tom presiding at the tiller, and my chief sitting by him\nwith the sounding-pole which I had been sent on a fool's errand to\nfetch. Then that young girl said to me--\n\n'Oh, how awful to have to go out in that little boat on such a night! Do\nyou think there is any danger?'\n\nI would rather have been stabbed. I went off, full of venom, to help in\nthe pilot-house. By and by the boat's lantern disappeared, and after an\ninterval a wee spark glimmered upon the face of the water a mile away.\nMr. Thornburg blew the whistle, in acknowledgment, backed the steamer\nout, and made for it. We flew along for a while, then slackened steam\nand went cautiously gliding toward the spark. Presently Mr. Thornburg\nexclaimed--\n\n'Hello, the buoy-lantern's out!'\n\nHe stopped the engines. A moment or two later he said--\n\n'Why, there it is again!'\n\nSo he came ahead on the engines once more, and rang for the leads.\nGradually the water shoaled up, and then began to deepen again! Mr.\nThornburg muttered--\n\n'Well, I don't understand this. I believe that buoy has drifted off the\nreef. Seems to be a little too far to the left. No matter, it is safest\nto run over it anyhow.'\n\nSo, in that solid world of darkness we went creeping down on the light.\nJust as our bows were in the act of plowing over it, Mr. Thornburg\nseized the bell-ropes, rang a startling peal, and exclaimed--\n\n'My soul, it's the sounding-boat!'\n\nA sudden chorus of wild alarms burst out far below--a pause--and then\nthe sound of grinding and crashing followed. Mr. Thornburg exclaimed--\n\n'There! the paddle-wheel has ground the sounding-boat to lucifer\nmatches! Run! See who is killed!'\n\nI was on the main deck in the twinkling of an eye. My chief and the\nthird mate and nearly all the men were safe. They had discovered their\ndanger when it was too late to pull out of the way; then, when the great\nguards overshadowed them a moment later, they were prepared and knew\nwhat to do; at my chiefs order they sprang at the right instant, seized\nthe guard, and were hauled aboard. The next moment the sounding-yawl\nswept aft to the wheel and was struck and splintered to atoms. Two of\nthe men and the cub Tom, were missing--a fact which spread like wildfire\nover the boat. The passengers came flocking to the forward gangway,\nladies and all, anxious-eyed, white-faced, and talked in awed voices of\nthe dreadful thing. And often and again I heard them say, 'Poor fellows!\npoor boy, poor boy!'\n\nBy this time the boat's yawl was manned and away, to search for the\nmissing. Now a faint call was heard, off to the left. The yawl had\ndisappeared in the other direction. Half the people rushed to one side\nto encourage the swimmer with their shouts; the other half rushed the\nother way to shriek to the yawl to turn about. By the callings,\nthe swimmer was approaching, but some said the sound showed failing\nstrength. The crowd massed themselves against the boiler-deck railings,\nleaning over and staring into the gloom; and every faint and fainter cry\nwrung from them such words as, 'Ah, poor fellow, poor fellow! is there\nno way to save him?'\n\nBut still the cries held out, and drew nearer, and presently the voice\nsaid pluckily--\n\n'I can make it! Stand by with a rope!'\n\nWhat a rousing cheer they gave him! The chief mate took his stand in the\nglare of a torch-basket, a coil of rope in his hand, and his men grouped\nabout him. The next moment the swimmer's face appeared in the circle of\nlight, and in another one the owner of it was hauled aboard, limp and\ndrenched, while cheer on cheer went up. It was that devil Tom.\n\nThe yawl crew searched everywhere, but found no sign of the two men.\nThey probably failed to catch the guard, tumbled back, and were struck\nby the wheel and killed. Tom had never jumped for the guard at all, but\nhad plunged head-first into the river and dived under the wheel. It was\nnothing; I could have done it easy enough, and I said so; but everybody\nwent on just the same, making a wonderful to do over that ass, as if he\nhad done something great. That girl couldn't seem to have enough of that\npitiful 'hero' the rest of the trip; but little I cared; I loathed her,\nany way.\n\nThe way we came to mistake the sounding-boat's lantern for the\nbuoy-light was this. My chief said that after laying the buoy he fell\naway and watched it till it seemed to be secure; then he took up a\nposition a hundred yards below it and a little to one side of the\nsteamer's course, headed the sounding-boat up-stream, and waited. Having\nto wait some time, he and the officer got to talking; he looked up when\nhe judged that the steamer was about on the reef; saw that the buoy was\ngone, but supposed that the steamer had already run over it; he went\non with his talk; he noticed that the steamer was getting very close on\nhim, but that was the correct thing; it was her business to shave him\nclosely, for convenience in taking him aboard; he was expecting her to\nsheer off, until the last moment; then it flashed upon him that she was\ntrying to run him down, mistaking his lantern for the buoy-light; so he\nsang out, 'Stand by to spring for the guard, men!' and the next instant\nthe jump was made.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 13\n\nA Pilot's Needs\n\nBUT I am wandering from what I was intending to do, that is, make\nplainer than perhaps appears in the previous chapters, some of the\npeculiar requirements of the science of piloting. First of all, there\nis one faculty which a pilot must incessantly cultivate until he has\nbrought it to absolute perfection. Nothing short of perfection will do.\nThat faculty is memory. He cannot stop with merely thinking a thing is\nso and so; he must know it; for this is eminently one of the 'exact'\nsciences. With what scorn a pilot was looked upon, in the old times, if\nhe ever ventured to deal in that feeble phrase 'I think,' instead of the\nvigorous one 'I know!' One cannot easily realize what a tremendous thing\nit is to know every trivial detail of twelve hundred miles of river and\nknow it with absolute exactness. If you will take the longest street\nin New York, and travel up and down it, conning its features patiently\nuntil you know every house and window and door and lamp-post and big and\nlittle sign by heart, and know them so accurately that you can instantly\nname the one you are abreast of when you are set down at random in\nthat street in the middle of an inky black night, you will then have a\ntolerable notion of the amount and the exactness of a pilot's knowledge\nwho carries the Mississippi River in his head. And then if you will\ngo on until you know every street crossing, the character, size, and\nposition of the crossing-stones, and the varying depth of mud in each of\nthose numberless places, you will have some idea of what the pilot must\nknow in order to keep a Mississippi steamer out of trouble. Next, if\nyou will take half of the signs in that long street, and _change their\nplaces_ once a month, and still manage to know their new positions\naccurately on dark nights, and keep up with these repeated changes\nwithout making any mistakes, you will understand what is required of a\npilot's peerless memory by the fickle Mississippi.\n\nI think a pilot's memory is about the most wonderful thing in the world.\nTo know the Old and New Testaments by heart, and be able to recite them\nglibly, forward or backward, or begin at random anywhere in the book\nand recite both ways and never trip or make a mistake, is no extravagant\nmass of knowledge, and no marvelous facility, compared to a pilot's\nmassed knowledge of the Mississippi and his marvelous facility in the\nhandling of it. I make this comparison deliberately, and believe I am\nnot expanding the truth when I do it. Many will think my figure too\nstrong, but pilots will not.\n\nAnd how easily and comfortably the pilot's memory does its work; how\nplacidly effortless is its way; how _unconsciously _it lays up its vast\nstores, hour by hour, day by day, and never loses or mislays a single\nvaluable package of them all! Take an instance. Let a leadsman cry,\n'Half twain! half twain! half twain! half twain! half twain!' until\nit become as monotonous as the ticking of a clock; let conversation be\ngoing on all the time, and the pilot be doing his share of the talking,\nand no longer consciously listening to the leadsman; and in the midst\nof this endless string of half twains let a single 'quarter twain!' be\ninterjected, without emphasis, and then the half twain cry go on again,\njust as before: two or three weeks later that pilot can describe with\nprecision the boat's position in the river when that quarter twain\nwas uttered, and give you such a lot of head-marks, stern-marks, and\nside-marks to guide you, that you ought to be able to take the boat\nthere and put her in that same spot again yourself! The cry of 'quarter\ntwain' did not really take his mind from his talk, but his trained\nfaculties instantly photographed the bearings, noted the change of\ndepth, and laid up the important details for future reference without\nrequiring any assistance from him in the matter. If you were walking\nand talking with a friend, and another friend at your side kept up a\nmonotonous repetition of the vowel sound A, for a couple of blocks, and\nthen in the midst interjected an R, thus, A, A, A, A, A, R, A, A, A,\netc., and gave the R no emphasis, you would not be able to state, two or\nthree weeks afterward, that the R had been put in, nor be able to tell\nwhat objects you were passing at the moment it was done. But you could\nif your memory had been patiently and laboriously trained to do that\nsort of thing mechanically.\n\nGive a man a tolerably fair memory to start with, and piloting will\ndevelop it into a very colossus of capability. But _only in the matters\nit is daily drilled in_. A time would come when the man's faculties\ncould not help noticing landmarks and soundings, and his memory could\nnot help holding on to them with the grip of a vise; but if you asked\nthat same man at noon what he had had for breakfast, it would be ten\nchances to one that he could not tell you. Astonishing things can be\ndone with the human memory if you will devote it faithfully to one\nparticular line of business.\n\nAt the time that wages soared so high on the Missouri River, my chief,\nMr. Bixby, went up there and learned more than a thousand miles of that\nstream with an ease and rapidity that were astonishing. When he had seen\neach division once in the daytime and once at night, his education was\nso nearly complete that he took out a 'daylight' license; a few\ntrips later he took out a full license, and went to piloting day and\nnight--and he ranked A 1, too.\n\nMr. Bixby placed me as steersman for a while under a pilot whose feats\nof memory were a constant marvel to me. However, his memory was born in\nhim, I think, not built. For instance, somebody would mention a name.\nInstantly Mr. Brown would break in--\n\n'Oh, I knew _him_. Sallow-faced, red-headed fellow, with a little scar\non the side of his throat, like a splinter under the flesh. He was only\nin the Southern trade six months. That was thirteen years ago. I made a\ntrip with him. There was five feet in the upper river then; the “Henry\nBlake” grounded at the foot of Tower Island drawing four and a half; the\n“George Elliott” unshipped her rudder on the wreck of the “Sunflower”--'\n\n'Why, the “Sunflower” didn't sink until--'\n\n'I know when she sunk; it was three years before that, on the 2nd of\nDecember; Asa Hardy was captain of her, and his brother John was first\nclerk; and it was his first trip in her, too; Tom Jones told me these\nthings a week afterward in New Orleans; he was first mate of the\n“Sunflower.” Captain Hardy stuck a nail in his foot the 6th of July of\nthe next year, and died of the lockjaw on the 15th. His brother died\ntwo years after 3rd of March,--erysipelas. I never saw either of the\nHardys,--they were Alleghany River men,--but people who knew them told\nme all these things. And they said Captain Hardy wore yarn socks winter\nand summer just the same, and his first wife's name was Jane Shook--she\nwas from New England--and his second one died in a lunatic asylum. It\nwas in the blood. She was from Lexington, Kentucky. Name was Horton\nbefore she was married.'\n\nAnd so on, by the hour, the man's tongue would go. He could _not _forget\nany thing. It was simply impossible. The most trivial details remained\nas distinct and luminous in his head, after they had lain there for\nyears, as the most memorable events. His was not simply a pilot's\nmemory; its grasp was universal. If he were talking about a trifling\nletter he had received seven years before, he was pretty sure to deliver\nyou the entire screed from memory. And then without observing that he\nwas departing from the true line of his talk, he was more than likely\nto hurl in a long-drawn parenthetical biography of the writer of that\nletter; and you were lucky indeed if he did not take up that writer's\nrelatives, one by one, and give you their biographies, too.\n\nSuch a memory as that is a great misfortune. To it, all occurrences\nare of the same size. Its possessor cannot distinguish an interesting\ncircumstance from an uninteresting one. As a talker, he is bound to clog\nhis narrative with tiresome details and make himself an insufferable\nbore. Moreover, he cannot stick to his subject. He picks up every little\ngrain of memory he discerns in his way, and so is led aside. Mr. Brown\nwould start out with the honest intention of telling you a vastly funny\nanecdote about a dog. He would be 'so full of laugh' that he could\nhardly begin; then his memory would start with the dog's breed and\npersonal appearance; drift into a history of his owner; of his owner's\nfamily, with descriptions of weddings and burials that had occurred in\nit, together with recitals of congratulatory verses and obituary poetry\nprovoked by the same: then this memory would recollect that one of these\nevents occurred during the celebrated 'hard winter' of such and such a\nyear, and a minute description of that winter would follow, along with\nthe names of people who were frozen to death, and statistics showing the\nhigh figures which pork and hay went up to. Pork and hay would suggest\ncorn and fodder; corn and fodder would suggest cows and horses; cows and\nhorses would suggest the circus and certain celebrated bare-back riders;\nthe transition from the circus to the menagerie was easy and natural;\nfrom the elephant to equatorial Africa was but a step; then of course\nthe heathen savages would suggest religion; and at the end of three or\nfour hours' tedious jaw, the watch would change, and Brown would go out\nof the pilot-house muttering extracts from sermons he had heard years\nbefore about the efficacy of prayer as a means of grace. And the\noriginal first mention would be all you had learned about that dog,\nafter all this waiting and hungering.\n\nA pilot must have a memory; but there are two higher qualities which he\nmust also have. He must have good and quick judgment and decision, and a\ncool, calm courage that no peril can shake. Give a man the merest trifle\nof pluck to start with, and by the time he has become a pilot he cannot\nbe unmanned by any danger a steamboat can get into; but one cannot quite\nsay the same for judgment. Judgment is a matter of brains, and a man\nmust _start _with a good stock of that article or he will never succeed\nas a pilot.\n\nThe growth of courage in the pilot-house is steady all the time, but it\ndoes not reach a high and satisfactory condition until some time after\nthe young pilot has been 'standing his own watch,' alone and under\nthe staggering weight of all the responsibilities connected with the\nposition. When an apprentice has become pretty thoroughly acquainted\nwith the river, he goes clattering along so fearlessly with his\nsteamboat, night or day, that he presently begins to imagine that it is\n_his _courage that animates him; but the first time the pilot steps out\nand leaves him to his own devices he finds out it was the other man's.\nHe discovers that the article has been left out of his own cargo\naltogether. The whole river is bristling with exigencies in a moment;\nhe is not prepared for them; he does not know how to meet them; all his\nknowledge forsakes him; and within fifteen minutes he is as white as a\nsheet and scared almost to death. Therefore pilots wisely train these\ncubs by various strategic tricks to look danger in the face a little\nmore calmly. A favorite way of theirs is to play a friendly swindle upon\nthe candidate.\n\nMr. Bixby served me in this fashion once, and for years afterward I\nused to blush even in my sleep when I thought of it. I had become a good\nsteersman; so good, indeed, that I had all the work to do on our watch,\nnight and day; Mr. Bixby seldom made a suggestion to me; all he ever did\nwas to take the wheel on particularly bad nights or in particularly bad\ncrossings, land the boat when she needed to be landed, play gentleman of\nleisure nine-tenths of the watch, and collect the wages. The lower river\nwas about bank-full, and if anybody had questioned my ability to run any\ncrossing between Cairo and New Orleans without help or instruction,\nI should have felt irreparably hurt. The idea of being afraid of any\ncrossing in the lot, in the _day-time_, was a thing too preposterous for\ncontemplation. Well, one matchless summer's day I was bowling down the\nbend above island 66, brimful of self-conceit and carrying my nose as\nhigh as a giraffe's, when Mr. Bixby said--\n\n'I am going below a while. I suppose you know the next crossing?'\n\nThis was almost an affront. It was about the plainest and simplest\ncrossing in the whole river. One couldn't come to any harm, whether he\nran it right or not; and as for depth, there never had been any bottom\nthere. I knew all this, perfectly well.\n\n'Know how to _run _it? Why, I can run it with my eyes shut.'\n\n'How much water is there in it?'\n\n'Well, that is an odd question. I couldn't get bottom there with a\nchurch steeple.'\n\n'You think so, do you?'\n\nThe very tone of the question shook my confidence. That was what Mr.\nBixby was expecting. He left, without saying anything more. I began to\nimagine all sorts of things. Mr. Bixby, unknown to me, of course, sent\nsomebody down to the forecastle with some mysterious instructions to the\nleadsmen, another messenger was sent to whisper among the officers,\nand then Mr. Bixby went into hiding behind a smoke-stack where he could\nobserve results. Presently the captain stepped out on the hurricane\ndeck; next the chief mate appeared; then a clerk. Every moment or two a\nstraggler was added to my audience; and before I got to the head of\nthe island I had fifteen or twenty people assembled down there under my\nnose. I began to wonder what the trouble was. As I started across, the\ncaptain glanced aloft at me and said, with a sham uneasiness in his\nvoice--\n\n'Where is Mr. Bixby?'\n\n'Gone below, sir.'\n\nBut that did the business for me. My imagination began to construct\ndangers out of nothing, and they multiplied faster than I could keep the\nrun of them. All at once I imagined I saw shoal water ahead! The wave\nof coward agony that surged through me then came near dislocating every\njoint in me. All my confidence in that crossing vanished. I seized the\nbell-rope; dropped it, ashamed; seized it again; dropped it once more;\nclutched it tremblingly one again, and pulled it so feebly that I could\nhardly hear the stroke myself. Captain and mate sang out instantly, and\nboth together--\n\n'Starboard lead there! and quick about it!'\n\nThis was another shock. I began to climb the wheel like a squirrel;\nbut I would hardly get the boat started to port before I would see new\ndangers on that side, and away I would spin to the other; only to find\nperils accumulating to starboard, and be crazy to get to port again.\nThen came the leadsman's sepulchral cry--\n\n'D-e-e-p four!'\n\nDeep four in a bottomless crossing! The terror of it took my breath\naway.\n\n'M-a-r-k three!... M-a-r-k three... Quarter less three!... Half twain!'\n\nThis was frightful! I seized the bell-ropes and stopped the engines.\n\n'Quarter twain! Quarter twain! _Mark _twain!'\n\nI was helpless. I did not know what in the world to do. I was quaking\nfrom head to foot, and I could have hung my hat on my eyes, they stuck\nout so far.\n\n'Quarter _less _twain! Nine and a _half_!'\n\nWe were _drawing _nine! My hands were in a nerveless flutter. I could\nnot ring a bell intelligibly with them. I flew to the speaking-tube and\nshouted to the engineer--\n\n'Oh, Ben, if you love me, _back _her! Quick, Ben! Oh, back the immortal\n_soul_ out of her!'\n\nI heard the door close gently. I looked around, and there stood Mr.\nBixby, smiling a bland, sweet smile. Then the audience on the hurricane\ndeck sent up a thundergust of humiliating laughter. I saw it all, now,\nand I felt meaner than the meanest man in human history. I laid in the\nlead, set the boat in her marks, came ahead on the engines, and said--\n\n'It was a fine trick to play on an orphan, _wasn't_ it? I suppose I'll\nnever hear the last of how I was ass enough to heave the lead at the\nhead of 66.'\n\n'Well, no, you won't, maybe. In fact I hope you won't; for I want you\nto learn something by that experience. Didn't you _know _there was no\nbottom in that crossing?'\n\n'Yes, sir, I did.'\n\n'Very well, then. You shouldn't have allowed me or anybody else to shake\nyour confidence in that knowledge. Try to remember that. And another\nthing: when you get into a dangerous place, don't turn coward. That\nisn't going to help matters any.'\n\nIt was a good enough lesson, but pretty hardly learned. Yet about the\nhardest part of it was that for months I so often had to hear a phrase\nwhich I had conceived a particular distaste for. It was, 'Oh, Ben, if\nyou love me, back her!'\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 14\n\nRank and Dignity of Piloting\n\nIN my preceding chapters I have tried, by going into the minutiae of the\nscience of piloting, to carry the reader step by step to a comprehension\nof what the science consists of; and at the same time I have tried to\nshow him that it is a very curious and wonderful science, too, and very\nworthy of his attention. If I have seemed to love my subject, it is no\nsurprising thing, for I loved the profession far better than any I have\nfollowed since, and I took a measureless pride in it. The reason is\nplain: a pilot, in those days, was the only unfettered and entirely\nindependent human being that lived in the earth. Kings are but the\nhampered servants of parliament and people; parliaments sit in chains\nforged by their constituency; the editor of a newspaper cannot be\nindependent, but must work with one hand tied behind him by party and\npatrons, and be content to utter only half or two-thirds of his mind; no\nclergyman is a free man and may speak the whole truth, regardless of\nhis parish's opinions; writers of all kinds are manacled servants of the\npublic. We write frankly and fearlessly, but then we 'modify' before we\nprint. In truth, every man and woman and child has a master, and worries\nand frets in servitude; but in the day I write of, the Mississippi pilot\nhad none. The captain could stand upon the hurricane deck, in the pomp\nof a very brief authority, and give him five or six orders while the\nvessel backed into the stream, and then that skipper's reign was over.\n\nThe moment that the boat was under way in the river, she was under the\nsole and unquestioned control of the pilot. He could do with her exactly\nas he pleased, run her when and whither he chose, and tie her up to the\nbank whenever his judgment said that that course was best. His movements\nwere entirely free; he consulted no one, he received commands from\nnobody, he promptly resented even the merest suggestions. Indeed,\nthe law of the United States forbade him to listen to commands or\nsuggestions, rightly considering that the pilot necessarily knew better\nhow to handle the boat than anybody could tell him. So here was the\nnovelty of a king without a keeper, an absolute monarch who was absolute\nin sober truth and not by a fiction of words. I have seen a boy of\neighteen taking a great steamer serenely into what seemed almost certain\ndestruction, and the aged captain standing mutely by, filled with\napprehension but powerless to interfere. His interference, in that\nparticular instance, might have been an excellent thing, but to permit\nit would have been to establish a most pernicious precedent. It will\neasily be guessed, considering the pilot's boundless authority, that he\nwas a great personage in the old steamboating days. He was treated with\nmarked courtesy by the captain and with marked deference by all\nthe officers and servants; and this deferential spirit was quickly\ncommunicated to the passengers, too. I think pilots were about the only\npeople I ever knew who failed to show, in some degree, embarrassment in\nthe presence of traveling foreign princes. But then, people in one's own\ngrade of life are not usually embarrassing objects.\n\nBy long habit, pilots came to put all their wishes in the form of\ncommands. It 'gravels' me, to this day, to put my will in the weak shape\nof a request, instead of launching it in the crisp language of an order.\nIn those old days, to load a steamboat at St. Louis, take her to New\nOrleans and back, and discharge cargo, consumed about twenty-five\ndays, on an average. Seven or eight of these days the boat spent at the\nwharves of St. Louis and New Orleans, and every soul on board was hard\nat work, except the two pilots; they did nothing but play gentleman up\ntown, and receive the same wages for it as if they had been on duty. The\nmoment the boat touched the wharf at either city, they were ashore; and\nthey were not likely to be seen again till the last bell was ringing and\neverything in readiness for another voyage.\n\nWhen a captain got hold of a pilot of particularly high reputation, he\ntook pains to keep him. When wages were four hundred dollars a month on\nthe Upper Mississippi, I have known a captain to keep such a pilot in\nidleness, under full pay, three months at a time, while the river was\nfrozen up. And one must remember that in those cheap times four hundred\ndollars was a salary of almost inconceivable splendor. Few men on shore\ngot such pay as that, and when they did they were mightily looked up\nto. When pilots from either end of the river wandered into our small\nMissouri village, they were sought by the best and the fairest, and\ntreated with exalted respect. Lying in port under wages was a thing\nwhich many pilots greatly enjoyed and appreciated; especially if they\nbelonged in the Missouri River in the heyday of that trade (Kansas\ntimes), and got nine hundred dollars a trip, which was equivalent to\nabout eighteen hundred dollars a month. Here is a conversation of that\nday. A chap out of the Illinois River, with a little stern-wheel tub,\naccosts a couple of ornate and gilded Missouri River pilots--\n\n'Gentlemen, I've got a pretty good trip for the upcountry, and shall\nwant you about a month. How much will it be?'\n\n'Eighteen hundred dollars apiece.'\n\n'Heavens and earth! You take my boat, let me have your wages, and I'll\ndivide!'\n\nI will remark, in passing, that Mississippi steamboatmen were important\nin landsmen's eyes (and in their own, too, in a degree) according to the\ndignity of the boat they were on. For instance, it was a proud thing to\nbe of the crew of such stately craft as the 'Aleck Scott' or the 'Grand\nTurk.' Negro firemen, deck hands, and barbers belonging to those boats\nwere distinguished personages in their grade of life, and they were well\naware of that fact too. A stalwart darkey once gave offense at a negro\nball in New Orleans by putting on a good many airs. Finally one of the\nmanagers bustled up to him and said--\n\n'Who _is_ you, any way? Who is you? dat's what I wants to know!'\n\nThe offender was not disconcerted in the least, but swelled himself\nup and threw that into his voice which showed that he knew he was not\nputting on all those airs on a stinted capital.\n\n'Who _is_ I? Who _is _I? I let you know mighty quick who I is! I want\nyou niggers to understan' dat I fires de middle do'{footnote [Door]} on\nde “Aleck Scott!”'\n\nThat was sufficient.\n\nThe barber of the 'Grand Turk' was a spruce young negro, who aired his\nimportance with balmy complacency, and was greatly courted by the circle\nin which he moved. The young colored population of New Orleans were much\ngiven to flirting, at twilight, on the banquettes of the back streets.\nSomebody saw and heard something like the following, one evening, in\none of those localities. A middle-aged negro woman projected her head\nthrough a broken pane and shouted (very willing that the neighbors\nshould hear and envy), 'You Mary Ann, come in de house dis minute!\nStannin' out dah foolin' 'long wid dat low trash, an' heah's de barber\noffn de “Gran' Turk” wants to conwerse wid you!'\n\nMy reference, a moment ago, to the fact that a pilot's peculiar official\nposition placed him out of the reach of criticism or command, brings\nStephen W---- naturally to my mind. He was a gifted pilot, a good\nfellow, a tireless talker, and had both wit and humor in him. He had a\nmost irreverent independence, too, and was deliciously easy-going and\ncomfortable in the presence of age, official dignity, and even the most\naugust wealth. He always had work, he never saved a penny, he was a most\npersuasive borrower, he was in debt to every pilot on the river, and to\nthe majority of the captains. He could throw a sort of splendor around\na bit of harum-scarum, devil-may-care piloting, that made it almost\nfascinating--but not to everybody. He made a trip with good old Captain\nY----once, and was 'relieved' from duty when the boat got to New\nOrleans. Somebody expressed surprise at the discharge. Captain Y----\nshuddered at the mere mention of Stephen. Then his poor, thin old voice\npiped out something like this:--\n\n'Why, bless me! I wouldn't have such a wild creature on my boat for the\nworld--not for the whole world! He swears, he sings, he whistles, he\nyells--I never saw such an Injun to yell. All times of the night--it\nnever made any difference to him. He would just yell that way, not for\nanything in particular, but merely on account of a kind of devilish\ncomfort he got out of it. I never could get into a sound sleep but\nhe would fetch me out of bed, all in a cold sweat, with one of those\ndreadful war-whoops. A queer being--very queer being; no respect for\nanything or anybody. Sometimes he called me “Johnny.” And he kept a\nfiddle, and a cat. He played execrably. This seemed to distress the cat,\nand so the cat would howl. Nobody could sleep where that man--and his\nfamily--was. And reckless. There never was anything like it. Now you may\nbelieve it or not, but as sure as I am sitting here, he brought my boat\na-tilting down through those awful snags at Chicot under a rattling\nhead of steam, and the wind a-blowing like the very nation, at that! My\nofficers will tell you so. They saw it. And, sir, while he was a-tearing\nright down through those snags, and I a-shaking in my shoes and praying,\nI wish I may never speak again if he didn't pucker up his mouth and go\nto _whistling_! Yes, sir; whistling “Buffalo gals, can't you come out\ntonight, can't you come out to-night, can't you come out to-night;” and\ndoing it as calmly as if we were attending a funeral and weren't related\nto the corpse. And when I remonstrated with him about it, he smiled down\non me as if I was his child, and told me to run in the house and try to\nbe good, and not be meddling with my superiors!'\n\nOnce a pretty mean captain caught Stephen in New Orleans out of work\nand as usual out of money. He laid steady siege to Stephen, who was in\na very 'close place,' and finally persuaded him to hire with him at one\nhundred and twenty-five dollars per month, just half wages, the captain\nagreeing not to divulge the secret and so bring down the contempt of all\nthe guild upon the poor fellow. But the boat was not more than a day out\nof New Orleans before Stephen discovered that the captain was boasting\nof his exploit, and that all the officers had been told. Stephen winced,\nbut said nothing. About the middle of the afternoon the captain stepped\nout on the hurricane deck, cast his eye around, and looked a good deal\nsurprised. He glanced inquiringly aloft at Stephen, but Stephen was\nwhistling placidly, and attending to business. The captain stood around\na while in evident discomfort, and once or twice seemed about to make a\nsuggestion; but the etiquette of the river taught him to avoid that sort\nof rashness, and so he managed to hold his peace. He chafed and puzzled\na few minutes longer, then retired to his apartments. But soon he\nwas out again, and apparently more perplexed than ever. Presently he\nventured to remark, with deference--\n\n'Pretty good stage of the river now, ain't it, sir?'\n\n'Well, I should say so! Bank-full _is_ a pretty liberal stage.'\n\n'Seems to be a good deal of current here.'\n\n'Good deal don't describe it! It's worse than a mill-race.'\n\n'Isn't it easier in toward shore than it is out here in the middle?'\n\n'Yes, I reckon it is; but a body can't be too careful with a steamboat.\nIt's pretty safe out here; can't strike any bottom here, you can depend\non that.'\n\nThe captain departed, looking rueful enough. At this rate, he would\nprobably die of old age before his boat got to St. Louis. Next day he\nappeared on deck and again found Stephen faithfully standing up the\nmiddle of the river, fighting the whole vast force of the Mississippi,\nand whistling the same placid tune. This thing was becoming serious.\nIn by the shore was a slower boat clipping along in the easy water and\ngaining steadily; she began to make for an island chute; Stephen stuck\nto the middle of the river. Speech was _wrung _from the captain. He\nsaid--\n\n'Mr. W----, don't that chute cut off a good deal of distance?'\n\n'I think it does, but I don't know.'\n\n'Don't know! Well, isn't there water enough in it now to go through?'\n\n'I expect there is, but I am not certain.'\n\n'Upon my word this is odd! Why, those pilots on that boat yonder are\ngoing to try it. Do you mean to say that you don't know as much as they\ndo?'\n\n'_They_! Why, _they _are two-hundred-and-fifty-dollar pilots! But\ndon't you be uneasy; I know as much as any man can afford to know for a\nhundred and twenty-five!'\n\nThe captain surrendered.\n\nFive minutes later Stephen was bowling through the chute and showing the\nrival boat a two-hundred-and-fifty-dollar pair of heels.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 15\n\nThe Pilots' Monopoly\n\nONE day, on board the 'Aleck Scott,' my chief, Mr. Bixby, was crawling\ncarefully through a close place at Cat Island, both leads going, and\neverybody holding his breath. The captain, a nervous, apprehensive man,\nkept still as long as he could, but finally broke down and shouted from\nthe hurricane deck--\n\n'For gracious' sake, give her steam, Mr. Bixby! give her steam! She'll\nnever raise the reef on this headway!'\n\nFor all the effect that was produced upon Mr. Bixby, one would have\nsupposed that no remark had been made. But five minutes later, when\nthe danger was past and the leads laid in, he burst instantly into a\nconsuming fury, and gave the captain the most admirable cursing I ever\nlistened to. No bloodshed ensued; but that was because the captain's\ncause was weak; for ordinarily he was not a man to take correction\nquietly.\n\nHaving now set forth in detail the nature of the science of piloting,\nand likewise described the rank which the pilot held among the\nfraternity of steamboatmen, this seems a fitting place to say a few\nwords about an organization which the pilots once formed for the\nprotection of their guild. It was curious and noteworthy in this,\nthat it was perhaps the compactest, the completest, and the strongest\ncommercial organization ever formed among men.\n\nFor a long time wages had been two hundred and fifty dollars a month;\nbut curiously enough, as steamboats multiplied and business increased,\nthe wages began to fall little by little. It was easy to discover the\nreason of this. Too many pilots were being 'made.' It was nice to have\na 'cub,' a steersman, to do all the hard work for a couple of years,\ngratis, while his master sat on a high bench and smoked; all pilots and\ncaptains had sons or nephews who wanted to be pilots. By and by it came\nto pass that nearly every pilot on the river had a steersman. When a\nsteersman had made an amount of progress that was satisfactory to any\ntwo pilots in the trade, they could get a pilot's license for him by\nsigning an application directed to the United States Inspector. Nothing\nfurther was needed; usually no questions were asked, no proofs of\ncapacity required.\n\nVery well, this growing swarm of new pilots presently began to undermine\nthe wages, in order to get berths. Too late--apparently--the knights of\nthe tiller perceived their mistake. Plainly, something had to be done,\nand quickly; but what was to be the needful thing. A close organization.\nNothing else would answer. To compass this seemed an impossibility; so\nit was talked, and talked, and then dropped. It was too likely to ruin\nwhoever ventured to move in the matter. But at last about a dozen of\nthe boldest--and some of them the best--pilots on the river launched\nthemselves into the enterprise and took all the chances. They got a\nspecial charter from the legislature, with large powers, under the name\nof the Pilots' Benevolent Association; elected their officers, completed\ntheir organization, contributed capital, put 'association' wages up to\ntwo hundred and fifty dollars at once--and then retired to their homes,\nfor they were promptly discharged from employment. But there were two\nor three unnoticed trifles in their by-laws which had the seeds of\npropagation in them. For instance, all idle members of the association,\nin good standing, were entitled to a pension of twenty-five dollars per\nmonth. This began to bring in one straggler after another from the ranks\nof the new-fledged pilots, in the dull (summer) season. Better have\ntwenty-five dollars than starve; the initiation fee was only twelve\ndollars, and no dues required from the unemployed.\n\nAlso, the widows of deceased members in good standing could draw\ntwenty-five dollars per month, and a certain sum for each of their\nchildren. Also, the said deceased would be buried at the association's\nexpense. These things resurrected all the superannuated and forgotten\npilots in the Mississippi Valley. They came from farms, they came from\ninterior villages, they came from everywhere. They came on crutches, on\ndrays, in ambulances,--any way, so they got there. They paid in their\ntwelve dollars, and straightway began to draw out twenty-five dollars a\nmonth, and calculate their burial bills.\n\nBy and by, all the useless, helpless pilots, and a dozen first-class\nones, were in the association, and nine-tenths of the best pilots out\nof it and laughing at it. It was the laughing-stock of the whole river.\nEverybody joked about the by-law requiring members to pay ten per cent.\nof their wages, every month, into the treasury for the support of the\nassociation, whereas all the members were outcast and tabooed, and\nno one would employ them. Everybody was derisively grateful to the\nassociation for taking all the worthless pilots out of the way and\nleaving the whole field to the excellent and the deserving; and\neverybody was not only jocularly grateful for that, but for a result\nwhich naturally followed, namely, the gradual advance of wages as the\nbusy season approached. Wages had gone up from the low figure of one\nhundred dollars a month to one hundred and twenty-five, and in some\ncases to one hundred and fifty; and it was great fun to enlarge upon the\nfact that this charming thing had been accomplished by a body of men not\none of whom received a particle of benefit from it. Some of the jokers\nused to call at the association rooms and have a good time chaffing the\nmembers and offering them the charity of taking them as steersmen for\na trip, so that they could see what the forgotten river looked like.\nHowever, the association was content; or at least it gave no sign to the\ncontrary. Now and then it captured a pilot who was 'out of luck,' and\nadded him to its list; and these later additions were very valuable,\nfor they were good pilots; the incompetent ones had all been absorbed\nbefore. As business freshened, wages climbed gradually up to two hundred\nand fifty dollars--the association figure--and became firmly fixed\nthere; and still without benefiting a member of that body, for no member\nwas hired. The hilarity at the association's expense burst all bounds,\nnow. There was no end to the fun which that poor martyr had to put up\nwith.\n\nHowever, it is a long lane that has no turning. Winter approached,\nbusiness doubled and trebled, and an avalanche of Missouri, Illinois and\nUpper Mississippi River boats came pouring down to take a chance in the\nNew Orleans trade. All of a sudden pilots were in great demand, and were\ncorrespondingly scarce. The time for revenge was come. It was a bitter\npill to have to accept association pilots at last, yet captains and\nowners agreed that there was no other way. But none of these outcasts\noffered! So there was a still bitterer pill to be swallowed: they must\nbe sought out and asked for their services. Captain ---- was the first\nman who found it necessary to take the dose, and he had been the\nloudest derider of the organization. He hunted up one of the best of the\nassociation pilots and said--\n\n'Well, you boys have rather got the best of us for a little while, so\nI'll give in with as good a grace as I can. I've come to hire you; get\nyour trunk aboard right away. I want to leave at twelve o'clock.'\n\n'I don't know about that. Who is your other pilot?'\n\n'I've got I. S----. Why?'\n\n'I can't go with him. He don't belong to the association.'\n\n'What!'\n\n'It's so.'\n\n'Do you mean to tell me that you won't turn a wheel with one of the\nvery best and oldest pilots on the river because he don't belong to your\nassociation?'\n\n'Yes, I do.'\n\n'Well, if this isn't putting on airs! I supposed I was doing you a\nbenevolence; but I begin to think that I am the party that wants a favor\ndone. Are you acting under a law of the concern?'\n\n'Yes.'\n\n'Show it to me.'\n\nSo they stepped into the association rooms, and the secretary soon\nsatisfied the captain, who said--\n\n'Well, what am I to do? I have hired Mr. S---- for the entire season.'\n\n'I will provide for you,' said the secretary. 'I will detail a pilot to\ngo with you, and he shall be on board at twelve o'clock.'\n\n'But if I discharge S----, he will come on me for the whole season's\nwages.'\n\n'Of course that is a matter between you and Mr. S----, captain. We\ncannot meddle in your private affairs.'\n\nThe captain stormed, but to no purpose. In the end he had to discharge\nS----, pay him about a thousand dollars, and take an association pilot\nin his place. The laugh was beginning to turn the other way now. Every\nday, thenceforward, a new victim fell; every day some outraged captain\ndischarged a non-association pet, with tears and profanity, and\ninstalled a hated association man in his berth. In a very little while,\nidle non-associationists began to be pretty plenty, brisk as business\nwas, and much as their services were desired. The laugh was shifting to\nthe other side of their mouths most palpably. These victims, together\nwith the captains and owners, presently ceased to laugh altogether,\nand began to rage about the revenge they would take when the passing\nbusiness 'spurt' was over.\n\nSoon all the laughers that were left were the owners and crews of boats\nthat had two non-association pilots. But their triumph was not very\nlong-lived. For this reason: It was a rigid rule of the association\nthat its members should never, under any circumstances whatever, give\ninformation about the channel to any 'outsider.' By this time about half\nthe boats had none but association pilots, and the other half had none\nbut outsiders. At the first glance one would suppose that when it came\nto forbidding information about the river these two parties could play\nequally at that game; but this was not so. At every good-sized town from\none end of the river to the other, there was a 'wharf-boat' to land\nat, instead of a wharf or a pier. Freight was stored in it for\ntransportation; waiting passengers slept in its cabins. Upon each\nof these wharf-boats the association's officers placed a strong box\nfastened with a peculiar lock which was used in no other service but\none--the United States mail service. It was the letter-bag lock, a\nsacred governmental thing. By dint of much beseeching the government\nhad been persuaded to allow the association to use this lock. Every\nassociation man carried a key which would open these boxes. That key, or\nrather a peculiar way of holding it in the hand when its owner was asked\nfor river information by a stranger--for the success of the St. Louis\nand New Orleans association had now bred tolerably thriving branches in\na dozen neighboring steamboat trades--was the association man's sign and\ndiploma of membership; and if the stranger did not respond by producing\na similar key and holding it in a certain manner duly prescribed, his\nquestion was politely ignored.\n\nFrom the association's secretary each member received a package of more\nor less gorgeous blanks, printed like a billhead, on handsome paper,\nproperly ruled in columns; a bill-head worded something like this--\n\nThese blanks were filled up, day by day, as the voyage progressed, and\ndeposited in the several wharf-boat boxes. For instance, as soon as the\nfirst crossing, out from St. Louis, was completed, the items would be\nentered upon the blank, under the appropriate headings, thus--\n\n'St. Louis. Nine and a half (feet). Stern on court-house, head on dead\ncottonwood above wood-yard, until you raise the first reef, then pull up\nsquare.' Then under head of Remarks: 'Go just outside the wrecks; this\nis important. New snag just where you straighten down; go above it.'\n\nThe pilot who deposited that blank in the Cairo box (after adding to it\nthe details of every crossing all the way down from St. Louis) took\nout and read half a dozen fresh reports (from upward-bound steamers)\nconcerning the river between Cairo and Memphis, posted himself\nthoroughly, returned them to the box, and went back aboard his boat\nagain so armed against accident that he could not possibly get his boat\ninto trouble without bringing the most ingenious carelessness to his\naid.\n\nImagine the benefits of so admirable a system in a piece of river twelve\nor thirteen hundred miles long, whose channel was shifting every day!\nThe pilot who had formerly been obliged to put up with seeing a shoal\nplace once or possibly twice a month, had a hundred sharp eyes to watch\nit for him, now, and bushels of intelligent brains to tell him how to\nrun it. His information about it was seldom twenty-four hours old. If\nthe reports in the last box chanced to leave any misgivings on his\nmind concerning a treacherous crossing, he had his remedy; he blew his\nsteam-whistle in a peculiar way as soon as he saw a boat approaching;\nthe signal was answered in a peculiar way if that boat's pilots were\nassociation men; and then the two steamers ranged alongside and all\nuncertainties were swept away by fresh information furnished to the\ninquirer by word of mouth and in minute detail.\n\nThe first thing a pilot did when he reached New Orleans or St. Louis was\nto take his final and elaborate report to the association parlors and\nhang it up there,--after which he was free to visit his family. In these\nparlors a crowd was always gathered together, discussing changes in the\nchannel, and the moment there was a fresh arrival, everybody stopped\ntalking till this witness had told the newest news and settled the\nlatest uncertainty. Other craftsmen can 'sink the shop,' sometimes,\nand interest themselves in other matters. Not so with a pilot; he must\ndevote himself wholly to his profession and talk of nothing else; for it\nwould be small gain to be perfect one day and imperfect the next. He has\nno time or words to waste if he would keep 'posted.'\n\nBut the outsiders had a hard time of it. No particular place to meet\nand exchange information, no wharf-boat reports, none but chance and\nunsatisfactory ways of getting news. The consequence was that a man\nsometimes had to run five hundred miles of river on information that\nwas a week or ten days old. At a fair stage of the river that might have\nanswered; but when the dead low water came it was destructive.\n\nNow came another perfectly logical result. The outsiders began to\nground steamboats, sink them, and get into all sorts of trouble,\nwhereas accidents seemed to keep entirely away from the association men.\nWherefore even the owners and captains of boats furnished exclusively\nwith outsiders, and previously considered to be wholly independent of\nthe association and free to comfort themselves with brag and laughter,\nbegan to feel pretty uncomfortable. Still, they made a show of keeping\nup the brag, until one black day when every captain of the lot was\nformally ordered to immediately discharge his outsiders and take\nassociation pilots in their stead. And who was it that had the dashing\npresumption to do that? Alas, it came from a power behind the throne\nthat was greater than the throne itself. It was the underwriters!\n\nIt was no time to 'swap knives.' Every outsider had to take his trunk\nashore at once. Of course it was supposed that there was collusion\nbetween the association and the underwriters, but this was not so. The\nlatter had come to comprehend the excellence of the 'report' system of\nthe association and the safety it secured, and so they had made their\ndecision among themselves and upon plain business principles.\n\nThere was weeping and wailing and gnashing of teeth in the camp of\nthe outsiders now. But no matter, there was but one course for them to\npursue, and they pursued it. They came forward in couples and groups,\nand proffered their twelve dollars and asked for membership. They were\nsurprised to learn that several new by-laws had been long ago added. For\ninstance, the initiation fee had been raised to fifty dollars; that\nsum must be tendered, and also ten per cent. of the wages which the\napplicant had received each and every month since the founding of\nthe association. In many cases this amounted to three or four hundred\ndollars. Still, the association would not entertain the application\nuntil the money was present. Even then a single adverse vote killed the\napplication. Every member had to vote 'Yes' or 'No' in person and before\nwitnesses; so it took weeks to decide a candidacy, because many pilots\nwere so long absent on voyages. However, the repentant sinners scraped\ntheir savings together, and one by one, by our tedious voting process,\nthey were added to the fold. A time came, at last, when only about ten\nremained outside. They said they would starve before they would apply.\nThey remained idle a long while, because of course nobody could venture\nto employ them.\n\nBy and by the association published the fact that upon a certain date\nthe wages would be raised to five hundred dollars per month. All the\nbranch associations had grown strong, now, and the Red River one had\nadvanced wages to seven hundred dollars a month. Reluctantly the ten\noutsiders yielded, in view of these things, and made application. There\nwas another new by-law, by this time, which required them to pay dues\nnot only on all the wages they had received since the association was\nborn, but also on what they would have received if they had continued at\nwork up to the time of their application, instead of going off to pout\nin idleness. It turned out to be a difficult matter to elect them, but\nit was accomplished at last. The most virulent sinner of this batch had\nstayed out and allowed 'dues' to accumulate against him so long that he\nhad to send in six hundred and twenty-five dollars with his application.\n\nThe association had a good bank account now, and was very strong. There\nwas no longer an outsider. A by-law was added forbidding the reception\nof any more cubs or apprentices for five years; after which time\na limited number would be taken, not by individuals, but by the\nassociation, upon these terms: the applicant must not be less than\neighteen years old, and of respectable family and good character; he\nmust pass an examination as to education, pay a thousand dollars in\nadvance for the privilege of becoming an apprentice, and must remain\nunder the commands of the association until a great part of the\nmembership (more than half, I think) should be willing to sign his\napplication for a pilot's license.\n\nAll previously-articled apprentices were now taken away from their\nmasters and adopted by the association. The president and secretary\ndetailed them for service on one boat or another, as they chose, and\nchanged them from boat to boat according to certain rules. If a pilot\ncould show that he was in infirm health and needed assistance, one of\nthe cubs would be ordered to go with him.\n\nThe widow and orphan list grew, but so did the association's financial\nresources. The association attended its own funerals in state, and paid\nfor them. When occasion demanded, it sent members down the river upon\nsearches for the bodies of brethren lost by steamboat accidents; a\nsearch of this kind sometimes cost a thousand dollars.\n\nThe association procured a charter and went into the insurance business,\nalso. It not only insured the lives of its members, but took risks on\nsteamboats.\n\nThe organization seemed indestructible. It was the tightest monopoly in\nthe world. By the United States law, no man could become a pilot unless\ntwo duly licensed pilots signed his application; and now there was\nnobody outside of the association competent to sign. Consequently the\nmaking of pilots was at an end. Every year some would die and others\nbecome incapacitated by age and infirmity; there would be no new ones\nto take their places. In time, the association could put wages up to any\nfigure it chose; and as long as it should be wise enough not to carry\nthe thing too far and provoke the national government into amending the\nlicensing system, steamboat owners would have to submit, since there\nwould be no help for it.\n\nThe owners and captains were the only obstruction that lay between\nthe association and absolute power; and at last this one was removed.\nIncredible as it may seem, the owners and captains deliberately did it\nthemselves. When the pilots' association announced, months beforehand,\nthat on the first day of September, 1861, wages would be advanced to\nfive hundred dollars per month, the owners and captains instantly put\nfreights up a few cents, and explained to the farmers along the river\nthe necessity of it, by calling their attention to the burdensome rate\nof wages about to be established. It was a rather slender argument, but\nthe farmers did not seem to detect it. It looked reasonable to them that\nto add five cents freight on a bushel of corn was justifiable under\nthe circumstances, overlooking the fact that this advance on a cargo of\nforty thousand sacks was a good deal more than necessary to cover the\nnew wages.\n\nSo, straightway the captains and owners got up an association of their\nown, and proposed to put captains' wages up to five hundred dollars,\ntoo, and move for another advance in freights. It was a novel idea,\nbut of course an effect which had been produced once could be produced\nagain. The new association decreed (for this was before all the\noutsiders had been taken into the pilots' association) that if any\ncaptain employed a non-association pilot, he should be forced to\ndischarge him, and also pay a fine of five hundred dollars. Several\nof these heavy fines were paid before the captains' organization grew\nstrong enough to exercise full authority over its membership; but that\nall ceased, presently. The captains tried to get the pilots to decree\nthat no member of their corporation should serve under a non-association\ncaptain; but this proposition was declined. The pilots saw that they\nwould be backed up by the captains and the underwriters anyhow, and so\nthey wisely refrained from entering into entangling alliances.\n\nAs I have remarked, the pilots' association was now the compactest\nmonopoly in the world, perhaps, and seemed simply indestructible.\nAnd yet the days of its glory were numbered. First, the new railroad\nstretching up through Mississippi, Tennessee, and Kentucky, to Northern\nrailway centers, began to divert the passenger travel from the steamers;\nnext the war came and almost entirely annihilated the steamboating\nindustry during several years, leaving most of the pilots idle, and the\ncost of living advancing all the time; then the treasurer of the St.\nLouis association put his hand into the till and walked off with\nevery dollar of the ample fund; and finally, the railroads intruding\neverywhere, there was little for steamers to do, when the war was over,\nbut carry freights; so straightway some genius from the Atlantic coast\nintroduced the plan of towing a dozen steamer cargoes down to New\nOrleans at the tail of a vulgar little tug-boat; and behold, in the\ntwinkling of an eye, as it were, the association and the noble science\nof piloting were things of the dead and pathetic past!\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 16\n\nRacing Days\n\nIT was always the custom for the boats to leave New Orleans between four\nand five o'clock in the afternoon. From three o'clock onward they would\nbe burning rosin and pitch pine (the sign of preparation), and so one\nhad the picturesque spectacle of a rank, some two or three miles long,\nof tall, ascending columns of coal-black smoke; a colonnade which\nsupported a sable roof of the same smoke blended together and spreading\nabroad over the city. Every outward-bound boat had its flag flying at\nthe jack-staff, and sometimes a duplicate on the verge staff astern.\nTwo or three miles of mates were commanding and swearing with more than\nusual emphasis; countless processions of freight barrels and boxes were\nspinning athwart the levee and flying aboard the stage-planks, belated\npassengers were dodging and skipping among these frantic things, hoping\nto reach the forecastle companion way alive, but having their doubts\nabout it; women with reticules and bandboxes were trying to keep up with\nhusbands freighted with carpet-sacks and crying babies, and making a\nfailure of it by losing their heads in the whirl and roar and general\ndistraction; drays and baggage-vans were clattering hither and thither\nin a wild hurry, every now and then getting blocked and jammed together,\nand then during ten seconds one could not see them for the profanity,\nexcept vaguely and dimly; every windlass connected with every forehatch,\nfrom one end of that long array of steamboats to the other, was keeping\nup a deafening whiz and whir, lowering freight into the hold, and the\nhalf-naked crews of perspiring negroes that worked them were roaring\nsuch songs as 'De Las' Sack! De Las' Sack!'--inspired to unimaginable\nexaltation by the chaos of turmoil and racket that was driving everybody\nelse mad.\n\nBy this time the hurricane and boiler decks of the steamers would be\npacked and black with passengers. The 'last bells' would begin to clang,\nall down the line, and then the powwow seemed to double; in a moment or\ntwo the final warning came,--a simultaneous din of Chinese gongs, with\nthe cry, 'All dat ain't goin', please to git asho'!'--and behold, the\npowwow quadrupled! People came swarming ashore, overturning excited\nstragglers that were trying to swarm aboard. One more moment later a\nlong array of stage-planks was being hauled in, each with its customary\nlatest passenger clinging to the end of it with teeth, nails, and\neverything else, and the customary latest procrastinator making a wild\nspring shoreward over his head.\n\nNow a number of the boats slide backward into the stream, leaving wide\ngaps in the serried rank of steamers. Citizens crowd the decks of boats\nthat are not to go, in order to see the sight. Steamer after steamer\nstraightens herself up, gathers all her strength, and presently comes\nswinging by, under a tremendous head of steam, with flag flying, black\nsmoke rolling, and her entire crew of firemen and deck-hands (usually\nswarthy negroes) massed together on the forecastle, the best 'voice' in\nthe lot towering from the midst (being mounted on the capstan), waving\nhis hat or a flag, and all roaring a mighty chorus, while the parting\ncannons boom and the multitudinous spectators swing their hats and\nhuzza! Steamer after steamer falls into line, and the stately procession\ngoes winging its flight up the river.\n\nIn the old times, whenever two fast boats started out on a race, with a\nbig crowd of people looking on, it was inspiring to hear the crews sing,\nespecially if the time were night-fall, and the forecastle lit up with\nthe red glare of the torch-baskets. Racing was royal fun. The public\nalways had an idea that racing was dangerous; whereas the opposite was\nthe case--that is, after the laws were passed which restricted each boat\nto just so many pounds of steam to the square inch. No engineer was ever\nsleepy or careless when his heart was in a race. He was constantly on\nthe alert, trying gauge-cocks and watching things. The dangerous place\nwas on slow, plodding boats, where the engineers drowsed around and\nallowed chips to get into the 'doctor' and shut off the water supply\nfrom the boilers.\n\nIn the 'flush times' of steamboating, a race between two notoriously\nfleet steamers was an event of vast importance. The date was set for\nit several weeks in advance, and from that time forward, the whole\nMississippi Valley was in a state of consuming excitement. Politics and\nthe weather were dropped, and people talked only of the coming race. As\nthe time approached, the two steamers 'stripped' and got ready. Every\nencumbrance that added weight, or exposed a resisting surface to wind\nor water, was removed, if the boat could possibly do without it. The\n'spars,' and sometimes even their supporting derricks, were sent ashore,\nand no means left to set the boat afloat in case she got aground. When\nthe 'Eclipse' and the 'A. L. Shotwell' ran their great race many years\nago, it was said that pains were taken to scrape the gilding off the\nfanciful device which hung between the 'Eclipse's' chimneys, and that\nfor that one trip the captain left off his kid gloves and had his head\nshaved. But I always doubted these things.\n\nIf the boat was known to make her best speed when drawing five and a\nhalf feet forward and five feet aft, she was carefully loaded to that\nexact figure--she wouldn't enter a dose of homoeopathic pills on her\nmanifest after that. Hardly any passengers were taken, because they not\nonly add weight but they never will 'trim boat.' They always run to\nthe side when there is anything to see, whereas a conscientious and\nexperienced steamboatman would stick to the center of the boat and part\nhis hair in the middle with a spirit level.\n\nNo way-freights and no way-passengers were allowed, for the racers would\nstop only at the largest towns, and then it would be only 'touch and\ngo.' Coal flats and wood flats were contracted for beforehand, and\nthese were kept ready to hitch on to the flying steamers at a moment's\nwarning. Double crews were carried, so that all work could be quickly\ndone.\n\nThe chosen date being come, and all things in readiness, the two great\nsteamers back into the stream, and lie there jockeying a moment, and\napparently watching each other's slightest movement, like sentient\ncreatures; flags drooping, the pent steam shrieking through\nsafety-valves, the black smoke rolling and tumbling from the chimneys\nand darkening all the air. People, people everywhere; the shores, the\nhouse-tops, the steamboats, the ships, are packed with them, and you\nknow that the borders of the broad Mississippi are going to be fringed\nwith humanity thence northward twelve hundred miles, to welcome these\nracers.\n\nPresently tall columns of steam burst from the 'scape-pipes of both\nsteamers, two guns boom a good-bye, two red-shirted heroes mounted\non capstans wave their small flags above the massed crews on the\nforecastles, two plaintive solos linger on the air a few waiting\nseconds, two mighty choruses burst forth--and here they come! Brass\nbands bray Hail Columbia, huzza after huzza thunders from the shores,\nand the stately creatures go whistling by like the wind.\n\nThose boats will never halt a moment between New Orleans and St. Louis,\nexcept for a second or two at large towns, or to hitch thirty-cord\nwood-boats alongside. You should be on board when they take a couple of\nthose wood-boats in tow and turn a swarm of men into each; by the time\nyou have wiped your glasses and put them on, you will be wondering what\nhas become of that wood.\n\nTwo nicely matched steamers will stay in sight of each other day after\nday. They might even stay side by side, but for the fact that pilots are\nnot all alike, and the smartest pilots will win the race. If one of the\nboats has a 'lightning' pilot, whose 'partner' is a trifle his inferior,\nyou can tell which one is on watch by noting whether that boat has\ngained ground or lost some during each four-hour stretch. The shrewdest\npilot can delay a boat if he has not a fine genius for steering.\nSteering is a very high art. One must not keep a rudder dragging across\na boat's stem if he wants to get up the river fast.\n\nThere is a great difference in boats, of course. For a long time I was\non a boat that was so slow we used to forget what year it was we left\nport in. But of course this was at rare intervals. Ferryboats used to\nlose valuable trips because their passengers grew old and died, waiting\nfor us to get by. This was at still rarer intervals. I had the documents\nfor these occurrences, but through carelessness they have been mislaid.\nThis boat, the 'John J. Roe,' was so slow that when she finally sunk in\nMadrid Bend, it was five years before the owners heard of it. That was\nalways a confusing fact to me, but it is according to the record, any\nway. She was dismally slow; still, we often had pretty exciting times\nracing with islands, and rafts, and such things. One trip, however, we\ndid rather well. We went to St. Louis in sixteen days. But even at\nthis rattling gait I think we changed watches three times in Fort Adams\nreach, which is five miles long. A 'reach' is a piece of straight river,\nand of course the current drives through such a place in a pretty lively\nway.\n\nThat trip we went to Grand Gulf, from New Orleans, in four days (three\nhundred and forty miles); the 'Eclipse' and 'Shotwell' did it in one.\nWe were nine days out, in the chute of 63 (seven hundred miles); the\n'Eclipse' and 'Shotwell' went there in two days. Something over a\ngeneration ago, a boat called the 'J. M. White' went from New Orleans\nto Cairo in three days, six hours, and forty-four minutes. In 1853 the\n'Eclipse' made the same trip in three days, three hours, and twenty\nminutes.{footnote [Time disputed. Some authorities add 1 hour and 16\nminutes to this.]} In 1870 the 'R. E. Lee' did it in three days and\n_one_ hour. This last is called the fastest trip on record. I will\ntry to show that it was not. For this reason: the distance between\nNew Orleans and Cairo, when the 'J. M. White' ran it, was about eleven\nhundred and six miles; consequently her average speed was a trifle over\nfourteen miles per hour. In the 'Eclipse's' day the distance between\nthe two ports had become reduced to one thousand and eighty miles;\nconsequently her average speed was a shade under fourteen and\nthree-eighths miles per hour. In the 'R. E. Lee's' time the distance\nhad diminished to about one thousand and thirty miles; consequently her\naverage was about fourteen and one-eighth miles per hour. Therefore the\n'Eclipse's' was conspicuously the fastest time that has ever been made.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 17\n\nCut-offs and Stephen\n\nTHESE dry details are of importance in one particular. They give me\nan opportunity of introducing one of the Mississippi's oddest\npeculiarities,--that of shortening its length from time to time. If\nyou will throw a long, pliant apple-paring over your shoulder, it will\npretty fairly shape itself into an average section of the Mississippi\nRiver; that is, the nine or ten hundred miles stretching from Cairo,\nIllinois, southward to New Orleans, the same being wonderfully crooked,\nwith a brief straight bit here and there at wide intervals. The two\nhundred-mile stretch from Cairo northward to St. Louis is by no means so\ncrooked, that being a rocky country which the river cannot cut much.\n\nThe water cuts the alluvial banks of the 'lower' river into deep\nhorseshoe curves; so deep, indeed, that in some places if you were to\nget ashore at one extremity of the horseshoe and walk across the neck,\nhalf or three quarters of a mile, you could sit down and rest a couple\nof hours while your steamer was coming around the long elbow, at a speed\nof ten miles an hour, to take you aboard again. When the river is\nrising fast, some scoundrel whose plantation is back in the country, and\ntherefore of inferior value, has only to watch his chance, cut a little\ngutter across the narrow neck of land some dark night, and turn the\nwater into it, and in a wonderfully short time a miracle has happened:\nto wit, the whole Mississippi has taken possession of that little ditch,\nand placed the countryman's plantation on its bank (quadrupling its\nvalue), and that other party's formerly valuable plantation finds itself\naway out yonder on a big island; the old watercourse around it will soon\nshoal up, boats cannot approach within ten miles of it, and down goes\nits value to a fourth of its former worth. Watches are kept on those\nnarrow necks, at needful times, and if a man happens to be caught\ncutting a ditch across them, the chances are all against his ever having\nanother opportunity to cut a ditch.\n\nPray observe some of the effects of this ditching business. Once there\nwas a neck opposite Port Hudson, Louisiana, which was only half a mile\nacross, in its narrowest place. You could walk across there in fifteen\nminutes; but if you made the journey around the cape on a raft, you\ntraveled thirty-five miles to accomplish the same thing. In 1722 the\nriver darted through that neck, deserted its old bed, and thus\nshortened itself thirty-five miles. In the same way it shortened itself\ntwenty-five miles at Black Hawk Point in 1699. Below Red River Landing,\nRaccourci cut-off was made (forty or fifty years ago, I think). This\nshortened the river twenty-eight miles. In our day, if you travel by\nriver from the southernmost of these three cut-offs to the northernmost,\nyou go only seventy miles. To do the same thing a hundred and\nseventy-six years ago, one had to go a hundred and fifty-eight\nmiles!--shortening of eighty-eight miles in that trifling distance.\nAt some forgotten time in the past, cut-offs were made above Vidalia,\nLouisiana; at island 92; at island 84; and at Hale's Point. These\nshortened the river, in the aggregate, seventy-seven miles.\n\nSince my own day on the Mississippi, cut-offs have been made at\nHurricane Island; at island 100; at Napoleon, Arkansas; at Walnut\nBend; and at Council Bend. These shortened the river, in the aggregate,\nsixty-seven miles. In my own time a cut-off was made at American Bend,\nwhich shortened the river ten miles or more.\n\nTherefore, the Mississippi between Cairo and New Orleans was twelve\nhundred and fifteen miles long one hundred and seventy-six years ago.\nIt was eleven hundred and eighty after the cut-off of 1722. It was\none thousand and forty after the American Bend cut-off. It has lost\nsixty-seven miles since. Consequently its length is only nine hundred\nand seventy-three miles at present.\n\nNow, if I wanted to be one of those ponderous scientific people, and\n'let on' to prove what had occurred in the remote past by what had\noccurred in a given time in the recent past, or what will occur in the\nfar future by what has occurred in late years, what an opportunity is\nhere! Geology never had such a chance, nor such exact data to argue\nfrom! Nor 'development of species,' either! Glacial epochs are great\nthings, but they are vague--vague. Please observe:--\n\nIn the space of one hundred and seventy-six years the Lower Mississippi\nhas shortened itself two hundred and forty-two miles. That is an average\nof a trifle over one mile and a third per year. Therefore, any calm\nperson, who is not blind or idiotic, can see that in the Old Oolitic\nSilurian Period,' just a million years ago next November, the Lower\nMississippi River was upwards of one million three hundred thousand\nmiles long, and stuck out over the Gulf of Mexico like a fishing-rod.\nAnd by the same token any person can see that seven hundred and\nforty-two years from now the Lower Mississippi will be only a mile and\nthree-quarters long, and Cairo and New Orleans will have joined their\nstreets together, and be plodding comfortably along under a single mayor\nand a mutual board of aldermen. There is something fascinating about\nscience. One gets such wholesale returns of conjecture out of such a\ntrifling investment of fact.\n\nWhen the water begins to flow through one of those ditches I have been\nspeaking of, it is time for the people thereabouts to move. The water\ncleaves the banks away like a knife. By the time the ditch has become\ntwelve or fifteen feet wide, the calamity is as good as accomplished,\nfor no power on earth can stop it now. When the width has reached a\nhundred yards, the banks begin to peel off in slices half an acre wide.\nThe current flowing around the bend traveled formerly only five miles\nan hour; now it is tremendously increased by the shortening of the\ndistance. I was on board the first boat that tried to go through the\ncut-off at American Bend, but we did not get through. It was toward\nmidnight, and a wild night it was--thunder, lightning, and torrents of\nrain. It was estimated that the current in the cut-off was making about\nfifteen or twenty miles an hour; twelve or thirteen was the best our\nboat could do, even in tolerably slack water, therefore perhaps we were\nfoolish to try the cut-off. However, Mr. Brown was ambitious, and he\nkept on trying. The eddy running up the bank, under the 'point,' was\nabout as swift as the current out in the middle; so we would go flying\nup the shore like a lightning express train, get on a big head of steam,\nand 'stand by for a surge' when we struck the current that was whirling\nby the point. But all our preparations were useless. The instant the\ncurrent hit us it spun us around like a top, the water deluged the\nforecastle, and the boat careened so far over that one could hardly keep\nhis feet. The next instant we were away down the river, clawing with\nmight and main to keep out of the woods. We tried the experiment\nfour times. I stood on the forecastle companion way to see. It was\nastonishing to observe how suddenly the boat would spin around and turn\ntail the moment she emerged from the eddy and the current struck her\nnose. The sounding concussion and the quivering would have been about\nthe same if she had come full speed against a sand-bank. Under the\nlightning flashes one could see the plantation cabins and the goodly\nacres tumble into the river; and the crash they made was not a bad\neffort at thunder. Once, when we spun around, we only missed a house\nabout twenty feet, that had a light burning in the window; and in\nthe same instant that house went overboard. Nobody could stay on our\nforecastle; the water swept across it in a torrent every time we plunged\nathwart the current. At the end of our fourth effort we brought up\nin the woods two miles below the cut-off; all the country there was\noverflowed, of course. A day or two later the cut-off was three-quarters\nof a mile wide, and boats passed up through it without much difficulty,\nand so saved ten miles.\n\nThe old Raccourci cut-off reduced the river's length twenty-eight miles.\nThere used to be a tradition connected with it. It was said that a boat\ncame along there in the night and went around the enormous elbow the\nusual way, the pilots not knowing that the cut-off had been made. It was\na grisly, hideous night, and all shapes were vague and distorted. The\nold bend had already begun to fill up, and the boat got to running\naway from mysterious reefs, and occasionally hitting one. The perplexed\npilots fell to swearing, and finally uttered the entirely unnecessary\nwish that they might never get out of that place. As always happens\nin such cases, that particular prayer was answered, and the others\nneglected. So to this day that phantom steamer is still butting around\nin that deserted river, trying to find her way out. More than one grave\nwatchman has sworn to me that on drizzly, dismal nights, he has glanced\nfearfully down that forgotten river as he passed the head of the island,\nand seen the faint glow of the specter steamer's lights drifting through\nthe distant gloom, and heard the muffled cough of her 'scape-pipes and\nthe plaintive cry of her leadsmen.\n\nIn the absence of further statistics, I beg to close this chapter with\none more reminiscence of 'Stephen.'\n\nMost of the captains and pilots held Stephen's note for borrowed sums,\nranging from two hundred and fifty dollars upward. Stephen never paid\none of these notes, but he was very prompt and very zealous about\nrenewing them every twelve months.\n\nOf course there came a time, at last, when Stephen could no longer\nborrow of his ancient creditors; so he was obliged to lie in wait for\nnew men who did not know him. Such a victim was good-hearted, simple\nnatured young Yates (I use a fictitious name, but the real name began,\nas this one does, with a Y). Young Yates graduated as a pilot, got a\nberth, and when the month was ended and he stepped up to the clerk's\noffice and received his two hundred and fifty dollars in crisp new\nbills, Stephen was there! His silvery tongue began to wag, and in a very\nlittle while Yates's two hundred and fifty dollars had changed hands.\nThe fact was soon known at pilot headquarters, and the amusement and\nsatisfaction of the old creditors were large and generous. But innocent\nYates never suspected that Stephen's promise to pay promptly at the\nend of the week was a worthless one. Yates called for his money at the\nstipulated time; Stephen sweetened him up and put him off a week. He\ncalled then, according to agreement, and came away sugar-coated again,\nbut suffering under another postponement. So the thing went on. Yates\nhaunted Stephen week after week, to no purpose, and at last gave it\nup. And then straightway Stephen began to haunt Yates! Wherever Yates\nappeared, there was the inevitable Stephen. And not only there, but\nbeaming with affection and gushing with apologies for not being able to\npay. By and by, whenever poor Yates saw him coming, he would turn and\nfly, and drag his company with him, if he had company; but it was of\nno use; his debtor would run him down and corner him. Panting and\nred-faced, Stephen would come, with outstretched hands and eager eyes,\ninvade the conversation, shake both of Yates's arms loose in their\nsockets, and begin--\n\n'My, what a race I've had! I saw you didn't see me, and so I clapped on\nall steam for fear I'd miss you entirely. And here you are! there, just\nstand so, and let me look at you! just the same old noble countenance.'\n[To Yates's friend:] 'Just look at him! _Look _at him! Ain't it just\n_good _to look at him! _ain't_ it now? Ain't he just a picture! _Some\n_call him a picture; I call him a panorama! That's what he is--an entire\npanorama. And now I'm reminded! How I do wish I could have seen you an\nhour earlier! For twenty-four hours I've been saving up that two hundred\nand fifty dollars for you; been looking for you everywhere. I waited at\nthe Planter's from six yesterday evening till two o'clock this morning,\nwithout rest or food; my wife says, “Where have you been all night?”\n I said, “This debt lies heavy on my mind.” She says, “In all my days I\nnever saw a man take a debt to heart the way you do.” I said, “It's my\nnature; how can I change it?” She says, “Well, do go to bed and get some\nrest.” I said, “Not till that poor, noble young man has got his money.”\n So I set up all night, and this morning out I shot, and the first man\nI struck told me you had shipped on the “Grand Turk” and gone to New\nOrleans. Well, sir, I had to lean up against a building and cry. So help\nme goodness, I couldn't help it. The man that owned the place come\nout cleaning up with a rag, and said he didn't like to have people cry\nagainst his building, and then it seemed to me that the whole world had\nturned against me, and it wasn't any use to live any more; and coming\nalong an hour ago, suffering no man knows what agony, I met Jim Wilson\nand paid him the two hundred and fifty dollars on account; and to think\nthat here you are, now, and I haven't got a cent! But as sure as I am\nstanding here on this ground on this particular brick,--there, I've\nscratched a mark on the brick to remember it by,--I'll borrow that money\nand pay it over to you at twelve o'clock sharp, tomorrow! Now, stand so;\nlet me look at you just once more.'\n\nAnd so on. Yates's life became a burden to him. He could not escape his\ndebtor and his debtor's awful sufferings on account of not being able\nto pay. He dreaded to show himself in the street, lest he should find\nStephen lying in wait for him at the corner.\n\nBogart's billiard saloon was a great resort for pilots in those days.\nThey met there about as much to exchange river news as to play. One\nmorning Yates was there; Stephen was there, too, but kept out of sight.\nBut by and by, when about all the pilots had arrived who were in town,\nStephen suddenly appeared in the midst, and rushed for Yates as for a\nlong-lost brother.\n\n'_Oh_, I am so glad to see you! Oh my soul, the sight of you is such a\ncomfort to my eyes! Gentlemen, I owe all of you money; among you I owe\nprobably forty thousand dollars. I want to pay it; I intend to pay it\nevery last cent of it. You all know, without my telling you, what sorrow\nit has cost me to remain so long under such deep obligations to such\npatient and generous friends; but the sharpest pang I suffer--by far\nthe sharpest--is from the debt I owe to this noble young man here; and I\nhave come to this place this morning especially to make the announcement\nthat I have at last found a method whereby I can pay off all my debts!\nAnd most especially I wanted _him _to be here when I announced it. Yes,\nmy faithful friend,--my benefactor, I've found the method! I've found\nthe method to pay off all my debts, and you'll get your money!' Hope\ndawned in Yates's eye; then Stephen, beaming benignantly, and placing\nhis hand upon Yates's head, added, 'I am going to pay them off in\nalphabetical order!'\n\nThen he turned and disappeared. The full significance of Stephen's\n'method' did not dawn upon the perplexed and musing crowd for some two\nminutes; and then Yates murmured with a sigh--\n\n'Well, the Y's stand a gaudy chance. He won't get any further than the\nC's in _this _world, and I reckon that after a good deal of eternity has\nwasted away in the next one, I'll still be referred to up there as “that\npoor, ragged pilot that came here from St. Louis in the early days!”\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 18\n\nI Take a Few Extra Lessons\n\nDURING the two or two and a half years of my apprenticeship, I served\nunder many pilots, and had experience of many kinds of steamboatmen and\nmany varieties of steamboats; for it was not always convenient for Mr.\nBixby to have me with him, and in such cases he sent me with somebody\nelse. I am to this day profiting somewhat by that experience; for in\nthat brief, sharp schooling, I got personally and familiarly acquainted\nwith about all the different types of human nature that are to be found\nin fiction, biography, or history. The fact is daily borne in upon me,\nthat the average shore-employment requires as much as forty years\nto equip a man with this sort of an education. When I say I am still\nprofiting by this thing, I do not mean that it has constituted me a\njudge of men--no, it has not done that; for judges of men are born, not\nmade. My profit is various in kind and degree; but the feature of it\nwhich I value most is the zest which that early experience has given\nto my later reading. When I find a well-drawn character in fiction or\nbiography, I generally take a warm personal interest in him, for the\nreason that I have known him before--met him on the river.\n\nThe figure that comes before me oftenest, out of the shadows of that\nvanished time, is that of Brown, of the steamer 'Pennsylvania'--the man\nreferred to in a former chapter, whose memory was so good and tiresome.\nHe was a middle-aged, long, slim, bony, smooth-shaven, horse-faced,\nignorant, stingy, malicious, snarling, fault hunting, mote-magnifying\ntyrant. I early got the habit of coming on watch with dread at my heart.\nNo matter how good a time I might have been having with the off-watch\nbelow, and no matter how high my spirits might be when I started aloft,\nmy soul became lead in my body the moment I approached the pilot-house.\n\nI still remember the first time I ever entered the presence of that man.\nThe boat had backed out from St. Louis and was 'straightening down;'\nI ascended to the pilot-house in high feather, and very proud to be\nsemi-officially a member of the executive family of so fast and famous\na boat. Brown was at the wheel. I paused in the middle of the room, all\nfixed to make my bow, but Brown did not look around. I thought he took a\nfurtive glance at me out of the corner of his eye, but as not even this\nnotice was repeated, I judged I had been mistaken. By this time he was\npicking his way among some dangerous 'breaks' abreast the woodyards;\ntherefore it would not be proper to interrupt him; so I stepped softly\nto the high bench and took a seat.\n\nThere was silence for ten minutes; then my new boss turned and inspected\nme deliberately and painstakingly from head to heel for about--as\nit seemed to me--a quarter of an hour. After which he removed his\ncountenance and I saw it no more for some seconds; then it came around\nonce more, and this question greeted me--\n\n'Are you Horace Bigsby's cub?'\n\n'Yes, sir.'\n\nAfter this there was a pause and another inspection. Then--\n\n'What's your name?'\n\nI told him. He repeated it after me. It was probably the only thing he\never forgot; for although I was with him many months he never addressed\nhimself to me in any other way than 'Here!' and then his command\nfollowed.\n\n'Where was you born?'\n\n'In Florida, Missouri.'\n\nA pause. Then--\n\n'Dern sight better staid there!'\n\nBy means of a dozen or so of pretty direct questions, he pumped my\nfamily history out of me.\n\nThe leads were going now, in the first crossing. This interrupted the\ninquest. When the leads had been laid in, he resumed--\n\n'How long you been on the river?'\n\nI told him. After a pause--\n\n'Where'd you get them shoes?'\n\nI gave him the information.\n\n'Hold up your foot!'\n\nI did so. He stepped back, examined the shoe minutely and\ncontemptuously, scratching his head thoughtfully, tilting his\nhigh sugar-loaf hat well forward to facilitate the operation, then\nejaculated, 'Well, I'll be dod derned!' and returned to his wheel.\n\nWhat occasion there was to be dod derned about it is a thing which is\nstill as much of a mystery to me now as it was then. It must have\nbeen all of fifteen minutes--fifteen minutes of dull, homesick\nsilence--before that long horse-face swung round upon me again--and\nthen, what a change! It was as red as fire, and every muscle in it was\nworking. Now came this shriek--\n\n'Here!--You going to set there all day?'\n\nI lit in the middle of the floor, shot there by the electric\nsuddenness of the surprise. As soon as I could get my voice I said,\napologetically:--'I have had no orders, sir.'\n\n'You've had no _orders_! My, what a fine bird we are! We must have\n_orders_! Our father was a _gentleman_--owned slaves--and we've been\nto _school_. Yes, _we _are a gentleman, _too_, and got to have _orders!\norders_, is it? _Orders _is what you want! Dod dern my skin, _i'll_\nlearn you to swell yourself up and blow around here about your\ndod-derned _orders_! G'way from the wheel!' (I had approached it without\nknowing it.)\n\nI moved back a step or two, and stood as in a dream, all my senses\nstupefied by this frantic assault.\n\n'What you standing there for? Take that ice-pitcher down to the\ntexas-tender-come, move along, and don't you be all day about it!'\n\nThe moment I got back to the pilot-house, Brown said--\n\n'Here! What was you doing down there all this time?'\n\n'I couldn't find the texas-tender; I had to go all the way to the\npantry.'\n\n'Derned likely story! Fill up the stove.'\n\nI proceeded to do so. He watched me like a cat. Presently he shouted--\n\n'Put down that shovel! Deadest numskull I ever saw--ain't even got sense\nenough to load up a stove.'\n\nAll through the watch this sort of thing went on. Yes, and the\nsubsequent watches were much like it, during a stretch of months. As I\nhave said, I soon got the habit of coming on duty with dread. The moment\nI was in the presence, even in the darkest night, I could feel those\nyellow eyes upon me, and knew their owner was watching for a pretext to\nspit out some venom on me. Preliminarily he would say--\n\n'Here! Take the wheel.'\n\nTwo minutes later--\n\n'_Where _in the nation you going to? Pull her down! pull her down!'\n\nAfter another moment--\n\n'Say! You going to hold her all day? Let her go--meet her! meet her!'\n\nThen he would jump from the bench, snatch the wheel from me, and meet\nher himself, pouring out wrath upon me all the time.\n\nGeorge Ritchie was the other pilot's cub. He was having good times now;\nfor his boss, George Ealer, was as kindhearted as Brown wasn't. Ritchie\nhad steeled for Brown the season before; consequently he knew exactly\nhow to entertain himself and plague me, all by the one operation.\nWhenever I took the wheel for a moment on Ealer's watch, Ritchie would\nsit back on the bench and play Brown, with continual ejaculations of\n'Snatch her! snatch her! Derndest mud-cat I ever saw!' 'Here! Where you\ngoing _now_? Going to run over that snag?' 'Pull her _down_! Don't you\nhear me? Pull her _down!_' 'There she goes! _Just _as I expected! I\n_told_ you not to cramp that reef. G'way from the wheel!'\n\nSo I always had a rough time of it, no matter whose watch it was; and\nsometimes it seemed to me that Ritchie's good-natured badgering was\npretty nearly as aggravating as Brown's dead-earnest nagging.\n\nI often wanted to kill Brown, but this would not answer. A cub had\nto take everything his boss gave, in the way of vigorous comment and\ncriticism; and we all believed that there was a United States law making\nit a penitentiary offense to strike or threaten a pilot who was on\nduty. However, I could _imagine _myself killing Brown; there was no law\nagainst that; and that was the thing I used always to do the moment I\nwas abed. Instead of going over my river in my mind as was my duty,\nI threw business aside for pleasure, and killed Brown. I killed Brown\nevery night for months; not in old, stale, commonplace ways, but in new\nand picturesque ones;--ways that were sometimes surprising for freshness\nof design and ghastliness of situation and environment.\n\nBrown was _always _watching for a pretext to find fault; and if he could\nfind no plausible pretext, he would invent one. He would scold you for\nshaving a shore, and for not shaving it; for hugging a bar, and for not\nhugging it; for 'pulling down' when not invited, and for not pulling\ndown when not invited; for firing up without orders, and for waiting\n_for_ orders. In a word, it was his invariable rule to find fault with\n_everything _you did; and another invariable rule of his was to throw\nall his remarks (to you) into the form of an insult.\n\nOne day we were approaching New Madrid, bound down and heavily laden.\nBrown was at one side of the wheel, steering; I was at the other,\nstanding by to 'pull down' or 'shove up.' He cast a furtive glance at me\nevery now and then. I had long ago learned what that meant; viz., he was\ntrying to invent a trap for me. I wondered what shape it was going to\ntake. By and by he stepped back from the wheel and said in his usual\nsnarly way--\n\n'Here!--See if you've got gumption enough to round her to.'\n\nThis was simply _bound _to be a success; nothing could prevent it; for\nhe had never allowed me to round the boat to before; consequently, no\nmatter how I might do the thing, he could find free fault with it. He\nstood back there with his greedy eye on me, and the result was what\nmight have been foreseen: I lost my head in a quarter of a minute, and\ndidn't know what I was about; I started too early to bring the boat\naround, but detected a green gleam of joy in Brown's eye, and corrected\nmy mistake; I started around once more while too high up, but corrected\nmyself again in time; I made other false moves, and still managed to\nsave myself; but at last I grew so confused and anxious that I tumbled\ninto the very worst blunder of all--I got too far down before beginning\nto fetch the boat around. Brown's chance was come.\n\nHis face turned red with passion; he made one bound, hurled me across\nthe house with a sweep of his arm, spun the wheel down, and began to\npour out a stream of vituperation upon me which lasted till he was out\nof breath. In the course of this speech he called me all the different\nkinds of hard names he could think of, and once or twice I thought he\nwas even going to swear--but he didn't this time. 'Dod dern' was the\nnearest he ventured to the luxury of swearing, for he had been brought\nup with a wholesome respect for future fire and brimstone.\n\nThat was an uncomfortable hour; for there was a big audience on the\nhurricane deck. When I went to bed that night, I killed Brown in\nseventeen different ways--all of them new.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 19\n\nBrown and I Exchange Compliments\n\nTwo trips later, I got into serious trouble. Brown was steering; I was\n'pulling down.' My younger brother appeared on the hurricane deck, and\nshouted to Brown to stop at some landing or other a mile or so below.\nBrown gave no intimation that he had heard anything. But that was his\nway: he never condescended to take notice of an under clerk. The wind\nwas blowing; Brown was deaf (although he always pretended he wasn't),\nand I very much doubted if he had heard the order. If I had two heads,\nI would have spoken; but as I had only one, it seemed judicious to take\ncare of it; so I kept still.\n\nPresently, sure enough, we went sailing by that plantation. Captain\nKlinefelter appeared on the deck, and said--\n\n'Let her come around, sir, let her come around. Didn't Henry tell you to\nland here?'\n\n'_No_, sir!'\n\n'I sent him up to do, it.'\n\n'He did come up; and that's all the good it done, the dod-derned fool.\nHe never said anything.'\n\n'Didn't _you _hear him?' asked the captain of me.\n\nOf course I didn't want to be mixed up in this business, but there was\nno way to avoid it; so I said--\n\n'Yes, sir.'\n\nI knew what Brown's next remark would be, before he uttered it; it was--\n\n'Shut your mouth! you never heard anything of the kind.'\n\nI closed my mouth according to instructions. An hour later, Henry\nentered the pilot-house, unaware of what had been going on. He was a\nthoroughly inoffensive boy, and I was sorry to see him come, for I knew\nBrown would have no pity on him. Brown began, straightway--\n\n'Here! why didn't you tell me we'd got to land at that plantation?'\n\n'I did tell you, Mr. Brown.'\n\n'It's a lie!'\n\nI said--\n\n'You lie, yourself. He did tell you.'\n\nBrown glared at me in unaffected surprise; and for as much as a moment\nhe was entirely speechless; then he shouted to me--\n\n'I'll attend to your case in half a minute!' then to Henry, 'And you\nleave the pilot-house; out with you!'\n\nIt was pilot law, and must be obeyed. The boy started out, and even had\nhis foot on the upper step outside the door, when Brown, with a sudden\naccess of fury, picked up a ten-pound lump of coal and sprang after him;\nbut I was between, with a heavy stool, and I hit Brown a good honest\nblow which stretched-him out.\n\nI had committed the crime of crimes--I had lifted my hand against a\npilot on duty! I supposed I was booked for the penitentiary sure, and\ncouldn't be booked any surer if I went on and squared my long account\nwith this person while I had the chance; consequently I stuck to him and\npounded him with my fists a considerable time--I do not know how long,\nthe pleasure of it probably made it seem longer than it really was;--but\nin the end he struggled free and jumped up and sprang to the wheel: a\nvery natural solicitude, for, all this time, here was this steamboat\ntearing down the river at the rate of fifteen miles an hour and nobody\nat the helm! However, Eagle Bend was two miles wide at this bank-full\nstage, and correspondingly long and deep; and the boat was steering\nherself straight down the middle and taking no chances. Still, that was\nonly luck--a body _might _have found her charging into the woods.\n\nPerceiving, at a glance, that the 'Pennsylvania' was in no danger, Brown\ngathered up the big spy-glass, war-club fashion, and ordered me out of\nthe pilot-house with more than Comanche bluster. But I was not afraid of\nhim now; so, instead of going, I tarried, and criticized his grammar; I\nreformed his ferocious speeches for him, and put them into good English,\ncalling his attention to the advantage of pure English over the bastard\ndialect of the Pennsylvanian collieries whence he was extracted.\nHe could have done his part to admiration in a cross-fire of mere\nvituperation, of course; but he was not equipped for this species of\ncontroversy; so he presently laid aside his glass and took the wheel,\nmuttering and shaking his head; and I retired to the bench. The racket\nhad brought everybody to the hurricane deck, and I trembled when I\nsaw the old captain looking up from the midst of the crowd. I said\nto myself, 'Now I _am_ done for!'--For although, as a rule, he was so\nfatherly and indulgent toward the boat's family, and so patient of minor\nshortcomings, he could be stern enough when the fault was worth it.\n\nI tried to imagine what he _would _do to a cub pilot who had been guilty\nof such a crime as mine, committed on a boat guard-deep with costly\nfreight and alive with passengers. Our watch was nearly ended. I thought\nI would go and hide somewhere till I got a chance to slide ashore. So\nI slipped out of the pilot-house, and down the steps, and around to\nthe texas door--and was in the act of gliding within, when the captain\nconfronted me! I dropped my head, and he stood over me in silence a\nmoment or two, then said impressively--\n\n'Follow me.'\n\nI dropped into his wake; he led the way to his parlor in the forward end\nof the texas. We were alone, now. He closed the after door; then moved\nslowly to the forward one and closed that. He sat down; I stood before\nhim. He looked at me some little time, then said--\n\n'So you have been fighting Mr. Brown?'\n\nI answered meekly--\n\n'Yes, sir.'\n\n'Do you know that that is a very serious matter?'\n\n'Yes, sir.'\n\n'Are you aware that this boat was plowing down the river fully five\nminutes with no one at the wheel?'\n\n'Yes, sir.'\n\n'Did you strike him first?'\n\n'Yes, sir.'\n\n'What with?'\n\n'A stool, sir.'\n\n'Hard?'\n\n'Middling, sir.'\n\n'Did it knock him down?'\n\n'He--he fell, sir.'\n\n'Did you follow it up? Did you do anything further?'\n\n'Yes, sir.'\n\n'What did you do?'\n\n'Pounded him, sir.'\n\n'Pounded him?'\n\n'Yes, sir.'\n\n'Did you pound him much?--that is, severely?'\n\n'One might call it that, sir, maybe.'\n\n'I'm deuced glad of it! Hark ye, never mention that I said that. You\nhave been guilty of a great crime; and don't you ever be guilty of it\nagain, on this boat. _But_--lay for him ashore! Give him a good sound\nthrashing, do you hear? I'll pay the expenses. Now go--and mind you, not\na word of this to anybody. Clear out with you!--you've been guilty of a\ngreat crime, you whelp!'\n\nI slid out, happy with the sense of a close shave and a mighty\ndeliverance; and I heard him laughing to himself and slapping his fat\nthighs after I had closed his door.\n\nWhen Brown came off watch he went straight to the captain, who was\ntalking with some passengers on the boiler deck, and demanded that I be\nput ashore in New Orleans--and added--\n\n'I'll never turn a wheel on this boat again while that cub stays.'\n\nThe captain said--\n\n'But he needn't come round when you are on watch, Mr. Brown.\n\n'I won't even stay on the same boat with him. One of us has got to go\nashore.'\n\n'Very well,' said the captain, 'let it be yourself;' and resumed his\ntalk with the passengers.\n\nDuring the brief remainder of the trip, I knew how an emancipated slave\nfeels; for I was an emancipated slave myself. While we lay at landings,\nI listened to George Ealer's flute; or to his readings from his two\nbibles, that is to say, Goldsmith and Shakespeare; or I played chess\nwith him--and would have beaten him sometimes, only he always took back\nhis last move and ran the game out differently.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 20\n\nA Catastrophe\n\nWE lay three days in New Orleans, but the captain did not succeed in\nfinding another pilot; so he proposed that I should stand a daylight\nwatch, and leave the night watches to George Ealer. But I was afraid; I\nhad never stood a watch of any sort by myself, and I believed I should\nbe sure to get into trouble in the head of some chute, or ground the\nboat in a near cut through some bar or other. Brown remained in his\nplace; but he would not travel with me. So the captain gave me an order\non the captain of the 'A. T. Lacey,' for a passage to St. Louis, and\nsaid he would find a new pilot there and my steersman's berth could\nthen be resumed. The 'Lacey' was to leave a couple of days after the\n'Pennsylvania.'\n\nThe night before the '_Pennsylvania_' left, Henry and I sat chatting\non a freight pile on the levee till midnight. The subject of the chat,\nmainly, was one which I think we had not exploited before--steamboat\ndisasters. One was then on its way to us, little as we suspected it;\nthe water which was to make the steam which should cause it, was washing\npast some point fifteen hundred miles up the river while we talked;--but\nit would arrive at the right time and the right place. We doubted if\npersons not clothed with authority were of much use in cases of disaster\nand attendant panic; still, they might be of _some _use; so we decided\nthat if a disaster ever fell within our experience we would at least\nstick to the boat, and give such minor service as chance might throw in\nthe way. Henry remembered this, afterward, when the disaster came, and\nacted accordingly.\n\nThe 'Lacey' started up the river two days behind the 'Pennsylvania.' We\ntouched at Greenville, Mississippi, a couple of days out, and somebody\nshouted--\n\n'The “Pennsylvania” is blown up at Ship Island, and a hundred and fifty\nlives lost!'\n\nAt Napoleon, Arkansas, the same evening, we got an extra, issued by a\nMemphis paper, which gave some particulars. It mentioned my brother, and\nsaid he was not hurt.\n\nFurther up the river we got a later extra. My brother was again\nmentioned; but this time as being hurt beyond help. We did not get\nfull details of the catastrophe until we reached Memphis. This is the\nsorrowful story--\n\nIt was six o'clock on a hot summer morning. The 'Pennsylvania' was\ncreeping along, north of Ship Island, about sixty miles below Memphis on\na half-head of steam, towing a wood-flat which was fast being emptied.\nGeorge Ealer was in the pilot-house-alone, I think; the second engineer\nand a striker had the watch in the engine room; the second mate had\nthe watch on deck; George Black, Mr. Wood, and my brother, clerks, were\nasleep, as were also Brown and the head engineer, the carpenter, the\nchief mate, and one striker; Captain Klinefelter was in the barber's\nchair, and the barber was preparing to shave him. There were a good many\ncabin passengers aboard, and three or four hundred deck passengers--so\nit was said at the time--and not very many of them were astir. The wood\nbeing nearly all out of the flat now, Ealer rang to 'come ahead' full\nsteam, and the next moment four of the eight boilers exploded with a\nthunderous crash, and the whole forward third of the boat was hoisted\ntoward the sky! The main part of the mass, with the chimneys, dropped\nupon the boat again, a mountain of riddled and chaotic rubbish--and\nthen, after a little, fire broke out.\n\nMany people were flung to considerable distances, and fell in the\nriver; among these were Mr. Wood and my brother, and the carpenter. The\ncarpenter was still stretched upon his mattress when he struck the water\nseventy-five feet from the boat. Brown, the pilot, and George Black,\nchief clerk, were never seen or heard of after the explosion. The\nbarber's chair, with Captain Klinefelter in it and unhurt, was left with\nits back overhanging vacancy--everything forward of it, floor and all,\nhad disappeared; and the stupefied barber, who was also unhurt,\nstood with one toe projecting over space, still stirring his lather\nunconsciously, and saying, not a word.\n\nWhen George Ealer saw the chimneys plunging aloft in front of him, he\nknew what the matter was; so he muffled his face in the lapels of his\ncoat, and pressed both hands there tightly to keep this protection in\nits place so that no steam could get to his nose or mouth. He had ample\ntime to attend to these details while he was going up and returning. He\npresently landed on top of the unexploded boilers, forty feet below the\nformer pilot-house, accompanied by his wheel and a rain of other stuff,\nand enveloped in a cloud of scalding steam. All of the many who breathed\nthat steam, died; none escaped. But Ealer breathed none of it. He made\nhis way to the free air as quickly as he could; and when the steam\ncleared away he returned and climbed up on the boilers again, and\npatiently hunted out each and every one of his chessmen and the several\njoints of his flute.\n\nBy this time the fire was beginning to threaten. Shrieks and groans\nfilled the air. A great many persons had been scalded, a great many\ncrippled; the explosion had driven an iron crowbar through one man's\nbody--I think they said he was a priest. He did not die at once, and his\nsufferings were very dreadful. A young French naval cadet, of fifteen,\nson of a French admiral, was fearfully scalded, but bore his tortures\nmanfully. Both mates were badly scalded, but they stood to their posts,\nnevertheless. They drew the wood-boat aft, and they and the captain\nfought back the frantic herd of frightened immigrants till the wounded\ncould be brought there and placed in safety first.\n\nWhen Mr. Wood and Henry fell in the water, they struck out for shore,\nwhich was only a few hundred yards away; but Henry presently said he\nbelieved he was not hurt (what an unaccountable error!), and therefore\nwould swim back to the boat and help save the wounded. So they parted,\nand Henry returned.\n\nBy this time the fire was making fierce headway, and several persons\nwho were imprisoned under the ruins were begging piteously for help.\nAll efforts to conquer the fire proved fruitless; so the buckets were\npresently thrown aside and the officers fell-to with axes and tried to\ncut the prisoners out. A striker was one of the captives; he said he was\nnot injured, but could not free himself; and when he saw that the fire\nwas likely to drive away the workers, he begged that some one would\nshoot him, and thus save him from the more dreadful death. The fire did\ndrive the axmen away, and they had to listen, helpless, to this poor\nfellow's supplications till the flames ended his miseries.\n\nThe fire drove all into the wood-flat that could be accommodated there;\nit was cut adrift, then, and it and the burning steamer floated down\nthe river toward Ship Island. They moored the flat at the head of the\nisland, and there, unsheltered from the blazing sun, the half-naked\noccupants had to remain, without food or stimulants, or help for their\nhurts, during the rest of the day. A steamer came along, finally,\nand carried the unfortunates to Memphis, and there the most lavish\nassistance was at once forthcoming. By this time Henry was insensible.\nThe physicians examined his injuries and saw that they were fatal, and\nnaturally turned their main attention to patients who could be saved.\n\nForty of the wounded were placed upon pallets on the floor of a great\npublic hall, and among these was Henry. There the ladies of Memphis\ncame every day, with flowers, fruits, and dainties and delicacies of\nall kinds, and there they remained and nursed the wounded. All the\nphysicians stood watches there, and all the medical students; and the\nrest of the town furnished money, or whatever else was wanted. And\nMemphis knew how to do all these things well; for many a disaster\nlike the 'Pennsylvania's' had happened near her doors, and she was\nexperienced, above all other cities on the river, in the gracious office\nof the Good Samaritan.'\n\nThe sight I saw when I entered that large hall was new and strange to\nme. Two long rows of prostrate forms--more than forty, in all--and every\nface and head a shapeless wad of loose raw cotton. It was a gruesome\nspectacle. I watched there six days and nights, and a very melancholy\nexperience it was. There was one daily incident which was peculiarly\ndepressing: this was the removal of the doomed to a chamber apart. It\nwas done in order that the _morale _of the other patients might not be\ninjuriously affected by seeing one of their number in the death-agony.\nThe fated one was always carried out with as little stir as possible,\nand the stretcher was always hidden from sight by a wall of assistants;\nbut no matter: everybody knew what that cluster of bent forms, with\nits muffled step and its slow movement meant; and all eyes watched it\nwistfully, and a shudder went abreast of it like a wave.\n\nI saw many poor fellows removed to the 'death-room,' and saw them no\nmore afterward. But I saw our chief mate carried thither more than\nonce. His hurts were frightful, especially his scalds. He was clothed in\nlinseed oil and raw cotton to his waist, and resembled nothing human.\nHe was often out of his mind; and then his pains would make him rave and\nshout and sometimes shriek. Then, after a period of dumb exhaustion, his\ndisordered imagination would suddenly transform the great apartment into\na forecastle, and the hurrying throng of nurses into the crew; and\nhe would come to a sitting posture and shout, 'Hump yourselves, _hump\n_yourselves, you petrifactions, snail-bellies, pall-bearers! going to\nbe all _day_ getting that hatful of freight out?' and supplement this\nexplosion with a firmament-obliterating irruption or profanity which\nnothing could stay or stop till his crater was empty. And now and then\nwhile these frenzies possessed him, he would tear off handfuls of the\ncotton and expose his cooked flesh to view. It was horrible. It was\nbad for the others, of course--this noise and these exhibitions; so the\ndoctors tried to give him morphine to quiet him. But, in his mind or out\nof it, he would not take it. He said his wife had been killed by that\ntreacherous drug, and he would die before he would take it. He suspected\nthat the doctors were concealing it in his ordinary medicines and in his\nwater--so he ceased from putting either to his lips. Once, when he had\nbeen without water during two sweltering days, he took the dipper in his\nhand, and the sight of the limpid fluid, and the misery of his thirst,\ntempted him almost beyond his strength; but he mastered himself and\nthrew it away, and after that he allowed no more to be brought near him.\nThree times I saw him carried to the death-room, insensible and supposed\nto be dying; but each time he revived, cursed his attendants, and\ndemanded to be taken back. He lived to be mate of a steamboat again.\n\nBut he was the only one who went to the death-room and returned alive.\nDr. Peyton, a principal physician, and rich in all the attributes that\ngo to constitute high and flawless character, did all that educated\njudgment and trained skill could do for Henry; but, as the newspapers\nhad said in the beginning, his hurts were past help. On the evening of\nthe sixth day his wandering mind busied itself with matters far away,\nand his nerveless fingers 'picked at his coverlet.' His hour had struck;\nwe bore him to the death-room, poor boy.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 21\n\nA Section in My Biography\n\nIN due course I got my license. I was a pilot now, full fledged. I\ndropped into casual employments; no misfortunes resulting, intermittent\nwork gave place to steady and protracted engagements. Time drifted\nsmoothly and prosperously on, and I supposed--and hoped--that I was\ngoing to follow the river the rest of my days, and die at the wheel\nwhen my mission was ended. But by and by the war came, commerce was\nsuspended, my occupation was gone.\n\nI had to seek another livelihood. So I became a silver miner in Nevada;\nnext, a newspaper reporter; next, a gold miner, in California; next, a\nreporter in San Francisco; next, a special correspondent in the Sandwich\nIslands; next, a roving correspondent in Europe and the East; next,\nan instructional torch-bearer on the lecture platform; and, finally, I\nbecame a scribbler of books, and an immovable fixture among the other\nrocks of New England.\n\nIn so few words have I disposed of the twenty-one slow-drifting years\nthat have come and gone since I last looked from the windows of a\npilot-house.\n\nLet us resume, now.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 22\n\nI Return to My Muttons\n\nAFTER twenty-one years' absence, I felt a very strong desire to see the\nriver again, and the steamboats, and such of the boys as might be left;\nso I resolved to go out there. I enlisted a poet for company, and a\nstenographer to 'take him down,' and started westward about the middle\nof April.\n\nAs I proposed to make notes, with a view to printing, I took some\nthought as to methods of procedure. I reflected that if I were\nrecognized, on the river, I should not be as free to go and come, talk,\ninquire, and spy around, as I should be if unknown; I remembered that it\nwas the custom of steamboatmen in the old times to load up the confiding\nstranger with the most picturesque and admirable lies, and put\nthe sophisticated friend off with dull and ineffectual facts: so I\nconcluded, that, from a business point of view, it would be an advantage\nto disguise our party with fictitious names. The idea was certainly\ngood, but it bred infinite bother; for although Smith, Jones, and\nJohnson are easy names to remember when there is no occasion to remember\nthem, it is next to impossible to recollect them when they are wanted.\nHow do criminals manage to keep a brand-new _alias _in mind? This is a\ngreat mystery. I was innocent; and yet was seldom able to lay my hand on\nmy new name when it was needed; and it seemed to me that if I had had\na crime on my conscience to further confuse me, I could never have kept\nthe name by me at all.\n\nWe left per Pennsylvania Railroad, at 8 A.M. April 18.\n\n'EVENING. Speaking of dress. Grace and picturesqueness drop gradually\nout of it as one travels away from New York.'\n\nI find that among my notes. It makes no difference which direction you\ntake, the fact remains the same. Whether you move north, south, east,\nor west, no matter: you can get up in the morning and guess how far you\nhave come, by noting what degree of grace and picturesqueness is by that\ntime lacking in the costumes of the new passengers,--I do not mean of\nthe women alone, but of both sexes. It may be that _carriage _is at the\nbottom of this thing; and I think it is; for there are plenty of ladies\nand gentlemen in the provincial cities whose garments are all made\nby the best tailors and dressmakers of New York; yet this has no\nperceptible effect upon the grand fact: the educated eye never mistakes\nthose people for New-Yorkers. No, there is a godless grace, and snap,\nand style about a born and bred New-Yorker which mere clothing cannot\neffect.\n\n'APRIL 19. This morning, struck into the region of full\ngoatees--sometimes accompanied by a mustache, but only occasionally.'\n\nIt was odd to come upon this thick crop of an obsolete and uncomely\nfashion; it was like running suddenly across a forgotten acquaintance\nwhom you had supposed dead for a generation. The goatee extends over\na wide extent of country; and is accompanied by an iron-clad belief in\nAdam and the biblical history of creation, which has not suffered from\nthe assaults of the scientists.\n\n'AFTERNOON. At the railway stations the loafers carry _both _hands in\ntheir breeches pockets; it was observable, heretofore, that one hand\nwas sometimes out of doors,--here, never. This is an important fact in\ngeography.'\n\nIf the loafers determined the character of a country, it would be still\nmore important, of course.\n\n'Heretofore, all along, the station-loafer has been often observed to\nscratch one shin with the other foot; here, these remains of activity\nare wanting. This has an ominous look.'\n\nBy and by, we entered the tobacco-chewing region. Fifty years ago, the\ntobacco-chewing region covered the Union. It is greatly restricted now.\n\nNext, boots began to appear. Not in strong force, however. Later--away\ndown the Mississippi--they became the rule. They disappeared from other\nsections of the Union with the mud; no doubt they will disappear from\nthe river villages, also, when proper pavements come in.\n\nWe reached St. Louis at ten o'clock at night. At the counter of the\nhotel I tendered a hurriedly-invented fictitious name, with a miserable\nattempt at careless ease. The clerk paused, and inspected me in the\ncompassionate way in which one inspects a respectable person who is\nfound in doubtful circumstances; then he said--\n\n'It's all right; I know what sort of a room you want. Used to clerk at\nthe St. James, in New York.'\n\nAn unpromising beginning for a fraudulent career. We started to the\nsupper room, and met two other men whom I had known elsewhere. How odd\nand unfair it is: wicked impostors go around lecturing under my _Nom\nDe Guerre_ and nobody suspects them; but when an honest man attempts an\nimposture, he is exposed at once.\n\nOne thing seemed plain: we must start down the river the next day, if\npeople who could not be deceived were going to crop up at this rate:\nan unpalatable disappointment, for we had hoped to have a week in\nSt. Louis. The Southern was a good hotel, and we could have had a\ncomfortable time there. It is large, and well conducted, and its\ndecorations do not make one cry, as do those of the vast Palmer House,\nin Chicago. True, the billiard-tables were of the Old Silurian Period,\nand the cues and balls of the Post-Pliocene; but there was refreshment\nin this, not discomfort; for there is rest and healing in the\ncontemplation of antiquities.\n\nThe most notable absence observable in the billiard-room, was the\nabsence of the river man. If he was there he had taken in his sign,\nhe was in disguise. I saw there none of the swell airs and graces, and\nostentatious displays of money, and pompous squanderings of it, which\nused to distinguish the steamboat crowd from the dry-land crowd in\nthe bygone days, in the thronged billiard-rooms of St. Louis. In those\ntimes, the principal saloons were always populous with river men; given\nfifty players present, thirty or thirty-five were likely to be from\nthe river. But I suspected that the ranks were thin now, and the\nsteamboatmen no longer an aristocracy. Why, in my time they used to\ncall the 'barkeep' Bill, or Joe, or Tom, and slap him on the shoulder;\nI watched for that. But none of these people did it. Manifestly a glory\nthat once was had dissolved and vanished away in these twenty-one years.\n\nWhen I went up to my room, I found there the young man called Rogers,\ncrying. Rogers was not his name; neither was Jones, Brown, Dexter,\nFerguson, Bascom, nor Thompson; but he answered to either of these that\na body found handy in an emergency; or to any other name, in fact, if he\nperceived that you meant him. He said--\n\n'What is a person to do here when he wants a drink of water?--drink this\nslush?'\n\n'Can't you drink it?'\n\n'I could if I had some other water to wash it with.'\n\nHere was a thing which had not changed; a score of years had not\naffected this water's mulatto complexion in the least; a score of\ncenturies would succeed no better, perhaps. It comes out of the\nturbulent, bank-caving Missouri, and every tumblerful of it holds nearly\nan acre of land in solution. I got this fact from the bishop of the\ndiocese. If you will let your glass stand half an hour, you can separate\nthe land from the water as easy as Genesis; and then you will find them\nboth good: the one good to eat, the other good to drink. The land is\nvery nourishing, the water is thoroughly wholesome. The one appeases\nhunger; the other, thirst. But the natives do not take them separately,\nbut together, as nature mixed them. When they find an inch of mud in the\nbottom of a glass, they stir it up, and then take the draught as they\nwould gruel. It is difficult for a stranger to get used to this batter,\nbut once used to it he will prefer it to water. This is really the case.\nIt is good for steamboating, and good to drink; but it is worthless for\nall other purposes, except baptizing.\n\nNext morning, we drove around town in the rain. The city seemed but\nlittle changed. It _was _greatly changed, but it did not seem so;\nbecause in St. Louis, as in London and Pittsburgh, you can't persuade\na new thing to look new; the coal smoke turns it into an antiquity the\nmoment you take your hand off it. The place had just about doubled its\nsize, since I was a resident of it, and was now become a city of 400,000\ninhabitants; still, in the solid business parts, it looked about as it\nhad looked formerly. Yet I am sure there is not as much smoke in St.\nLouis now as there used to be. The smoke used to bank itself in a dense\nbillowy black canopy over the town, and hide the sky from view. This\nshelter is very much thinner now; still, there is a sufficiency of smoke\nthere, I think. I heard no complaint.\n\nHowever, on the outskirts changes were apparent enough; notably in\ndwelling-house architecture. The fine new homes are noble and beautiful\nand modern. They stand by themselves, too, with green lawns around them;\nwhereas the dwellings of a former day are packed together in blocks,\nand are all of one pattern, with windows all alike, set in an arched\nframe-work of twisted stone; a sort of house which was handsome enough\nwhen it was rarer.\n\nThere was another change--the Forest Park. This was new to me. It is\nbeautiful and very extensive, and has the excellent merit of having been\nmade mainly by nature. There are other parks, and fine ones, notably\nTower Grove and the Botanical Gardens; for St. Louis interested herself\nin such improvements at an earlier day than did the most of our cities.\n\nThe first time I ever saw St. Louis, I could have bought it for six\nmillion dollars, and it was the mistake of my life that I did not do\nit. It was bitter now to look abroad over this domed and steepled\nmetropolis, this solid expanse of bricks and mortar stretching away on\nevery hand into dim, measure-defying distances, and remember that I had\nallowed that opportunity to go by. Why I should have allowed it to go\nby seems, of course, foolish and inexplicable to-day, at a first glance;\nyet there were reasons at the time to justify this course.\n\nA Scotchman, Hon. Charles Augustus Murray, writing some forty-five\nor fifty years ago, said--'The streets are narrow, ill paved and ill\nlighted.' Those streets are narrow still, of course; many of them are\nill paved yet; but the reproach of ill lighting cannot be repeated, now.\nThe 'Catholic New Church' was the only notable building then, and Mr.\nMurray was confidently called upon to admire it, with its 'species of\nGrecian portico, surmounted by a kind of steeple, much too diminutive\nin its proportions, and surmounted by sundry ornaments' which the\nunimaginative Scotchman found himself 'quite unable to describe;' and\ntherefore was grateful when a German tourist helped him out with the\nexclamation--'By--, they look exactly like bed-posts!' St. Louis is\nwell equipped with stately and noble public buildings now, and the\nlittle church, which the people used to be so proud of, lost its\nimportance a long time ago. Still, this would not surprise Mr. Murray,\nif he could come back; for he prophesied the coming greatness of St.\nLouis with strong confidence.\n\nThe further we drove in our inspection-tour, the more sensibly I\nrealized how the city had grown since I had seen it last; changes in\ndetail became steadily more apparent and frequent than at first, too:\nchanges uniformly evidencing progress, energy, prosperity.\n\nBut the change of changes was on the 'levee.' This time, a departure\nfrom the rule. Half a dozen sound-asleep steamboats where I used to see\na solid mile of wide-awake ones! This was melancholy, this was\nwoeful. The absence of the pervading and jocund steamboatman from the\nbilliard-saloon was explained. He was absent because he is no more. His\noccupation is gone, his power has passed away, he is absorbed into the\ncommon herd, he grinds at the mill, a shorn Samson and inconspicuous.\nHalf a dozen lifeless steamboats, a mile of empty wharves, a negro\nfatigued with whiskey stretched asleep, in a wide and soundless vacancy,\nwhere the serried hosts of commerce used to contend!{footnote [Capt.\nMarryat, writing forty-five years ago says: 'St. Louis has 20,000\ninhabitants. _The river abreast of the town is crowded with steamboats,\nlying in two or three tiers_.']} Here was desolation, indeed.\n\n'The old, old sea, as one in tears, Comes murmuring, with foamy lips,\nAnd knocking at the vacant piers, Calls for his long-lost multitude of\nships.'\n\nThe towboat and the railroad had done their work, and done it well and\ncompletely. The mighty bridge, stretching along over our heads, had\ndone its share in the slaughter and spoliation. Remains of former\nsteamboatmen told me, with wan satisfaction, that the bridge doesn't\npay. Still, it can be no sufficient compensation to a corpse, to know\nthat the dynamite that laid him out was not of as good quality as it had\nbeen supposed to be.\n\nThe pavements along the river front were bad: the sidewalks were rather\nout of repair; there was a rich abundance of mud. All this was familiar\nand satisfying; but the ancient armies of drays, and struggling throngs\nof men, and mountains of freight, were gone; and Sabbath reigned in\ntheir stead. The immemorial mile of cheap foul doggeries remained, but\nbusiness was dull with them; the multitudes of poison-swilling Irishmen\nhad departed, and in their places were a few scattering handfuls of\nragged negroes, some drinking, some drunk, some nodding, others\nasleep. St. Louis is a great and prosperous and advancing city; but the\nriver-edge of it seems dead past resurrection.\n\nMississippi steamboating was born about 1812; at the end of thirty\nyears, it had grown to mighty proportions; and in less than thirty\nmore, it was dead! A strangely short life for so majestic a creature. Of\ncourse it is not absolutely dead, neither is a crippled octogenarian who\ncould once jump twenty-two feet on level ground; but as contrasted with\nwhat it was in its prime vigor, Mississippi steamboating may be called\ndead.\n\nIt killed the old-fashioned keel-boating, by reducing the freight-trip\nto New Orleans to less than a week. The railroads have killed the\nsteamboat passenger traffic by doing in two or three days what the\nsteamboats consumed a week in doing; and the towing-fleets have killed\nthe through-freight traffic by dragging six or seven steamer-loads of\nstuff down the river at a time, at an expense so trivial that steamboat\ncompetition was out of the question.\n\nFreight and passenger way-traffic remains to the steamers. This is in\nthe hands--along the two thousand miles of river between St. Paul and\nNew Orleans---of two or three close corporations well fortified with\ncapital; and by able and thoroughly business-like management and system,\nthese make a sufficiency of money out of what is left of the once\nprodigious steamboating industry. I suppose that St. Louis and New\nOrleans have not suffered materially by the change, but alas for the\nwood-yard man!\n\nHe used to fringe the river all the way; his close-ranked merchandise\nstretched from the one city to the other, along the banks, and he sold\nuncountable cords of it every year for cash on the nail; but all\nthe scattering boats that are left burn coal now, and the seldomest\nspectacle on the Mississippi to-day is a wood-pile. Where now is the\nonce wood-yard man?\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 23\n\nTraveling Incognito\n\nMY idea was, to tarry a while in every town between St. Louis and New\nOrleans. To do this, it would be necessary to go from place to place by\nthe short packet lines. It was an easy plan to make, and would have been\nan easy one to follow, twenty years ago--but not now. There are wide\nintervals between boats, these days.\n\nI wanted to begin with the interesting old French settlements of St.\nGenevieve and Kaskaskia, sixty miles below St. Louis. There was only one\nboat advertised for that section--a Grand Tower packet. Still, one\nboat was enough; so we went down to look at her. She was a venerable\nrack-heap, and a fraud to boot; for she was playing herself for personal\nproperty, whereas the good honest dirt was so thickly caked all over her\nthat she was righteously taxable as real estate. There are places in\nNew England where her hurricane deck would be worth a hundred and fifty\ndollars an acre. The soil on her forecastle was quite good--the new crop\nof wheat was already springing from the cracks in protected places.\nThe companionway was of a dry sandy character, and would have been well\nsuited for grapes, with a southern exposure and a little subsoiling. The\nsoil of the boiler deck was thin and rocky, but good enough for grazing\npurposes. A colored boy was on watch here--nobody else visible. We\ngathered from him that this calm craft would go, as advertised, 'if she\ngot her trip;' if she didn't get it, she would wait for it.\n\n'Has she got any of her trip?'\n\n'Bless you, no, boss. She ain't unloadened, yit. She only come in dis\nmawnin'.'\n\nHe was uncertain as to when she might get her trip, but thought it might\nbe to-morrow or maybe next day. This would not answer at all; so we had\nto give up the novelty of sailing down the river on a farm. We had one\nmore arrow in our quiver: a Vicksburg packet, the 'Gold Dust,' was to\nleave at 5 P.M. We took passage in her for Memphis, and gave up the idea\nof stopping off here and there, as being impracticable. She was neat,\nclean, and comfortable. We camped on the boiler deck, and bought some\ncheap literature to kill time with. The vender was a venerable Irishman\nwith a benevolent face and a tongue that worked easily in the socket,\nand from him we learned that he had lived in St. Louis thirty-four years\nand had never been across the river during that period. Then he wandered\ninto a very flowing lecture, filled with classic names and allusions,\nwhich was quite wonderful for fluency until the fact became rather\napparent that this was not the first time, nor perhaps the fiftieth,\nthat the speech had been delivered. He was a good deal of a character,\nand much better company than the sappy literature he was selling. A\nrandom remark, connecting Irishmen and beer, brought this nugget of\ninformation out of him--\n\nThey don't drink it, sir. They can't drink it, sir. Give an Irishman\nlager for a month, and he's a dead man. An Irishman is lined with\ncopper, and the beer corrodes it. But whiskey polishes the copper and is\nthe saving of him, sir.'\n\nAt eight o'clock, promptly, we backed out and crossed the river. As we\ncrept toward the shore, in the thick darkness, a blinding glory of white\nelectric light burst suddenly from our forecastle, and lit up the\nwater and the warehouses as with a noon-day glare. Another big\nchange, this--no more flickering, smoky, pitch-dripping, ineffectual\ntorch-baskets, now: their day is past. Next, instead of calling out a\nscore of hands to man the stage, a couple of men and a hatful of\nsteam lowered it from the derrick where it was suspended, launched it,\ndeposited it in just the right spot, and the whole thing was over\nand done with before a mate in the olden time could have got his\nprofanity-mill adjusted to begin the preparatory services. Why this new\nand simple method of handling the stages was not thought of when the\nfirst steamboat was built, is a mystery which helps one to realize what\na dull-witted slug the average human being is.\n\nWe finally got away at two in the morning, and when I turned out at\nsix, we were rounding to at a rocky point where there was an old\nstone warehouse--at any rate, the ruins of it; two or three decayed\ndwelling-houses were near by, in the shelter of the leafy hills; but\nthere were no evidences of human or other animal life to be seen.\nI wondered if I had forgotten the river; for I had no recollection\nwhatever of this place; the shape of the river, too, was unfamiliar;\nthere was nothing in sight, anywhere, that I could remember ever having\nseen before. I was surprised, disappointed, and annoyed.\n\nWe put ashore a well-dressed lady and gentleman, and two well-dressed,\nlady-like young girls, together with sundry Russia-leather bags. A\nstrange place for such folk! No carriage was waiting. The party moved\noff as if they had not expected any, and struck down a winding country\nroad afoot.\n\nBut the mystery was explained when we got under way again; for these\npeople were evidently bound for a large town which lay shut in behind\na tow-head (i.e., new island) a couple of miles below this landing.\nI couldn't remember that town; I couldn't place it, couldn't call its\nname. So I lost part of my temper. I suspected that it might be St.\nGenevieve--and so it proved to be. Observe what this eccentric river had\nbeen about: it had built up this huge useless tow-head directly in\nfront of this town, cut off its river communications, fenced it away\ncompletely, and made a 'country' town of it. It is a fine old place,\ntoo, and deserved a better fate. It was settled by the French, and is a\nrelic of a time when one could travel from the mouths of the Mississippi\nto Quebec and be on French territory and under French rule all the way.\n\nPresently I ascended to the hurricane deck and cast a longing glance\ntoward the pilot-house.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 24\n\nMy Incognito is Exploded\n\nAFTER a close study of the face of the pilot on watch, I was satisfied\nthat I had never seen him before; so I went up there. The pilot\ninspected me; I re-inspected the pilot. These customary preliminaries\nover, I sat down on the high bench, and he faced about and went on with\nhis work. Every detail of the pilot-house was familiar to me, with one\nexception,--a large-mouthed tube under the breast-board. I puzzled over\nthat thing a considerable time; then gave up and asked what it was for.\n\n'To hear the engine-bells through.'\n\nIt was another good contrivance which ought to have been invented half a\ncentury sooner. So I was thinking, when the pilot asked--\n\n'Do you know what this rope is for?'\n\nI managed to get around this question, without committing myself.\n\n'Is this the first time you were ever in a pilot-house?'\n\nI crept under that one.\n\n'Where are you from?'\n\n'New England.'\n\n'First time you have ever been West?'\n\nI climbed over this one.\n\n'If you take an interest in such things, I can tell you what all these\nthings are for.'\n\nI said I should like it.\n\n'This,' putting his hand on a backing-bell rope, 'is to sound the\nfire-alarm; this,' putting his hand on a go-ahead bell, 'is to call the\ntexas-tender; this one,' indicating the whistle-lever, 'is to call the\ncaptain'--and so he went on, touching one object after another, and\nreeling off his tranquil spool of lies.\n\nI had never felt so like a passenger before. I thanked him, with\nemotion, for each new fact, and wrote it down in my note-book. The\npilot warmed to his opportunity, and proceeded to load me up in the good\nold-fashioned way. At times I was afraid he was going to rupture his\ninvention; but it always stood the strain, and he pulled through all\nright. He drifted, by easy stages, into revealments of the river's\nmarvelous eccentricities of one sort and another, and backed them up\nwith some pretty gigantic illustrations. For instance--\n\n'Do you see that little boulder sticking out of the water yonder? well,\nwhen I first came on the river, that was a solid ridge of rock, over\nsixty feet high and two miles long. All washed away but that.' [This\nwith a sigh.]\n\nI had a mighty impulse to destroy him, but it seemed to me that killing,\nin any ordinary way, would be too good for him.\n\nOnce, when an odd-looking craft, with a vast coal-scuttle slanting aloft\non the end of a beam, was steaming by in the distance, he indifferently\ndrew attention to it, as one might to an object grown wearisome through\nfamiliarity, and observed that it was an 'alligator boat.'\n\n'An alligator boat? What's it for?'\n\n'To dredge out alligators with.'\n\n'Are they so thick as to be troublesome?'\n\n'Well, not now, because the Government keeps them down. But they used\nto be. Not everywhere; but in favorite places, here and there, where\nthe river is wide and shoal-like Plum Point, and Stack Island, and so\non--places they call alligator beds.'\n\n'Did they actually impede navigation?'\n\n'Years ago, yes, in very low water; there was hardly a trip, then, that\nwe didn't get aground on alligators.'\n\nIt seemed to me that I should certainly have to get out my tomahawk.\nHowever, I restrained myself and said--\n\n'It must have been dreadful.'\n\n'Yes, it was one of the main difficulties about piloting. It was so\nhard to tell anything about the water; the damned things shift around\nso--never lie still five minutes at a time. You can tell a wind-reef,\nstraight off, by the look of it; you can tell a break; you can tell a\nsand-reef--that's all easy; but an alligator reef doesn't show up, worth\nanything. Nine times in ten you can't tell where the water is; and when\nyou do see where it is, like as not it ain't there when _you _get there,\nthe devils have swapped around so, meantime. Of course there were some\nfew pilots that could judge of alligator water nearly as well as they\ncould of any other kind, but they had to have natural talent for it; it\nwasn't a thing a body could learn, you had to be born with it. Let\nme see: there was Ben Thornburg, and Beck Jolly, and Squire Bell, and\nHorace Bixby, and Major Downing, and John Stevenson, and Billy Gordon,\nand Jim Brady, and George Ealer, and Billy Youngblood--all A-1 alligator\npilots. _They _could tell alligator water as far as another Christian\ncould tell whiskey. Read it?--Ah, _couldn't_ they, though! I only wish I\nhad as many dollars as they could read alligator water a mile and a half\noff. Yes, and it paid them to do it, too. A good alligator pilot could\nalways get fifteen hundred dollars a month. Nights, other people had to\nlay up for alligators, but those fellows never laid up for alligators;\nthey never laid up for anything but fog. They could _smell _the best\nalligator water it was said; I don't know whether it was so or not, and\nI think a body's got his hands full enough if he sticks to just what he\nknows himself, without going around backing up other people's say-so's,\nthough there's a plenty that ain't backward about doing it, as long as\nthey can roust out something wonderful to tell. Which is not the style\nof Robert Styles, by as much as three fathom--maybe quarter-_less_.'\n\n[My! Was this Rob Styles?--This mustached and stately figure?-A\nslim enough cub, in my time. How he has improved in comeliness in\nfive-and-twenty year and in the noble art of inflating his facts.] After\nthese musings, I said aloud--\n\n'I should think that dredging out the alligators wouldn't have done much\ngood, because they could come back again right away.'\n\n'If you had had as much experience of alligators as I have, you wouldn't\ntalk like that. You dredge an alligator once and he's _convinced_. It's\nthe last you hear of _him_. He wouldn't come back for pie. If there's\none thing that an alligator is more down on than another, it's being\ndredged. Besides, they were not simply shoved out of the way; the most\nof the scoopful were scooped aboard; they emptied them into the\nhold; and when they had got a trip, they took them to Orleans to the\nGovernment works.'\n\n'What for?'\n\n'Why, to make soldier-shoes out of their hides. All the Government shoes\nare made of alligator hide. It makes the best shoes in the world. They\nlast five years, and they won't absorb water. The alligator fishery is\na Government monopoly. All the alligators are Government property--just\nlike the live-oaks. You cut down a live-oak, and Government fines you\nfifty dollars; you kill an alligator, and up you go for misprision\nof treason--lucky duck if they don't hang you, too. And they will, if\nyou're a Democrat. The buzzard is the sacred bird of the South, and you\ncan't touch him; the alligator is the sacred bird of the Government, and\nyou've got to let him alone.'\n\n'Do you ever get aground on the alligators now?'\n\n'Oh, no! it hasn't happened for years.'\n\n'Well, then, why do they still keep the alligator boats in service?'\n\n'Just for police duty--nothing more. They merely go up and down now\nand then. The present generation of alligators know them as easy as a\nburglar knows a roundsman; when they see one coming, they break camp and\ngo for the woods.'\n\nAfter rounding-out and finishing-up and polishing-off the alligator\nbusiness, he dropped easily and comfortably into the historical vein,\nand told of some tremendous feats of half-a-dozen old-time steamboats\nof his acquaintance, dwelling at special length upon a certain\nextraordinary performance of his chief favorite among this distinguished\nfleet--and then adding--\n\n'That boat was the “_Cyclone_,”--last trip she ever made--she sunk, that\nvery trip--captain was Tom Ballou, the most immortal liar that ever I\nstruck. He couldn't ever seem to tell the truth, in any kind of weather.\nWhy, he would make you fairly shudder. He _was _the most scandalous\nliar! I left him, finally; I couldn't stand it. The proverb says, “like\nmaster, like man;” and if you stay with that kind of a man, you'll come\nunder suspicion by and by, just as sure as you live. He paid first-class\nwages; but said I, What's wages when your reputation's in danger? So I\nlet the wages go, and froze to my reputation. And I've never regretted\nit. Reputation's worth everything, ain't it? That's the way I look at\nit. He had more selfish organs than any seven men in the world--all\npacked in the stern-sheets of his skull, of course, where they belonged.\nThey weighed down the back of his head so that it made his nose tilt up\nin the air. People thought it was vanity, but it wasn't, it was malice.\nIf you only saw his foot, you'd take him to be nineteen feet high, but\nhe wasn't; it was because his foot was out of drawing. He was intended\nto be nineteen feet high, no doubt, if his foot was made first, but he\ndidn't get there; he was only five feet ten. That's what he was, and\nthat's what he is. You take the lies out of him, and he'll shrink to the\nsize of your hat; you take the malice out of him, and he'll disappear.\nThat “Cyclone” was a rattler to go, and the sweetest thing to steer that\never walked the waters. Set her amidships, in a big river, and just let\nher go; it was all you had to do. She would hold herself on a star\nall night, if you let her alone. You couldn't ever feel her rudder. It\nwasn't any more labor to steer her than it is to count the Republican\nvote in a South Carolina election. One morning, just at daybreak, the\nlast trip she ever made, they took her rudder aboard to mend it; I\ndidn't know anything about it; I backed her out from the wood-yard\nand went a-weaving down the river all serene. When I had gone about\ntwenty-three miles, and made four horribly crooked crossings--'\n\n'Without any rudder?'\n\n'Yes--old Capt. Tom appeared on the roof and began to find fault with me\nfor running such a dark night--'\n\n'Such a _dark night_?--Why, you said--'\n\n'Never mind what I said,--'twas as dark as Egypt now, though pretty soon\nthe moon began to rise, and--'\n\n'You mean the _sun_--because you started out just at break of--look\nhere! Was this _before _you quitted the captain on account of his lying,\nor--'\n\n'It was before--oh, a long time before. And as I was saying, he--'\n\n'But was this the trip she sunk, or was--'\n\n'Oh, no!--months afterward. And so the old man, he--'\n\n'Then she made _two _last trips, because you said--'\n\nHe stepped back from the wheel, swabbing away his perspiration, and\nsaid--\n\n'Here!' (calling me by name), '_you _take her and lie a while--you're\nhandier at it than I am. Trying to play yourself for a stranger and an\ninnocent!--why, I knew you before you had spoken seven words; and I made\nup my mind to find out what was your little game. It was to _draw me\nout_. Well, I let you, didn't I? Now take the wheel and finish the\nwatch; and next time play fair, and you won't have to work your\npassage.'\n\nThus ended the fictitious-name business. And not six hours out from St.\nLouis! but I had gained a privilege, any way, for I had been itching\nto get my hands on the wheel, from the beginning. I seemed to have\nforgotten the river, but I hadn't forgotten how to steer a steamboat,\nnor how to enjoy it, either.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 25\n\nFrom Cairo to Hickman\n\nTHE scenery, from St. Louis to Cairo--two hundred miles--is varied and\nbeautiful. The hills were clothed in the fresh foliage of spring now,\nand were a gracious and worthy setting for the broad river flowing\nbetween. Our trip began auspiciously, with a perfect day, as to\nbreeze and sunshine, and our boat threw the miles out behind her with\nsatisfactory despatch.\n\nWe found a railway intruding at Chester, Illinois; Chester has also a\npenitentiary now, and is otherwise marching on. At Grand Tower, too,\nthere was a railway; and another at Cape Girardeau. The former town gets\nits name from a huge, squat pillar of rock, which stands up out of the\nwater on the Missouri side of the river--a piece of nature's fanciful\nhandiwork--and is one of the most picturesque features of the scenery of\nthat region. For nearer or remoter neighbors, the Tower has the Devil's\nBake Oven--so called, perhaps, because it does not powerfully resemble\nanybody else's bake oven; and the Devil's Tea Table--this latter a great\nsmooth-surfaced mass of rock, with diminishing wine-glass stem, perched\nsome fifty or sixty feet above the river, beside a beflowered and\ngarlanded precipice, and sufficiently like a tea-table to answer for\nanybody, Devil or Christian. Away down the river we have the Devil's\nElbow and the Devil's Race-course, and lots of other property of his\nwhich I cannot now call to mind.\n\nThe Town of Grand Tower was evidently a busier place than it had been in\nold times, but it seemed to need some repairs here and there, and a new\ncoat of whitewash all over. Still, it was pleasant to me to see the old\ncoat once more. 'Uncle' Mumford, our second officer, said the place had\nbeen suffering from high water, and consequently was not looking its\nbest now. But he said it was not strange that it didn't waste white-wash\non itself, for more lime was made there, and of a better quality, than\nanywhere in the West; and added--'On a dairy farm you never can get any\nmilk for your coffee, nor any sugar for it on a sugar plantation; and it\nis against sense to go to a lime town to hunt for white-wash.' In my own\nexperience I knew the first two items to be true; and also that people\nwho sell candy don't care for candy; therefore there was plausibility in\nUncle Mumford's final observation that 'people who make lime run more to\nreligion than whitewash.' Uncle Mumford said, further, that Grand Tower\nwas a great coaling center and a prospering place.\n\nCape Girardeau is situated on a hillside, and makes a handsome\nappearance. There is a great Jesuit school for boys at the foot of the\ntown by the river. Uncle Mumford said it had as high a reputation for\nthoroughness as any similar institution in Missouri! There was another\ncollege higher up on an airy summit--a bright new edifice, picturesquely\nand peculiarly towered and pinnacled--a sort of gigantic casters, with\nthe cruets all complete. Uncle Mumford said that Cape Girardeau was the\nAthens of Missouri, and contained several colleges besides those already\nmentioned; and all of them on a religious basis of one kind or another.\nHe directed my attention to what he called the 'strong and pervasive\nreligious look of the town,' but I could not see that it looked more\nreligious than the other hill towns with the same slope and built of the\nsame kind of bricks. Partialities often make people see more than really\nexists.\n\nUncle Mumford has been thirty years a mate on the river. He is a man of\npractical sense and a level head; has observed; has had much experience\nof one sort and another; has opinions; has, also, just a perceptible\ndash of poetry in his composition, an easy gift of speech, a thick\ngrowl in his voice, and an oath or two where he can get at them when the\nexigencies of his office require a spiritual lift. He is a mate of the\nblessed old-time kind; and goes gravely damning around, when there is\nwork to the fore, in a way to mellow the ex-steamboatman's heart with\nsweet soft longings for the vanished days that shall come no more.\n'_Git _up there you! Going to be all day? Why d'n't you _say _you was\npetrified in your hind legs, before you shipped!'\n\nHe is a steady man with his crew; kind and just, but firm; so they\nlike him, and stay with him. He is still in the slouchy garb of the\nold generation of mates; but next trip the Anchor Line will have him in\nuniform--a natty blue naval uniform, with brass buttons, along with all\nthe officers of the line--and then he will be a totally different style\nof scenery from what he is now.\n\nUniforms on the Mississippi! It beats all the other changes put\ntogether, for surprise. Still, there is another surprise--that it was\nnot made fifty years ago. It is so manifestly sensible, that it might\nhave been thought of earlier, one would suppose. During fifty years, out\nthere, the innocent passenger in need of help and information, has been\nmistaking the mate for the cook, and the captain for the barber--and\nbeing roughly entertained for it, too. But his troubles are ended now.\nAnd the greatly improved aspect of the boat's staff is another advantage\nachieved by the dress-reform period.\n\nSteered down the bend below Cape Girardeau. They used to call it\n'Steersman's Bend;' plain sailing and plenty of water in it, always;\nabout the only place in the Upper River that a new cub was allowed to\ntake a boat through, in low water.\n\nThebes, at the head of the Grand Chain, and Commerce at the foot of it,\nwere towns easily rememberable, as they had not undergone conspicuous\nalteration. Nor the Chain, either--in the nature of things; for it is a\nchain of sunken rocks admirably arranged to capture and kill steamboats\non bad nights. A good many steamboat corpses lie buried there, out of\nsight; among the rest my first friend the 'Paul Jones;' she knocked her\nbottom out, and went down like a pot, so the historian told me--Uncle\nMumford. He said she had a gray mare aboard, and a preacher. To me,\nthis sufficiently accounted for the disaster; as it did, of course, to\nMumford, who added--\n\n'But there are many ignorant people who would scoff at such a matter,\nand call it superstition. But you will always notice that they are\npeople who have never traveled with a gray mare and a preacher. I went\ndown the river once in such company. We grounded at Bloody Island; we\ngrounded at Hanging Dog; we grounded just below this same Commerce;\nwe jolted Beaver Dam Rock; we hit one of the worst breaks in the\n'Graveyard' behind Goose Island; we had a roustabout killed in a fight;\nwe burnt a boiler; broke a shaft; collapsed a flue; and went into Cairo\nwith nine feet of water in the hold--may have been more, may have been\nless. I remember it as if it were yesterday. The men lost their heads\nwith terror. They painted the mare blue, in sight of town, and threw the\npreacher overboard, or we should not have arrived at all. The preacher\nwas fished out and saved. He acknowledged, himself, that he had been to\nblame. I remember it all, as if it were yesterday.'\n\nThat this combination--of preacher and gray mare--should breed calamity,\nseems strange, and at first glance unbelievable; but the fact is\nfortified by so much unassailable proof that to doubt is to dishonor\nreason. I myself remember a case where a captain was warned by numerous\nfriends against taking a gray mare and a preacher with him, but\npersisted in his purpose in spite of all that could be said; and the\nsame day--it may have been the next, and some say it was, though I think\nit was the same day--he got drunk and fell down the hatchway, and was\nborne to his home a corpse. This is literally true.\n\nNo vestige of Hat Island is left now; every shred of it is washed away.\nI do not even remember what part of the river it used to be in,\nexcept that it was between St. Louis and Cairo somewhere. It was a bad\nregion--all around and about Hat Island, in early days. A farmer who\nlived on the Illinois shore there, said that twenty-nine steamboats had\nleft their bones strung along within sight from his house. Between\nSt. Louis and Cairo the steamboat wrecks average one to the mile;--two\nhundred wrecks, altogether.\n\nI could recognize big changes from Commerce down. Beaver Dam Rock was\nout in the middle of the river now, and throwing a prodigious 'break;'\nit used to be close to the shore, and boats went down outside of it.\nA big island that used to be away out in mid-river, has retired to the\nMissouri shore, and boats do not go near it any more. The island called\nJacket Pattern is whittled down to a wedge now, and is booked for early\ndestruction. Goose Island is all gone but a little dab the size of a\nsteamboat. The perilous 'Graveyard,' among whose numberless wrecks\nwe used to pick our way so slowly and gingerly, is far away from the\nchannel now, and a terror to nobody. One of the islands formerly called\nthe Two Sisters is gone entirely; the other, which used to lie close\nto the Illinois shore, is now on the Missouri side, a mile away; it is\njoined solidly to the shore, and it takes a sharp eye to see where the\nseam is--but it is Illinois ground yet, and the people who live on\nit have to ferry themselves over and work the Illinois roads and pay\nIllinois taxes: singular state of things!\n\nNear the mouth of the river several islands were missing--washed away.\nCairo was still there--easily visible across the long, flat point upon\nwhose further verge it stands; but we had to steam a long way around\nto get to it. Night fell as we were going out of the 'Upper River' and\nmeeting the floods of the Ohio. We dashed along without anxiety; for\nthe hidden rock which used to lie right in the way has moved up stream\na long distance out of the channel; or rather, about one county has gone\ninto the river from the Missouri point, and the Cairo point has 'made\ndown' and added to its long tongue of territory correspondingly. The\nMississippi is a just and equitable river; it never tumbles one man's\nfarm overboard without building a new farm just like it for that man's\nneighbor. This keeps down hard feelings.\n\nGoing into Cairo, we came near killing a steamboat which paid no\nattention to our whistle and then tried to cross our bows. By doing some\nstrong backing, we saved him; which was a great loss, for he would have\nmade good literature.\n\nCairo is a brisk town now; and is substantially built, and has a city\nlook about it which is in noticeable contrast to its former estate, as\nper Mr. Dickens's portrait of it. However, it was already building with\nbricks when I had seen it last--which was when Colonel (now General)\nGrant was drilling his first command there. Uncle Mumford says the\nlibraries and Sunday-schools have done a good work in Cairo, as well as\nthe brick masons. Cairo has a heavy railroad and river trade, and her\nsituation at the junction of the two great rivers is so advantageous\nthat she cannot well help prospering.\n\nWhen I turned out, in the morning, we had passed Columbus, Kentucky,\nand were approaching Hickman, a pretty town, perched on a handsome hill.\nHickman is in a rich tobacco region, and formerly enjoyed a great and\nlucrative trade in that staple, collecting it there in her warehouses\nfrom a large area of country and shipping it by boat; but Uncle Mumford\nsays she built a railway to facilitate this commerce a little more, and\nhe thinks it facilitated it the wrong way--took the bulk of the trade\nout of her hands by 'collaring it along the line without gathering it at\nher doors.'\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 26\n\nUnder Fire\n\nTALK began to run upon the war now, for we were getting down into the\nupper edge of the former battle-stretch by this time. Columbus was just\nbehind us, so there was a good deal said about the famous battle of\nBelmont. Several of the boat's officers had seen active service in the\nMississippi war-fleet. I gathered that they found themselves sadly out\nof their element in that kind of business at first, but afterward got\naccustomed to it, reconciled to it, and more or less at home in it. One\nof our pilots had his first war experience in the Belmont fight, as a\npilot on a boat in the Confederate service. I had often had a curiosity\nto know how a green hand might feel, in his maiden battle, perched all\nsolitary and alone on high in a pilot house, a target for Tom, Dick\nand Harry, and nobody at his elbow to shame him from showing the white\nfeather when matters grew hot and perilous around him; so, to me his\nstory was valuable--it filled a gap for me which all histories had left\ntill that time empty.\n\nTHE PILOT'S FIRST BATTLE\n\nHe said--\n\nIt was the 7th of November. The fight began at seven in the morning. I\nwas on the 'R. H. W. Hill.' Took over a load of troops from Columbus.\nCame back, and took over a battery of artillery. My partner said he\nwas going to see the fight; wanted me to go along. I said, no, I wasn't\nanxious, I would look at it from the pilot-house. He said I was a\ncoward, and left.\n\nThat fight was an awful sight. General Cheatham made his men strip their\ncoats off and throw them in a pile, and said, 'Now follow me to hell\nor victory!' I heard him say that from the pilot-house; and then he\ngalloped in, at the head of his troops. Old General Pillow, with his\nwhite hair, mounted on a white horse, sailed in, too, leading his troops\nas lively as a boy. By and by the Federals chased the rebels back, and\nhere they came! tearing along, everybody for himself and Devil take the\nhindmost! and down under the bank they scrambled, and took shelter. I\nwas sitting with my legs hanging out of the pilot-house window. All at\nonce I noticed a whizzing sound passing my ear. Judged it was a bullet.\nI didn't stop to think about anything, I just tilted over backwards and\nlanded on the floor, and staid there. The balls came booming around.\nThree cannon-balls went through the chimney; one ball took off the\ncorner of the pilot-house; shells were screaming and bursting all\naround. Mighty warm times--I wished I hadn't come.\n\nI lay there on the pilot-house floor, while the shots came faster\nand faster. I crept in behind the big stove, in the middle of the\npilot-house. Presently a minie-ball came through the stove, and just\ngrazed my head, and cut my hat. I judged it was time to go away\nfrom there. The captain was on the roof with a red-headed major from\nMemphis--a fine-looking man. I heard him say he wanted to leave here,\nbut 'that pilot is killed.' I crept over to the starboard side to pull\nthe bell to set her back; raised up and took a look, and I saw about\nfifteen shot holes through the window panes; had come so lively I hadn't\nnoticed them. I glanced out on the water, and the spattering shot were\nlike a hailstorm. I thought best to get out of that place. I went down\nthe pilot-house guy, head first--not feet first but head first--slid\ndown--before I struck the deck, the captain said we must leave there. So\nI climbed up the guy and got on the floor again. About that time, they\ncollared my partner and were bringing him up to the pilot-house between\ntwo soldiers. Somebody had said I was killed. He put his head in and saw\nme on the floor reaching for the backing bells. He said, 'Oh, hell, he\nain't shot,' and jerked away from the men who had him by the collar, and\nran below. We were there until three o'clock in the afternoon, and then\ngot away all right.\n\nThe next time I saw my partner, I said, 'Now, come out, be honest, and\ntell me the truth. Where did you go when you went to see that battle?'\nHe says, 'I went down in the hold.'\n\nAll through that fight I was scared nearly to death. I hardly knew\nanything, I was so frightened; but you see, nobody knew that but me.\nNext day General Polk sent for me, and praised me for my bravery and\ngallant conduct. I never said anything, I let it go at that. I judged it\nwasn't so, but it was not for me to contradict a general officer.\n\nPretty soon after that I was sick, and used up, and had to go off to\nthe Hot Springs. When there, I got a good many letters from commanders\nsaying they wanted me to come back. I declined, because I wasn't well\nenough or strong enough; but I kept still, and kept the reputation I had\nmade.\n\nA plain story, straightforwardly told; but Mumford told me that that\npilot had 'gilded that scare of his, in spots;' that his subsequent\ncareer in the war was proof of it.\n\nWe struck down through the chute of Island No. 8, and I went below\nand fell into conversation with a passenger, a handsome man, with easy\ncarriage and an intelligent face. We were approaching Island No. 10,\na place so celebrated during the war. This gentleman's home was on the\nmain shore in its neighborhood. I had some talk with him about the war\ntimes; but presently the discourse fell upon 'feuds,' for in no part of\nthe South has the vendetta flourished more briskly, or held out longer\nbetween warring families, than in this particular region. This gentleman\nsaid--\n\n'There's been more than one feud around here, in old times, but I reckon\nthe worst one was between the Darnells and the Watsons. Nobody don't\nknow now what the first quarrel was about, it's so long ago; the\nDarnells and the Watsons don't know, if there's any of them living,\nwhich I don't think there is. Some says it was about a horse or a\ncow--anyway, it was a little matter; the money in it wasn't of no\nconsequence--none in the world--both families was rich. The thing could\nhave been fixed up, easy enough; but no, that wouldn't do. Rough words\nhad been passed; and so, nothing but blood could fix it up after that.\nThat horse or cow, whichever it was, cost sixty years of killing and\ncrippling! Every year or so somebody was shot, on one side or the other;\nand as fast as one generation was laid out, their sons took up the feud\nand kept it a-going. And it's just as I say; they went on shooting each\nother, year in and year out--making a kind of a religion of it, you\nsee--till they'd done forgot, long ago, what it was all about. Wherever\na Darnell caught a Watson, or a Watson caught a Darnell, one of 'em was\ngoing to get hurt--only question was, which of them got the drop on\nthe other. They'd shoot one another down, right in the presence of the\nfamily. They didn't hunt for each other, but when they happened to meet,\nthey puffed and begun. Men would shoot boys, boys would shoot men. A man\nshot a boy twelve years old--happened on him in the woods, and didn't\ngive him no chance. If he _had _'a' given him a chance, the boy'd 'a'\nshot him. Both families belonged to the same church (everybody around\nhere is religious); through all this fifty or sixty years' fuss, both\ntribes was there every Sunday, to worship. They lived each side of the\nline, and the church was at a landing called Compromise. Half the church\nand half the aisle was in Kentucky, the other half in Tennessee. Sundays\nyou'd see the families drive up, all in their Sunday clothes, men,\nwomen, and children, and file up the aisle, and set down, quiet and\norderly, one lot on the Tennessee side of the church and the other on\nthe Kentucky side; and the men and boys would lean their guns up against\nthe wall, handy, and then all hands would join in with the prayer and\npraise; though they say the man next the aisle didn't kneel down, along\nwith the rest of the family; kind of stood guard. I don't know; never\nwas at that church in my life; but I remember that that's what used to\nbe said.\n\n'Twenty or twenty-five years ago, one of the feud families caught a\nyoung man of nineteen out and killed him. Don't remember whether it was\nthe Darnells and Watsons, or one of the other feuds; but anyway, this\nyoung man rode up--steamboat laying there at the time--and the first\nthing he saw was a whole gang of the enemy. He jumped down behind a\nwood-pile, but they rode around and begun on him, he firing back, and\nthey galloping and cavorting and yelling and banging away with all their\nmight. Think he wounded a couple of them; but they closed in on him\nand chased him into the river; and as he swum along down stream, they\nfollowed along the bank and kept on shooting at him; and when he struck\nshore he was dead. Windy Marshall told me about it. He saw it. He was\ncaptain of the boat.\n\n'Years ago, the Darnells was so thinned out that the old man and his two\nsons concluded they'd leave the country. They started to take steamboat\njust above No. 10; but the Watsons got wind of it; and they arrived just\nas the two young Darnells was walking up the companion-way with their\nwives on their arms. The fight begun then, and they never got no\nfurther--both of them killed. After that, old Darnell got into trouble\nwith the man that run the ferry, and the ferry-man got the worst\nof it--and died. But his friends shot old Darnell through and\nthrough--filled him full of bullets, and ended him.'\n\nThe country gentleman who told me these things had been reared in ease\nand comfort, was a man of good parts, and was college bred. His loose\ngrammar was the fruit of careless habit, not ignorance. This habit\namong educated men in the West is not universal, but it is\nprevalent--prevalent in the towns, certainly, if not in the cities; and\nto a degree which one cannot help noticing, and marveling at. I heard a\nWesterner who would be accounted a highly educated man in any country,\nsay 'never mind, it _don't make no difference_, anyway.' A life-long\nresident who was present heard it, but it made no impression upon her.\nShe was able to recall the fact afterward, when reminded of it; but\nshe confessed that the words had not grated upon her ear at the\ntime--a confession which suggests that if educated people can hear such\nblasphemous grammar, from such a source, and be unconscious of the deed,\nthe crime must be tolerably common--so common that the general ear has\nbecome dulled by familiarity with it, and is no longer alert, no longer\nsensitive to such affronts.\n\nNo one in the world speaks blemishless grammar; no one has ever written\nit--_no_ one, either in the world or out of it (taking the Scriptures\nfor evidence on the latter point); therefore it would not be fair to\nexact grammatical perfection from the peoples of the Valley; but they\nand all other peoples may justly be required to refrain from _knowingly\nand purposely_ debauching their grammar.\n\nI found the river greatly changed at Island No. 10. The island which\nI remembered was some three miles long and a quarter of a mile wide,\nheavily timbered, and lay near the Kentucky shore--within two hundred\nyards of it, I should say. Now, however, one had to hunt for it with a\nspy-glass. Nothing was left of it but an insignificant little tuft, and\nthis was no longer near the Kentucky shore; it was clear over against\nthe opposite shore, a mile away. In war times the island had been an\nimportant place, for it commanded the situation; and, being heavily\nfortified, there was no getting by it. It lay between the upper and\nlower divisions of the Union forces, and kept them separate, until a\njunction was finally effected across the Missouri neck of land; but the\nisland being itself joined to that neck now, the wide river is without\nobstruction.\n\nIn this region the river passes from Kentucky into Tennessee, back into\nMissouri, then back into Kentucky, and thence into Tennessee again. So a\nmile or two of Missouri sticks over into Tennessee.\n\nThe town of New Madrid was looking very unwell; but otherwise unchanged\nfrom its former condition and aspect. Its blocks of frame-houses were\nstill grouped in the same old flat plain, and environed by the same\nold forests. It was as tranquil as formerly, and apparently had neither\ngrown nor diminished in size. It was said that the recent high water had\ninvaded it and damaged its looks. This was surprising news; for in low\nwater the river bank is very high there (fifty feet), and in my day an\noverflow had always been considered an impossibility. This present flood\nof 1882 Will doubtless be celebrated in the river's history for several\ngenerations before a deluge of like magnitude shall be seen. It put all\nthe unprotected low lands under water, from Cairo to the mouth; it broke\ndown the levees in a great many places, on both sides of the river;\nand in some regions south, when the flood was at its highest, the\nMississippi was _seventy miles_ wide! a number of lives were lost,\nand the destruction of property was fearful. The crops were destroyed,\nhouses washed away, and shelterless men and cattle forced to take refuge\non scattering elevations here and there in field and forest, and wait\nin peril and suffering until the boats put in commission by the national\nand local governments and by newspaper enterprise could come and rescue\nthem. The properties of multitudes of people were under water for\nmonths, and the poorer ones must have starved by the hundred if succor\nhad not been promptly afforded.{footnote [For a detailed and interesting\ndescription of the great flood, written on board of the New Orleans\n_Times-Democrat's_ relief-boat, see Appendix A]} The water had been\nfalling during a considerable time now, yet as a rule we found the banks\nstill under water.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 27\n\nSome Imported Articles\n\nWE met two steamboats at New Madrid. Two steamboats in sight at once! an\ninfrequent spectacle now in the lonesome Mississippi. The loneliness\nof this solemn, stupendous flood is impressive--and depressing. League\nafter league, and still league after league, it pours its chocolate tide\nalong, between its solid forest walls, its almost untenanted shores,\nwith seldom a sail or a moving object of any kind to disturb the surface\nand break the monotony of the blank, watery solitude; and so the day\ngoes, the night comes, and again the day--and still the same, night\nafter night and day after day--majestic, unchanging sameness of\nserenity, repose, tranquillity, lethargy, vacancy--symbol of eternity,\nrealization of the heaven pictured by priest and prophet, and longed for\nby the good and thoughtless!\n\nImmediately after the war of 1812, tourists began to come to America,\nfrom England; scattering ones at first, then a sort of procession of\nthem--a procession which kept up its plodding, patient march through the\nland during many, many years. Each tourist took notes, and went home and\npublished a book--a book which was usually calm, truthful, reasonable,\nkind; but which seemed just the reverse to our tender-footed\nprogenitors. A glance at these tourist-books shows us that in certain\nof its aspects the Mississippi has undergone no change since those\nstrangers visited it, but remains to-day about as it was then. The\nemotions produced in those foreign breasts by these aspects were not\nall formed on one pattern, of course; they _had _to be various, along\nat first, because the earlier tourists were obliged to originate their\nemotions, whereas in older countries one can always borrow emotions\nfrom one's predecessors. And, mind you, emotions are among the toughest\nthings in the world to manufacture out of whole cloth; it is easier\nto manufacture seven facts than one emotion. Captain Basil Hall. R.N.,\nwriting fifty-five years ago, says--\n\n'Here I caught the first glimpse of the object I had so long wished to\nbehold, and felt myself amply repaid at that moment for all the trouble\nI had experienced in coming so far; and stood looking at the river\nflowing past till it was too dark to distinguish anything. But it was\nnot till I had visited the same spot a dozen times, that I came to a\nright comprehension of the grandeur of the scene.'\n\nFollowing are Mrs. Trollope's emotions. She is writing a few months\nlater in the same year, 1827, and is coming in at the mouth of the\nMississippi--\n\n'The first indication of our approach to land was the appearance of this\nmighty river pouring forth its muddy mass of waters, and mingling with\nthe deep blue of the Mexican Gulf. I never beheld a scene so utterly\ndesolate as this entrance of the Mississippi. Had Dante seen it, he\nmight have drawn images of another Borgia from its horrors. One only\nobject rears itself above the eddying waters; this is the mast of a\nvessel long since wrecked in attempting to cross the bar, and it still\nstands, a dismal witness of the destruction that has been, and a boding\nprophet of that which is to come.'\n\nEmotions of Hon. Charles Augustus Murray (near St. Louis), seven years\nlater--\n\n'It is only when you ascend the mighty current for fifty or a hundred\nmiles, and use the eye of imagination as well as that of nature,\nthat you begin to understand all his might and majesty. You see him\nfertilizing a boundless valley, bearing along in his course the trophies\nof his thousand victories over the shattered forest--here carrying away\nlarge masses of soil with all their growth, and there forming islands,\ndestined at some future period to be the residence of man; and while\nindulging in this prospect, it is then time for reflection to suggest\nthat the current before you has flowed through two or three thousand\nmiles, and has yet to travel one thousand three hundred more before\nreaching its ocean destination.'\n\nReceive, now, the emotions of Captain Marryat, R.N. author of the sea\ntales, writing in 1837, three years after Mr. Murray--\n\n'Never, perhaps, in the records of nations, was there an instance of a\ncentury of such unvarying and unmitigated crime as is to be collected\nfrom the history of the turbulent and blood-stained Mississippi. The\nstream itself appears as if appropriate for the deeds which have been\ncommitted. It is not like most rivers, beautiful to the sight, bestowing\nfertility in its course; not one that the eye loves to dwell upon as\nit sweeps along, nor can you wander upon its banks, or trust yourself\nwithout danger to its stream. It is a furious, rapid, desolating\ntorrent, loaded with alluvial soil; and few of those who are received\ninto its waters ever rise again, {footnote [There was a foolish\nsuperstition of some little prevalence in that day, that the Mississippi\nwould neither buoy up a swimmer, nor permit a drowned person's body to\nrise to the surface.]} or can support themselves long upon its surface\nwithout assistance from some friendly log. It contains the coarsest and\nmost uneatable of fish, such as the cat-fish and such genus, and as\nyou descend, its banks are occupied with the fetid alligator, while the\npanther basks at its edge in the cane-brakes, almost impervious to man.\nPouring its impetuous waters through wild tracks covered with trees of\nlittle value except for firewood, it sweeps down whole forests in its\ncourse, which disappear in tumultuous confusion, whirled away by the\nstream now loaded with the masses of soil which nourished their roots,\noften blocking up and changing for a time the channel of the river,\nwhich, as if in anger at its being opposed, inundates and devastates the\nwhole country round; and as soon as it forces its way through its former\nchannel, plants in every direction the uprooted monarchs of the forest\n(upon whose branches the bird will never again perch, or the raccoon,\nthe opossum, or the squirrel climb) as traps to the adventurous\nnavigators of its waters by steam, who, borne down upon these concealed\ndangers which pierce through the planks, very often have not time to\nsteer for and gain the shore before they sink to the bottom. There are\nno pleasing associations connected with the great common sewer of\nthe Western America, which pours out its mud into the Mexican Gulf,\npolluting the clear blue sea for many miles beyond its mouth. It is a\nriver of desolation; and instead of reminding you, like other beautiful\nrivers, of an angel which has descended for the benefit of man, you\nimagine it a devil, whose energies have been only overcome by the\nwonderful power of steam.'\n\nIt is pretty crude literature for a man accustomed to handling a pen;\nstill, as a panorama of the emotions sent weltering through this noted\nvisitor's breast by the aspect and traditions of the 'great common\nsewer,' it has a value. A value, though marred in the matter of\nstatistics by inaccuracies; for the catfish is a plenty good enough fish\nfor anybody, and there are no panthers that are 'impervious to man.'\n\nLater still comes Alexander Mackay, of the Middle Temple, Barrister at\nLaw, with a better digestion, and no catfish dinner aboard, and feels as\nfollows--\n\n'The Mississippi! It was with indescribable emotions that I first felt\nmyself afloat upon its waters. How often in my schoolboy dreams, and in\nmy waking visions afterwards, had my imagination pictured to itself the\nlordly stream, rolling with tumultuous current through the boundless\nregion to which it has given its name, and gathering into itself, in its\ncourse to the ocean, the tributary waters of almost every latitude in\nthe temperate zone! Here it was then in its reality, and I, at length,\nsteaming against its tide. I looked upon it with that reverence with\nwhich everyone must regard a great feature of external nature.'\n\nSo much for the emotions. The tourists, one and all, remark upon the\ndeep, brooding loneliness and desolation of the vast river. Captain\nBasil Hall, who saw it at flood-stage, says--\n\n'Sometimes we passed along distances of twenty or thirty miles without\nseeing a single habitation. An artist, in search of hints for a painting\nof the deluge, would here have found them in abundance.'\n\nThe first shall be last, etc. just two hundred years ago, the old\noriginal first and gallantest of all the foreign tourists, pioneer, head\nof the procession, ended his weary and tedious discovery-voyage down the\nsolemn stretches of the great river--La Salle, whose name will last as\nlong as the river itself shall last. We quote from Mr. Parkman--\n\n'And now they neared their journey's end. On the sixth of April, the\nriver divided itself into three broad channels. La Salle followed that\nof the west, and D'Autray that of the east; while Tonty took the middle\npassage. As he drifted down the turbid current, between the low and\nmarshy shores, the brackish water changed to brine, and the breeze grew\nfresh with the salt breath of the sea. Then the broad bosom of the\ngreat Gulf opened on his sight, tossing its restless billows, limitless,\nvoiceless, lonely as when born of chaos, without a sail, without a sign\nof life.'\n\nThen, on a spot of solid ground, La Salle reared a column 'bearing the\narms of France; the Frenchmen were mustered under arms; and while the\nNew England Indians and their squaws looked on in wondering silence,\nthey chanted the _Te Deum, The Exaudiat_, and the _Domine Salvum Fac\nRegem_.'\n\nThen, whilst the musketry volleyed and rejoicing shouts burst forth,\nthe victorious discoverer planted the column, and made proclamation in a\nloud voice, taking formal possession of the river and the vast\ncountries watered by it, in the name of the King. The column bore this\ninscription--\n\nLOUIS LE GRAND, ROY DE FRANCE ET DE NAVARRE, REGNE; LE NEUVIEME AVRIL,\n1682.\n\nNew Orleans intended to fittingly celebrate, this present year, the\nbicentennial anniversary of this illustrious event; but when the\ntime came, all her energies and surplus money were required in other\ndirections, for the flood was upon the land then, making havoc and\ndevastation everywhere.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 28\n\nUncle Mumford Unloads\n\nALL day we swung along down the river, and had the stream almost wholly\nto ourselves. Formerly, at such a stage of the water, we should have\npassed acres of lumber rafts, and dozens of big coal barges; also\noccasional little trading-scows, peddling along from farm to farm, with\nthe peddler's family on board; possibly, a random scow, bearing a humble\nHamlet and Co. on an itinerant dramatic trip. But these were all absent.\nFar along in the day, we saw one steamboat; just one, and no more. She\nwas lying at rest in the shade, within the wooded mouth of the Obion\nRiver. The spy-glass revealed the fact that she was named for me--or\n_he_ was named for me, whichever you prefer. As this was the first time\nI had ever encountered this species of honor, it seems excusable to\nmention it, and at the same time call the attention of the authorities\nto the tardiness of my recognition of it.\n\nNoted a big change in the river, at Island 21. It was a very large\nisland, and used to be out toward mid-stream; but it is joined fast to\nthe main shore now, and has retired from business as an island.\n\nAs we approached famous and formidable Plum Point, darkness fell, but\nthat was nothing to shudder about--in these modern times. For now\nthe national government has turned the Mississippi into a sort of\ntwo-thousand-mile torchlight procession. In the head of every crossing,\nand in the foot of every crossing, the government has set up a\nclear-burning lamp. You are never entirely in the dark, now; there is\nalways a beacon in sight, either before you, or behind you, or abreast.\nOne might almost say that lamps have been squandered there. Dozens of\ncrossings are lighted which were not shoal when they were created,\nand have never been shoal since; crossings so plain, too, and also so\nstraight, that a steamboat can take herself through them without any\nhelp, after she has been through once. Lamps in such places are of\ncourse not wasted; it is much more convenient and comfortable for a\npilot to hold on them than on a spread of formless blackness that won't\nstay still; and money is saved to the boat, at the same time, for she\ncan of course make more miles with her rudder amidships than she can\nwith it squared across her stern and holding her back.\n\nBut this thing has knocked the romance out of piloting, to a large\nextent. It, and some other things together, have knocked all the romance\nout of it. For instance, the peril from snags is not now what it once\nwas. The government's snag-boats go patrolling up and down, in these\nmatter-of-fact days, pulling the river's teeth; they have rooted out\nall the old clusters which made many localities so formidable; and they\nallow no new ones to collect. Formerly, if your boat got away from you,\non a black night, and broke for the woods, it was an anxious time with\nyou; so was it also, when you were groping your way through solidified\ndarkness in a narrow chute; but all that is changed now--you flash out\nyour electric light, transform night into day in the twinkling of an\neye, and your perils and anxieties are at an end. Horace Bixby and\nGeorge Ritchie have charted the crossings and laid out the courses\nby compass; they have invented a lamp to go with the chart, and have\npatented the whole. With these helps, one may run in the fog now, with\nconsiderable security, and with a confidence unknown in the old days.\n\nWith these abundant beacons, the banishment of snags, plenty of daylight\nin a box and ready to be turned on whenever needed, and a chart and\ncompass to fight the fog with, piloting, at a good stage of water, is\nnow nearly as safe and simple as driving stage, and is hardly more than\nthree times as romantic.\n\nAnd now in these new days, these days of infinite change, the Anchor\nLine have raised the captain above the pilot by giving him the bigger\nwages of the two. This was going far, but they have not stopped there.\nThey have decreed that the pilot shall remain at his post, and stand\nhis watch clear through, whether the boat be under way or tied up to the\nshore. We, that were once the aristocrats of the river, can't go to bed\nnow, as we used to do, and sleep while a hundred tons of freight are\nlugged aboard; no, we must sit in the pilot-house; and keep awake, too.\nVerily we are being treated like a parcel of mates and engineers. The\nGovernment has taken away the romance of our calling; the Company has\ntaken away its state and dignity.\n\nPlum Point looked as it had always looked by night, with the exception\nthat now there were beacons to mark the crossings, and also a lot of\nother lights on the Point and along its shore; these latter glinting\nfrom the fleet of the United States River Commission, and from a village\nwhich the officials have built on the land for offices and for the\nemployees of the service. The military engineers of the Commission\nhave taken upon their shoulders the job of making the Mississippi over\nagain--a job transcended in size by only the original job of creating\nit. They are building wing-dams here and there, to deflect the current;\nand dikes to confine it in narrower bounds; and other dikes to make it\nstay there; and for unnumbered miles along the Mississippi, they are\nfelling the timber-front for fifty yards back, with the purpose of\nshaving the bank down to low-water mark with the slant of a house roof,\nand ballasting it with stones; and in many places they have protected\nthe wasting shores with rows of piles. One who knows the Mississippi\nwill promptly aver--not aloud, but to himself--that ten thousand River\nCommissions, with the mines of the world at their back, cannot tame that\nlawless stream, cannot curb it or confine it, cannot say to it, Go\nhere, or Go there, and make it obey; cannot save a shore which it has\nsentenced; cannot bar its path with an obstruction which it will not\ntear down, dance over, and laugh at. But a discreet man will not put\nthese things into spoken words; for the West Point engineers have not\ntheir superiors anywhere; they know all that can be known of their\nabstruse science; and so, since they conceive that they can fetter and\nhandcuff that river and boss him, it is but wisdom for the unscientific\nman to keep still, lie low, and wait till they do it. Captain Eads,\nwith his jetties, has done a work at the mouth of the Mississippi which\nseemed clearly impossible; so we do not feel full confidence now to\nprophesy against like impossibilities. Otherwise one would pipe out and\nsay the Commission might as well bully the comets in their courses and\nundertake to make them behave, as try to bully the Mississippi into\nright and reasonable conduct.\n\nI consulted Uncle Mumford concerning this and cognate matters; and I\ngive here the result, stenographically reported, and therefore to be\nrelied on as being full and correct; except that I have here and there\nleft out remarks which were addressed to the men, such as 'where in\nblazes are you going with that barrel now?' and which seemed to me to\nbreak the flow of the written statement, without compensating by adding\nto its information or its clearness. Not that I have ventured to\nstrike out all such interjections; I have removed only those which were\nobviously irrelevant; wherever one occurred which I felt any question\nabout, I have judged it safest to let it remain.\n\nUNCLE MUMFORD'S IMPRESSIONS\n\nUncle Mumford said--\n\n'As long as I have been mate of a steamboat--thirty years--I have\nwatched this river and studied it. Maybe I could have learnt more about\nit at West Point, but if I believe it I wish I may be _what are you\nsucking your fingers there for ?--collar that kag of nails!_ Four years\nat West Point, and plenty of books and schooling, will learn a man a\ngood deal, I reckon, but it won't learn him the river. You turn one\nof those little European rivers over to this Commission, with its hard\nbottom and clear water, and it would just be a holiday job for them to\nwall it, and pile it, and dike it, and tame it down, and boss it around,\nand make it go wherever they wanted it to, and stay where they put it,\nand do just as they said, every time. But this ain't that kind of a\nriver. They have started in here with big confidence, and the best\nintentions in the world; but they are going to get left. What does\nEcclesiastes vii. 13 say? Says enough to knock _their _little game\ngalley-west, don't it? Now you look at their methods once. There at\nDevil's Island, in the Upper River, they wanted the water to go one way,\nthe water wanted to go another. So they put up a stone wall. But what\ndoes the river care for a stone wall? When it got ready, it just bulged\nthrough it. Maybe they can build another that will stay; that is, up\nthere--but not down here they can't. Down here in the Lower River, they\ndrive some pegs to turn the water away from the shore and stop it from\nslicing off the bank; very well, don't it go straight over and cut\nsomebody else's bank? Certainly. Are they going to peg all the banks?\nWhy, they could buy ground and build a new Mississippi cheaper. They are\npegging Bulletin Tow-head now. It won't do any good. If the river has\ngot a mortgage on that island, it will foreclose, sure, pegs or no pegs.\nAway down yonder, they have driven two rows of piles straight through\nthe middle of a dry bar half a mile long, which is forty foot out of the\nwater when the river is low. What do you reckon that is for? If I know,\nI wish I may land in--_hump yourself, you son of an undertaker!--out\nwith that coal-oil, now, lively, lively!_ And just look at what they are\ntrying to do down there at Milliken's Bend. There's been a cut-off in\nthat section, and Vicksburg is left out in the cold. It's a country town\nnow. The river strikes in below it; and a boat can't go up to the town\nexcept in high water. Well, they are going to build wing-dams in the\nbend opposite the foot of 103, and throw the water over and cut off the\nfoot of the island and plow down into an old ditch where the river\nused to be in ancient times; and they think they can persuade the water\naround that way, and get it to strike in above Vicksburg, as it used\nto do, and fetch the town back into the world again. That is, they are\ngoing to take this whole Mississippi, and twist it around and make it\nrun several miles _up stream_. Well you've got to admire men that deal\nin ideas of that size and can tote them around without crutches; but you\nhaven't got to believe they can _do_ such miracles, have you! And yet\nyou ain't absolutely obliged to believe they can't. I reckon the safe\nway, where a man can afford it, is to copper the operation, and at the\nsame time buy enough property in Vicksburg to square you up in case they\nwin. Government is doing a deal for the Mississippi, now--spending loads\nof money on her. When there used to be four thousand steamboats and ten\nthousand acres of coal-barges, and rafts and trading scows, there wasn't\na lantern from St. Paul to New Orleans, and the snags were thicker than\nbristles on a hog's back; and now when there's three dozen steamboats\nand nary barge or raft, Government has snatched out all the snags, and\nlit up the shores like Broadway, and a boat's as safe on the river as\nshe'd be in heaven. And I reckon that by the time there ain't any boats\nleft at all, the Commission will have the old thing all reorganized, and\ndredged out, and fenced in, and tidied up, to a degree that will make\nnavigation just simply perfect, and absolutely safe and profitable; and\nall the days will be Sundays, and all the mates will be Sunday-school\nsu----_what-in-the-nation-you-fooling-around-there-for, you sons of\nunrighteousness, heirs of perdition! going to be a year getting that\nhogshead ashore?'_\n\nDuring our trip to New Orleans and back, we had many conversations\nwith river men, planters, journalists, and officers of the River\nCommission--with conflicting and confusing results. To wit:--\n\n1. Some believed in the Commission's scheme to arbitrarily and\npermanently confine (and thus deepen) the channel, preserve threatened\nshores, etc.\n\n2. Some believed that the Commission's money ought to be spent only on\nbuilding and repairing the great system of levees.\n\n3. Some believed that the higher you build your levee, the higher the\nriver's bottom will rise; and that consequently the levee system is a\nmistake.\n\n4. Some believed in the scheme to relieve the river, in flood-time, by\nturning its surplus waters off into Lake Borgne, etc.\n\n5. Some believed in the scheme of northern lake-reservoirs to replenish\nthe Mississippi in low-water seasons.\n\nWherever you find a man down there who believes in one of these theories\nyou may turn to the next man and frame your talk upon the hypothesis\nthat he does not believe in that theory; and after you have had\nexperience, you do not take this course doubtfully, or hesitatingly, but\nwith the confidence of a dying murderer--converted one, I mean. For you\nwill have come to know, with a deep and restful certainty, that you are\nnot going to meet two people sick of the same theory, one right after\nthe other. No, there will always be one or two with the other diseases\nalong between. And as you proceed, you will find out one or two other\nthings. You will find out that there is no distemper of the lot but is\ncontagious; and you cannot go where it is without catching it. You may\nvaccinate yourself with deterrent facts as much as you please--it will\ndo no good; it will seem to 'take,' but it doesn't; the moment you rub\nagainst any one of those theorists, make up your mind that it is time to\nhang out your yellow flag.\n\nYes, you are his sure victim: yet his work is not all to your hurt--only\npart of it; for he is like your family physician, who comes and cures\nthe mumps, and leaves the scarlet-fever behind. If your man is a\nLake-Borgne-relief theorist, for instance, he will exhale a cloud of\ndeadly facts and statistics which will lay you out with that disease,\nsure; but at the same time he will cure you of any other of the five\ntheories that may have previously got into your system.\n\nI have had all the five; and had them 'bad;' but ask me not, in mournful\nnumbers, which one racked me hardest, or which one numbered the biggest\nsick list, for I do not know. In truth, no one can answer the latter\nquestion. Mississippi Improvement is a mighty topic, down yonder. Every\nman on the river banks, south of Cairo, talks about it every day, during\nsuch moments as he is able to spare from talking about the war; and each\nof the several chief theories has its host of zealous partisans; but,\nas I have said, it is not possible to determine which cause numbers the\nmost recruits.\n\nAll were agreed upon one point, however: if Congress would make a\nsufficient appropriation, a colossal benefit would result. Very well;\nsince then the appropriation has been made--possibly a sufficient one,\ncertainly not too large a one. Let us hope that the prophecy will be\namply fulfilled.\n\nOne thing will be easily granted by the reader; that an opinion from Mr.\nEdward Atkinson, upon any vast national commercial matter, comes as near\nranking as authority, as can the opinion of any individual in the Union.\nWhat he has to say about Mississippi River Improvement will be found in\nthe Appendix.{footnote [See Appendix B.]}\n\nSometimes, half a dozen figures will reveal, as with a lightning-flash,\nthe importance of a subject which ten thousand labored words, with the\nsame purpose in view, had left at last but dim and uncertain. Here is a\ncase of the sort--paragraph from the 'Cincinnati Commercial'--\n\n'The towboat “Jos. B. Williams” is on her way to New Orleans with a\ntow of thirty-two barges, containing six hundred thousand bushels\n(seventy-six pounds to the bushel) of coal exclusive of her own fuel,\nbeing the largest tow ever taken to New Orleans or anywhere else in the\nworld. Her freight bill, at 3 cents a bushel, amounts to $18,000. It\nwould take eighteen hundred cars, of three hundred and thirty-three\nbushels to the car, to transport this amount of coal. At $10 per ton, or\n$100 per car, which would be a fair price for the distance by rail, the\nfreight bill would amount to $180,000, or $162,000 more by rail than by\nriver. The tow will be taken from Pittsburg to New Orleans in fourteen\nor fifteen days. It would take one hundred trains of eighteen cars to\nthe train to transport this one tow of six hundred thousand bushels\nof coal, and even if it made the usual speed of fast freight lines, it\nwould take one whole summer to put it through by rail.'\n\nWhen a river in good condition can enable one to save $162,000 and a\nwhole summer's time, on a single cargo, the wisdom of taking measures to\nkeep the river in good condition is made plain to even the uncommercial\nmind.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 29\n\nA Few Specimen Bricks\n\nWE passed through the Plum Point region, turned Craighead's Point,\nand glided unchallenged by what was once the formidable Fort Pillow,\nmemorable because of the massacre perpetrated there during the war.\nMassacres are sprinkled with some frequency through the histories of\nseveral Christian nations, but this is almost the only one that can be\nfound in American history; perhaps it is the only one which rises to a\nsize correspondent to that huge and somber title. We have the 'Boston\nMassacre,' where two or three people were killed; but we must bunch\nAnglo-Saxon history together to find the fellow to the Fort Pillow\ntragedy; and doubtless even then we must travel back to the days and the\nperformances of Coeur de Lion, that fine 'hero,' before we accomplish\nit.\n\nMore of the river's freaks. In times past, the channel used to strike\nabove Island 37, by Brandywine Bar, and down towards Island 39.\nAfterward, changed its course and went from Brandywine down through\nVogelman's chute in the Devil's Elbow, to Island 39--part of this course\nreversing the old order; the river running _up_ four or five miles,\ninstead of down, and cutting off, throughout, some fifteen miles of\ndistance. This in 1876. All that region is now called Centennial Island.\n\nThere is a tradition that Island 37 was one of the principal abiding\nplaces of the once celebrated 'Murel's Gang.' This was a colossal\ncombination of robbers, horse-thieves, negro-stealers, and\ncounterfeiters, engaged in business along the river some fifty or sixty\nyears ago. While our journey across the country towards St. Louis was in\nprogress we had had no end of Jesse James and his stirring history; for\nhe had just been assassinated by an agent of the Governor of Missouri,\nand was in consequence occupying a good deal of space in the newspapers.\nCheap histories of him were for sale by train boys. According to these,\nhe was the most marvelous creature of his kind that had ever existed. It\nwas a mistake. Murel was his equal in boldness; in pluck; in rapacity;\nin cruelty, brutality, heartlessness, treachery, and in general and\ncomprehensive vileness and shamelessness; and very much his superior\nin some larger aspects. James was a retail rascal; Murel, wholesale.\nJames's modest genius dreamed of no loftier flight than the planning\nof raids upon cars, coaches, and country banks; Murel projected negro\ninsurrections and the capture of New Orleans; and furthermore, on\noccasion, this Murel could go into a pulpit and edify the congregation.\nWhat are James and his half-dozen vulgar rascals compared with this\nstately old-time criminal, with his sermons, his meditated insurrections\nand city-captures, and his majestic following of ten hundred men, sworn\nto do his evil will!\n\nHere is a paragraph or two concerning this big operator, from a now\nforgotten book which was published half a century ago--\n\nHe appears to have been a most dexterous as well as consummate villain.\nWhen he traveled, his usual disguise was that of an itinerant preacher;\nand it is said that his discourses were very 'soul-moving'--interesting\nthe hearers so much that they forgot to look after their horses, which\nwere carried away by his confederates while he was preaching. But the\nstealing of horses in one State, and selling them in another, was but\na small portion of their business; the most lucrative was the enticing\nslaves to run away from their masters, that they might sell them in\nanother quarter. This was arranged as follows; they would tell a negro\nthat if he would run away from his master, and allow them to sell him,\nhe should receive a portion of the money paid for him, and that upon his\nreturn to them a second time they would send him to a free State, where\nhe would be safe.\n\nThe poor wretches complied with this request, hoping to obtain money and\nfreedom; they would be sold to another master, and run away again, to\ntheir employers; sometimes they would be sold in this manner three or\nfour times, until they had realized three or four thousand dollars by\nthem; but as, after this, there was fear of detection, the usual custom\nwas to get rid of the only witness that could be produced against them,\nwhich was the negro himself, by murdering him, and throwing his body\ninto the Mississippi. Even if it was established that they had stolen\na negro, before he was murdered, they were always prepared to evade\npunishment; for they concealed the negro who had run away, until he\nwas advertised, and a reward offered to any man who would catch him. An\nadvertisement of this kind warrants the person to take the property, if\nfound. And then the negro becomes a property in trust, when, therefore,\nthey sold the negro, it only became a breach of trust, not stealing; and\nfor a breach of trust, the owner of the property can only have redress\nby a civil action, which was useless, as the damages were never paid.\nIt may be inquired, how it was that Murel escaped Lynch law under such\ncircumstances This will be easily understood when it is stated that he\nhad _more than a thousand sworn confederates_, all ready at a moment's\nnotice to support any of the gang who might be in trouble. The names of\nall the principal confederates of Murel were obtained from himself, in\na manner which I shall presently explain. The gang was composed of two\nclasses: the Heads or Council, as they were called, who planned and\nconcerted, but seldom acted; they amounted to about four hundred.\nThe other class were the active agents, and were termed strikers, and\namounted to about six hundred and fifty. These were the tools in the\nhands of the others; they ran all the risk, and received but a small\nportion of the money; they were in the power of the leaders of the gang,\nwho would sacrifice them at any time by handing them over to justice, or\nsinking their bodies in the Mississippi. The general rendezvous of this\ngang of miscreants was on the Arkansas side of the river, where they\nconcealed their negroes in the morasses and cane-brakes.\n\nThe depredations of this extensive combination were severely felt; but\nso well were their plans arranged, that although Murel, who was always\nactive, was everywhere suspected, there was no proof to be obtained. It\nso happened, however, that a young man of the name of Stewart, who was\nlooking after two slaves which Murel had decoyed away, fell in with him\nand obtained his confidence, took the oath, and was admitted into the\ngang as one of the General Council. By this means all was discovered;\nfor Stewart turned traitor, although he had taken the oath, and having\nobtained every information, exposed the whole concern, the names of all\nthe parties, and finally succeeded in bringing home sufficient\nevidence against Murel, to procure his conviction and sentence to the\nPenitentiary (Murel was sentenced to fourteen years' imprisonment); so\nmany people who were supposed to be honest, and bore a respectable name\nin the different States, were found to be among the list of the Grand\nCouncil as published by Stewart, that every attempt was made to throw\ndiscredit upon his assertions--his character was vilified, and more\nthan one attempt was made to assassinate him. He was obliged to quit the\nSouthern States in consequence. It is, however, now well ascertained\nto have been all true; and although some blame Mr. Stewart for having\nviolated his oath, they no longer attempt to deny that his revelations\nwere correct. I will quote one or two portions of Murel's confessions to\nMr. Stewart, made to him when they were journeying together. I ought to\nhave observed, that the ultimate intentions of Murel and his associates\nwere, by his own account, on a very extended scale; having no less\nan object in view than _raising the blacks against the whites, taking\npossession of, and plundering new orleans, and making themselves\npossessors of the territory_. The following are a few extracts:--\n\n'I collected all my friends about New Orleans at one of our friends'\nhouses in that place, and we sat in council three days before we got all\nour plans to our notion; we then determined to undertake the rebellion\nat every hazard, and make as many friends as we could for that purpose.\nEvery man's business being assigned him, I started to Natchez on foot,\nhaving sold my horse in New Orleans,--with the intention of stealing\nanother after I started. I walked four days, and no opportunity offered\nfor me to get a horse. The fifth day, about twelve, I had become tired,\nand stopped at a creek to get some water and rest a little. While I was\nsitting on a log, looking down the road the way that I had come, a man\ncame in sight riding on a good-looking horse. The very moment I saw him,\nI was determined to have his horse, if he was in the garb of a traveler.\nHe rode up, and I saw from his equipage that he was a traveler. I arose\nand drew an elegant rifle pistol on him and ordered him to dismount. He\ndid so, and I took his horse by the bridle and pointed down the creek,\nand ordered him to walk before me. He went a few hundred yards and\nstopped. I hitched his horse, and then made him undress himself, all to\nhis shirt and drawers, and ordered him to turn his back to me. He said,\n'If you are determined to kill me, let me have time to pray before I\ndie,' I told him I had no time to hear him pray. He turned around and\ndropped on his knees, and I shot him through the back of the head.\n\nI ripped open his belly and took out his entrails, and sunk him in the\ncreek. I then searched his pockets, and found four hundred dollars and\nthirty-seven cents, and a number of papers that I did not take time to\nexamine. I sunk the pocket-book and papers and his hat, in the creek.\nHis boots were brand-new, and fitted me genteelly; and I put them on\nand sunk my old shoes in the creek, to atone for them. I rolled up his\nclothes and put them into his portmanteau, as they were brand-new cloth\nof the best quality. I mounted as fine a horse as ever I straddled, and\ndirected my course for Natchez in much better style than I had been for\nthe last five days.\n\n'Myself and a fellow by the name of Crenshaw gathered four good horses\nand started for Georgia. We got in company with a young South Carolinian\njust before we got to Cumberland Mountain, and Crenshaw soon knew all\nabout his business. He had been to Tennessee to buy a drove of hogs, but\nwhen he got there pork was dearer than he calculated, and he declined\npurchasing. We concluded he was a prize. Crenshaw winked at me; I\nunderstood his idea. Crenshaw had traveled the road before, but I never\nhad; we had traveled several miles on the mountain, when he passed near\na great precipice; just before we passed it Crenshaw asked me for my\nwhip, which had a pound of lead in the butt; I handed it to him, and he\nrode up by the side of the South Carolinian, and gave him a blow on the\nside of the head and tumbled him from his horse; we lit from our horses\nand fingered his pockets; we got twelve hundred and sixty-two dollars.\nCrenshaw said he knew a place to hide him, and he gathered him under his\narms, and I by his feet, and conveyed him to a deep crevice in the brow\nof the precipice, and tumbled him into it, and he went out of sight; we\nthen tumbled in his saddle, and took his horse with us, which was worth\ntwo hundred dollars.\n\n'We were detained a few days, and during that time our friend went to a\nlittle village in the neighborhood and saw the negro advertised (a negro\nin our possession), and a description of the two men of whom he had been\npurchased, and giving his suspicions of the men. It was rather squally\ntimes, but any port in a storm: we took the negro that night on the bank\nof a creek which runs by the farm of our friend, and Crenshaw shot him\nthrough the head. We took out his entrails and sunk him in the creek.\n\n'He had sold the other negro the third time on Arkansaw River for\nupwards of five hundred dollars; and then stole him and delivered him\ninto the hand of his friend, who conducted him to a swamp, and veiled\nthe tragic scene, and got the last gleanings and sacred pledge of\nsecrecy; as a game of that kind will not do unless it ends in a mystery\nto all but the fraternity. He sold the negro, first and last, for nearly\ntwo thousand dollars, and then put him for ever out of the reach of all\npursuers; and they can never graze him unless they can find the negro;\nand that they cannot do, for his carcass has fed many a tortoise and\ncatfish before this time, and the frogs have sung this many a long day\nto the silent repose of his skeleton.'\n\nWe were approaching Memphis, in front of which city, and witnessed by\nits people, was fought the most famous of the river battles of the Civil\nWar. Two men whom I had served under, in my river days, took part in\nthat fight: Mr. Bixby, head pilot of the Union fleet, and Montgomery,\nCommodore of the Confederate fleet. Both saw a great deal of active\nservice during the war, and achieved high reputations for pluck and\ncapacity.\n\nAs we neared Memphis, we began to cast about for an excuse to stay\nwith the 'Gold Dust' to the end of her course--Vicksburg. We were so\npleasantly situated, that we did not wish to make a change. I had an\nerrand of considerable importance to do at Napoleon, Arkansas, but\nperhaps I could manage it without quitting the 'Gold Dust.' I said as\nmuch; so we decided to stick to present quarters.\n\nThe boat was to tarry at Memphis till ten the next morning. It is a\nbeautiful city, nobly situated on a commanding bluff overlooking the\nriver. The streets are straight and spacious, though not paved in a way\nto incite distempered admiration. No, the admiration must be reserved\nfor the town's sewerage system, which is called perfect; a recent\nreform, however, for it was just the other way, up to a few years ago--a\nreform resulting from the lesson taught by a desolating visitation\nof the yellow-fever. In those awful days the people were swept off by\nhundreds, by thousands; and so great was the reduction caused by flight\nand by death together, that the population was diminished three-fourths,\nand so remained for a time. Business stood nearly still, and the streets\nbore an empty Sunday aspect.\n\nHere is a picture of Memphis, at that disastrous time, drawn by a German\ntourist who seems to have been an eye-witness of the scenes which he\ndescribes. It is from Chapter VII, of his book, just published, in\nLeipzig, 'Mississippi-Fahrten, von Ernst von Hesse-Wartegg.'--\n\n'In August the yellow-fever had reached its extremest height. Daily,\nhundreds fell a sacrifice to the terrible epidemic. The city was become\na mighty graveyard, two-thirds of the population had deserted the place,\nand only the poor, the aged and the sick, remained behind, a sure prey\nfor the insidious enemy. The houses were closed: little lamps burned in\nfront of many--a sign that here death had entered. Often, several lay\ndead in a single house; from the windows hung black crape. The stores\nwere shut up, for their owners were gone away or dead.\n\n'Fearful evil! In the briefest space it struck down and swept away even\nthe most vigorous victim. A slight indisposition, then an hour of\nfever, then the hideous delirium, then--the Yellow Death! On the street\ncorners, and in the squares, lay sick men, suddenly overtaken by the\ndisease; and even corpses, distorted and rigid. Food failed. Meat\nspoiled in a few hours in the fetid and pestiferous air, and turned\nblack.\n\n'Fearful clamors issue from many houses; then after a season they cease,\nand all is still: noble, self-sacrificing men come with the coffin,\nnail it up, and carry it away, to the graveyard. In the night stillness\nreigns. Only the physicians and the hearses hurry through the streets;\nand out of the distance, at intervals, comes the muffled thunder of the\nrailway train, which with the speed of the wind, and as if hunted by\nfuries, flies by the pest-ridden city without halting.'\n\nBut there is life enough there now. The population exceeds forty\nthousand and is augmenting, and trade is in a flourishing condition.\nWe drove about the city; visited the park and the sociable horde of\nsquirrels there; saw the fine residences, rose-clad and in other ways\nenticing to the eye; and got a good breakfast at the hotel.\n\nA thriving place is the Good Samaritan City of the Mississippi: has\na great wholesale jobbing trade; foundries, machine shops; and\nmanufactories of wagons, carriages, and cotton-seed oil; and is shortly\nto have cotton mills and elevators.\n\nHer cotton receipts reached five hundred thousand bales last year--an\nincrease of sixty thousand over the year before. Out from her healthy\ncommercial heart issue five trunk lines of railway; and a sixth is being\nadded.\n\nThis is a very different Memphis from the one which the vanished and\nunremembered procession of foreign tourists used to put into their books\nlong time ago. In the days of the now forgotten but once renowned and\nvigorously hated Mrs. Trollope, Memphis seems to have consisted mainly\nof one long street of log-houses, with some outlying cabins sprinkled\naround rearward toward the woods; and now and then a pig, and no end of\nmud. That was fifty-five years ago. She stopped at the hotel. Plainly it\nwas not the one which gave us our breakfast. She says--\n\n'The table was laid for fifty persons, and was nearly full. They ate in\nperfect silence, and with such astonishing rapidity that their dinner\nwas over literally before ours was begun; the only sounds heard were\nthose produced by the knives and forks, with the unceasing chorus of\ncoughing, _etc_.'\n\n'Coughing, etc.' The 'etc.' stands for an unpleasant word there, a word\nwhich she does not always charitably cover up, but sometimes prints. You\nwill find it in the following description of a steamboat dinner which\nshe ate in company with a lot of aristocratic planters; wealthy,\nwell-born, ignorant swells they were, tinselled with the usual harmless\nmilitary and judicial titles of that old day of cheap shams and windy\npretense--\n\n'The total want of all the usual courtesies of the table; the voracious\nrapidity with which the viands were seized and devoured; the strange\nuncouth phrases and pronunciation; the loathsome spitting, from the\ncontamination of which it was absolutely impossible to protect our\ndresses; the frightful manner of feeding with their knives, till the\nwhole blade seemed to enter into the mouth; and the still more frightful\nmanner of cleaning the teeth afterward with a pocket knife, soon forced\nus to feel that we were not surrounded by the generals, colonels, and\nmajors of the old world; and that the dinner hour was to be anything\nrather than an hour of enjoyment.'\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 30\n\nSketches by the Way\n\nIT was a big river, below Memphis; banks brimming full, everywhere, and\nvery frequently more than full, the waters pouring out over the land,\nflooding the woods and fields for miles into the interior; and in\nplaces, to a depth of fifteen feet; signs, all about, of men's hard work\ngone to ruin, and all to be done over again, with straitened means and a\nweakened courage. A melancholy picture, and a continuous one;--hundreds\nof miles of it. Sometimes the beacon lights stood in water three feet\ndeep, in the edge of dense forests which extended for miles without\nfarm, wood-yard, clearing, or break of any kind; which meant that the\nkeeper of the light must come in a skiff a great distance to discharge\nhis trust,--and often in desperate weather. Yet I was told that the\nwork is faithfully performed, in all weathers; and not always by\nmen, sometimes by women, if the man is sick or absent. The Government\nfurnishes oil, and pays ten or fifteen dollars a month for the lighting\nand tending. A Government boat distributes oil and pays wages once a\nmonth.\n\nThe Ship Island region was as woodsy and tenantless as ever. The island\nhas ceased to be an island; has joined itself compactly to the main\nshore, and wagons travel, now, where the steamboats used to navigate. No\nsigns left of the wreck of the 'Pennsylvania.' Some farmer will turn up\nher bones with his plow one day, no doubt, and be surprised.\n\nWe were getting down now into the migrating negro region. These poor\npeople could never travel when they were slaves; so they make up for\nthe privation now. They stay on a plantation till the desire to travel\nseizes them; then they pack up, hail a steamboat, and clear out. Not for\nany particular place; no, nearly any place will answer; they only want\nto be moving. The amount of money on hand will answer the rest of the\nconundrum for them. If it will take them fifty miles, very well; let it\nbe fifty. If not, a shorter flight will do.\n\nDuring a couple of days, we frequently answered these hails. Sometimes\nthere was a group of high-water-stained, tumble-down cabins, populous\nwith colored folk, and no whites visible; with grassless patches of dry\nground here and there; a few felled trees, with skeleton cattle, mules,\nand horses, eating the leaves and gnawing the bark--no other food for\nthem in the flood-wasted land. Sometimes there was a single lonely\nlanding-cabin; near it the colored family that had hailed us; little and\nbig, old and young, roosting on the scant pile of household goods; these\nconsisting of a rusty gun, some bed-ticks, chests, tinware, stools,\na crippled looking-glass, a venerable arm-chair, and six or eight\nbase-born and spiritless yellow curs, attached to the family by strings.\nThey must have their dogs; can't go without their dogs. Yet the dogs are\nnever willing; they always object; so, one after another, in ridiculous\nprocession, they are dragged aboard; all four feet braced and sliding\nalong the stage, head likely to be pulled off; but the tugger marching\ndeterminedly forward, bending to his work, with the rope over his\nshoulder for better purchase. Sometimes a child is forgotten and left on\nthe bank; but never a dog.\n\nThe usual river-gossip going on in the pilot-house. Island No. 63--an\nisland with a lovely 'chute,' or passage, behind it in the former times.\nThey said Jesse Jamieson, in the 'Skylark,' had a visiting pilot with\nhim one trip--a poor old broken-down, superannuated fellow--left him at\nthe wheel, at the foot of 63, to run off the watch. The ancient mariner\nwent up through the chute, and down the river outside; and up the chute\nand down the river again; and yet again and again; and handed the\nboat over to the relieving pilot, at the end of three hours of honest\nendeavor, at the same old foot of the island where he had originally\ntaken the wheel! A darkey on shore who had observed the boat go by,\nabout thirteen times, said, 'clar to gracious, I wouldn't be s'prised if\ndey's a whole line o' dem Sk'ylarks!'\n\nAnecdote illustrative of influence of reputation in the changing of\nopinion. The 'Eclipse' was renowned for her swiftness. One day she\npassed along; an old darkey on shore, absorbed in his own matters, did\nnot notice what steamer it was. Presently someone asked--\n\n'Any boat gone up?'\n\n'Yes, sah.'\n\n'Was she going fast?'\n\n'Oh, so-so--loafin' along.'\n\n'Now, do you know what boat that was?'\n\n'No, sah.'\n\n'Why, uncle, that was the “Eclipse.”'\n\n'No! Is dat so? Well, I bet it was--cause she jes' went by here\na-_sparklin_'!'\n\nPiece of history illustrative of the violent style of some of the people\ndown along here, During the early weeks of high water, A's fence rails\nwashed down on B's ground, and B's rails washed up in the eddy and\nlanded on A's ground. A said, 'Let the thing remain so; I will use your\nrails, and you use mine.' But B objected--wouldn't have it so. One day,\nA came down on B's ground to get his rails. B said, 'I'll kill you!' and\nproceeded for him with his revolver. A said, 'I'm not armed.' So B, who\nwished to do only what was right, threw down his revolver; then pulled\na knife, and cut A's throat all around, but gave his principal attention\nto the front, and so failed to sever the jugular. Struggling around, A\nmanaged to get his hands on the discarded revolver, and shot B dead with\nit--and recovered from his own injuries.\n\nFurther gossip;--after which, everybody went below to get afternoon\ncoffee, and left me at the wheel, alone, Something presently reminded\nme of our last hour in St. Louis, part of which I spent on this boat's\nhurricane deck, aft. I was joined there by a stranger, who dropped into\nconversation with me--a brisk young fellow, who said he was born in a\ntown in the interior of Wisconsin, and had never seen a steamboat until\na week before. Also said that on the way down from La Crosse he had\ninspected and examined his boat so diligently and with such passionate\ninterest that he had mastered the whole thing from stem to rudder-blade.\nAsked me where I was from. I answered, New England. 'Oh, a Yank!' said\nhe; and went chatting straight along, without waiting for assent or\ndenial. He immediately proposed to take me all over the boat and tell\nme the names of her different parts, and teach me their uses. Before I\ncould enter protest or excuse, he was already rattling glibly away at\nhis benevolent work; and when I perceived that he was misnaming the\nthings, and inhospitably amusing himself at the expense of an innocent\nstranger from a far country, I held my peace, and let him have his way.\nHe gave me a world of misinformation; and the further he went, the wider\nhis imagination expanded, and the more he enjoyed his cruel work of\ndeceit. Sometimes, after palming off a particularly fantastic and\noutrageous lie upon me, he was so 'full of laugh' that he had to\nstep aside for a minute, upon one pretext or another, to keep me from\nsuspecting. I staid faithfully by him until his comedy was finished.\nThen he remarked that he had undertaken to 'learn' me all about a\nsteamboat, and had done it; but that if he had overlooked anything, just\nask him and he would supply the lack. 'Anything about this boat that you\ndon't know the name of or the purpose of, you come to me and I'll tell\nyou.' I said I would, and took my departure; disappeared, and approached\nhim from another quarter, whence he could not see me. There he sat, all\nalone, doubling himself up and writhing this way and that, in the throes\nof unappeasable laughter. He must have made himself sick; for he was\nnot publicly visible afterward for several days. Meantime, the episode\ndropped out of my mind.\n\nThe thing that reminded me of it now, when I was alone at the wheel,\nwas the spectacle of this young fellow standing in the pilot-house door,\nwith the knob in his hand, silently and severely inspecting me. I don't\nknow when I have seen anybody look so injured as he did. He did not\nsay anything--simply stood there and looked; reproachfully looked and\npondered. Finally he shut the door, and started away; halted on the\ntexas a minute; came slowly back and stood in the door again, with that\ngrieved look in his face; gazed upon me awhile in meek rebuke, then\nsaid--\n\n'You let me learn you all about a steamboat, didn't you?'\n\n'Yes,' I confessed.\n\n'Yes, you did--_didn't_ you?'\n\n'Yes.'\n\n'You are the feller that--that--'\n\nLanguage failed. Pause--impotent struggle for further words--then he\ngave it up, choked out a deep, strong oath, and departed for good.\nAfterward I saw him several times below during the trip; but he was\ncold--would not look at me. Idiot, if he had not been in such a sweat to\nplay his witless practical joke upon me, in the beginning, I would have\npersuaded his thoughts into some other direction, and saved him from\ncommitting that wanton and silly impoliteness.\n\nI had myself called with the four o'clock watch, mornings, for one\ncannot see too many summer sunrises on the Mississippi. They are\nenchanting. First, there is the eloquence of silence; for a deep hush\nbroods everywhere. Next, there is the haunting sense of loneliness,\nisolation, remoteness from the worry and bustle of the world. The dawn\ncreeps in stealthily; the solid walls of black forest soften to gray,\nand vast stretches of the river open up and reveal themselves; the water\nis glass-smooth, gives off spectral little wreaths of white mist, there\nis not the faintest breath of wind, nor stir of leaf; the tranquillity\nis profound and infinitely satisfying. Then a bird pipes up, another\nfollows, and soon the pipings develop into a jubilant riot of music.\nYou see none of the birds; you simply move through an atmosphere of song\nwhich seems to sing itself. When the light has become a little stronger,\nyou have one of the fairest and softest pictures imaginable. You have\nthe intense green of the massed and crowded foliage near by; you see it\npaling shade by shade in front of you; upon the next projecting cape,\na mile off or more, the tint has lightened to the tender young green of\nspring; the cape beyond that one has almost lost color, and the furthest\none, miles away under the horizon, sleeps upon the water a mere dim\nvapor, and hardly separable from the sky above it and about it. And all\nthis stretch of river is a mirror, and you have the shadowy reflections\nof the leafage and the curving shores and the receding capes pictured in\nit. Well, that is all beautiful; soft and rich and beautiful; and when\nthe sun gets well up, and distributes a pink flush here and a powder of\ngold yonder and a purple haze where it will yield the best effect, you\ngrant that you have seen something that is worth remembering.\n\nWe had the Kentucky Bend country in the early morning--scene of a\nstrange and tragic accident in the old times, Captain Poe had a small\nstern-wheel boat, for years the home of himself and his wife. One night\nthe boat struck a snag in the head of Kentucky Bend, and sank with\nastonishing suddenness; water already well above the cabin floor when\nthe captain got aft. So he cut into his wife's state-room from above\nwith an ax; she was asleep in the upper berth, the roof a flimsier one\nthan was supposed; the first blow crashed down through the rotten boards\nand clove her skull.\n\nThis bend is all filled up now--result of a cut-off; and the same agent\nhas taken the great and once much-frequented Walnut Bend, and set\nit away back in a solitude far from the accustomed track of passing\nsteamers.\n\nHelena we visited, and also a town I had not heard of before, it being\nof recent birth--Arkansas City. It was born of a railway; the Little\nRock, Mississippi River and Texas Railroad touches the river there.\nWe asked a passenger who belonged there what sort of a place it was.\n'Well,' said he, after considering, and with the air of one who wishes\nto take time and be accurate, 'It's a hell of a place.' A description\nwhich was photographic for exactness. There were several rows and\nclusters of shabby frame-houses, and a supply of mud sufficient to\ninsure the town against a famine in that article for a hundred years;\nfor the overflow had but lately subsided. There were stagnant ponds\nin the streets, here and there, and a dozen rude scows were scattered\nabout, lying aground wherever they happened to have been when the waters\ndrained off and people could do their visiting and shopping on foot once\nmore. Still, it is a thriving place, with a rich country behind it, an\nelevator in front of it, and also a fine big mill for the manufacture of\ncotton-seed oil. I had never seen this kind of a mill before.\n\nCotton-seed was comparatively valueless in my time; but it is worth $12\nor $13 a ton now, and none of it is thrown away. The oil made from it is\ncolorless, tasteless, and almost if not entirely odorless. It is claimed\nthat it can, by proper manipulation, be made to resemble and perform the\noffice of any and all oils, and be produced at a cheaper rate than\nthe cheapest of the originals. Sagacious people shipped it to Italy,\ndoctored it, labeled it, and brought it back as olive oil. This trade\ngrew to be so formidable that Italy was obliged to put a prohibitory\nimpost upon it to keep it from working serious injury to her oil\nindustry.\n\nHelena occupies one of the prettiest situations on the Mississippi. Her\nperch is the last, the southernmost group of hills which one sees on\nthat side of the river. In its normal condition it is a pretty town; but\nthe flood (or possibly the seepage) had lately been ravaging it; whole\nstreets of houses had been invaded by the muddy water, and the outsides\nof the buildings were still belted with a broad stain extending upwards\nfrom the foundations. Stranded and discarded scows lay all about;\nplank sidewalks on stilts four feet high were still standing; the board\nsidewalks on the ground level were loose and ruinous,--a couple of men\ntrotting along them could make a blind man think a cavalry charge\nwas coming; everywhere the mud was black and deep, and in many\nplaces malarious pools of stagnant water were standing. A Mississippi\ninundation is the next most wasting and desolating infliction to a fire.\n\nWe had an enjoyable time here, on this sunny Sunday: two full hours'\nliberty ashore while the boat discharged freight. In the back streets\nbut few white people were visible, but there were plenty of colored\nfolk--mainly women and girls; and almost without exception upholstered\nin bright new clothes of swell and elaborate style and cut--a glaring\nand hilarious contrast to the mournful mud and the pensive puddles.\n\nHelena is the second town in Arkansas, in point of population--which\nis placed at five thousand. The country about it is exceptionally\nproductive. Helena has a good cotton trade; handles from forty to sixty\nthousand bales annually; she has a large lumber and grain commerce; has\na foundry, oil mills, machine shops and wagon factories--in brief has\n$1,000,000 invested in manufacturing industries. She has two railways,\nand is the commercial center of a broad and prosperous region. Her gross\nreceipts of money, annually, from all sources, are placed by the New\nOrleans 'Times-Democrat' at $4,000,000.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 31\n\nA Thumb-print and What Came of It\n\nWE were approaching Napoleon, Arkansas. So I began to think about my\nerrand there. Time, noonday; and bright and sunny. This was bad--not\nbest, anyway; for mine was not (preferably) a noonday kind of errand.\nThe more I thought, the more that fact pushed itself upon me--now in one\nform, now in another. Finally, it took the form of a distinct question:\nis it good common sense to do the errand in daytime, when, by a little\nsacrifice of comfort and inclination, you can have night for it, and\nno inquisitive eyes around. This settled it. Plain question and plain\nanswer make the shortest road out of most perplexities.\n\nI got my friends into my stateroom, and said I was sorry to create\nannoyance and disappointment, but that upon reflection it really seemed\nbest that we put our luggage ashore and stop over at Napoleon. Their\ndisapproval was prompt and loud; their language mutinous. Their main\nargument was one which has always been the first to come to the surface,\nin such cases, since the beginning of time: 'But you decided and _agreed\n_to stick to this boat, etc.; as if, having determined to do an unwise\nthing, one is thereby bound to go ahead and make _two _unwise things of\nit, by carrying out that determination.\n\nI tried various mollifying tactics upon them, with reasonably good\nsuccess: under which encouragement, I increased my efforts; and, to show\nthem that I had not created this annoying errand, and was in no way to\nblame for it, I presently drifted into its history--substantially as\nfollows:\n\nToward the end of last year, I spent a few months in Munich, Bavaria.\nIn November I was living in Fraulein Dahlweiner's _pension_, 1a,\nKarlstrasse; but my working quarters were a mile from there, in the\nhouse of a widow who supported herself by taking lodgers. She and her\ntwo young children used to drop in every morning and talk German to\nme--by request. One day, during a ramble about the city, I visited one\nof the two establishments where the Government keeps and watches corpses\nuntil the doctors decide that they are permanently dead, and not in\na trance state. It was a grisly place, that spacious room. There were\nthirty-six corpses of adults in sight, stretched on their backs on\nslightly slanted boards, in three long rows--all of them with wax-white,\nrigid faces, and all of them wrapped in white shrouds. Along the sides\nof the room were deep alcoves, like bay windows; and in each of these\nlay several marble-visaged babes, utterly hidden and buried under banks\nof fresh flowers, all but their faces and crossed hands. Around a finger\nof each of these fifty still forms, both great and small, was a ring;\nand from the ring a wire led to the ceiling, and thence to a bell in a\nwatch-room yonder, where, day and night, a watchman sits always alert\nand ready to spring to the aid of any of that pallid company who,\nwaking out of death, shall make a movement--for any, even the slightest,\nmovement will twitch the wire and ring that fearful bell. I imagined\nmyself a death-sentinel drowsing there alone, far in the dragging\nwatches of some wailing, gusty night, and having in a twinkling all\nmy body stricken to quivering jelly by the sudden clamor of that awful\nsummons! So I inquired about this thing; asked what resulted usually? if\nthe watchman died, and the restored corpse came and did what it could to\nmake his last moments easy. But I was rebuked for trying to feed an idle\nand frivolous curiosity in so solemn and so mournful a place; and went\nmy way with a humbled crest.\n\nNext morning I was telling the widow my adventure, when she exclaimed--\n\n'Come with me! I have a lodger who shall tell you all you want to know.\nHe has been a night-watchman there.'\n\nHe was a living man, but he did not look it. He was abed, and had his\nhead propped high on pillows; his face was wasted and colorless,\nhis deep-sunken eyes were shut; his hand, lying on his breast, was\ntalon-like, it was so bony and long-fingered. The widow began her\nintroduction of me. The man's eyes opened slowly, and glittered wickedly\nout from the twilight of their caverns; he frowned a black frown; he\nlifted his lean hand and waved us peremptorily away. But the widow kept\nstraight on, till she had got out the fact that I was a stranger and\nan American. The man's face changed at once; brightened, became even\neager--and the next moment he and I were alone together.\n\nI opened up in cast-iron German; he responded in quite flexible English;\nthereafter we gave the German language a permanent rest.\n\nThis consumptive and I became good friends. I visited him every day,\nand we talked about everything. At least, about everything but wives and\nchildren. Let anybody's wife or anybody's child be mentioned, and three\nthings always followed: the most gracious and loving and tender light\nglimmered in the man's eyes for a moment; faded out the next, and in its\nplace came that deadly look which had flamed there the first time I ever\nsaw his lids unclose; thirdly, he ceased from speech, there and then for\nthat day; lay silent, abstracted, and absorbed; apparently heard nothing\nthat I said; took no notice of my good-byes, and plainly did not know,\nby either sight or hearing, when I left the room.\n\nWhen I had been this Karl Ritter's daily and sole intimate during two\nmonths, he one day said, abruptly--\n\n'I will tell you my story.'\n\nA DYING MAN S CONFESSION\n\nThen he went on as follows:--\n\nI have never given up, until now. But now I have given up. I am going to\ndie. I made up my mind last night that it must be, and very soon, too.\nYou say you are going to revisit your river, by-and-bye, when you find\nopportunity. Very well; that, together with a certain strange\nexperience which fell to my lot last night, determines me to tell you my\nhistory--for you will see Napoleon, Arkansas; and for my sake you\nwill stop there, and do a certain thing for me--a thing which you will\nwillingly undertake after you shall have heard my narrative.\n\nLet us shorten the story wherever we can, for it will need it, being\nlong. You already know how I came to go to America, and how I came to\nsettle in that lonely region in the South. But you do not know that I\nhad a wife. My wife was young, beautiful, loving, and oh, so divinely\ngood and blameless and gentle! And our little girl was her mother in\nminiature. It was the happiest of happy households.\n\nOne night--it was toward the close of the war--I woke up out of a sodden\nlethargy, and found myself bound and gagged, and the air tainted with\nchloroform! I saw two men in the room, and one was saying to the other,\nin a hoarse whisper, 'I told her I would, if she made a noise, and as\nfor the child--'\n\nThe other man interrupted in a low, half-crying voice--\n\n'You said we'd only gag them and rob them, not hurt them; or I wouldn't\nhave come.'\n\n'Shut up your whining; had to change the plan when they waked up; you\ndone all you could to protect them, now let that satisfy you; come, help\nrummage.'\n\nBoth men were masked, and wore coarse, ragged 'nigger' clothes; they had\na bull's-eye lantern, and by its light I noticed that the gentler robber\nhad no thumb on his right hand. They rummaged around my poor cabin for a\nmoment; the head bandit then said, in his stage whisper--\n\n'It's a waste of time--he shall tell where it's hid. Undo his gag, and\nrevive him up.'\n\nThe other said--\n\n'All right--provided no clubbing.'\n\n'No clubbing it is, then--provided he keeps still.'\n\nThey approached me; just then there was a sound outside; a sound of\nvoices and trampling hoofs; the robbers held their breath and listened;\nthe sounds came slowly nearer and nearer; then came a shout--\n\n'_Hello_, the house! Show a light, we want water.'\n\n'The captain's voice, by G--!' said the stage-whispering ruffian,\nand both robbers fled by the way of the back door, shutting off their\nbull's-eye as they ran.\n\nThe strangers shouted several times more, then rode by--there seemed to\nbe a dozen of the horses--and I heard nothing more.\n\nI struggled, but could not free myself from my bonds. I tried to speak,\nbut the gag was effective; I could not make a sound. I listened for my\nwife's voice and my child's--listened long and intently, but no sound\ncame from the other end of the room where their bed was. This silence\nbecame more and more awful, more and more ominous, every moment. Could\nyou have endured an hour of it, do you think? Pity me, then, who had\nto endure three. Three hours--? it was three ages! Whenever the clock\nstruck, it seemed as if years had gone by since I had heard it last. All\nthis time I was struggling in my bonds; and at last, about dawn, I got\nmyself free, and rose up and stretched my stiff limbs. I was able to\ndistinguish details pretty well. The floor was littered with things\nthrown there by the robbers during their search for my savings. The\nfirst object that caught my particular attention was a document of mine\nwhich I had seen the rougher of the two ruffians glance at and then cast\naway. It had blood on it! I staggered to the other end of the room. Oh,\npoor unoffending, helpless ones, there they lay, their troubles ended,\nmine begun!\n\nDid I appeal to the law--I? Does it quench the pauper's thirst if the\nKing drink for him? Oh, no, no, no--I wanted no impertinent interference\nof the law. Laws and the gallows could not pay the debt that was owing\nto me! Let the laws leave the matter in my hands, and have no fears: I\nwould find the debtor and collect the debt. How accomplish this, do you\nsay? How accomplish it, and feel so sure about it, when I had neither\nseen the robbers' faces, nor heard their natural voices, nor had any\nidea who they might be? Nevertheless, I _was _sure--quite sure, quite\nconfident. I had a clue--a clue which you would not have valued--a clue\nwhich would not have greatly helped even a detective, since he would\nlack the secret of how to apply it. I shall come to that, presently--you\nshall see. Let us go on, now, taking things in their due order. There\nwas one circumstance which gave me a slant in a definite direction\nto begin with: Those two robbers were manifestly soldiers in tramp\ndisguise; and not new to military service, but old in it--regulars,\nperhaps; they did not acquire their soldierly attitude, gestures,\ncarriage, in a day, nor a month, nor yet in a year. So I thought,\nbut said nothing. And one of them had said, 'the captain's voice,\nby G--!'--the one whose life I would have. Two miles away, several\nregiments were in camp, and two companies of U.S. cavalry. When I\nlearned that Captain Blakely, of Company C had passed our way, that\nnight, with an escort, I said nothing, but in that company I resolved to\nseek my man. In conversation I studiously and persistently described the\nrobbers as tramps, camp followers; and among this class the people made\nuseless search, none suspecting the soldiers but me.\n\nWorking patiently, by night, in my desolated home, I made a disguise for\nmyself out of various odds and ends of clothing; in the nearest village\nI bought a pair of blue goggles. By-and-bye, when the military camp\nbroke up, and Company C was ordered a hundred miles north, to Napoleon,\nI secreted my small hoard of money in my belt, and took my departure in\nthe night. When Company C arrived in Napoleon, I was already there. Yes,\nI was there, with a new trade--fortune-teller. Not to seem partial, I\nmade friends and told fortunes among all the companies garrisoned there;\nbut I gave Company C the great bulk of my attentions. I made myself\nlimitlessly obliging to these particular men; they could ask me no\nfavor, put upon me no risk, which I would decline. I became the willing\nbutt of their jokes; this perfected my popularity; I became a favorite.\n\nI early found a private who lacked a thumb--what joy it was to me! And\nwhen I found that he alone, of all the company, had lost a thumb, my\nlast misgiving vanished; I was _sure _I was on the right track. This\nman's name was Kruger, a German. There were nine Germans in the company.\nI watched, to see who might be his intimates; but he seemed to have no\nespecial intimates. But I was his intimate; and I took care to make\nthe intimacy grow. Sometimes I so hungered for my revenge that I could\nhardly restrain myself from going on my knees and begging him to point\nout the man who had murdered my wife and child; but I managed to bridle\nmy tongue. I bided my time, and went on telling fortunes, as opportunity\noffered.\n\nMy apparatus was simple: a little red paint and a bit of white paper. I\npainted the ball of the client's thumb, took a print of it on the paper,\nstudied it that night, and revealed his fortune to him next day. What\nwas my idea in this nonsense? It was this: When I was a youth, I knew an\nold Frenchman who had been a prison-keeper for thirty years, and he told\nme that there was one thing about a person which never changed, from\nthe cradle to the grave--the lines in the ball of the thumb; and he said\nthat these lines were never exactly alike in the thumbs of any two human\nbeings. In these days, we photograph the new criminal, and hang his\npicture in the Rogues' Gallery for future reference; but that Frenchman,\nin his day, used to take a print of the ball of a new prisoner's thumb\nand put that away for future reference. He always said that pictures\nwere no good--future disguises could make them useless; 'The thumb's\nthe only sure thing,' said he; 'you can't disguise that.' And he used\nto prove his theory, too, on my friends and acquaintances; it always\nsucceeded.\n\nI went on telling fortunes. Every night I shut myself in, all alone,\nand studied the day's thumb-prints with a magnifying-glass. Imagine the\ndevouring eagerness with which I pored over those mazy red spirals,\nwith that document by my side which bore the right-hand\nthumb-and-finger-marks of that unknown murderer, printed with the\ndearest blood--to me--that was ever shed on this earth! And many and\nmany a time I had to repeat the same old disappointed remark, 'will they\n_never _correspond!'\n\nBut my reward came at last. It was the print of the thumb of the\nforty-third man of Company C whom I had experimented on--Private Franz\nAdler. An hour before, I did not know the murderer's name, or voice,\nor figure, or face, or nationality; but now I knew all these things!\nI believed I might feel sure; the Frenchman's repeated demonstrations\nbeing so good a warranty. Still, there was a way to _make _sure. I had\nan impression of Kruger's left thumb. In the morning I took him aside\nwhen he was off duty; and when we were out of sight and hearing of\nwitnesses, I said, impressively--\n\n'A part of your fortune is so grave, that I thought it would be better\nfor you if I did not tell it in public. You and another man, whose\nfortune I was studying last night,--Private Adler,--have been murdering\na woman and a child! You are being dogged: within five days both of you\nwill be assassinated.'\n\nHe dropped on his knees, frightened out of his wits; and for five\nminutes he kept pouring out the same set of words, like a demented\nperson, and in the same half-crying way which was one of my memories of\nthat murderous night in my cabin--\n\n'I didn't do it; upon my soul I didn't do it; and I tried to keep _him\n_from doing it; I did, as God is my witness. He did it alone.'\n\nThis was all I wanted. And I tried to get rid of the fool; but no, he\nclung to me, imploring me to save him from the assassin. He said--\n\n'I have money--ten thousand dollars--hid away, the fruit of loot and\nthievery; save me--tell me what to do, and you shall have it, every\npenny. Two-thirds of it is my cousin Adler's; but you can take it\nall. We hid it when we first came here. But I hid it in a new place\nyesterday, and have not told him--shall not tell him. I was going to\ndesert, and get away with it all. It is gold, and too heavy to carry\nwhen one is running and dodging; but a woman who has been gone over the\nriver two days to prepare my way for me is going to follow me with it;\nand if I got no chance to describe the hiding-place to her I was going\nto slip my silver watch into her hand, or send it to her, and she would\nunderstand. There's a piece of paper in the back of the case, which\ntells it all. Here, take the watch--tell me what to do!'\n\nHe was trying to press his watch upon me, and was exposing the paper\nand explaining it to me, when Adler appeared on the scene, about a dozen\nyards away. I said to poor Kruger--\n\n'Put up your watch, I don't want it. You shan't come to any harm. Go,\nnow; I must tell Adler his fortune. Presently I will tell you how to\nescape the assassin; meantime I shall have to examine your thumbmark\nagain. Say nothing to Adler about this thing--say nothing to anybody.'\n\nHe went away filled with fright and gratitude, poor devil. I told Adler\na long fortune--purposely so long that I could not finish it; promised\nto come to him on guard, that night, and tell him the really important\npart of it--the tragical part of it, I said--so must be out of reach of\neavesdroppers. They always kept a picket-watch outside the town--mere\ndiscipline and ceremony--no occasion for it, no enemy around.\n\nToward midnight I set out, equipped with the countersign, and picked my\nway toward the lonely region where Adler was to keep his watch. It was\nso dark that I stumbled right on a dim figure almost before I could get\nout a protecting word. The sentinel hailed and I answered, both at the\nsame moment. I added, 'It's only me--the fortune-teller.' Then I slipped\nto the poor devil's side, and without a word I drove my dirk into his\nheart! _Ya wohl_, laughed I, it _was _the tragedy part of his fortune,\nindeed! As he fell from his horse, he clutched at me, and my blue\ngoggles remained in his hand; and away plunged the beast dragging him,\nwith his foot in the stirrup.\n\nI fled through the woods, and made good my escape, leaving the accusing\ngoggles behind me in that dead man's hand.\n\nThis was fifteen or sixteen years ago. Since then I have wandered\naimlessly about the earth, sometimes at work, sometimes idle; sometimes\nwith money, sometimes with none; but always tired of life, and wishing\nit was done, for my mission here was finished, with the act of that\nnight; and the only pleasure, solace, satisfaction I had, in all those\ntedious years, was in the daily reflection, 'I have killed him!'\n\nFour years ago, my health began to fail. I had wandered into Munich, in\nmy purposeless way. Being out of money, I sought work, and got it; did\nmy duty faithfully about a year, and was then given the berth of night\nwatchman yonder in that dead-house which you visited lately. The place\nsuited my mood. I liked it. I liked being with the dead--liked being\nalone with them. I used to wander among those rigid corpses, and peer\ninto their austere faces, by the hour. The later the time, the more\nimpressive it was; I preferred the late time. Sometimes I turned the\nlights low: this gave perspective, you see; and the imagination could\nplay; always, the dim receding ranks of the dead inspired one with weird\nand fascinating fancies. Two years ago--I had been there a year then--I\nwas sitting all alone in the watch-room, one gusty winter's night,\nchilled, numb, comfortless; drowsing gradually into unconsciousness; the\nsobbing of the wind and the slamming of distant shutters falling fainter\nand fainter upon my dulling ear each moment, when sharp and suddenly\nthat dead-bell rang out a blood-curdling alarum over my head! The shock\nof it nearly paralyzed me; for it was the first time I had ever heard\nit.\n\nI gathered myself together and flew to the corpse-room. About midway\ndown the outside rank, a shrouded figure was sitting upright, wagging\nits head slowly from one side to the other--a grisly spectacle! Its side\nwas toward me. I hurried to it and peered into its face. Heavens, it was\nAdler!\n\nCan you divine what my first thought was? Put into words, it was this:\n'It seems, then, you escaped me once: there will be a different result\nthis time!'\n\nEvidently this creature was suffering unimaginable terrors. Think what\nit must have been to wake up in the midst of that voiceless hush, and,\nlook out over that grim congregation of the dead! What gratitude shone\nin his skinny white face when he saw a living form before him! And how\nthe fervency of this mute gratitude was augmented when his eyes fell\nupon the life-giving cordials which I carried in my hands! Then imagine\nthe horror which came into this pinched face when I put the cordials\nbehind me, and said mockingly--\n\n'Speak up, Franz Adler--call upon these dead. Doubtless they will listen\nand have pity; but here there is none else that will.'\n\nHe tried to speak, but that part of the shroud which bound his jaws,\nheld firm and would not let him. He tried to lift imploring hands, but\nthey were crossed upon his breast and tied. I said--\n\n'Shout, Franz Adler; make the sleepers in the distant streets hear you\nand bring help. Shout--and lose no time, for there is little to lose.\nWhat, you cannot? That is a pity; but it is no matter--it does not\nalways bring help. When you and your cousin murdered a helpless woman\nand child in a cabin in Arkansas--my wife, it was, and my child!--they\nshrieked for help, you remember; but it did no good; you remember that\nit did no good, is it not so? Your teeth chatter--then why cannot\nyou shout? Loosen the bandages with your hands--then you can. Ah, I\nsee--your hands are tied, they cannot aid you. How strangely things\nrepeat themselves, after long years; for _my_ hands were tied, that\nnight, you remember? Yes, tied much as yours are now--how odd that is.\nI could not pull free. It did not occur to you to untie me; it does not\noccur to me to untie you. Sh--! there's a late footstep. It is\ncoming this way. Hark, how near it is! One can count the\nfootfalls--one--two--three. There--it is just outside. Now is the time!\nShout, man, shout!--it is the one sole chance between you and eternity!\nAh, you see you have delayed too long--it is gone by. There--it is dying\nout. It is gone! Think of it--reflect upon it--you have heard a human\nfootstep for the last time. How curious it must be, to listen to so\ncommon a sound as that, and know that one will never hear the fellow to\nit again.'\n\nOh, my friend, the agony in that shrouded face was ecstasy to see! I\nthought of a new torture, and applied it--assisting myself with a trifle\nof lying invention--\n\n'That poor Kruger tried to save my wife and child, and I did him a\ngrateful good turn for it when the time came. I persuaded him to\nrob you; and I and a woman helped him to desert, and got him away in\nsafety.' A look as of surprise and triumph shone out dimly through the\nanguish in my victim's face. I was disturbed, disquieted. I said--\n\n'What, then--didn't he escape?'\n\nA negative shake of the head.\n\n'No? What happened, then?'\n\nThe satisfaction in the shrouded face was still plainer. The man tried\nto mumble out some words--could not succeed; tried to express something\nwith his obstructed hands--failed; paused a moment, then feebly tilted\nhis head, in a meaning way, toward the corpse that lay nearest him.\n\n'Dead?' I asked. 'Failed to escape?--caught in the act and shot?'\n\nNegative shake of the head.\n\n'How, then?'\n\nAgain the man tried to do something with his hands. I watched closely,\nbut could not guess the intent. I bent over and watched still more\nintently. He had twisted a thumb around and was weakly punching at his\nbreast with it. 'Ah--stabbed, do you mean?'\n\nAffirmative nod, accompanied by a spectral smile of such peculiar\ndevilishness, that it struck an awakening light through my dull brain,\nand I cried--\n\n'Did I stab him, mistaking him for you?--for that stroke was meant for\nnone but you.'\n\nThe affirmative nod of the re-dying rascal was as joyous as his failing\nstrength was able to put into its expression.\n\n'O, miserable, miserable me, to slaughter the pitying soul that, stood a\nfriend to my darlings when they were helpless, and would have saved them\nif he could! miserable, oh, miserable, miserable me!'\n\nI fancied I heard the muffled gurgle of a mocking laugh. I took my face\nout of my hands, and saw my enemy sinking back upon his inclined board.\n\nHe was a satisfactory long time dying. He had a wonderful vitality, an\nastonishing constitution. Yes, he was a pleasant long time at it. I got\na chair and a newspaper, and sat down by him and read. Occasionally I\ntook a sip of brandy. This was necessary, on account of the cold. But I\ndid it partly because I saw, that along at first, whenever I reached\nfor the bottle, he thought I was going to give him some. I read aloud:\nmainly imaginary accounts of people snatched from the grave's threshold\nand restored to life and vigor by a few spoonsful of liquor and a warm\nbath. Yes, he had a long, hard death of it--three hours and six minutes,\nfrom the time he rang his bell.\n\nIt is believed that in all these eighteen years that have elapsed\nsince the institution of the corpse-watch, no shrouded occupant of the\nBavarian dead-houses has ever rung its bell. Well, it is a harmless\nbelief. Let it stand at that.\n\nThe chill of that death-room had penetrated my bones. It revived and\nfastened upon me the disease which had been afflicting me, but which, up\nto that night, had been steadily disappearing. That man murdered my wife\nand my child; and in three days hence he will have added me to his list.\nNo matter--God! how delicious the memory of it!--I caught him escaping\nfrom his grave, and thrust him back into it.\n\nAfter that night, I was confined to my bed for a week; but as soon as\nI could get about, I went to the dead-house books and got the number of\nthe house which Adler had died in. A wretched lodging-house, it was.\nIt was my idea that he would naturally have gotten hold of Kruger's\neffects, being his cousin; and I wanted to get Kruger's watch, if I\ncould. But while I was sick, Adler's things had been sold and scattered,\nall except a few old letters, and some odds and ends of no value.\nHowever, through those letters, I traced out a son of Kruger's, the\nonly relative left. He is a man of thirty now, a shoemaker by trade,\nand living at No. 14 Konigstrasse, Mannheim--widower, with several small\nchildren. Without explaining to him why, I have furnished two-thirds of\nhis support, ever since.\n\nNow, as to that watch--see how strangely things happen! I traced it\naround and about Germany for more than a year, at considerable cost in\nmoney and vexation; and at last I got it. Got it, and was unspeakably\nglad; opened it, and found nothing in it! Why, I might have known that\nthat bit of paper was not going to stay there all this time. Of course\nI gave up that ten thousand dollars then; gave it up, and dropped it out\nof my mind: and most sorrowfully, for I had wanted it for Kruger's son.\n\nLast night, when I consented at last that I must die, I began to make\nready. I proceeded to burn all useless papers; and sure enough, from a\nbatch of Adler's, not previously examined with thoroughness, out dropped\nthat long-desired scrap! I recognized it in a moment. Here it is--I will\ntranslate it:\n\n'Brick livery stable, stone foundation, middle of town, corner of\nOrleans and Market. Corner toward Court-house. Third stone, fourth row.\nStick notice there, saying how many are to come.'\n\nThere--take it, and preserve it. Kruger explained that that stone was\nremovable; and that it was in the north wall of the foundation, fourth\nrow from the top, and third stone from the west. The money is secreted\nbehind it. He said the closing sentence was a blind, to mislead in\ncase the paper should fall into wrong hands. It probably performed that\noffice for Adler.\n\nNow I want to beg that when you make your intended journey down the\nriver, you will hunt out that hidden money, and send it to Adam Kruger,\ncare of the Mannheim address which I have mentioned. It will make a rich\nman of him, and I shall sleep the sounder in my grave for knowing that I\nhave done what I could for the son of the man who tried to save my\nwife and child--albeit my hand ignorantly struck him down, whereas the\nimpulse of my heart would have been to shield and serve him.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 32\n\nThe Disposal of a Bonanza\n\n'SUCH was Ritter's narrative,' said I to my two friends. There was a\nprofound and impressive silence, which lasted a considerable time; then\nboth men broke into a fusillade of exciting and admiring ejaculations\nover the strange incidents of the tale; and this, along with a rattling\nfire of questions, was kept up until all hands were about out of breath.\nThen my friends began to cool down, and draw off, under shelter of\noccasional volleys, into silence and abysmal reverie. For ten minutes\nnow, there was stillness. Then Rogers said dreamily--\n\n'Ten thousand dollars.'\n\nAdding, after a considerable pause--\n\n'Ten thousand. It is a heap of money.'\n\nPresently the poet inquired--\n\n'Are you going to send it to him right away?'\n\n'Yes,' I said. 'It is a queer question.'\n\nNo reply. After a little, Rogers asked, hesitatingly:\n\n'_All _of it?--That is--I mean--'\n\n'Certainly, all of it.'\n\nI was going to say more, but stopped--was stopped by a train of thought\nwhich started up in me. Thompson spoke, but my mind was absent, and I\ndid not catch what he said. But I heard Rogers answer--\n\n'Yes, it seems so to me. It ought to be quite sufficient; for I don't\nsee that he has done anything.'\n\nPresently the poet said--\n\n'When you come to look at it, it is more than sufficient. Just look at\nit--five thousand dollars! Why, he couldn't spend it in a lifetime! And\nit would injure him, too; perhaps ruin him--you want to look at that.\nIn a little while he would throw his last away, shut up his shop, maybe\ntake to drinking, maltreat his motherless children, drift into other\nevil courses, go steadily from bad to worse--'\n\n'Yes, that's it,' interrupted Rogers, fervently, 'I've seen it a hundred\ntimes--yes, more than a hundred. You put money into the hands of a man\nlike that, if you want to destroy him, that's all; just put money into\nhis hands, it's all you've got to do; and if it don't pull him down,\nand take all the usefulness out of him, and all the self-respect and\neverything, then I don't know human nature--ain't that so, Thompson?\nAnd even if we were to give him a _third _of it; why, in less than six\nmonths--'\n\n'Less than six _weeks_, you'd better say!' said I, warming up and\nbreaking in. 'Unless he had that three thousand dollars in safe hands\nwhere he couldn't touch it, he would no more last you six weeks than--'\n\n'Of _course _he wouldn't,' said Thompson; 'I've edited books for\nthat kind of people; and the moment they get their hands on the\nroyalty--maybe it's three thousand, maybe it's two thousand--'\n\n'What business has that shoemaker with two thousand dollars, I should\nlike to know?' broke in Rogers, earnestly. 'A man perhaps perfectly\ncontented now, there in Mannheim, surrounded by his own class, eating\nhis bread with the appetite which laborious industry alone can\ngive, enjoying his humble life, honest, upright, pure in heart; and\n_blest_!--yes, I say blest! blest above all the myriads that go in silk\nattire and walk the empty artificial round of social folly--but just\nyou put that temptation before him once! just you lay fifteen hundred\ndollars before a man like that, and say--'\n\n'Fifteen hundred devils!' cried I, '_five _hundred would rot his\nprinciples, paralyze his industry, drag him to the rumshop, thence to\nthe gutter, thence to the almshouse, thence to----'\n\n'_Why _put upon ourselves this crime, gentlemen?' interrupted the poet\nearnestly and appealingly. 'He is happy where he is, and _as _he is.\nEvery sentiment of honor, every sentiment of charity, every sentiment of\nhigh and sacred benevolence warns us, beseeches us, commands us to leave\nhim undisturbed. That is real friendship, that is true friendship. We\ncould follow other courses that would be more showy; but none that would\nbe so truly kind and wise, depend upon it.'\n\nAfter some further talk, it became evident that each of us, down in his\nheart, felt some misgivings over this settlement of the matter. It\nwas manifest that we all felt that we ought to send the poor shoemaker\n_something_. There was long and thoughtful discussion of this point; and\nwe finally decided to send him a chromo.\n\nWell, now that everything seemed to be arranged satisfactorily to\neverybody concerned, a new trouble broke out: it transpired that these\ntwo men were expecting to share equally in the money with me. That was\nnot my idea. I said that if they got half of it between them they might\nconsider themselves lucky. Rogers said--\n\n'Who would have had _any _if it hadn't been for me? I flung out the\nfirst hint--but for that it would all have gone to the shoemaker.'\n\nThompson said that he was thinking of the thing himself at the very\nmoment that Rogers had originally spoken.\n\nI retorted that the idea would have occurred to me plenty soon enough,\nand without anybody's help. I was slow about thinking, maybe, but I was\nsure.\n\nThis matter warmed up into a quarrel; then into a fight; and each man\ngot pretty badly battered. As soon as I had got myself mended up after\na fashion, I ascended to the hurricane deck in a pretty sour humor. I\nfound Captain McCord there, and said, as pleasantly as my humor would\npermit--\n\n'I have come to say good-bye, captain. I wish to go ashore at Napoleon.'\n\n'Go ashore where?'\n\n'Napoleon.'\n\nThe captain laughed; but seeing that I was not in a jovial mood, stopped\nthat and said--\n\n'But are you serious?'\n\n'Serious? I certainly am.'\n\nThe captain glanced up at the pilot-house and said--\n\n'He wants to get off at Napoleon!'\n\n'Napoleon?'\n\n'That's what he says.'\n\n'Great Caesar's ghost!'\n\nUncle Mumford approached along the deck. The captain said--\n\n'Uncle, here's a friend of yours wants to get off at Napoleon!'\n\n'Well, by--?'\n\nI said--\n\n'Come, what is all this about? Can't a man go ashore at Napoleon if he\nwants to?'\n\n'Why, hang it, don't you know? There _isn't_ any Napoleon any more.\nHasn't been for years and years. The Arkansas River burst through it,\ntore it all to rags, and emptied it into the Mississippi!'\n\n'Carried the _whole _town away?-banks, churches, jails,\nnewspaper-offices, court-house, theater, fire department, livery stable\n_everything _?'\n\n'Everything. just a fifteen-minute job.' or such a matter. Didn't leave\nhide nor hair, shred nor shingle of it, except the fag-end of a shanty\nand one brick chimney. This boat is paddling along right now, where the\ndead-center of that town used to be; yonder is the brick chimney-all\nthat's left of Napoleon. These dense woods on the right used to be a\nmile back of the town. Take a look behind you--up-stream--now you begin\nto recognize this country, don't you?'\n\n'Yes, I do recognize it now. It is the most wonderful thing I ever heard\nof; by a long shot the most wonderful--and unexpected.'\n\nMr. Thompson and Mr. Rogers had arrived, meantime, with satchels and\numbrellas, and had silently listened to the captain's news. Thompson put\na half-dollar in my hand and said softly--\n\n'For my share of the chromo.'\n\nRogers followed suit.\n\nYes, it was an astonishing thing to see the Mississippi rolling between\nunpeopled shores and straight over the spot where I used to see a good\nbig self-complacent town twenty years ago. Town that was county-seat\nof a great and important county; town with a big United States marine\nhospital; town of innumerable fights--an inquest every day; town where\nI had used to know the prettiest girl, and the most accomplished in the\nwhole Mississippi Valley; town where we were handed the first printed\nnews of the 'Pennsylvania's' mournful disaster a quarter of a century\nago; a town no more--swallowed up, vanished, gone to feed the fishes;\nnothing left but a fragment of a shanty and a crumbling brick chimney!\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 33\n\nRefreshments and Ethics\n\nIN regard to Island 74, which is situated not far from the former\nNapoleon, a freak of the river here has sorely perplexed the laws of\nmen and made them a vanity and a jest. When the State of Arkansas was\nchartered, she controlled 'to the center of the river'--a most unstable\nline. The State of Mississippi claimed 'to the channel'--another shifty\nand unstable line. No. 74 belonged to Arkansas. By and by a cut-off\nthrew this big island out of Arkansas, and yet not within Mississippi.\n'Middle of the river' on one side of it, 'channel' on the other. That\nis as I understand the problem. Whether I have got the details right\nor wrong, this _fact _remains: that here is this big and exceedingly\nvaluable island of four thousand acres, thrust out in the cold, and\nbelonging to neither the one State nor the other; paying taxes to\nneither, owing allegiance to neither. One man owns the whole island, and\nof right is 'the man without a country.'\n\nIsland 92 belongs to Arkansas. The river moved it over and joined it\nto Mississippi. A chap established a whiskey shop there, without a\nMississippi license, and enriched himself upon Mississippi custom under\nArkansas protection (where no license was in those days required).\n\nWe glided steadily down the river in the usual privacy--steamboat or\nother moving thing seldom seen. Scenery as always: stretch upon stretch\nof almost unbroken forest, on both sides of the river; soundless\nsolitude. Here and there a cabin or two, standing in small openings on\nthe gray and grassless banks--cabins which had formerly stood a quarter\nor half-mile farther to the front, and gradually been pulled farther\nand farther back as the shores caved in. As at Pilcher's Point, for\ninstance, where the cabins had been moved back three hundred yards in\nthree months, so we were told; but the caving banks had already caught\nup with them, and they were being conveyed rearward once more.\n\nNapoleon had but small opinion of Greenville, Mississippi, in the old\ntimes; but behold, Napoleon is gone to the cat-fishes, and here is\nGreenville full of life and activity, and making a considerable flourish\nin the Valley; having three thousand inhabitants, it is said, and doing\na gross trade of $2,500,000 annually. A growing town.\n\nThere was much talk on the boat about the Calhoun Land Company, an\nenterprise which is expected to work wholesome results. Colonel Calhoun,\na grandson of the statesman, went to Boston and formed a syndicate\nwhich purchased a large tract of land on the river, in Chicot County,\nArkansas--some ten thousand acres--for cotton-growing. The purpose is to\nwork on a cash basis: buy at first hands, and handle their own product;\nsupply their negro laborers with provisions and necessaries at a\ntrifling profit, say 8 or 10 per cent.; furnish them comfortable\nquarters, etc., and encourage them to save money and remain on the\nplace. If this proves a financial success, as seems quite certain, they\npropose to establish a banking-house in Greenville, and lend money at an\nunburdensome rate of interest--6 per cent. is spoken of.\n\nThe trouble heretofore has been--I am quoting remarks of planters and\nsteamboatmen--that the planters, although owning the land, were without\ncash capital; had to hypothecate both land and crop to carry on the\nbusiness. Consequently, the commission dealer who furnishes the money\ntakes some risk and demands big interest--usually 10 per cent., and\n2{half} per cent. for negotiating the loan. The planter has also to buy\nhis supplies through the same dealer, paying commissions and profits.\nThen when he ships his crop, the dealer adds his commissions, insurance,\netc. So, taking it by and large, and first and last, the dealer's share\nof that crop is about 25 per cent.'{footnote ['But what can the State do\nwhere the people are under subjection to rates of interest ranging from\n18 to 30 per cent., and are also under the necessity of purchasing their\ncrops in advance even of planting, at these rates, for the privilege\nof purchasing all their supplies at 100 per cent. profit?'--_Edward\nAtkinson_.]}\n\nA cotton-planter's estimate of the average margin of profit on planting,\nin his section: One man and mule will raise ten acres of cotton, giving\nten bales cotton, worth, say, $500; cost of producing, say $350; net\nprofit, $150, or $15 per acre. There is also a profit now from\nthe cotton-seed, which formerly had little value--none where much\ntransportation was necessary. In sixteen hundred pounds crude cotton\nfour hundred are lint, worth, say, ten cents a pound; and twelve hundred\npounds of seed, worth $12 or $13 per ton. Maybe in future even the stems\nwill not be thrown away. Mr. Edward Atkinson says that for each bale\nof cotton there are fifteen hundred pounds of stems, and that these are\nvery rich in phosphate of lime and potash; that when ground and mixed\nwith ensilage or cotton-seed meal (which is too rich for use as fodder\nin large quantities), the stem mixture makes a superior food, rich in\nall the elements needed for the production of milk, meat, and bone.\nHeretofore the stems have been considered a nuisance.\n\nComplaint is made that the planter remains grouty toward the former\nslave, since the war; will have nothing but a chill business relation\nwith him, no sentiment permitted to intrude, will not keep a 'store'\nhimself, and supply the negro's wants and thus protect the negro's\npocket and make him able and willing to stay on the place and an\nadvantage to him to do it, but lets that privilege to some thrifty\nIsraelite, who encourages the thoughtless negro and wife to buy all\nsorts of things which they could do without--buy on credit, at big\nprices, month after month, credit based on the negro's share of the\ngrowing crop; and at the end of the season, the negro's share belongs\nto the Israelite,' the negro is in debt besides, is discouraged,\ndissatisfied, restless, and both he and the planter are injured; for he\nwill take steamboat and migrate, and the planter must get a stranger in\nhis place who does not know him, does not care for him, will fatten the\nIsraelite a season, and follow his predecessor per steamboat.\n\nIt is hoped that the Calhoun Company will show, by its humane and\nprotective treatment of its laborers, that its method is the most\nprofitable for both planter and negro; and it is believed that a general\nadoption of that method will then follow.\n\nAnd where so many are saying their say, shall not the barkeeper testify?\nHe is thoughtful, observant, never drinks; endeavors to earn his salary,\nand _would _earn it if there were custom enough. He says the people\nalong here in Mississippi and Louisiana will send up the river to buy\nvegetables rather than raise them, and they will come aboard at the\nlandings and buy fruits of the barkeeper. Thinks they 'don't know\nanything but cotton;' believes they don't know how to raise vegetables\nand fruit--'at least the most of them.' Says 'a nigger will go to H for\na watermelon' ['H' is all I find in the stenographer's report--means\nHalifax probably, though that seems a good way to go for a watermelon).\nBarkeeper buys watermelons for five cents up the river, brings them\ndown and sells them for fifty. 'Why does he mix such elaborate and\npicturesque drinks for the nigger hands on the boat?' Because they won't\nhave any other. 'They want a big drink; don't make any difference what\nyou make it of, they want the worth of their money. You give a nigger a\nplain gill of half-a-dollar brandy for five cents--will he touch it? No.\nAin't size enough to it. But you put up a pint of all kinds of worthless\nrubbish, and heave in some red stuff to make it beautiful--red's the\nmain thing--and he wouldn't put down that glass to go to a circus.'\n\nAll the bars on this Anchor Line are rented and owned by one firm.\nThey furnish the liquors from their own establishment, and hire the\nbarkeepers 'on salary.' Good liquors? Yes, on some of the boats, where\nthere are the kind of passengers that want it and can pay for it. On\nthe other boats? No. Nobody but the deck hands and firemen to drink it.\n'Brandy? Yes, I've got brandy, plenty of it; but you don't want any of\nit unless you've made your will.' It isn't as it used to be in the\nold times. Then everybody traveled by steamboat, everybody drank, and\neverybody treated everybody else. 'Now most everybody goes by railroad,\nand the rest don't drink.' In the old times the barkeeper owned the bar\nhimself, 'and was gay and smarty and talky and all jeweled up, and was\nthe toniest aristocrat on the boat; used to make $2,000 on a trip. A\nfather who left his son a steamboat bar, left him a fortune. Now he\nleaves him board and lodging; yes, and washing, if a shirt a trip will\ndo. Yes, indeedy, times are changed. Why, do you know, on the principal\nline of boats on the Upper Mississippi, they don't have any bar at all!\nSounds like poetry, but it's the petrified truth.'\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 34\n\nTough Yarns\n\nSTACK island. I remembered Stack Island; also Lake Providence,\nLouisiana--which is the first distinctly Southern-looking town you come\nto, downward-bound; lies level and low, shade-trees hung with venerable\ngray beards of Spanish moss; 'restful, pensive, Sunday aspect about the\nplace,' comments Uncle Mumford, with feeling--also with truth.\n\nA Mr. H. furnished some minor details of fact concerning this region\nwhich I would have hesitated to believe if I had not known him to be a\nsteamboat mate. He was a passenger of ours, a resident of Arkansas City,\nand bound to Vicksburg to join his boat, a little Sunflower packet.\nHe was an austere man, and had the reputation of being singularly\nunworldly, for a river man. Among other things, he said that Arkansas\nhad been injured and kept back by generations of exaggerations\nconcerning the mosquitoes here. One may smile, said he, and turn the\nmatter off as being a small thing; but when you come to look at the\neffects produced, in the way of discouragement of immigration, and\ndiminished values of property, it was quite the opposite of a small\nthing, or thing in any wise to be coughed down or sneered at. These\nmosquitoes had been persistently represented as being formidable and\nlawless; whereas 'the truth is, they are feeble, insignificant in size,\ndiffident to a fault, sensitive'--and so on, and so on; you would have\nsupposed he was talking about his family. But if he was soft on the\nArkansas mosquitoes, he was hard enough on the mosquitoes of Lake\nProvidence to make up for it--'those Lake Providence colossi,' as he\nfinely called them. He said that two of them could whip a dog, and that\nfour of them could hold a man down; and except help come, they would\nkill him--'butcher him,' as he expressed it. Referred in a sort of\ncasual way--and yet significant way--to 'the fact that the life policy\nin its simplest form is unknown in Lake Providence--they take out a\nmosquito policy besides.' He told many remarkable things about those\nlawless insects. Among others, said he had seen them try to vote.\nNoticing that this statement seemed to be a good deal of a strain on us,\nhe modified it a little: said he might have been mistaken, as to that\nparticular, but knew he had seen them around the polls 'canvassing.'\n\nThere was another passenger--friend of H.'s--who backed up the harsh\nevidence against those mosquitoes, and detailed some stirring adventures\nwhich he had had with them. The stories were pretty sizable, merely\npretty sizable; yet Mr. H. was continually interrupting with a cold,\ninexorable 'Wait--knock off twenty-five per cent. of that; now go\non;' or, 'Wait--you are getting that too strong; cut it down, cut it\ndown--you get a leetle too much costumery on to your statements: always\ndress a fact in tights, never in an ulster;' or, 'Pardon, once more: if\nyou are going to load anything more on to that statement, you want to\nget a couple of lighters and tow the rest, because it's drawing all the\nwater there is in the river already; stick to facts--just stick to\nthe cold facts; what these gentlemen want for a book is the frozen\ntruth--ain't that so, gentlemen?' He explained privately that it was\nnecessary to watch this man all the time, and keep him within bounds;\nit would not do to neglect this precaution, as he, Mr. H., 'knew to his\nsorrow.' Said he, 'I will not deceive you; he told me such a monstrous\nlie once, that it swelled my left ear up, and spread it so that I was\nactually not able to see out around it; it remained so for months, and\npeople came miles to see me fan myself with it.'\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 35\n\nVicksburg During the Trouble\n\nWE used to plow past the lofty hill-city, Vicksburg, down-stream; but\nwe cannot do that now. A cut-off has made a country town of it, like\nOsceola, St. Genevieve, and several others. There is currentless\nwater--also a big island--in front of Vicksburg now. You come down the\nriver the other side of the island, then turn and come up to the town;\nthat is, in high water: in low water you can't come up, but must land\nsome distance below it.\n\nSigns and scars still remain, as reminders of Vicksburg's tremendous\nwar experiences; earthworks, trees crippled by the cannon balls,\ncave-refuges in the clay precipices, etc. The caves did good service\nduring the six weeks' bombardment of the city--May 8 to July 4, 1863.\nThey were used by the non-combatants--mainly by the women and children;\nnot to live in constantly, but to fly to for safety on occasion. They\nwere mere holes, tunnels, driven into the perpendicular clay bank, then\nbranched Y shape, within the hill. Life in Vicksburg, during the six\nweeks was perhaps--but wait; here are some materials out of which to\nreproduce it:--\n\nPopulation, twenty-seven thousand soldiers and three thousand\nnon-combatants; the city utterly cut off from the world--walled solidly\nin, the frontage by gunboats, the rear by soldiers and batteries;\nhence, no buying and selling with the outside; no passing to and fro;\nno God-speeding a parting guest, no welcoming a coming one; no printed\nacres of world-wide news to be read at breakfast, mornings--a tedious\ndull absence of such matter, instead; hence, also, no running to see\nsteamboats smoking into view in the distance up or down, and plowing\ntoward the town--for none came, the river lay vacant and undisturbed;\nno rush and turmoil around the railway station, no struggling over\nbewildered swarms of passengers by noisy mobs of hackmen--all quiet\nthere; flour two hundred dollars a barrel, sugar thirty, corn ten\ndollars a bushel, bacon five dollars a pound, rum a hundred dollars a\ngallon; other things in proportion: consequently, no roar and racket of\ndrays and carriages tearing along the streets; nothing for them to\ndo, among that handful of non-combatants of exhausted means; at three\no'clock in the morning, silence; silence so dead that the measured\ntramp of a sentinel can be heard a seemingly impossible distance; out of\nhearing of this lonely sound, perhaps the stillness is absolute: all in\na moment come ground-shaking thunder-crashes of artillery, the sky\nis cobwebbed with the crisscrossing red lines streaming from soaring\nbomb-shells, and a rain of iron fragments descends upon the city;\ndescends upon the empty streets: streets which are not empty a moment\nlater, but mottled with dim figures of frantic women and children\nscurrying from home and bed toward the cave dungeons--encouraged by the\nhumorous grim soldiery, who shout 'Rats, to your holes!' and laugh.\n\nThe cannon-thunder rages, shells scream and crash overhead, the iron\nrain pours down, one hour, two hours, three, possibly six, then stops;\nsilence follows, but the streets are still empty; the silence continues;\nby-and-bye a head projects from a cave here and there and yonder, and\nreconnoitres, cautiously; the silence still continuing, bodies follow\nheads, and jaded, half smothered creatures group themselves about,\nstretch their cramped limbs, draw in deep draughts of the grateful fresh\nair, gossip with the neighbors from the next cave; maybe straggle off\nhome presently, or take a lounge through the town, if the stillness\ncontinues; and will scurry to the holes again, by-and-bye, when the\nwar-tempest breaks forth once more.\n\nThere being but three thousand of these cave-dwellers--merely the\npopulation of a village--would they not come to know each other, after a\nweek or two, and familiarly; insomuch that the fortunate or unfortunate\nexperiences of one would be of interest to all?\n\nThose are the materials furnished by history. From them might not almost\nanybody reproduce for himself the life of that time in Vicksburg? Could\nyou, who did not experience it, come nearer to reproducing it to the\nimagination of another non-participant than could a Vicksburger who did\nexperience it? It seems impossible; and yet there are reasons why it\nmight not really be. When one makes his first voyage in a ship, it is\nan experience which multitudinously bristles with striking novelties;\nnovelties which are in such sharp contrast with all this person's\nformer experiences that they take a seemingly deathless grip upon his\nimagination and memory. By tongue or pen he can make a landsman live\nthat strange and stirring voyage over with him; make him see it all and\nfeel it all. But if he wait? If he make ten voyages in succession--what\nthen? Why, the thing has lost color, snap, surprise; and has become\ncommonplace. The man would have nothing to tell that would quicken a\nlandsman's pulse.\n\nYears ago, I talked with a couple of the Vicksburg non-combatants--a man\nand his wife. Left to tell their story in their own way, those people\ntold it without fire, almost without interest.\n\nA week of their wonderful life there would have made their tongues\neloquent for ever perhaps; but they had six weeks of it, and that wore\nthe novelty all out; they got used to being bomb-shelled out of home\nand into the ground; the matter became commonplace. After that, the\npossibility of their ever being startlingly interesting in their talks\nabout it was gone. What the man said was to this effect:--\n\n'It got to be Sunday all the time. Seven Sundays in the week--to us,\nanyway. We hadn't anything to do, and time hung heavy. Seven Sundays,\nand all of them broken up at one time or another, in the day or in the\nnight, by a few hours of the awful storm of fire and thunder and iron.\nAt first we used to shin for the holes a good deal faster than we did\nafterwards. The first time, I forgot the children, and Maria fetched\nthem both along. When she was all safe in the cave she fainted. Two or\nthree weeks afterwards, when she was running for the holes, one morning,\nthrough a shell-shower, a big shell burst near her, and covered her all\nover with dirt, and a piece of the iron carried away her game-bag of\nfalse hair from the back of her head. Well, she stopped to get that\ngame-bag before she shoved along again! Was getting used to things\nalready, you see. We all got so that we could tell a good deal about\nshells; and after that we didn't always go under shelter if it was a\nlight shower. Us men would loaf around and talk; and a man would say,\n'There she goes!' and name the kind of shell it was from the sound of\nit, and go on talking--if there wasn't any danger from it. If a\nshell was bursting close over us, we stopped talking and stood\nstill;--uncomfortable, yes, but it wasn't safe to move. When it let\ngo, we went on talking again, if nobody hurt--maybe saying, 'That was a\nripper!' or some such commonplace comment before we resumed; or, maybe,\nwe would see a shell poising itself away high in the air overhead.\nIn that case, every fellow just whipped out a sudden, 'See you again,\ngents!' and shoved. Often and often I saw gangs of ladies promenading\nthe streets, looking as cheerful as you please, and keeping an eye\ncanted up watching the shells; and I've seen them stop still when they\nwere uncertain about what a shell was going to do, and wait and make\ncertain; and after that they sa'ntered along again, or lit out for\nshelter, according to the verdict. Streets in some towns have a litter\nof pieces of paper, and odds and ends of one sort or another lying\naround. Ours hadn't; they had _iron _litter. Sometimes a man\nwould gather up all the iron fragments and unbursted shells in his\nneighborhood, and pile them into a kind of monument in his front\nyard--a ton of it, sometimes. No glass left; glass couldn't stand such\na bombardment; it was all shivered out. Windows of the houses\nvacant--looked like eye-holes in a skull. _Whole _panes were as scarce\nas news.\n\n'We had church Sundays. Not many there, along at first; but by-and-bye\npretty good turnouts. I've seen service stop a minute, and everybody sit\nquiet--no voice heard, pretty funeral-like then--and all the more so on\naccount of the awful boom and crash going on outside and overhead; and\npretty soon, when a body could be heard, service would go on again.\nOrgans and church-music mixed up with a bombardment is a powerful queer\ncombination--along at first. Coming out of church, one morning, we had\nan accident--the only one that happened around me on a Sunday. I was\njust having a hearty handshake with a friend I hadn't seen for a while,\nand saying, 'Drop into our cave to-night, after bombardment; we've got\nhold of a pint of prime wh--.' Whiskey, I was going to say, you know,\nbut a shell interrupted. A chunk of it cut the man's arm off, and left\nit dangling in my hand. And do you know the thing that is going to stick\nthe longest in my memory, and outlast everything else, little and big, I\nreckon, is the mean thought I had then? It was 'the whiskey _is saved_.'\nAnd yet, don't you know, it was kind of excusable; because it was as\nscarce as diamonds, and we had only just that little; never had another\ntaste during the siege.\n\n'Sometimes the caves were desperately crowded, and always hot and close.\nSometimes a cave had twenty or twenty-five people packed into it; no\nturning-room for anybody; air so foul, sometimes, you couldn't have made\na candle burn in it. A child was born in one of those caves one night,\nThink of that; why, it was like having it born in a trunk.\n\n'Twice we had sixteen people in our cave; and a number of times we had a\ndozen. Pretty suffocating in there. We always had eight; eight belonged\nthere. Hunger and misery and sickness and fright and sorrow, and I\ndon't know what all, got so loaded into them that none of them were ever\nrightly their old selves after the siege. They all died but three of us\nwithin a couple of years. One night a shell burst in front of the hole\nand caved it in and stopped it up. It was lively times, for a while,\ndigging out. Some of us came near smothering. After that we made two\nopenings--ought to have thought of it at first.\n\n'Mule meat. No, we only got down to that the last day or two. Of course\nit was good; anything is good when you are starving.\n\nThis man had kept a diary during--six weeks? No, only the first six\ndays. The first day, eight close pages; the second, five; the third,\none--loosely written; the fourth, three or four lines; a line or two\nthe fifth and sixth days; seventh day, diary abandoned; life in terrific\nVicksburg having now become commonplace and matter of course.\n\nThe war history of Vicksburg has more about it to interest the general\nreader than that of any other of the river-towns. It is full of variety,\nfull of incident, full of the picturesque. Vicksburg held out longer\nthan any other important river-town, and saw warfare in all its phases,\nboth land and water--the siege, the mine, the assault, the repulse, the\nbombardment, sickness, captivity, famine.\n\nThe most beautiful of all the national cemeteries is here. Over the\ngreat gateway is this inscription:--\n\n“HERE REST IN PEACE 16,600 WHO DIED FOR THEIR COUNTRY IN THE YEARS 1861\nTO 1865.”\n\nThe grounds are nobly situated; being very high and commanding a wide\nprospect of land and river. They are tastefully laid out in broad\nterraces, with winding roads and paths; and there is profuse adornment\nin the way of semi-tropical shrubs and flowers,' and in one part is a\npiece of native wild-wood, left just as it grew, and, therefore, perfect\nin its charm. Everything about this cemetery suggests the hand of the\nnational Government. The Government's work is always conspicuous for\nexcellence, solidity, thoroughness, neatness. The Government does its\nwork well in the first place, and then takes care of it.\n\nBy winding-roads--which were often cut to so great a depth between\nperpendicular walls that they were mere roofless tunnels--we drove out a\nmile or two and visited the monument which stands upon the scene of the\nsurrender of Vicksburg to General Grant by General Pemberton. Its metal\nwill preserve it from the hackings and chippings which so defaced\nits predecessor, which was of marble; but the brick foundations\nare crumbling, and it will tumble down by-and-bye. It overlooks a\npicturesque region of wooded hills and ravines; and is not unpicturesque\nitself, being well smothered in flowering weeds. The battered remnant of\nthe marble monument has been removed to the National Cemetery.\n\nOn the road, a quarter of a mile townward, an aged colored man showed\nus, with pride, an unexploded bomb-shell which has lain in his yard\nsince the day it fell there during the siege.\n\n'I was a-stannin' heah, an' de dog was a-stannin' heah; de dog he went\nfor de shell, gwine to pick a fuss wid it; but I didn't; I says, “Jes'\nmake you'seff at home heah; lay still whah you is, or bust up de place,\njes' as you's a mind to, but I's got business out in de woods, I has!”'\n\nVicksburg is a town of substantial business streets and pleasant\nresidences; it commands the commerce of the Yazoo and Sunflower Rivers;\nis pushing railways in several directions, through rich agricultural\nregions, and has a promising future of prosperity and importance.\n\nApparently, nearly all the river towns, big and little, have made up\ntheir minds that they must look mainly to railroads for wealth and\nupbuilding, henceforth. They are acting upon this idea. The signs are,\nthat the next twenty years will bring about some noteworthy changes in\nthe Valley, in the direction of increased population and wealth, and in\nthe intellectual advancement and the liberalizing of opinion which go\nnaturally with these. And yet, if one may judge by the past, the river\ntowns will manage to find and use a chance, here and there, to cripple\nand retard their progress. They kept themselves back in the days of\nsteamboating supremacy, by a system of wharfage-dues so stupidly graded\nas to prohibit what may be called small _retail _traffic in freights and\npassengers. Boats were charged such heavy wharfage that they could not\nafford to land for one or two passengers or a light lot of freight.\nInstead of encouraging the bringing of trade to their doors, the towns\ndiligently and effectively discouraged it. They could have had many\nboats and low rates; but their policy rendered few boats and high\nrates compulsory. It was a policy which extended--and extends--from New\nOrleans to St. Paul.\n\nWe had a strong desire to make a trip up the Yazoo and the Sunflower--an\ninteresting region at any time, but additionally interesting at this\ntime, because up there the great inundation was still to be seen in\nforce--but we were nearly sure to have to wait a day or more for a New\nOrleans boat on our return; so we were obliged to give up the project.\n\nHere is a story which I picked up on board the boat that night. I insert\nit in this place merely because it is a good story, not because it\nbelongs here--for it doesn't. It was told by a passenger--a college\nprofessor--and was called to the surface in the course of a general\nconversation which began with talk about horses, drifted into talk\nabout astronomy, then into talk about the lynching of the gamblers\nin Vicksburg half a century ago, then into talk about dreams and\nsuperstitions; and ended, after midnight, in a dispute over free trade\nand protection.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 36\n\nThe Professor's Yarn\n\nIT was in the early days. I was not a college professor then. I was a\nhumble-minded young land-surveyor, with the world before me--to survey,\nin case anybody wanted it done. I had a contract to survey a route for a\ngreat mining-ditch in California, and I was on my way thither, by sea--a\nthree or four weeks' voyage. There were a good many passengers, but I\nhad very little to say to them; reading and dreaming were my passions,\nand I avoided conversation in order to indulge these appetites. There\nwere three professional gamblers on board--rough, repulsive fellows. I\nnever had any talk with them, yet I could not help seeing them with some\nfrequency, for they gambled in an upper-deck stateroom every day and\nnight, and in my promenades I often had glimpses of them through their\ndoor, which stood a little ajar to let out the surplus tobacco smoke and\nprofanity. They were an evil and hateful presence, but I had to put up\nwith it, of course,\n\nThere was one other passenger who fell under my eye a good deal, for he\nseemed determined to be friendly with me, and I could not have gotten\nrid of him without running some chance of hurting his feelings, and I\nwas far from wishing to do that. Besides, there was something engaging\nin his countrified simplicity and his beaming good-nature. The first\ntime I saw this Mr. John Backus, I guessed, from his clothes and his\nlooks, that he was a grazier or farmer from the backwoods of some\nwestern State--doubtless Ohio--and afterward when he dropped into his\npersonal history and I discovered that he _was _a cattle-raiser from\ninterior Ohio, I was so pleased with my own penetration that I warmed\ntoward him for verifying my instinct.\n\nHe got to dropping alongside me every day, after breakfast, to help me\nmake my promenade; and so, in the course of time, his easy-working jaw\nhad told me everything about his business, his prospects, his family,\nhis relatives, his politics--in fact everything that concerned a Backus,\nliving or dead. And meantime I think he had managed to get out of me\neverything I knew about my trade, my tribe, my purposes, my prospects,\nand myself. He was a gentle and persuasive genius, and this thing showed\nit; for I was not given to talking about my matters. I said something\nabout triangulation, once; the stately word pleased his ear; he inquired\nwhat it meant; I explained; after that he quietly and inoffensively\nignored my name, and always called me Triangle.\n\nWhat an enthusiast he was in cattle! At the bare name of a bull or\na cow, his eye would light and his eloquent tongue would turn itself\nloose. As long as I would walk and listen, he would walk and talk; he\nknew all breeds, he loved all breeds, he caressed them all with his\naffectionate tongue. I tramped along in voiceless misery whilst the\ncattle question was up; when I could endure it no longer, I used to\ndeftly insert a scientific topic into the conversation; then my eye\nfired and his faded; my tongue fluttered, his stopped; life was a joy to\nme, and a sadness to him.\n\nOne day he said, a little hesitatingly, and with somewhat of\ndiffidence--\n\n'Triangle, would you mind coming down to my stateroom a minute, and have\na little talk on a certain matter?'\n\nI went with him at once. Arrived there, he put his head out, glanced up\nand down the saloon warily, then closed the door and locked it. He sat\ndown on the sofa, and he said--\n\n'I'm a-going to make a little proposition to you, and if it strikes\nyou favorable, it'll be a middling good thing for both of us. You ain't\na-going out to Californy for fun, nuther am I--it's business, ain't that\nso? Well, you can do me a good turn, and so can I you, if we see fit.\nI've raked and scraped and saved, a considerable many years, and I've\ngot it all here.' He unlocked an old hair trunk, tumbled a chaos of\nshabby clothes aside, and drew a short stout bag into view for a moment,\nthen buried it again and relocked the trunk. Dropping his voice to a\ncautious low tone, he continued, 'She's all there--a round ten thousand\ndollars in yellow-boys; now this is my little idea: What I don't know\nabout raising cattle, ain't worth knowing. There's mints of money in it,\nin Californy. Well, I know, and you know, that all along a line that\n's being surveyed, there 's little dabs of land that they call “gores,”\n that fall to the surveyor free gratis for nothing. All you've got to do,\non your side, is to survey in such a way that the “gores” will fall on\ngood fat land, then you turn 'em over to me, I stock 'em with cattle,\nin rolls the cash, I plank out your share of the dollars regular, right\nalong, and--'\n\nI was sorry to wither his blooming enthusiasm, but it could not be\nhelped. I interrupted, and said severely--\n\n'I am not that kind of a surveyor. Let us change the subject, Mr.\nBackus.'\n\nIt was pitiful to see his confusion and hear his awkward and shamefaced\napologies. I was as much distressed as he was--especially as he seemed\nso far from having suspected that there was anything improper in his\nproposition. So I hastened to console him and lead him on to forget his\nmishap in a conversational orgy about cattle and butchery. We were lying\nat Acapulco; and, as we went on deck, it happened luckily that the crew\nwere just beginning to hoist some beeves aboard in slings. Backus's\nmelancholy vanished instantly, and with it the memory of his late\nmistake.\n\n'Now only look at that!' cried he; 'My goodness, Triangle, what _would\n_they say to it in _Ohio_. Wouldn't their eyes bug out, to see 'em\nhandled like that?--wouldn't they, though?'\n\nAll the passengers were on deck to look--even the gamblers--and Backus\nknew them all, and had afflicted them all with his pet topic. As I moved\naway, I saw one of the gamblers approach and accost him; then another\nof them; then the third. I halted; waited; watched; the conversation\ncontinued between the four men; it grew earnest; Backus drew gradually\naway; the gamblers followed, and kept at his elbow. I was uncomfortable.\nHowever, as they passed me presently, I heard Backus say, with a tone of\npersecuted annoyance--\n\n'But it ain't any use, gentlemen; I tell you again, as I've told you a\nhalf a dozen times before, I warn't raised to it, and I ain't a-going to\nresk it.'\n\nI felt relieved. 'His level head will be his sufficient protection,' I\nsaid to myself.\n\nDuring the fortnight's run from Acapulco to San Francisco I several\ntimes saw the gamblers talking earnestly with Backus, and once I threw\nout a gentle warning to him. He chuckled comfortably and said--\n\n'Oh, yes! they tag around after me considerable--want me to play a\nlittle, just for amusement, they say--but laws-a-me, if my folks have\ntold me once to look out for that sort of live-stock, they've told me a\nthousand times, I reckon.'\n\nBy-and-bye, in due course, we were approaching San Francisco. It was\nan ugly black night, with a strong wind blowing, but there was not much\nsea. I was on deck, alone. Toward ten I started below. A figure issued\nfrom the gamblers' den, and disappeared in the darkness. I experienced\na shock, for I was sure it was Backus. I flew down the companion-way,\nlooked about for him, could not find him, then returned to the deck just\nin time to catch a glimpse of him as he re-entered that confounded nest\nof rascality. Had he yielded at last? I feared it. What had he gone\nbelow for?--His bag of coin? Possibly. I drew near the door, full of\nbodings. It was a-crack, and I glanced in and saw a sight that made me\nbitterly wish I had given my attention to saving my poor cattle-friend,\ninstead of reading and dreaming my foolish time away. He was gambling.\nWorse still, he was being plied with champagne, and was already showing\nsome effect from it. He praised the 'cider,' as he called it, and said\nnow that he had got a taste of it he almost believed he would drink it\nif it was spirits, it was so good and so ahead of anything he had ever\nrun across before. Surreptitious smiles, at this, passed from one rascal\nto another, and they filled all the glasses, and whilst Backus honestly\ndrained his to the bottom they pretended to do the same, but threw the\nwine over their shoulders.\n\nI could not bear the scene, so I wandered forward and tried to interest\nmyself in the sea and the voices of the wind. But no, my uneasy spirit\nkept dragging me back at quarter-hour intervals; and always I saw Backus\ndrinking his wine--fairly and squarely, and the others throwing theirs\naway. It was the painfullest night I ever spent.\n\nThe only hope I had was that we might reach our anchorage with\nspeed--that would break up the game. I helped the ship along all I could\nwith my prayers. At last we went booming through the Golden Gate, and my\npulses leaped for joy. I hurried back to that door and glanced in. Alas,\nthere was small room for hope--Backus's eyes were heavy and bloodshot,\nhis sweaty face was crimson, his speech maudlin and thick, his body\nsawed drunkenly about with the weaving motion of the ship. He drained\nanother glass to the dregs, whilst the cards were being dealt.\n\nHe took his hand, glanced at it, and his dull eyes lit up for a moment.\nThe gamblers observed it, and showed their gratification by hardly\nperceptible signs.\n\n'How many cards?'\n\n'None!' said Backus.\n\nOne villain--named Hank Wiley--discarded one card, the others three\neach. The betting began. Heretofore the bets had been trifling--a dollar\nor two; but Backus started off with an eagle now, Wiley hesitated a\nmoment, then 'saw it' and 'went ten dollars better.' The other two threw\nup their hands.\n\nBackus went twenty better. Wiley said--\n\n'I see that, and go you a hundred better!' then smiled and reached for\nthe money.\n\n'Let it alone,' said Backus, with drunken gravity.\n\n'What! you mean to say you're going to cover it?'\n\n'Cover it? Well, I reckon I am--and lay another hundred on top of it,\ntoo.'\n\nHe reached down inside his overcoat and produced the required sum.\n\n'Oh, that's your little game, is it? I see your raise, and raise it five\nhundred!' said Wiley.\n\n'Five hundred better.' said the foolish bull-driver, and pulled out the\namount and showered it on the pile. The three conspirators hardly tried\nto conceal their exultation.\n\nAll diplomacy and pretense were dropped now, and the sharp exclamations\ncame thick and fast, and the yellow pyramid grew higher and higher. At\nlast ten thousand dollars lay in view. Wiley cast a bag of coin on the\ntable, and said with mocking gentleness--\n\n'Five thousand dollars better, my friend from the rural districts--what\ndo you say _now_?'\n\n'I _call _you!' said Backus, heaving his golden shot-bag on the pile.\n'What have you got?'\n\n'Four kings, you d--d fool!' and Wiley threw down his cards and\nsurrounded the stakes with his arms.\n\n'Four _aces_, you ass!' thundered Backus, covering his man with a cocked\nrevolver. '_I'm a professional gambler myself, and i've been laying for\nyou duffers all this voyage!'_\n\nDown went the anchor, rumbledy-dum-dum! and the long trip was ended.\n\nWell--well, it is a sad world. One of the three gamblers was Backus's\n'pal.' It was he that dealt the fateful hands. According to an\nunderstanding with the two victims, he was to have given Backus four\nqueens, but alas, he didn't.\n\nA week later, I stumbled upon Backus--arrayed in the height of\nfashion--in Montgomery Street. He said, cheerily, as we were parting--\n\n'Ah, by-the-way, you needn't mind about those gores. I don't really know\nanything about cattle, except what I was able to pick up in a week's\napprenticeship over in Jersey just before we sailed. My cattle-culture\nand cattle-enthusiasm have served their turn--I shan't need them any\nmore.'\n\nNext day we reluctantly parted from the 'Gold Dust' and her officers,\nhoping to see that boat and all those officers again, some day. A thing\nwhich the fates were to render tragically impossible!\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 37\n\nThe End of the 'Gold Dust'\n\nFOR, three months later, August 8, while I was writing one of these\nforegoing chapters, the New York papers brought this telegram--\n\nA TERRIBLE DISASTER.\n\nSEVENTEEN PERSONS KILLED BY AN EXPLOSION ON THE STEAMER 'GOLD DUST.'\n\n'NASHVILLE, Aug. 7.--A despatch from Hickman, Ky., says--\n\n'The steamer “Gold Dust” exploded her boilers at three o'clock to-day,\njust after leaving Hickman. Forty-seven persons were scalded and\nseventeen are missing. The boat was landed in the eddy just above the\ntown, and through the exertions of the citizens the cabin passengers,\nofficers, and part of the crew and deck passengers were taken ashore and\nremoved to the hotels and residences. Twenty-four of the injured were\nlying in Holcomb's dry-goods store at one time, where they received\nevery attention before being removed to more comfortable places.'\n\nA list of the names followed, whereby it appeared that of the seventeen\ndead, one was the barkeeper; and among the forty-seven wounded, were the\ncaptain, chief mate, second mate, and second and third clerks; also Mr.\nLem S. Gray, pilot, and several members of the crew.\n\nIn answer to a private telegram, we learned that none of these was\nseverely hurt, except Mr. Gray. Letters received afterward confirmed\nthis news, and said that Mr. Gray was improving and would get well.\nLater letters spoke less hopefully of his case; and finally came one\nannouncing his death. A good man, a most companionable and manly man,\nand worthy of a kindlier fate.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 38\n\nThe House Beautiful\n\nWE took passage in a Cincinnati boat for New Orleans; or on a Cincinnati\nboat--either is correct; the former is the eastern form of putting it,\nthe latter the western.\n\nMr. Dickens declined to agree that the Mississippi steamboats were\n'magnificent,' or that they were 'floating palaces,'--terms which\nhad always been applied to them; terms which did not over-express the\nadmiration with which the people viewed them.\n\nMr. Dickens's position was unassailable, possibly; the people's position\nwas certainly unassailable. If Mr. Dickens was comparing these boats\nwith the crown jewels; or with the Taj, or with the Matterhorn; or with\nsome other priceless or wonderful thing which he had seen, they were not\nmagnificent--he was right. The people compared them with what they had\nseen; and, thus measured, thus judged, the boats were magnificent--the\nterm was the correct one, it was not at all too strong. The people were\nas right as was Mr. Dickens. The steamboats were finer than anything on\nshore. Compared with superior dwelling-houses and first-class hotels in\nthe Valley, they were indubitably magnificent, they were 'palaces.' To\na few people living in New Orleans and St. Louis, they were not\nmagnificent, perhaps; not palaces; but to the great majority of those\npopulations, and to the entire populations spread over both banks\nbetween Baton Rouge and St. Louis, they were palaces; they tallied with\nthe citizen's dream of what magnificence was, and satisfied it.\n\nEvery town and village along that vast stretch of double river-frontage\nhad a best dwelling, finest dwelling, mansion,--the home of its\nwealthiest and most conspicuous citizen. It is easy to describe it:\nlarge grassy yard, with paling fence painted white--in fair repair;\nbrick walk from gate to door; big, square, two-story 'frame' house,\npainted white and porticoed like a Grecian temple--with this difference,\nthat the imposing fluted columns and Corinthian capitals were a pathetic\nsham, being made of white pine, and painted; iron knocker; brass door\nknob--discolored, for lack of polishing. Within, an uncarpeted hall, of\nplaned boards; opening out of it, a parlor, fifteen feet by fifteen--in\nsome instances five or ten feet larger; ingrain carpet; mahogany\ncenter-table; lamp on it, with green-paper shade--standing on a\ngridiron, so to speak, made of high-colored yarns, by the young ladies\nof the house, and called a lamp-mat; several books, piled and disposed,\nwith cast-iron exactness, according to an inherited and unchangeable\nplan; among them, Tupper, much penciled; also, 'Friendship's Offering,'\nand 'Affection's Wreath,' with their sappy inanities illustrated\nin die-away mezzotints; also, Ossian; 'Alonzo and Melissa:'\nmaybe 'Ivanhoe:' also 'Album,' full of original 'poetry' of the\nThou-hast-wounded-the-spirit-that-loved-thee breed; two or three\ngoody-goody works--'Shepherd of Salisbury Plain,' etc.; current\nnumber of the chaste and innocuous Godey's 'Lady's Book,' with painted\nfashion-plate of wax-figure women with mouths all alike--lips and\neyelids the same size--each five-foot woman with a two-inch wedge\nsticking from under her dress and letting-on to be half of her foot.\nPolished air-tight stove (new and deadly invention), with pipe passing\nthrough a board which closes up the discarded good old fireplace. On\neach end of the wooden mantel, over the fireplace, a large basket of\npeaches and other fruits, natural size, all done in plaster, rudely, or\nin wax, and painted to resemble the originals--which they don't. Over\nmiddle of mantel, engraving--Washington Crossing the Delaware; on the\nwall by the door, copy of it done in thunder-and-lightning crewels by\none of the young ladies--work of art which would have made Washington\nhesitate about crossing, if he could have foreseen what advantage was\ngoing to be taken of it. Piano--kettle in disguise--with music, bound\nand unbound, piled on it, and on a stand near by: Battle of Prague;\nBird Waltz; Arkansas Traveler; Rosin the Bow; Marseilles Hymn; On a Lone\nBarren Isle (St. Helena); The Last Link is Broken; She wore a Wreath of\nRoses the Night when last we met; Go, forget me, Why should Sorrow o'er\nthat Brow a Shadow fling; Hours there were to Memory Dearer; Long, Long\nAgo; Days of Absence; A Life on the Ocean Wave, a Home on the Rolling\nDeep; Bird at Sea; and spread open on the rack, where the plaintive\nsinger has left it, _ro_-holl on, silver _moo_-hoon, guide the\n_trav_-el-lerr his _way_, etc. Tilted pensively against the piano, a\nguitar--guitar capable of playing the Spanish Fandango by itself, if you\ngive it a start. Frantic work of art on the wall--pious motto, done on\nthe premises, sometimes in colored yarns, sometimes in faded grasses:\nprogenitor of the 'God Bless Our Home' of modern commerce. Framed in\nblack moldings on the wall, other works of arts, conceived and committed\non the premises, by the young ladies; being grim black-and-white\ncrayons; landscapes, mostly: lake, solitary sail-boat, petrified clouds,\npre-geological trees on shore, anthracite precipice; name of criminal\nconspicuous in the corner. Lithograph, Napoleon Crossing the Alps.\nLithograph, The Grave at St. Helena. Steel-plates, Trumbull's Battle of\nBunker Hill, and the Sally from Gibraltar. Copper-plates, Moses Smiting\nthe Rock, and Return of the Prodigal Son. In big gilt frame, slander\nof the family in oil: papa holding a book ['Constitution of the United\nStates'); guitar leaning against mamma, blue ribbons fluttering from\nits neck; the young ladies, as children, in slippers and scalloped\npantelettes, one embracing toy horse, the other beguiling kitten with\nball of yarn, and both simpering up at mamma, who simpers back. These\npersons all fresh, raw, and red--apparently skinned. Opposite, in\ngilt frame, grandpa and grandma, at thirty and twenty-two, stiff,\nold-fashioned, high-collared, puff-sleeved, glaring pallidly out from\na background of solid Egyptian night. Under a glass French clock dome,\nlarge bouquet of stiff flowers done in corpsy-white wax. Pyramidal\nwhat-not in the corner, the shelves occupied chiefly with bric-a-brac of\nthe period, disposed with an eye to best effect: shell, with the Lord's\nPrayer carved on it; another shell--of the long-oval sort, narrow,\nstraight orifice, three inches long, running from end to end--portrait\nof Washington carved on it; not well done; the shell had Washington's\nmouth, originally--artist should have built to that. These two are\nmemorials of the long-ago bridal trip to New Orleans and the French\nMarket. Other bric-a-brac: Californian 'specimens'--quartz, with gold\nwart adhering; old Guinea-gold locket, with circlet of ancestral hair in\nit; Indian arrow-heads, of flint; pair of bead moccasins, from uncle\nwho crossed the Plains; three 'alum' baskets of various colors--being\nskeleton-frame of wire, clothed-on with cubes of crystallized alum in\nthe rock-candy style--works of art which were achieved by the young\nladies; their doubles and duplicates to be found upon all what-nots\nin the land; convention of desiccated bugs and butterflies pinned to a\ncard; painted toy-dog, seated upon bellows-attachment--drops its\nunder jaw and squeaks when pressed upon; sugar-candy rabbit--limbs\nand features merged together, not strongly defined; pewter\npresidential-campaign medal; miniature card-board wood-sawyer, to be\nattached to the stove-pipe and operated by the heat; small Napoleon,\ndone in wax; spread-open daguerreotypes of dim children, parents,\ncousins, aunts, and friends, in all attitudes but customary ones; no\ntempled portico at back, and manufactured landscape stretching away in\nthe distance--that came in later, with the photograph; all these vague\nfigures lavishly chained and ringed--metal indicated and secured from\ndoubt by stripes and splashes of vivid gold bronze; all of them too much\ncombed, too much fixed up; and all of them uncomfortable in inflexible\nSunday-clothes of a pattern which the spectator cannot realize\ncould ever have been in fashion; husband and wife generally grouped\ntogether--husband sitting, wife standing, with hand on his shoulder--and\nboth preserving, all these fading years, some traceable effect of the\ndaguerreotypist's brisk 'Now smile, if you please!' Bracketed over\nwhat-not--place of special sacredness--an outrage in water-color, done\nby the young niece that came on a visit long ago, and died. Pity,\ntoo; for she might have repented of this in time. Horse-hair chairs,\nhorse-hair sofa which keeps sliding from under you. Window shades,\nof oil stuff, with milk-maids and ruined castles stenciled on them in\nfierce colors. Lambrequins dependent from gaudy boxings of beaten tin,\ngilded. Bedrooms with rag carpets; bedsteads of the 'corded' sort,\nwith a sag in the middle, the cords needing tightening; snuffy\nfeather-bed--not aired often enough; cane-seat chairs, splint-bottomed\nrocker; looking-glass on wall, school-slate size, veneered frame;\ninherited bureau; wash-bowl and pitcher, possibly--but not certainly;\nbrass candlestick, tallow candle, snuffers. Nothing else in the room.\nNot a bathroom in the house; and no visitor likely to come along who has\never seen one.\n\nThat was the residence of the principal citizen, all the way from the\nsuburbs of New Orleans to the edge of St. Louis. When he stepped aboard\na big fine steamboat, he entered a new and marvelous world: chimney-tops\ncut to counterfeit a spraying crown of plumes--and maybe painted red;\npilot-house, hurricane deck, boiler-deck guards, all garnished with\nwhite wooden filigree work of fanciful patterns; gilt acorns topping the\nderricks; gilt deer-horns over the big bell; gaudy symbolical picture\non the paddle-box, possibly; big roomy boiler-deck, painted blue, and\nfurnished with Windsor armchairs; inside, a far-receding snow-white\n'cabin;' porcelain knob and oil-picture on every stateroom door; curving\npatterns of filigree-work touched up with gilding, stretching overhead\nall down the converging vista; big chandeliers every little way, each\nan April shower of glittering glass-drops; lovely rainbow-light falling\neverywhere from the colored glazing of the skylights; the whole a\nlong-drawn, resplendent tunnel, a bewildering and soul-satisfying\nspectacle! In the ladies' cabin a pink and white Wilton carpet, as soft\nas mush, and glorified with a ravishing pattern of gigantic flowers.\nThen the Bridal Chamber--the animal that invented that idea was still\nalive and unhanged, at that day--Bridal Chamber whose pretentious\nflummery was necessarily overawing to the now tottering intellect of\nthat hosannahing citizen. Every state-room had its couple of cozy clean\nbunks, and perhaps a looking-glass and a snug closet; and sometimes\nthere was even a washbowl and pitcher, and part of a towel which could\nbe told from mosquito netting by an expert--though generally these\nthings were absent, and the shirt-sleeved passengers cleansed themselves\nat a long row of stationary bowls in the barber shop, where were also\npublic towels, public combs, and public soap.\n\nTake the steamboat which I have just described, and you have her in her\nhighest and finest, and most pleasing, and comfortable, and satisfactory\nestate. Now cake her over with a layer of ancient and obdurate dirt,\nand you have the Cincinnati steamer awhile ago referred to. Not all\nover--only inside; for she was ably officered in all departments except\nthe steward's.\n\nBut wash that boat and repaint her, and she would be about the\ncounterpart of the most complimented boat of the old flush times: for\nthe steamboat architecture of the West has undergone no change; neither\nhas steamboat furniture and ornamentation undergone any.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 39\n\nManufactures and Miscreants\n\nWHERE the river, in the Vicksburg region, used to be corkscrewed, it\nis now comparatively straight--made so by cut-off; a former distance\nof seventy miles is reduced to thirty-five. It is a change which threw\nVicksburg's neighbor, Delta, Louisiana, out into the country and ended\nits career as a river town. Its whole river-frontage is now occupied by\na vast sand-bar, thickly covered with young trees--a growth which will\nmagnify itself into a dense forest by-and-bye, and completely hide the\nexiled town.\n\nIn due time we passed Grand Gulf and Rodney, of war fame, and reached\nNatchez, the last of the beautiful hill-cities--for Baton Rouge, yet\nto come, is not on a hill, but only on high ground. Famous\nNatchez-under-the-hill has not changed notably in twenty years; in\noutward aspect--judging by the descriptions of the ancient procession\nof foreign tourists--it has not changed in sixty; for it is still small,\nstraggling, and shabby. It had a desperate reputation, morally, in\nthe old keel-boating and early steamboating times--plenty of drinking,\ncarousing, fisticuffing, and killing there, among the riff-raff of the\nriver, in those days. But Natchez-on-top-of-the-hill is attractive; has\nalways been attractive. Even Mrs. Trollope (1827) had to confess its\ncharms:\n\n'At one or two points the wearisome level line is relieved by bluffs,\nas they call the short intervals of high ground. The town of Natchez is\nbeautifully situated on one of those high spots. The contrast that\nits bright green hill forms with the dismal line of black forest that\nstretches on every side, the abundant growth of the pawpaw, palmetto\nand orange, the copious variety of sweet-scented flowers that flourish\nthere, all make it appear like an oasis in the desert. Natchez is the\nfurthest point to the north at which oranges ripen in the open air,\nor endure the winter without shelter. With the exception of this\nsweet spot, I thought all the little towns and villages we passed\nwretched-looking in the extreme.'\n\nNatchez, like her near and far river neighbors, has railways now, and is\nadding to them--pushing them hither and thither into all rich outlying\nregions that are naturally tributary to her. And like Vicksburg and New\nOrleans, she has her ice-factory: she makes thirty tons of ice a day.\nIn Vicksburg and Natchez, in my time, ice was jewelry; none but the rich\ncould wear it. But anybody and everybody can have it now. I visited one\nof the ice-factories in New Orleans, to see what the polar regions\nmight look like when lugged into the edge of the tropics. But there was\nnothing striking in the aspect of the place. It was merely a spacious\nhouse, with some innocent steam machinery in one end of it and some big\nporcelain pipes running here and there. No, not porcelain--they merely\nseemed to be; they were iron, but the ammonia which was being breathed\nthrough them had coated them to the thickness of your hand with solid\nmilk-white ice. It ought to have melted; for one did not require winter\nclothing in that atmosphere: but it did not melt; the inside of the pipe\nwas too cold.\n\nSunk into the floor were numberless tin boxes, a foot square and two\nfeet long, and open at the top end. These were full of clear water;\nand around each box, salt and other proper stuff was packed; also, the\nammonia gases were applied to the water in some way which will always\nremain a secret to me, because I was not able to understand the process.\nWhile the water in the boxes gradually froze, men gave it a stir or two\nwith a stick occasionally--to liberate the air-bubbles, I think. Other\nmen were continually lifting out boxes whose contents had become hard\nfrozen. They gave the box a single dip into a vat of boiling water, to\nmelt the block of ice free from its tin coffin, then they shot the block\nout upon a platform car, and it was ready for market. These big blocks\nwere hard, solid, and crystal-clear. In certain of them, big bouquets\nof fresh and brilliant tropical flowers had been frozen-in; in others,\nbeautiful silken-clad French dolls, and other pretty objects.\nThese blocks were to be set on end in a platter, in the center of\ndinner-tables, to cool the tropical air; and also to be ornamental, for\nthe flowers and things imprisoned in them could be seen as through plate\nglass. I was told that this factory could retail its ice, by wagon,\nthroughout New Orleans, in the humblest dwelling-house quantities, at\nsix or seven dollars a ton, and make a sufficient profit. This being the\ncase, there is business for ice-factories in the North; for we get ice\non no such terms there, if one take less than three hundred and fifty\npounds at a delivery.\n\nThe Rosalie Yarn Mill, of Natchez, has a capacity of 6,000 spindles and\n160 looms, and employs 100 hands. The Natchez Cotton Mills Company began\noperations four years ago in a two-story building of 50 x 190 feet, with\n4,000 spindles and 128 looms; capital $105,000, all subscribed in the\ntown. Two years later, the same stockholders increased their capital to\n$225,000; added a third story to the mill, increased its length to 317\nfeet; added machinery to increase the capacity to 10,300 spindles and\n304 looms. The company now employ 250 operatives, many of whom are\ncitizens of Natchez. 'The mill works 5,000 bales of cotton annually and\nmanufactures the best standard quality of brown shirtings and\nsheetings and drills, turning out 5,000,000 yards of these goods per\nyear.'{footnote [New Orleans Times-Democrat, 26 Aug, 1882.]} A close\ncorporation--stock held at $5,000 per share, but none in the market.\n\nThe changes in the Mississippi River are great and strange, yet were to\nbe expected; but I was not expecting to live to see Natchez and these\nother river towns become manufacturing strongholds and railway centers.\n\nSpeaking of manufactures reminds me of a talk upon that topic which I\nheard--which I overheard--on board the Cincinnati boat. I awoke out of\na fretted sleep, with a dull confusion of voices in my ears. I\nlistened--two men were talking; subject, apparently, the great\ninundation. I looked out through the open transom. The two men were\neating a late breakfast; sitting opposite each other; nobody else\naround. They closed up the inundation with a few words--having used it,\nevidently, as a mere ice-breaker and acquaintanceship-breeder--then they\ndropped into business. It soon transpired that they were drummers--one\nbelonging in Cincinnati, the other in New Orleans. Brisk men, energetic\nof movement and speech; the dollar their god, how to get it their\nreligion.\n\n'Now as to this article,' said Cincinnati, slashing into the ostensible\nbutter and holding forward a slab of it on his knife-blade, 'it's from\nour house; look at it--smell of it--taste it. Put any test on it you\nwant to. Take your own time--no hurry--make it thorough. There\nnow--what do you say? butter, ain't it. Not by a thundering sight--it's\noleomargarine! Yes, sir, that's what it is--oleomargarine. You can't\ntell it from butter; by George, an _expert _can't. It's from our house.\nWe supply most of the boats in the West; there's hardly a pound of\nbutter on one of them. We are crawling right along--_jumping _right\nalong is the word. We are going to have that entire trade. Yes, and the\nhotel trade, too. You are going to see the day, pretty soon, when you\ncan't find an ounce of butter to bless yourself with, in any hotel in\nthe Mississippi and Ohio Valleys, outside of the biggest cities. Why, we\nare turning out oleomargarine _now _by the thousands of tons. And we can\nsell it so dirt-cheap that the whole country has _got _to take it--can't\nget around it you see. Butter don't stand any show--there ain't any\nchance for competition. Butter's had its _day_--and from this out,\nbutter goes to the wall. There's more money in oleomargarine than--why,\nyou can't imagine the business we do. I've stopped in every town from\nCincinnati to Natchez; and I've sent home big orders from every one of\nthem.'\n\nAnd so-forth and so-on, for ten minutes longer, in the same fervid\nstrain. Then New Orleans piped up and said--\n\nYes, it's a first-rate imitation, that's a certainty; but it ain't the\nonly one around that's first-rate. For instance, they make olive-oil out\nof cotton-seed oil, nowadays, so that you can't tell them apart.'\n\n'Yes, that's so,' responded Cincinnati, 'and it was a tip-top business\nfor a while. They sent it over and brought it back from France and\nItaly, with the United States custom-house mark on it to indorse it for\ngenuine, and there was no end of cash in it; but France and Italy broke\nup the game--of course they naturally would. Cracked on such a rattling\nimpost that cotton-seed olive-oil couldn't stand the raise; had to hang\nup and quit.'\n\n'Oh, it _did_, did it? You wait here a minute.'\n\nGoes to his state-room, brings back a couple of long bottles, and takes\nout the corks--says:\n\n'There now, smell them, taste them, examine the bottles, inspect the\nlabels. One of 'm's from Europe, the other's never been out of this\ncountry. One's European olive-oil, the other's American cotton-seed\nolive-oil. Tell 'm apart? 'Course you can't. Nobody can. People that\nwant to, can go to the expense and trouble of shipping their oils to\nEurope and back--it's their privilege; but our firm knows a trick worth\nsix of that. We turn out the whole thing--clean from the word go--in our\nfactory in New Orleans: labels, bottles, oil, everything. Well, no, not\nlabels: been buying them abroad--get them dirt-cheap there. You see,\nthere's just one little wee speck, essence, or whatever it is, in\na gallon of cotton-seed oil, that give it a smell, or a flavor, or\nsomething--get that out, and you're all right--perfectly easy then to\nturn the oil into any kind of oil you want to, and there ain't anybody\nthat can detect the true from the false. Well, we know how to get that\none little particle out--and we're the only firm that does. And we turn\nout an olive-oil that is just simply perfect--undetectable! We are doing\na ripping trade, too--as I could easily show you by my order-book for\nthis trip. Maybe you'll butter everybody's bread pretty soon, but we'll\ncotton-seed his salad for him from the Gulf to Canada, and that's a\ndead-certain thing.'\n\nCincinnati glowed and flashed with admiration. The two scoundrels\nexchanged business-cards, and rose. As they left the table, Cincinnati\nsaid--\n\n'But you have to have custom-house marks, don't you? How do you manage\nthat?'\n\nI did not catch the answer.\n\nWe passed Port Hudson, scene of two of the most terrific episodes of the\nwar--the night-battle there between Farragut's fleet and the Confederate\nland batteries, April 14th, 1863; and the memorable land battle, two\nmonths later, which lasted eight hours--eight hours of exceptionally\nfierce and stubborn fighting--and ended, finally, in the repulse of the\nUnion forces with great slaughter.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 40\n\nCastles and Culture\n\nBATON ROUGE was clothed in flowers, like a bride--no, much more so; like\na greenhouse. For we were in the absolute South now--no modifications,\nno compromises, no half-way measures. The magnolia-trees in the Capitol\ngrounds were lovely and fragrant, with their dense rich foliage and huge\nsnow-ball blossoms. The scent of the flower is very sweet, but you want\ndistance on it, because it is so powerful. They are not good bedroom\nblossoms--they might suffocate one in his sleep. We were certainly\nin the South at last; for here the sugar region begins, and the\nplantations--vast green levels, with sugar-mill and negro quarters\nclustered together in the middle distance--were in view. And there was a\ntropical sun overhead and a tropical swelter in the air.\n\nAnd at this point, also, begins the pilot's paradise: a wide river hence\nto New Orleans, abundance of water from shore to shore, and no bars,\nsnags, sawyers, or wrecks in his road.\n\nSir Walter Scott is probably responsible for the Capitol building; for\nit is not conceivable that this little sham castle would ever have been\nbuilt if he had not run the people mad, a couple of generations ago,\nwith his medieval romances. The South has not yet recovered from the\ndebilitating influence of his books. Admiration of his fantastic heroes\nand their grotesque 'chivalry' doings and romantic juvenilities still\nsurvives here, in an atmosphere in which is already perceptible the\nwholesome and practical nineteenth-century smell of cotton-factories\nand locomotives; and traces of its inflated language and other windy\nhumbuggeries survive along with it. It is pathetic enough, that a\nwhitewashed castle, with turrets and things--materials all ungenuine\nwithin and without, pretending to be what they are not--should ever\nhave been built in this otherwise honorable place; but it is much more\npathetic to see this architectural falsehood undergoing restoration and\nperpetuation in our day, when it would have been so easy to let\ndynamite finish what a charitable fire began, and then devote this\nrestoration-money to the building of something genuine.\n\nBaton Rouge has no patent on imitation castles, however, and no monopoly\nof them. Here is a picture from the advertisement of the 'Female\nInstitute' of Columbia; Tennessee. The following remark is from the same\nadvertisement--\n\n'The Institute building has long been famed as a model of striking and\nbeautiful architecture. Visitors are charmed with its resemblance to\nthe old castles of song and story, with its towers, turreted walls, and\nivy-mantled porches.'\n\nKeeping school in a castle is a romantic thing; as romantic as keeping\nhotel in a castle.\n\nBy itself the imitation castle is doubtless harmless, and well enough;\nbut as a symbol and breeder and sustainer of maudlin Middle-Age\nromanticism here in the midst of the plainest and sturdiest and\ninfinitely greatest and worthiest of all the centuries the world has\nseen, it is necessarily a hurtful thing and a mistake.\n\nHere is an extract from the prospectus of a Kentucky 'Female College.'\nFemale college sounds well enough; but since the phrasing it in that\nunjustifiable way was done purely in the interest of brevity, it seems\nto me that she-college would have been still better--because shorter,\nand means the same thing: that is, if either phrase means anything at\nall--\n\n'The president is southern by birth, by rearing, by education, and by\nsentiment; the teachers are all southern in sentiment, and with the\nexception of those born in Europe were born and raised in the south.\nBelieving the southern to be the highest type of civilization this\ncontinent has seen, the young ladies are trained according to the\nsouthern ideas of delicacy, refinement, womanhood, religion, and\npropriety; hence we offer a first-class female college for the south and\nsolicit southern patronage.'\n\n{footnote [Illustrations of it thoughtlessly omitted by the advertiser:\n\nKNOXVILLE, Tenn., October 19.--This morning a few minutes after ten\no'clock, General Joseph A. Mabry, Thomas O'Connor, and Joseph A. Mabry,\nJr., were killed in a shooting affray. The difficulty began yesterday\nafternoon by General Mabry attacking Major O'Connor and threatening to\nkill him. This was at the fair grounds, and O'Connor told Mabry that it\nwas not the place to settle their difficulties. Mabry then told O'Connor\nhe should not live. It seems that Mabry was armed and O'Connor was not.\nThe cause of the difficulty was an old feud about the transfer of some\nproperty from Mabry to O'Connor. Later in the afternoon Mabry sent word\nto O'Connor that he would kill him on sight. This morning Major O'Connor\nwas standing in the door of the Mechanics' National Bank, of which\nhe was president. General Mabry and another gentleman walked down Gay\nStreet on the opposite side from the bank. O'Connor stepped into the\nbank, got a shot gun, took deliberate aim at General Mabry and fired.\nMabry fell dead, being shot in the left side. As he fell O'Connor fired\nagain, the shot taking effect in Mabry's thigh. O'Connor then reached\ninto the bank and got another shot gun. About this time Joseph A. Mabry,\nJr., son of General Mabry, came rushing down the street, unseen by\nO'Connor until within forty feet, when the young man fired a pistol, the\nshot taking effect in O'Connor's right breast, passing through the body\nnear the heart. The instant Mabry shot, O'Connor turned and fired, the\nload taking effect in young Mabry's right breast and side. Mabry fell\npierced with twenty buckshot, and almost instantly O'Connor fell dead\nwithout a struggle. Mabry tried to rise, but fell back dead. The whole\ntragedy occurred within two minutes, and neither of the three spoke\nafter he was shot. General Mabry had about thirty buckshot in his body.\nA bystander was painfully wounded in the thigh with a buckshot, and\nanother was wounded in the arm. Four other men had their clothing\npierced by buckshot. The affair caused great excitement, and Gay Street\nwas thronged with thousands of people. General Mabry and his son Joe\nwere acquitted only a few days ago of the murder of Moses Lusby and Don\nLusby, father and son, whom they killed a few weeks ago. Will Mabry was\nkilled by Don Lusby last Christmas. Major Thomas O'Connor was President\nof the Mechanics' National Bank here, and was the wealthiest man in the\nState.--_Associated Press Telegram_.\n\nOne day last month, Professor Sharpe, of the Somerville, Tenn.,\nFemale College, 'a quiet and gentlemanly man,' was told that his\nbrother-in-law, a Captain Burton, had threatened to kill him. Burton, it\nseems, had already killed one man and driven his knife into another. The\nProfessor armed himself with a double-barreled shot gun, started out in\nsearch of his brother-in-law, found him playing billiards in a saloon,\nand blew his brains out. The 'Memphis Avalanche' reports that the\nProfessor's course met with pretty general approval in the community;\nknowing that the law was powerless, in the actual condition of public\nsentiment, to protect him, he protected himself.\n\nAbout the same time, two young men in North Carolina quarreled about a\ngirl, and 'hostile messages' were exchanged. Friends tried to reconcile\nthem, but had their labor for their pains. On the 24th the young men\nmet in the public highway. One of them had a heavy club in his hand, the\nother an ax. The man with the club fought desperately for his life, but\nit was a hopeless fight from the first. A well-directed blow sent his\nclub whirling out of his grasp, and the next moment he was a dead man.\n\nAbout the same time, two 'highly connected' young Virginians, clerks in\na hardware store at Charlottesville, while 'skylarking,' came to blows.\nPeter Dick threw pepper in Charles Roads's eyes; Roads demanded an\napology; Dick refused to give it, and it was agreed that a duel was\ninevitable, but a difficulty arose; the parties had no pistols, and\nit was too late at night to procure them. One of them suggested that\nbutcher-knives would answer the purpose, and the other accepted the\nsuggestion; the result was that Roads fell to the floor with a gash in\nhis abdomen that may or may not prove fatal. If Dick has been arrested,\nthe news has not reached us. He 'expressed deep regret,' and we are\ntold by a Staunton correspondent of the _Philadelphia Press_ that 'every\neffort has been made to hush the matter up.'--_Extracts From The Public\nJournals_.]}\n\nWhat, warder, ho! the man that can blow so complacent a blast as that,\nprobably blows it from a castle.\n\nFrom Baton Rouge to New Orleans, the great sugar plantations border both\nsides of the river all the way, and stretch their league-wide levels\nback to the dim forest-walls of bearded cypress in the rear.\nShores lonely no longer. Plenty of dwellings all the way, on both\nbanks--standing so close together, for long distances, that the broad\nriver lying between the two rows, becomes a sort of spacious street.\nA most home-like and happy-looking region. And now and then you see a\npillared and porticoed great manor-house, embowered in trees. Here is\ntestimony of one or two of the procession of foreign tourists that filed\nalong here half a century ago. Mrs. Trollope says--\n\n'The unbroken flatness of the banks of the Mississippi continued\nunvaried for many miles above New Orleans; but the graceful and\nluxuriant palmetto, the dark and noble ilex, and the bright orange,\nwere everywhere to be seen, and it was many days before we were weary of\nlooking at them.'\n\nCaptain Basil Hall--\n\n'The district of country which lies adjacent to the Mississippi, in\nthe lower parts of Louisiana, is everywhere thickly peopled by sugar\nplanters, whose showy houses, gay piazzas, trig gardens, and numerous\nslave-villages, all clean and neat, gave an exceedingly thriving air to\nthe river scenery.\n\nAll the procession paint the attractive picture in the same way. The\ndescriptions of fifty years ago do not need to have a word changed in\norder to exactly describe the same region as it appears to-day--except\nas to the 'trigness' of the houses. The whitewash is gone from the\nnegro cabins now; and many, possibly most, of the big mansions, once so\nshining white, have worn out their paint and have a decayed, neglected\nlook. It is the blight of the war. Twenty-one years ago everything was\ntrim and trig and bright along the 'coast,' just as it had been in 1827,\nas described by those tourists.\n\nUnfortunate tourists! People humbugged them with stupid and silly lies,\nand then laughed at them for believing and printing the same. They\ntold Mrs. Trollope that the alligators--or crocodiles, as she calls\nthem--were terrible creatures; and backed up the statement with a\nblood-curdling account of how one of these slandered reptiles crept into\na squatter cabin one night, and ate up a woman and five children.\nThe woman, by herself, would have satisfied any ordinarily-impossible\nalligator; but no, these liars must make him gorge the five children\nbesides. One would not imagine that jokers of this robust breed would be\nsensitive--but they were. It is difficult, at this day, to understand,\nand impossible to justify, the reception which the book of the grave,\nhonest, intelligent, gentle, manly, charitable, well-meaning Capt. Basil\nHall got.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 41\n\nThe Metropolis of the South\n\nTHE approaches to New Orleans were familiar; general aspects were\nunchanged. When one goes flying through London along a railway propped\nin the air on tall arches, he may inspect miles of upper bedrooms\nthrough the open windows, but the lower half of the houses is under\nhis level and out of sight. Similarly, in high-river stage, in the New\nOrleans region, the water is up to the top of the enclosing levee-rim,\nthe flat country behind it lies low--representing the bottom of a\ndish--and as the boat swims along, high on the flood, one looks down\nupon the houses and into the upper windows. There is nothing but that\nfrail breastwork of earth between the people and destruction.\n\nThe old brick salt-warehouses clustered at the upper end of the city\nlooked as they had always looked; warehouses which had had a kind of\nAladdin's lamp experience, however, since I had seen them; for when the\nwar broke out the proprietor went to bed one night leaving them packed\nwith thousands of sacks of vulgar salt, worth a couple of dollars a\nsack, and got up in the morning and found his mountain of salt turned\ninto a mountain of gold, so to speak, so suddenly and to so dizzy a\nheight had the war news sent up the price of the article.\n\nThe vast reach of plank wharves remained unchanged, and there were as\nmany ships as ever: but the long array of steamboats had vanished; not\naltogether, of course, but not much of it was left.\n\nThe city itself had not changed--to the eye. It had greatly increased\nin spread and population, but the look of the town was not altered. The\ndust, waste-paper-littered, was still deep in the streets; the deep,\ntrough-like gutters alongside the curbstones were still half full of\nreposeful water with a dusty surface; the sidewalks were still--in the\nsugar and bacon region--encumbered by casks and barrels and hogsheads;\nthe great blocks of austerely plain commercial houses were as\ndusty-looking as ever.\n\nCanal Street was finer, and more attractive and stirring than formerly,\nwith its drifting crowds of people, its several processions of hurrying\nstreet-cars, and--toward evening--its broad second-story verandas\ncrowded with gentlemen and ladies clothed according to the latest mode.\n\nNot that there is any 'architecture' in Canal Street: to speak in broad,\ngeneral terms, there is no architecture in New Orleans, except in the\ncemeteries. It seems a strange thing to say of a wealthy, far-seeing,\nand energetic city of a quarter of a million inhabitants, but it is\ntrue. There is a huge granite U.S. Custom-house--costly enough, genuine\nenough, but as a decoration it is inferior to a gasometer. It looks like\na state prison. But it was built before the war. Architecture in America\nmay be said to have been born since the war. New Orleans, I believe,\nhas had the good luck--and in a sense the bad luck--to have had no great\nfire in late years. It must be so. If the opposite had been the case,\nI think one would be able to tell the 'burnt district' by the radical\nimprovement in its architecture over the old forms. One can do this\nin Boston and Chicago. The 'burnt district' of Boston was commonplace\nbefore the fire; but now there is no commercial district in any city\nin the world that can surpass it--or perhaps even rival it--in beauty,\nelegance, and tastefulness.\n\nHowever, New Orleans has begun--just this moment, as one may say. When\ncompleted, the new Cotton Exchange will be a stately and beautiful\nbuilding; massive, substantial, full of architectural graces; no shams\nor false pretenses or uglinesses about it anywhere. To the city, it will\nbe worth many times its cost, for it will breed its species. What has\nbeen lacking hitherto, was a model to build toward; something to educate\neye and taste; a _suggester_, so to speak.\n\nThe city is well outfitted with progressive men--thinking, sagacious,\nlong-headed men. The contrast between the spirit of the city and the\ncity's architecture is like the contrast between waking and sleep.\nApparently there is a 'boom' in everything but that one dead feature.\nThe water in the gutters used to be stagnant and slimy, and a potent\ndisease-breeder; but the gutters are flushed now, two or three times\na day, by powerful machinery; in many of the gutters the water never\nstands still, but has a steady current. Other sanitary improvements have\nbeen made; and with such effect that New Orleans claims to be (during\nthe long intervals between the occasional yellow-fever assaults) one\nof the healthiest cities in the Union. There's plenty of ice now for\neverybody, manufactured in the town. It is a driving place commercially,\nand has a great river, ocean, and railway business. At the date of our\nvisit, it was the best lighted city in the Union, electrically speaking.\nThe New Orleans electric lights were more numerous than those of New\nYork, and very much better. One had this modified noonday not only in\nCanal and some neighboring chief streets, but all along a stretch\nof five miles of river frontage. There are good clubs in the city\nnow--several of them but recently organized--and inviting modern-style\npleasure resorts at West End and Spanish Fort. The telephone is\neverywhere. One of the most notable advances is in journalism. The\nnewspapers, as I remember them, were not a striking feature. Now they\nare. Money is spent upon them with a free hand. They get the news,\nlet it cost what it may. The editorial work is not hack-grinding, but\nliterature. As an example of New Orleans journalistic achievement, it\nmay be mentioned that the 'Times-Democrat' of August 26, 1882, contained\na report of the year's business of the towns of the Mississippi Valley,\nfrom New Orleans all the way to St. Paul--two thousand miles. That issue\nof the paper consisted of forty pages; seven columns to the page; two\nhundred and eighty columns in all; fifteen hundred words to the column;\nan aggregate of four hundred and twenty thousand words. That is to say,\nnot much short of three times as many words as there are in this book.\nOne may with sorrow contrast this with the architecture of New Orleans.\n\nI have been speaking of public architecture only. The domestic article\nin New Orleans is reproachless, notwithstanding it remains as it always\nwas. All the dwellings are of wood--in the American part of the town, I\nmean--and all have a comfortable look. Those in the wealthy quarter are\nspacious; painted snow-white usually, and generally have wide verandas,\nor double-verandas, supported by ornamental columns. These mansions\nstand in the center of large grounds, and rise, garlanded with roses,\nout of the midst of swelling masses of shining green foliage and\nmany-colored blossoms. No houses could well be in better harmony with\ntheir surroundings, or more pleasing to the eye, or more home-like and\ncomfortable-looking.\n\nOne even becomes reconciled to the cistern presently; this is a mighty\ncask, painted green, and sometimes a couple of stories high, which\nis propped against the house-corner on stilts. There is a\nmansion-and-brewery suggestion about the combination which seems very\nincongruous at first. But the people cannot have wells, and so they\ntake rain-water. Neither can they conveniently have cellars, or\ngraves,{footnote [The Israelites are buried in graves--by permission, I\ntake it, not requirement; but none else, except the destitute, who are\nburied at public expense. The graves are but three or four feet deep.]}\nthe town being built upon 'made' ground; so they do without both, and\nfew of the living complain, and none of the others.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 42\n\nHygiene and Sentiment\n\nTHEY bury their dead in vaults, above the ground. These vaults have\na resemblance to houses--sometimes to temples; are built of marble,\ngenerally; are architecturally graceful and shapely; they face the walks\nand driveways of the cemetery; and when one moves through the midst of a\nthousand or so of them and sees their white roofs and gables stretching\ninto the distance on every hand, the phrase 'city of the dead' has all\nat once a meaning to him. Many of the cemeteries are beautiful, and\nare kept in perfect order. When one goes from the levee or the business\nstreets near it, to a cemetery, he observes to himself that if those\npeople down there would live as neatly while they are alive as they do\nafter they are dead, they would find many advantages in it; and besides,\ntheir quarter would be the wonder and admiration of the business world.\nFresh flowers, in vases of water, are to be seen at the portals of many\nof the vaults: placed there by the pious hands of bereaved parents and\nchildren, husbands and wives, and renewed daily. A milder form of sorrow\nfinds its inexpensive and lasting remembrancer in the coarse and ugly\nbut indestructible 'immortelle'--which is a wreath or cross or some such\nemblem, made of rosettes of black linen, with sometimes a yellow rosette\nat the conjunction of the cross's bars--kind of sorrowful breast-pin, so\nto say. The immortelle requires no attention: you just hang it up, and\nthere you are; just leave it alone, it will take care of your grief for\nyou, and keep it in mind better than you can; stands weather first-rate,\nand lasts like boiler-iron.\n\nOn sunny days, pretty little chameleons--gracefullest of legged\nreptiles--creep along the marble fronts of the vaults, and catch flies.\nTheir changes of color--as to variety--are not up to the creature's\nreputation. They change color when a person comes along and hangs up\nan immortelle; but that is nothing: any right-feeling reptile would do\nthat.\n\nI will gradually drop this subject of graveyards. I have been trying\nall I could to get down to the sentimental part of it, but I cannot\naccomplish it. I think there is no genuinely sentimental part to it.\nIt is all grotesque, ghastly, horrible. Graveyards may have been\njustifiable in the bygone ages, when nobody knew that for every dead\nbody put into the ground, to glut the earth and the plant-roots, and the\nair with disease-germs, five or fifty, or maybe a hundred persons must\ndie before their proper time; but they are hardly justifiable now, when\neven the children know that a dead saint enters upon a century-long\ncareer of assassination the moment the earth closes over his corpse. It\nis a grim sort of a thought. The relics of St. Anne, up in Canada, have\nnow, after nineteen hundred years, gone to curing the sick by the dozen.\nBut it is merest matter-of-course that these same relics, within a\ngeneration after St. Anne's death and burial, _made _several\nthousand people sick. Therefore these miracle-performances are simply\ncompensation, nothing more. St. Anne is somewhat slow pay, for a Saint,\nit is true; but better a debt paid after nineteen hundred years, and\noutlawed by the statute of limitations, than not paid at all; and most\nof the knights of the halo do not pay at all. Where you find one that\npays--like St. Anne--you find a hundred and fifty that take the benefit\nof the statute. And none of them pay any more than the principal of what\nthey owe--they pay none of the interest either simple or compound. A\nSaint can never _quite _return the principal, however; for his dead body\n_kills _people, whereas his relics _heal _only--they never restore the\ndead to life. That part of the account is always left unsettled.\n\n'Dr. F. Julius Le Moyne, after fifty years of medical practice, wrote:\n“The inhumation of human bodies, dead from infectious diseases, results\nin constantly loading the atmosphere, and polluting the waters, with\nnot only the germs that rise from simply putrefaction, but also with the\n_specific_ germs of the diseases from which death resulted.”\n\n'The gases (from buried corpses) will rise to the surface through\neight or ten feet of gravel, just as coal-gas will do, and there is\npractically no limit to their power of escape.\n\n'During the epidemic in New Orleans in 1853, Dr. E. H. Barton reported\nthat in the Fourth District the mortality was four hundred and fifty-two\nper thousand--more than double that of any other. In this district were\nthree large cemeteries, in which during the previous year more than\nthree thousand bodies had been buried. In other districts the proximity\nof cemeteries seemed to aggravate the disease.\n\n'In 1828 Professor Bianchi demonstrated how the fearful reappearance of\nthe plague at Modena was caused by excavations in ground where, _three\nhundred years previously_, the victims of the pestilence had been\nburied. Mr. Cooper, in explaining the causes of some epidemics, remarks\nthat the opening of the plague burial-grounds at Eyam resulted in an\nimmediate outbreak of disease.'--_North American Review, No. 3, Vol.\n135._\n\nIn an address before the Chicago Medical Society, in advocacy of\ncremation, Dr. Charles W. Purdy made some striking comparisons to show\nwhat a burden is laid upon society by the burial of the dead:--\n\n'One and one-fourth times more money is expended annually in funerals\nin the United States than the Government expends for public-school\npurposes. Funerals cost this country in 1880 enough money to pay the\nliabilities of all the commercial failures in the United States during\nthe same year, and give each bankrupt a capital of $8,630 with which to\nresume business. Funerals cost annually more money than the value of the\ncombined gold and silver yield of the United States in the year 1880!\nThese figures do not include the sums invested in burial-grounds and\nexpended in tombs and monuments, nor the loss from depreciation of\nproperty in the vicinity of cemeteries.'\n\nFor the rich, cremation would answer as well as burial; for the\nceremonies connected with it could be made as costly and ostentatious\nas a Hindu suttee; while for the poor, cremation would be better than\nburial, because so cheap {footnote [Four or five dollars is the minimum\ncost.]}--so cheap until the poor got to imitating the rich, which they\nwould do by-and-bye. The adoption of cremation would relieve us of a\nmuck of threadbare burial-witticisms; but, on the other hand, it would\nresurrect a lot of mildewed old cremation-jokes that have had a rest for\ntwo thousand years.\n\nI have a colored acquaintance who earns his living by odd jobs and heavy\nmanual labor. He never earns above four hundred dollars in a year, and\nas he has a wife and several young children, the closest scrimping is\nnecessary to get him through to the end of the twelve months debtless.\nTo such a man a funeral is a colossal financial disaster. While I was\nwriting one of the preceding chapters, this man lost a little child.\nHe walked the town over with a friend, trying to find a coffin that was\nwithin his means. He bought the very cheapest one he could find, plain\nwood, stained. It cost him twenty-six dollars. It would have cost less\nthan four, probably, if it had been built to put something useful into.\nHe and his family will feel that outlay a good many months.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 43\n\nThe Art of Inhumation\n\nABOUT the same time, I encountered a man in the street, whom I had not\nseen for six or seven years; and something like this talk followed. I\nsaid--\n\n'But you used to look sad and oldish; you don't now. Where did you get\nall this youth and bubbling cheerfulness? Give me the address.'\n\nHe chuckled blithely, took off his shining tile, pointed to a notched\npink circlet of paper pasted into its crown, with something lettered on\nit, and went on chuckling while I read, 'J. B----, _Undertaker_.' Then\nhe clapped his hat on, gave it an irreverent tilt to leeward, and cried\nout--\n\n'That's what's the matter! It used to be rough times with me when you\nknew me--insurance-agency business, you know; mighty irregular. Big\nfire, all right--brisk trade for ten days while people scared; after\nthat, dull policy-business till next fire. Town like this don't have\nfires often enough--a fellow strikes so many dull weeks in a row that\nhe gets discouraged. But you bet you, this is the business! People don't\nwait for examples to die. No, sir, they drop off right along--there\nain't any dull spots in the undertaker line. I just started in with\ntwo or three little old coffins and a hired hearse, and now look at the\nthing! I've worked up a business here that would satisfy any man, don't\ncare who he is. Five years ago, lodged in an attic; live in a swell\nhouse now, with a mansard roof, and all the modern inconveniences.'\n\n'Does a coffin pay so well. Is there much profit on a coffin?'\n\n'Go-way! How you talk!' Then, with a confidential wink, a dropping of\nthe voice, and an impressive laying of his hand on my arm; 'Look here;\nthere's one thing in this world which isn't ever cheap. That's a coffin.\nThere's one thing in this world which a person don't ever try to jew you\ndown on. That's a coffin. There's one thing in this world which a person\ndon't say--“I'll look around a little, and if I find I can't do better\nI'll come back and take it.” That's a coffin. There's one thing in this\nworld which a person won't take in pine if he can go walnut; and won't\ntake in walnut if he can go mahogany; and won't take in mahogany if he\ncan go an iron casket with silver door-plate and bronze handles. That's\na coffin. And there's one thing in this world which you don't have to\nworry around after a person to get him to pay for. And that's a coffin.\nUndertaking?--why it's the dead-surest business in Christendom, and the\nnobbiest.\n\n'Why, just look at it. A rich man won't have anything but your very\nbest; and you can just pile it on, too--pile it on and sock it to\nhim--he won't ever holler. And you take in a poor man, and if you work\nhim right he'll bust himself on a single lay-out. Or especially a woman.\nF'r instance: Mrs. O'Flaherty comes in--widow--wiping her eyes and kind\nof moaning. Unhandkerchiefs one eye, bats it around tearfully over the\nstock; says--\n\n'“And fhat might ye ask for that wan?”\n\n'“Thirty-nine dollars, madam,” says I.\n\n'“It 's a foine big price, sure, but Pat shall be buried like a\ngintleman, as he was, if I have to work me fingers off for it. I'll have\nthat wan, sor.”\n\n'“Yes, madam,” says I, “and it is a very good one, too; not costly, to\nbe sure, but in this life we must cut our garment to our clothes, as the\nsaying is.” And as she starts out, I heave in, kind of casually, “This\none with the white satin lining is a beauty, but I am afraid--well,\nsixty-five dollars is a rather--rather--but no matter, I felt obliged to\nsay to Mrs. O'Shaughnessy--”\n\n'“D'ye mane to soy that Bridget O'Shaughnessy bought the mate to that\njoo-ul box to ship that dhrunken divil to Purgatory in?”\n\n'“Yes, madam.”\n\n'“Then Pat shall go to heaven in the twin to it, if it takes the last\nrap the O'Flaherties can raise; and moind you, stick on some extras,\ntoo, and I'll give ye another dollar.”\n\n'And as I lay-in with the livery stables, of course I don't forget to\nmention that Mrs. O'Shaughnessy hired fifty-four dollars' worth of hacks\nand flung as much style into Dennis's funeral as if he had been a duke\nor an assassin. And of course she sails in and goes the O'Shaughnessy\nabout four hacks and an omnibus better. That used to be, but that's all\nplayed now; that is, in this particular town. The Irish got to piling up\nhacks so, on their funerals, that a funeral left them ragged and hungry\nfor two years afterward; so the priest pitched in and broke it all up.\nHe don't allow them to have but two hacks now, and sometimes only one.'\n\n'Well,' said I, 'if you are so light-hearted and jolly in ordinary\ntimes, what must you be in an epidemic?'\n\nHe shook his head.\n\n'No, you're off, there. We don't like to see an epidemic. An epidemic\ndon't pay. Well, of course I don't mean that, exactly; but it don't pay\nin proportion to the regular thing. Don't it occur to you, why?'\n\nNo.\n\n'Think.'\n\n'I can't imagine. What is it?'\n\n'It's just two things.'\n\n'Well, what are they?'\n\n'One's Embamming.'\n\n'And what's the other?'\n\n'Ice.'\n\n'How is that?'\n\n'Well, in ordinary times, a person dies, and we lay him up in ice; one\nday two days, maybe three, to wait for friends to come. Takes a lot of\nit--melts fast. We charge jewelry rates for that ice, and war-prices for\nattendance. Well, don't you know, when there's an epidemic, they rush\n'em to the cemetery the minute the breath's out. No market for ice in an\nepidemic. Same with Embamming. You take a family that's able to embam,\nand you've got a soft thing. You can mention sixteen different ways to\ndo it--though there _ain't_ only one or two ways, when you come down to\nthe bottom facts of it--and they'll take the highest-priced way, every\ntime. It's human nature--human nature in grief. It don't reason,\nyou see. Time being, it don't care a dam. All it wants is physical\nimmortality for deceased, and they're willing to pay for it. All you've\ngot to do is to just be ca'm and stack it up--they'll stand the racket.\nWhy, man, you can take a defunct that you couldn't _give _away; and get\nyour embamming traps around you and go to work; and in a couple of hours\nhe is worth a cool six hundred--that's what _he's_ worth. There ain't\nanything equal to it but trading rats for di'monds in time of famine.\nWell, don't you see, when there's an epidemic, people don't wait to\nembam. No, indeed they don't; and it hurts the business like hell-th,\nas we say--hurts it like hell-th, _health_, see?--Our little joke in the\ntrade. Well, I must be going. Give me a call whenever you need any--I\nmean, when you're going by, sometime.'\n\nIn his joyful high spirits, he did the exaggerating himself, if any has\nbeen done. I have not enlarged on him.\n\nWith the above brief references to inhumation, let us leave the subject.\nAs for me, I hope to be cremated. I made that remark to my pastor once,\nwho said, with what he seemed to think was an impressive manner--\n\n'I wouldn't worry about that, if I had your chances.' Much he knew about\nit--the family all so opposed to it.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 44\n\nCity Sights\n\nTHE old French part of New Orleans--anciently the Spanish part--bears no\nresemblance to the American end of the city: the American end which lies\nbeyond the intervening brick business-center. The houses are massed in\nblocks; are austerely plain and dignified; uniform of pattern, with here\nand there a departure from it with pleasant effect; all are plastered\non the outside, and nearly all have long, iron-railed verandas running\nalong the several stories. Their chief beauty is the deep, warm,\nvaricolored stain with which time and the weather have enriched the\nplaster. It harmonizes with all the surroundings, and has as natural\na look of belonging there as has the flush upon sunset clouds. This\ncharming decoration cannot be successfully imitated; neither is it to be\nfound elsewhere in America.\n\nThe iron railings are a specialty, also. The pattern is often\nexceedingly light and dainty, and airy and graceful--with a large cipher\nor monogram in the center, a delicate cobweb of baffling, intricate\nforms, wrought in steel. The ancient railings are hand-made, and are\nnow comparatively rare and proportionately valuable. They are become\n_bric-a-brac_.\n\nThe party had the privilege of idling through this ancient quarter of\nNew Orleans with the South's finest literary genius, the author of 'the\nGrandissimes.' In him the South has found a masterly delineator of its\ninterior life and its history. In truth, I find by experience, that the\nuntrained eye and vacant mind can inspect it, and learn of it, and judge\nof it, more clearly and profitably in his books than by personal contact\nwith it.\n\nWith Mr. Cable along to see for you, and describe and explain and\nilluminate, a jog through that old quarter is a vivid pleasure. And you\nhave a vivid sense as of unseen or dimly seen things--vivid, and yet\nfitful and darkling; you glimpse salient features, but lose the fine\nshades or catch them imperfectly through the vision of the imagination:\na case, as it were, of ignorant near-sighted stranger traversing the\nrim of wide vague horizons of Alps with an inspired and enlightened\nlong-sighted native.\n\nWe visited the old St. Louis Hotel, now occupied by municipal offices.\nThere is nothing strikingly remarkable about it; but one can say of it\nas of the Academy of Music in New York, that if a broom or a shovel has\never been used in it there is no circumstantial evidence to back up the\nfact. It is curious that cabbages and hay and things do not grow in the\nAcademy of Music; but no doubt it is on account of the interruption\nof the light by the benches, and the impossibility of hoeing the\ncrop except in the aisles. The fact that the ushers grow their\nbuttonhole-bouquets on the premises shows what might be done if they had\nthe right kind of an agricultural head to the establishment.\n\nWe visited also the venerable Cathedral, and the pretty square in front\nof it; the one dim with religious light, the other brilliant with the\nworldly sort, and lovely with orange-trees and blossomy shrubs; then we\ndrove in the hot sun through the wilderness of houses and out on to the\nwide dead level beyond, where the villas are, and the water wheels to\ndrain the town, and the commons populous with cows and children; passing\nby an old cemetery where we were told lie the ashes of an early pirate;\nbut we took him on trust, and did not visit him. He was a pirate with\na tremendous and sanguinary history; and as long as he preserved\nunspotted, in retirement, the dignity of his name and the grandeur of\nhis ancient calling, homage and reverence were his from high and\nlow; but when at last he descended into politics and became a paltry\nalderman, the public 'shook' him, and turned aside and wept. When he\ndied, they set up a monument over him; and little by little he has come\ninto respect again; but it is respect for the pirate, not the alderman.\nTo-day the loyal and generous remember only what he was, and charitably\nforget what he became.\n\nThence, we drove a few miles across a swamp, along a raised shell road,\nwith a canal on one hand and a dense wood on the other; and here and\nthere, in the distance, a ragged and angular-limbed and moss-bearded\ncypress, top standing out, clear cut against the sky, and as quaint of\nform as the apple-trees in Japanese pictures--such was our course and\nthe surroundings of it. There was an occasional alligator swimming\ncomfortably along in the canal, and an occasional picturesque colored\nperson on the bank, flinging his statue-rigid reflection upon the still\nwater and watching for a bite.\n\nAnd by-and-bye we reached the West End, a collection of hotels of the\nusual light summer-resort pattern, with broad verandas all around,\nand the waves of the wide and blue Lake Pontchartrain lapping the\nthresholds. We had dinner on a ground-veranda over the water--the\nchief dish the renowned fish called the pompano, delicious as the less\ncriminal forms of sin.\n\nThousands of people come by rail and carriage to West End and to Spanish\nFort every evening, and dine, listen to the bands, take strolls in\nthe open air under the electric lights, go sailing on the lake, and\nentertain themselves in various and sundry other ways.\n\nWe had opportunities on other days and in other places to test the\npompano. Notably, at an editorial dinner at one of the clubs in the\ncity. He was in his last possible perfection there, and justified his\nfame. In his suite was a tall pyramid of scarlet cray-fish--large ones;\nas large as one's thumb--delicate, palatable, appetizing. Also deviled\nwhitebait; also shrimps of choice quality; and a platter of small\nsoft-shell crabs of a most superior breed. The other dishes were what\none might get at Delmonico's, or Buckingham Palace; those I have spoken\nof can be had in similar perfection in New Orleans only, I suppose.\n\nIn the West and South they have a new institution--the Broom Brigade.\nIt is composed of young ladies who dress in a uniform costume, and go\nthrough the infantry drill, with broom in place of musket. It is a\nvery pretty sight, on private view. When they perform on the stage of\na theater, in the blaze of colored fires, it must be a fine and\nfascinating spectacle. I saw them go through their complex manual with\ngrace, spirit, and admirable precision. I saw them do everything which\na human being can possibly do with a broom, except sweep. I did not see\nthem sweep. But I know they could learn. What they have already learned\nproves that. And if they ever should learn, and should go on the\nwar-path down Tchoupitoulas or some of those other streets around there,\nthose thoroughfares would bear a greatly improved aspect in a very few\nminutes. But the girls themselves wouldn't; so nothing would be really\ngained, after all.\n\nThe drill was in the Washington Artillery building. In this building\nwe saw many interesting relics of the war. Also a fine oil-painting\nrepresenting Stonewall Jackson's last interview with General Lee. Both\nmen are on horseback. Jackson has just ridden up, and is accosting Lee.\nThe picture is very valuable, on account of the portraits, which are\nauthentic. But, like many another historical picture, it means nothing\nwithout its label. And one label will fit it as well as another--\n\nFirst Interview between Lee and Jackson.\n\nLast Interview between Lee and Jackson.\n\nJackson Introducing Himself to Lee.\n\nJackson Accepting Lee's Invitation to Dinner.\n\nJackson Declining Lee's Invitation to Dinner--with Thanks.\n\nJackson Apologizing for a Heavy Defeat.\n\nJackson Reporting a Great Victory.\n\nJackson Asking Lee for a Match.\n\nIt tells _one _story, and a sufficient one; for it says quite plainly\nand satisfactorily, 'Here are Lee and Jackson together.' The artist\nwould have made it tell that this is Lee and Jackson's last interview if\nhe could have done it. But he couldn't, for there wasn't any way to do\nit. A good legible label is usually worth, for information, a ton of\nsignificant attitude and expression in a historical picture. In Rome,\npeople with fine sympathetic natures stand up and weep in front of the\ncelebrated 'Beatrice Cenci the Day before her Execution.' It shows what\na label can do. If they did not know the picture, they would inspect it\nunmoved, and say, 'Young girl with hay fever; young girl with her head\nin a bag.'\n\nI found the half-forgotten Southern intonations and elisions as pleasing\nto my ear as they had formerly been. A Southerner talks music. At\nleast it is music to me, but then I was born in the South. The educated\nSoutherner has no use for an r, except at the beginning of a word. He\nsays 'honah,' and 'dinnah,' and 'Gove'nuh,' and 'befo' the waw,' and so\non. The words may lack charm to the eye, in print, but they have it to\nthe ear. When did the r disappear from Southern speech, and how did it\ncome to disappear? The custom of dropping it was not borrowed from\nthe North, nor inherited from England. Many Southerners--most\nSoutherners--put a y into occasional words that begin with the k sound.\nFor instance, they say Mr. K'yahtah (Carter) and speak of playing\nk'yahds or of riding in the k'yahs. And they have the pleasant\ncustom--long ago fallen into decay in the North--of frequently employing\nthe respectful 'Sir.' Instead of the curt Yes, and the abrupt No, they\nsay 'Yes, Suh', 'No, Suh.'\n\nBut there are some infelicities. Such as 'like' for 'as,' and the\naddition of an 'at' where it isn't needed. I heard an educated gentleman\nsay, 'Like the flag-officer did.' His cook or his butler would have\nsaid, 'Like the flag-officer done.' You hear gentlemen say, 'Where have\nyou been at?' And here is the aggravated form--heard a ragged street\nArab say it to a comrade: 'I was a-ask'n' Tom whah you was a-sett'n'\nat.' The very elect carelessly say 'will' when they mean 'shall'; and\nmany of them say, 'I didn't go to do it,' meaning 'I didn't mean to do\nit.' The Northern word 'guess'--imported from England, where it used\nto be common, and now regarded by satirical Englishmen as a Yankee\noriginal--is but little used among Southerners. They say 'reckon.' They\nhaven't any 'doesn't' in their language; they say 'don't' instead.\nThe unpolished often use 'went' for 'gone.' It is nearly as bad as\nthe Northern 'hadn't ought.' This reminds me that a remark of a very\npeculiar nature was made here in my neighborhood (in the North) a few\ndays ago: 'He hadn't ought to have went.' How is that? Isn't that a good\ndeal of a triumph? One knows the orders combined in this half-breed's\narchitecture without inquiring: one parent Northern, the other Southern.\nTo-day I heard a schoolmistress ask, 'Where is John gone?' This form is\nso common--so nearly universal, in fact--that if she had used 'whither'\ninstead of 'where,' I think it would have sounded like an affectation.\n\nWe picked up one excellent word--a word worth traveling to New Orleans\nto get; a nice limber, expressive, handy word--'lagniappe.' They\npronounce it lanny-yap. It is Spanish--so they said. We discovered it\nat the head of a column of odds and ends in the Picayune, the first day;\nheard twenty people use it the second; inquired what it meant the\nthird; adopted it and got facility in swinging it the fourth. It has a\nrestricted meaning, but I think the people spread it out a little when\nthey choose. It is the equivalent of the thirteenth roll in a 'baker's\ndozen.' It is something thrown in, gratis, for good measure. The custom\noriginated in the Spanish quarter of the city. When a child or a servant\nbuys something in a shop--or even the mayor or the governor, for aught I\nknow--he finishes the operation by saying--\n\n'Give me something for lagniappe.'\n\nThe shopman always responds; gives the child a bit of licorice-root,\ngives the servant a cheap cigar or a spool of thread, gives the\ngovernor--I don't know what he gives the governor; support, likely.\n\nWhen you are invited to drink, and this does occur now and then in New\nOrleans--and you say, 'What, again?--no, I've had enough;' the other\nparty says, 'But just this one time more--this is for lagniappe.' When\nthe beau perceives that he is stacking his compliments a trifle too\nhigh, and sees by the young lady's countenance that the edifice would\nhave been better with the top compliment left off, he puts his 'I beg\npardon--no harm intended,' into the briefer form of 'Oh, that's for\nlagniappe.' If the waiter in the restaurant stumbles and spills a gill\nof coffee down the back of your neck, he says 'For lagniappe, sah,' and\ngets you another cup without extra charge.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 45\n\nSouthern Sports\n\nIN the North one hears the war mentioned, in social conversation, once a\nmonth; sometimes as often as once a week; but as a distinct subject\nfor talk, it has long ago been relieved of duty. There are sufficient\nreasons for this. Given a dinner company of six gentlemen to-day, it\ncan easily happen that four of them--and possibly five--were not in the\nfield at all. So the chances are four to two, or five to one, that the\nwar will at no time during the evening become the topic of conversation;\nand the chances are still greater that if it become the topic it will\nremain so but a little while. If you add six ladies to the company, you\nhave added six people who saw so little of the dread realities of the\nwar that they ran out of talk concerning them years ago, and now would\nsoon weary of the war topic if you brought it up.\n\nThe case is very different in the South. There, every man you meet was\nin the war; and every lady you meet saw the war. The war is the great\nchief topic of conversation. The interest in it is vivid and constant;\nthe interest in other topics is fleeting. Mention of the war will wake\nup a dull company and set their tongues going, when nearly any other\ntopic would fail. In the South, the war is what A.D. is elsewhere: they\ndate from it. All day long you hear things 'placed' as having happened\nsince the waw; or du'in' the waw; or befo' the waw; or right aftah the\nwaw; or 'bout two yeahs or five yeahs or ten yeahs befo' the waw or\naftah the waw. It shows how intimately every individual was visited, in\nhis own person, by that tremendous episode. It gives the inexperienced\nstranger a better idea of what a vast and comprehensive calamity\ninvasion is than he can ever get by reading books at the fireside.\n\nAt a club one evening, a gentleman turned to me and said, in an aside--\n\n'You notice, of course, that we are nearly always talking about the war.\nIt isn't because we haven't anything else to talk about, but because\nnothing else has so strong an interest for us. And there is another\nreason: In the war, each of us, in his own person, seems to have sampled\nall the different varieties of human experience; as a consequence, you\ncan't mention an outside matter of any sort but it will certainly remind\nsome listener of something that happened during the war--and out he\ncomes with it. Of course that brings the talk back to the war. You may\ntry all you want to, to keep other subjects before the house, and we may\nall join in and help, but there can be but one result: the most random\ntopic would load every man up with war reminiscences, and shut him up,\ntoo; and talk would be likely to stop presently, because you can't talk\npale inconsequentialities when you've got a crimson fact or fancy in\nyour head that you are burning to fetch out.'\n\nThe poet was sitting some little distance away; and presently he began\nto speak--about the moon.\n\nThe gentleman who had been talking to me remarked in an 'aside:' 'There,\nthe moon is far enough from the seat of war, but you will see that it\nwill suggest something to somebody about the war; in ten minutes from\nnow the moon, as a topic, will be shelved.'\n\nThe poet was saying he had noticed something which was a surprise to\nhim; had had the impression that down here, toward the equator, the\nmoonlight was much stronger and brighter than up North; had had the\nimpression that when he visited New Orleans, many years ago, the moon--\n\nInterruption from the other end of the room--\n\n'Let me explain that. Reminds me of an anecdote. Everything is changed\nsince the war, for better or for worse; but you'll find people down here\nborn grumblers, who see no change except the change for the worse. There\nwas an old negro woman of this sort. A young New-Yorker said in her\npresence, “What a wonderful moon you have down here!” She sighed and\nsaid, “Ah, bless yo' heart, honey, you ought to seen dat moon befo' de\nwaw!”'\n\nThe new topic was dead already. But the poet resurrected it, and gave it\na new start.\n\nA brief dispute followed, as to whether the difference between Northern\nand Southern moonlight really existed or was only imagined. Moonlight\ntalk drifted easily into talk about artificial methods of dispelling\ndarkness. Then somebody remembered that when Farragut advanced upon\nPort Hudson on a dark night--and did not wish to assist the aim of the\nConfederate gunners--he carried no battle-lanterns, but painted the\ndecks of his ships white, and thus created a dim but valuable light,\nwhich enabled his own men to grope their way around with considerable\nfacility. At this point the war got the floor again--the ten minutes not\nquite up yet.\n\nI was not sorry, for war talk by men who have been in a war is always\ninteresting; whereas moon talk by a poet who has not been in the moon is\nlikely to be dull.\n\nWe went to a cockpit in New Orleans on a Saturday afternoon. I had never\nseen a cock-fight before. There were men and boys there of all ages and\nall colors, and of many languages and nationalities. But I noticed one\nquite conspicuous and surprising absence: the traditional brutal faces.\nThere were no brutal faces. With no cock-fighting going on, you could\nhave played the gathering on a stranger for a prayer-meeting; and after\nit began, for a revival--provided you blindfolded your stranger--for the\nshouting was something prodigious.\n\nA negro and a white man were in the ring; everybody else outside. The\ncocks were brought in in sacks; and when time was called, they were\ntaken out by the two bottle-holders, stroked, caressed, poked toward\neach other, and finally liberated. The big black cock plunged instantly\nat the little gray one and struck him on the head with his spur. The\ngray responded with spirit. Then the Babel of many-tongued shoutings\nbroke out, and ceased not thenceforth. When the cocks had been fighting\nsome little time, I was expecting them momently to drop dead, for both\nwere blind, red with blood, and so exhausted that they frequently fell\ndown. Yet they would not give up, neither would they die. The negro and\nthe white man would pick them up every few seconds, wipe them off, blow\ncold water on them in a fine spray, and take their heads in their mouths\nand hold them there a moment--to warm back the perishing life perhaps;\nI do not know. Then, being set down again, the dying creatures would\ntotter gropingly about, with dragging wings, find each other, strike a\nguesswork blow or two, and fall exhausted once more.\n\nI did not see the end of the battle. I forced myself to endure it\nas long as I could, but it was too pitiful a sight; so I made frank\nconfession to that effect, and we retired. We heard afterward that the\nblack cock died in the ring, and fighting to the last.\n\nEvidently there is abundant fascination about this 'sport' for such\nas have had a degree of familiarity with it. I never saw people enjoy\nanything more than this gathering enjoyed this fight. The case was the\nsame with old gray-heads and with boys of ten. They lost themselves\nin frenzies of delight. The 'cocking-main' is an inhuman sort of\nentertainment, there is no question about that; still, it seems a much\nmore respectable and far less cruel sport than fox-hunting--for the\ncocks like it; they experience, as well as confer enjoyment; which is\nnot the fox's case.\n\nWe assisted--in the French sense--at a mule race, one day. I believe I\nenjoyed this contest more than any other mule there. I enjoyed it more\nthan I remember having enjoyed any other animal race I ever saw. The\ngrand-stand was well filled with the beauty and the chivalry of New\nOrleans. That phrase is not original with me. It is the Southern\nreporter's. He has used it for two generations. He uses it twenty\ntimes a day, or twenty thousand times a day; or a million times a\nday--according to the exigencies. He is obliged to use it a million\ntimes a day, if he have occasion to speak of respectable men and women\nthat often; for he has no other phrase for such service except that\nsingle one. He never tires of it; it always has a fine sound to him.\nThere is a kind of swell medieval bulliness and tinsel about it that\npleases his gaudy barbaric soul. If he had been in Palestine in the\nearly times, we should have had no references to 'much people' out of\nhim. No, he would have said 'the beauty and the chivalry of Galilee'\nassembled to hear the Sermon on the Mount. It is likely that the men\nand women of the South are sick enough of that phrase by this time, and\nwould like a change, but there is no immediate prospect of their getting\nit.\n\nThe New Orleans editor has a strong, compact, direct, unflowery\nstyle; wastes no words, and does not gush. Not so with his average\ncorrespondent. In the Appendix I have quoted a good letter, penned by a\ntrained hand; but the average correspondent hurls a style which differs\nfrom that. For instance--\n\nThe 'Times-Democrat' sent a relief-steamer up one of the bayous, last\nApril. This steamer landed at a village, up there somewhere, and the\nCaptain invited some of the ladies of the village to make a short trip\nwith him. They accepted and came aboard, and the steamboat shoved out\nup the creek. That was all there was 'to it.' And that is all that\nthe editor of the 'Times-Democrat' would have got out of it. There was\nnothing in the thing but statistics, and he would have got nothing else\nout of it. He would probably have even tabulated them, partly to secure\nperfect clearness of statement, and partly to save space. But his\nspecial correspondent knows other methods of handling statistics. He\njust throws off all restraint and wallows in them--\n\n'On Saturday, early in the morning, the beauty of the place graced our\ncabin, and proud of her fair freight the gallant little boat glided up\nthe bayou.'\n\nTwenty-two words to say the ladies came aboard and the boat shoved\nout up the creek, is a clean waste of ten good words, and is also\ndestructive of compactness of statement.\n\nThe trouble with the Southern reporter is--Women. They unsettle\nhim; they throw him off his balance. He is plain, and sensible, and\nsatisfactory, until a woman heaves in sight. Then he goes all to pieces;\nhis mind totters, he becomes flowery and idiotic. From reading the above\nextract, you would imagine that this student of Sir Walter Scott is\nan apprentice, and knows next to nothing about handling a pen. On the\ncontrary, he furnishes plenty of proofs, in his long letter, that he\nknows well enough how to handle it when the women are not around to give\nhim the artificial-flower complaint. For instance--\n\n'At 4 o'clock ominous clouds began to gather in the south-east, and\npresently from the Gulf there came a blow which increased in severity\nevery moment. It was not safe to leave the landing then, and there was\na delay. The oaks shook off long tresses of their mossy beards to the\ntugging of the wind, and the bayou in its ambition put on miniature\nwaves in mocking of much larger bodies of water. A lull permitted a\nstart, and homewards we steamed, an inky sky overhead and a heavy wind\nblowing. As darkness crept on, there were few on board who did not wish\nthemselves nearer home.'\n\nThere is nothing the matter with that. It is good description, compactly\nput. Yet there was great temptation, there, to drop into lurid writing.\n\nBut let us return to the mule. Since I left him, I have rummaged around\nand found a full report of the race. In it I find confirmation of the\ntheory which I broached just now--namely, that the trouble with the\nSouthern reporter is Women: Women, supplemented by Walter Scott and his\nknights and beauty and chivalry, and so on. This is an excellent report,\nas long as the women stay out of it. But when they intrude, we have this\nfrantic result--\n\n'It will be probably a long time before the ladies' stand presents such\na sea of foam-like loveliness as it did yesterday. The New Orleans women\nare always charming, but never so much so as at this time of the year,\nwhen in their dainty spring costumes they bring with them a breath of\nbalmy freshness and an odor of sanctity unspeakable. The stand was so\ncrowded with them that, walking at their feet and seeing no possibility\nof approach, many a man appreciated as he never did before the Peri's\nfeeling at the Gates of Paradise, and wondered what was the priceless\nboon that would admit him to their sacred presence. Sparkling on their\nwhite-robed breasts or shoulders were the colors of their favorite\nknights, and were it not for the fact that the doughty heroes appeared\non unromantic mules, it would have been easy to imagine one of King\nArthur's gala-days.'\n\nThere were thirteen mules in the first heat; all sorts of mules, they\nwere; all sorts of complexions, gaits, dispositions, aspects. Some were\nhandsome creatures, some were not; some were sleek, some hadn't had\ntheir fur brushed lately; some were innocently gay and frisky; some were\nfull of malice and all unrighteousness; guessing from looks, some of\nthem thought the matter on hand was war, some thought it was a lark, the\nrest took it for a religious occasion. And each mule acted according to\nhis convictions. The result was an absence of harmony well compensated\nby a conspicuous presence of variety--variety of a picturesque and\nentertaining sort.\n\nAll the riders were young gentlemen in fashionable society. If the\nreader has been wondering why it is that the ladies of New Orleans\nattend so humble an orgy as a mule-race, the thing is explained now. It\nis a fashion-freak; all connected with it are people of fashion.\n\nIt is great fun, and cordially liked. The mule-race is one of the marked\noccasions of the year. It has brought some pretty fast mules to the\nfront. One of these had to be ruled out, because he was so fast that he\nturned the thing into a one-mule contest, and robbed it of one of its\nbest features--variety. But every now and then somebody disguises him\nwith a new name and a new complexion, and rings him in again.\n\nThe riders dress in full jockey costumes of bright-colored silks,\nsatins, and velvets.\n\nThe thirteen mules got away in a body, after a couple of false starts,\nand scampered off with prodigious spirit. As each mule and each rider\nhad a distinct opinion of his own as to how the race ought to be run,\nand which side of the track was best in certain circumstances, and how\noften the track ought to be crossed, and when a collision ought to\nbe accomplished, and when it ought to be avoided, these twenty-six\nconflicting opinions created a most fantastic and picturesque confusion,\nand the resulting spectacle was killingly comical.\n\nMile heat; time 2:22. Eight of the thirteen mules distanced. I had a bet\non a mule which would have won if the procession had been reversed. The\nsecond heat was good fun; and so was the 'consolation race for beaten\nmules,' which followed later; but the first heat was the best in that\nrespect.\n\nI think that much the most enjoyable of all races is a steamboat race;\nbut, next to that, I prefer the gay and joyous mule-rush. Two red-hot\nsteamboats raging along, neck-and-neck, straining every nerve--that is\nto say, every rivet in the boilers--quaking and shaking and groaning\nfrom stem to stern, spouting white steam from the pipes, pouring black\nsmoke from the chimneys, raining down sparks, parting the river into\nlong breaks of hissing foam--this is sport that makes a body's very\nliver curl with enjoyment. A horse-race is pretty tame and colorless\nin comparison. Still, a horse-race might be well enough, in its way,\nperhaps, if it were not for the tiresome false starts. But then,\nnobody is ever killed. At least, nobody was ever killed when I was at a\nhorse-race. They have been crippled, it is true; but this is little to\nthe purpose.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 46\n\nEnchantments and Enchanters\n\nTHE largest annual event in New Orleans is a something which we arrived\ntoo late to sample--the Mardi-Gras festivities. I saw the procession of\nthe Mystic Crew of Comus there, twenty-four years ago--with knights\nand nobles and so on, clothed in silken and golden Paris-made\ngorgeousnesses, planned and bought for that single night's use; and\nin their train all manner of giants, dwarfs, monstrosities, and other\ndiverting grotesquerie--a startling and wonderful sort of show, as it\nfiled solemnly and silently down the street in the light of its smoking\nand flickering torches; but it is said that in these latter days the\nspectacle is mightily augmented, as to cost, splendor, and variety.\nThere is a chief personage--'Rex;' and if I remember rightly, neither\nthis king nor any of his great following of subordinates is known to any\noutsider. All these people are gentlemen of position and consequence;\nand it is a proud thing to belong to the organization; so the mystery in\nwhich they hide their personality is merely for romance's sake, and not\non account of the police.\n\nMardi-Gras is of course a relic of the French and Spanish occupation;\nbut I judge that the religious feature has been pretty well knocked out\nof it now. Sir Walter has got the advantage of the gentlemen of the cowl\nand rosary, and he will stay. His medieval business, supplemented by the\nmonsters and the oddities, and the pleasant creatures from fairy-land,\nis finer to look at than the poor fantastic inventions and performances\nof the reveling rabble of the priest's day, and serves quite as well,\nperhaps, to emphasize the day and admonish men that the grace-line\nbetween the worldly season and the holy one is reached.\n\nThis Mardi-Gras pageant was the exclusive possession of New Orleans\nuntil recently. But now it has spread to Memphis and St. Louis and\nBaltimore. It has probably reached its limit. It is a thing which could\nhardly exist in the practical North; would certainly last but a very\nbrief time; as brief a time as it would last in London. For the soul\nof it is the romantic, not the funny and the grotesque. Take away the\nromantic mysteries, the kings and knights and big-sounding titles, and\nMardi-Gras would die, down there in the South. The very feature that\nkeeps it alive in the South--girly-girly romance--would kill it in the\nNorth or in London. Puck and Punch, and the press universal, would fall\nupon it and make merciless fun of it, and its first exhibition would be\nalso its last.\n\nAgainst the crimes of the French Revolution and of Bonaparte may be set\ntwo compensating benefactions: the Revolution broke the chains of the\n_ancien regime_ and of the Church, and made of a nation of abject slaves\na nation of freemen; and Bonaparte instituted the setting of merit above\nbirth, and also so completely stripped the divinity from royalty, that\nwhereas crowned heads in Europe were gods before, they are only men,\nsince, and can never be gods again, but only figureheads, and answerable\nfor their acts like common clay. Such benefactions as these compensate\nthe temporary harm which Bonaparte and the Revolution did, and leave the\nworld in debt to them for these great and permanent services to liberty,\nhumanity, and progress.\n\nThen comes Sir Walter Scott with his enchantments, and by his single\nmight checks this wave of progress, and even turns it back; sets the\nworld in love with dreams and phantoms; with decayed and swinish forms\nof religion; with decayed and degraded systems of government; with\nthe sillinesses and emptinesses, sham grandeurs, sham gauds, and sham\nchivalries of a brainless and worthless long-vanished society. He did\nmeasureless harm; more real and lasting harm, perhaps, than any other\nindividual that ever wrote. Most of the world has now outlived good part\nof these harms, though by no means all of them; but in our South they\nflourish pretty forcefully still. Not so forcefully as half a generation\nago, perhaps, but still forcefully. There, the genuine and wholesome\ncivilization of the nineteenth century is curiously confused and\ncommingled with the Walter Scott Middle-Age sham civilization; and so\nyou have practical, common-sense, progressive ideas, and progressive\nworks; mixed up with the duel, the inflated speech, and the jejune\nromanticism of an absurd past that is dead, and out of charity ought\nto be buried. But for the Sir Walter disease, the character of the\nSoutherner--or Southron, according to Sir Walter's starchier way of\nphrasing it--would be wholly modern, in place of modern and medieval\nmixed, and the South would be fully a generation further advanced than\nit is. It was Sir Walter that made every gentleman in the South a Major\nor a Colonel, or a General or a Judge, before the war; and it was he,\nalso, that made these gentlemen value these bogus decorations. For it\nwas he that created rank and caste down there, and also reverence\nfor rank and caste, and pride and pleasure in them. Enough is laid on\nslavery, without fathering upon it these creations and contributions of\nSir Walter.\n\nSir Walter had so large a hand in making Southern character, as it\nexisted before the war, that he is in great measure responsible for\nthe war. It seems a little harsh toward a dead man to say that we never\nshould have had any war but for Sir Walter; and yet something of a\nplausible argument might, perhaps, be made in support of that wild\nproposition. The Southerner of the American Revolution owned slaves; so\ndid the Southerner of the Civil War: but the former resembles the latter\nas an Englishman resembles a Frenchman. The change of character can be\ntraced rather more easily to Sir Walter's influence than to that of any\nother thing or person.\n\nOne may observe, by one or two signs, how deeply that influence\npenetrated, and how strongly it holds. If one take up a Northern or\nSouthern literary periodical of forty or fifty years ago, he will\nfind it filled with wordy, windy, flowery 'eloquence,' romanticism,\nsentimentality--all imitated from Sir Walter, and sufficiently badly\ndone, too--innocent travesties of his style and methods, in fact. This\nsort of literature being the fashion in both sections of the country,\nthere was opportunity for the fairest competition; and as a consequence,\nthe South was able to show as many well-known literary names,\nproportioned to population, as the North could.\n\nBut a change has come, and there is no opportunity now for a fair\ncompetition between North and South. For the North has thrown out\nthat old inflated style, whereas the Southern writer still clings\nto it--clings to it and has a restricted market for his wares, as a\nconsequence. There is as much literary talent in the South, now, as ever\nthere was, of course; but its work can gain but slight currency under\npresent conditions; the authors write for the past, not the present;\nthey use obsolete forms, and a dead language. But when a Southerner of\ngenius writes modern English, his book goes upon crutches no longer, but\nupon wings; and they carry it swiftly all about America and England,\nand through the great English reprint publishing houses of Germany--as\nwitness the experience of Mr. Cable and Uncle Remus, two of the very\nfew Southern authors who do not write in the Southern style. Instead\nof three or four widely-known literary names, the South ought to have a\ndozen or two--and will have them when Sir Walter's time is out.\n\nA curious exemplification of the power of a single book for good or harm\nis shown in the effects wrought by 'Don Quixote' and those wrought\nby 'Ivanhoe.' The first swept the world's admiration for the medieval\nchivalry-silliness out of existence; and the other restored it. As far\nas our South is concerned, the good work done by Cervantes is pretty\nnearly a dead letter, so effectually has Scott's pernicious work\nundermined it.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 47\n\nUncle Remus and Mr. Cable\n\nMR. JOEL CHANDLER HARRIS ['Uncle Remus') was to arrive from Atlanta at\nseven o'clock Sunday morning; so we got up and received him. We were\nable to detect him among the crowd of arrivals at the hotel-counter by\nhis correspondence with a description of him which had been furnished us\nfrom a trustworthy source. He was said to be undersized, red-haired,\nand somewhat freckled. He was the only man in the party whose outside\ntallied with this bill of particulars. He was said to be very shy. He\nis a shy man. Of this there is no doubt. It may not show on the surface,\nbut the shyness is there. After days of intimacy one wonders to see\nthat it is still in about as strong force as ever. There is a fine and\nbeautiful nature hidden behind it, as all know who have read the Uncle\nRemus book; and a fine genius, too, as all know by the same sign. I seem\nto be talking quite freely about this neighbor; but in talking to the\npublic I am but talking to his personal friends, and these things are\npermissible among friends.\n\nHe deeply disappointed a number of children who had flocked eagerly to\nMr. Cable's house to get a glimpse of the illustrious sage and oracle of\nthe nation's nurseries. They said--\n\n'Why, he 's white!'\n\nThey were grieved about it. So, to console them, the book was brought,\nthat they might hear Uncle Remus's Tar-Baby story from the lips of Uncle\nRemus himself--or what, in their outraged eyes, was left of him. But it\nturned out that he had never read aloud to people, and was too shy to\nventure the attempt now. Mr. Cable and I read from books of ours, to\nshow him what an easy trick it was; but his immortal shyness was proof\nagainst even this sagacious strategy, so we had to read about Brer\nRabbit ourselves.\n\nMr. Harris ought to be able to read the negro dialect better than\nanybody else, for in the matter of writing it he is the only master the\ncountry has produced. Mr. Cable is the only master in the writing of\nFrench dialects that the country has produced; and he reads them\nin perfection. It was a great treat to hear him read about Jean-ah\nPoquelin, and about Innerarity and his famous 'pigshoo' representing\n'Louisihanna _rif_-fusing to Hanter the Union,' along with passages of\nnicely-shaded German dialect from a novel which was still in manuscript.\n\nIt came out in conversation, that in two different instances Mr. Cable\ngot into grotesque trouble by using, in his books, next-to-impossible\nFrench names which nevertheless happened to be borne by living and\nsensitive citizens of New Orleans. His names were either inventions or\nwere borrowed from the ancient and obsolete past, I do not now remember\nwhich; but at any rate living bearers of them turned up, and were a good\ndeal hurt at having attention directed to themselves and their affairs\nin so excessively public a manner.\n\nMr. Warner and I had an experience of the same sort when we wrote\nthe book called 'The Gilded Age.' There is a character in it called\n'Sellers.' I do not remember what his first name was, in the beginning;\nbut anyway, Mr. Warner did not like it, and wanted it improved. He asked\nme if I was able to imagine a person named 'Eschol Sellers.' Of course I\nsaid I could not, without stimulants. He said that away out West, once,\nhe had met, and contemplated, and actually shaken hands with a man\nbearing that impossible name--'Eschol Sellers.' He added--\n\n'It was twenty years ago; his name has probably carried him off before\nthis; and if it hasn't, he will never see the book anyhow. We will\nconfiscate his name. The name you are using is common, and therefore\ndangerous; there are probably a thousand Sellerses bearing it, and the\nwhole horde will come after us; but Eschol Sellers is a safe name--it is\na rock.'\n\nSo we borrowed that name; and when the book had been out about a week,\none of the stateliest and handsomest and most aristocratic looking white\nmen that ever lived, called around, with the most formidable libel\nsuit in his pocket that ever--well, in brief, we got his permission to\nsuppress an edition of ten million {footnote [Figures taken from memory,\nand probably incorrect. Think it was more.]} copies of the book and\nchange that name to 'Mulberry Sellers' in future editions.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 48\n\nSugar and Postage\n\nONE day, on the street, I encountered the man whom, of all men, I most\nwished to see--Horace Bixby; formerly pilot under me--or rather, over\nme--now captain of the great steamer 'City of Baton Rouge,' the latest\nand swiftest addition to the Anchor Line. The same slender figure, the\nsame tight curls, the same springy step, the same alertness, the same\ndecision of eye and answering decision of hand, the same erect military\nbearing; not an inch gained or lost in girth, not an ounce gained or\nlost in weight, not a hair turned. It is a curious thing, to leave a man\nthirty-five years old, and come back at the end of twenty-one years and\nfind him still only thirty-five. I have not had an experience of this\nkind before, I believe. There were some crow's-feet, but they counted\nfor next to nothing, since they were inconspicuous.\n\nHis boat was just in. I had been waiting several days for her, purposing\nto return to St. Louis in her. The captain and I joined a party of\nladies and gentlemen, guests of Major Wood, and went down the river\nfifty-four miles, in a swift tug, to ex-Governor Warmouth's sugar\nplantation. Strung along below the city, were a number of decayed,\nram-shackly, superannuated old steamboats, not one of which had I ever\nseen before. They had all been built, and worn out, and thrown aside,\nsince I was here last. This gives one a realizing sense of the frailness\nof a Mississippi boat and the briefness of its life.\n\nSix miles below town a fat and battered brick chimney, sticking above\nthe magnolias and live-oaks, was pointed out as the monument erected by\nan appreciative nation to celebrate the battle of New Orleans--Jackson's\nvictory over the British, January 8, 1815. The war had ended, the two\nnations were at peace, but the news had not yet reached New Orleans. If\nwe had had the cable telegraph in those days, this blood would not have\nbeen spilt, those lives would not have been wasted; and better still,\nJackson would probably never have been president. We have gotten over\nthe harms done us by the war of 1812, but not over some of those done us\nby Jackson's presidency.\n\nThe Warmouth plantation covers a vast deal of ground, and the\nhospitality of the Warmouth mansion is graduated to the same large\nscale. We saw steam-plows at work, here, for the first time. The\ntraction engine travels about on its own wheels, till it reaches the\nrequired spot; then it stands still and by means of a wire rope pulls\nthe huge plow toward itself two or three hundred yards across the field,\nbetween the rows of cane. The thing cuts down into the black mold a foot\nand a half deep. The plow looks like a fore-and-aft brace of a Hudson\nriver steamer, inverted. When the negro steersman sits on one end of it,\nthat end tilts down near the ground, while the other sticks up high in\nair. This great see-saw goes rolling and pitching like a ship at sea,\nand it is not every circus rider that could stay on it.\n\nThe plantation contains two thousand six hundred acres; six hundred and\nfifty are in cane; and there is a fruitful orange grove of five thousand\ntrees. The cane is cultivated after a modern and intricate scientific\nfashion, too elaborate and complex for me to attempt to describe; but it\nlost $40,000 last year. I forget the other details. However, this year's\ncrop will reach ten or twelve hundred tons of sugar, consequently last\nyear's loss will not matter. These troublesome and expensive scientific\nmethods achieve a yield of a ton and a half and from that to two tons,\nto the acre; which is three or four times what the yield of an acre was\nin my time.\n\nThe drainage-ditches were everywhere alive with little\ncrabs--'fiddlers.' One saw them scampering sidewise in every direction\nwhenever they heard a disturbing noise. Expensive pests, these crabs;\nfor they bore into the levees, and ruin them.\n\nThe great sugar-house was a wilderness of tubs and tanks and vats and\nfilters, pumps, pipes, and machinery. The process of making sugar\nis exceedingly interesting. First, you heave your cane into the\ncentrifugals and grind out the juice; then run it through the\nevaporating pan to extract the fiber; then through the bone-filter to\nremove the alcohol; then through the clarifying tanks to discharge the\nmolasses; then through the granulating pipe to condense it; then through\nthe vacuum pan to extract the vacuum. It is now ready for market. I have\njotted these particulars down from memory. The thing looks simple and\neasy. Do not deceive yourself. To make sugar is really one of the\nmost difficult things in the world. And to make it right, is next to\nimpossible. If you will examine your own supply every now and then for\na term of years, and tabulate the result, you will find that not two men\nin twenty can make sugar without getting sand into it.\n\nWe could have gone down to the mouth of the river and visited Captain\nEads' great work, the 'jetties,' where the river has been compressed\nbetween walls, and thus deepened to twenty-six feet; but it was voted\nuseless to go, since at this stage of the water everything would be\ncovered up and invisible.\n\nWe could have visited that ancient and singular burg, 'Pilot-town,'\nwhich stands on stilts in the water--so they say; where nearly all\ncommunication is by skiff and canoe, even to the attending of weddings\nand funerals; and where the littlest boys and girls are as handy with\nthe oar as unamphibious children are with the velocipede.\n\nWe could have done a number of other things; but on account of limited\ntime, we went back home. The sail up the breezy and sparkling river was\na charming experience, and would have been satisfyingly sentimental\nand romantic but for the interruptions of the tug's pet parrot,\nwhose tireless comments upon the scenery and the guests were always\nthis-worldly, and often profane. He had also a superabundance of\nthe discordant, ear-splitting, metallic laugh common to his breed--a\nmachine-made laugh, a Frankenstein laugh, with the soul left out of it.\nHe applied it to every sentimental remark, and to every pathetic song.\nHe cackled it out with hideous energy after 'Home again, home again from\na foreign shore,' and said he 'wouldn't give a damn for a tug-load\nof such rot.' Romance and sentiment cannot long survive this sort of\ndiscouragement; so the singing and talking presently ceased; which so\ndelighted the parrot that he cursed himself hoarse for joy.\n\nThen the male members of the party moved to the forecastle, to smoke and\ngossip. There were several old steamboatmen along, and I learned from\nthem a great deal of what had been happening to my former river friends\nduring my long absence. I learned that a pilot whom I used to steer\nfor is become a spiritualist, and for more than fifteen years has been\nreceiving a letter every week from a deceased relative, through a\nNew York spiritualist medium named Manchester--postage graduated by\ndistance: from the local post-office in Paradise to New York, five\ndollars; from New York to St. Louis, three cents. I remember Mr.\nManchester very well. I called on him once, ten years ago, with a couple\nof friends, one of whom wished to inquire after a deceased uncle. This\nuncle had lost his life in a peculiarly violent and unusual way, half\na dozen years before: a cyclone blew him some three miles and knocked\na tree down with him which was four feet through at the butt and\nsixty-five feet high. He did not survive this triumph. At the seance\njust referred to, my friend questioned his late uncle, through Mr.\nManchester, and the late uncle wrote down his replies, using Mr.\nManchester's hand and pencil for that purpose. The following is a fair\nexample of the questions asked, and also of the sloppy twaddle in the\nway of answers, furnished by Manchester under the pretense that it came\nfrom the specter. If this man is not the paltriest fraud that lives, I\nowe him an apology--\n\nQUESTION. Where are you?\n\nANSWER. In the spirit world.\n\nQ. Are you happy?\n\nA. Very happy. Perfectly happy.\n\nQ. How do you amuse yourself?\n\nA. Conversation with friends, and other spirits.\n\nQ. What else?\n\nA. Nothing else. Nothing else is necessary.\n\nQ. What do you talk about?\n\nA. About how happy we are; and about friends left behind in the earth,\nand how to influence them for their good.\n\nQ. When your friends in the earth all get to the spirit land, what shall\nyou have to talk about then?--nothing but about how happy you all are?\n\nNo reply. It is explained that spirits will not answer frivolous\nquestions.\n\nQ. How is it that spirits that are content to spend an eternity in\nfrivolous employments, and accept it as happiness, are so fastidious\nabout frivolous questions upon the subject?\n\nNo reply.\n\nQ. Would you like to come back?\n\nA. No.\n\nQ. Would you say that under oath?\n\nA. Yes.\n\nQ. What do you eat there?\n\nA. We do not eat.\n\nQ. What do you drink?\n\nA. We do not drink.\n\nQ. What do you smoke?\n\nA. We do not smoke.\n\nQ. What do you read?\n\nA. We do not read.\n\nQ. Do all the good people go to your place?\n\nA. Yes.\n\nQ. You know my present way of life. Can you suggest any additions to it,\nin the way of crime, that will reasonably insure my going to some other\nplace.\n\nA. No reply.\n\nQ. When did you die?\n\nA. I did not die, I passed away.\n\nQ. Very well, then, when did you pass away? How long have you been in\nthe spirit land?\n\nA. We have no measurements of time here.\n\nQ. Though you may be indifferent and uncertain as to dates and times in\nyour present condition and environment, this has nothing to do with your\nformer condition. You had dates then. One of these is what I ask for.\nYou departed on a certain day in a certain year. Is not this true?\n\nA. Yes.\n\nQ. Then name the day of the month.\n\n(Much fumbling with pencil, on the part of the medium, accompanied by\nviolent spasmodic jerkings of his head and body, for some little time.\nFinally, explanation to the effect that spirits often forget dates, such\nthings being without importance to them.)\n\nQ. Then this one has actually forgotten the date of its translation to\nthe spirit land?\n\nThis was granted to be the case.\n\nQ. This is very curious. Well, then, what year was it?\n\n(More fumbling, jerking, idiotic spasms, on the part of the medium.\nFinally, explanation to the effect that the spirit has forgotten the\nyear.)\n\nQ. This is indeed stupendous. Let me put one more question, one last\nquestion, to you, before we part to meet no more;--for even if I fail\nto avoid your asylum, a meeting there will go for nothing as a meeting,\nsince by that time you will easily have forgotten me and my name: did\nyou die a natural death, or were you cut off by a catastrophe?\n\nA. (After long hesitation and many throes and spasms.) _Natural death_.\n\nThis ended the interview. My friend told the medium that when his\nrelative was in this poor world, he was endowed with an extraordinary\nintellect and an absolutely defectless memory, and it seemed a great\npity that he had not been allowed to keep some shred of these for\nhis amusement in the realms of everlasting contentment, and for the\namazement and admiration of the rest of the population there.\n\nThis man had plenty of clients--has plenty yet. He receives letters from\nspirits located in every part of the spirit world, and delivers them\nall over this country through the United States mail. These letters are\nfilled with advice--advice from 'spirits' who don't know as much as a\ntadpole--and this advice is religiously followed by the receivers. One\nof these clients was a man whom the spirits (if one may thus plurally\ndescribe the ingenious Manchester) were teaching how to contrive an\nimproved railway car-wheel. It is coarse employment for a spirit, but it\nis higher and wholesomer activity than talking for ever about 'how happy\nwe are.'\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 49\n\nEpisodes in Pilot Life\n\nIN the course of the tug-boat gossip, it came out that out of every five\nof my former friends who had quitted the river, four had chosen farming\nas an occupation. Of course this was not because they were peculiarly\ngifted, agriculturally, and thus more likely to succeed as farmers than\nin other industries: the reason for their choice must be traced to some\nother source. Doubtless they chose farming because that life is\nprivate and secluded from irruptions of undesirable strangers--like the\npilot-house hermitage. And doubtless they also chose it because on a\nthousand nights of black storm and danger they had noted the twinkling\nlights of solitary farm-houses, as the boat swung by, and pictured to\nthemselves the serenity and security and coziness of such refuges at\nsuch times, and so had by-and-bye come to dream of that retired and\npeaceful life as the one desirable thing to long for, anticipate, earn,\nand at last enjoy.\n\nBut I did not learn that any of these pilot-farmers had astonished\nanybody with their successes. Their farms do not support them: they\nsupport their farms. The pilot-farmer disappears from the river\nannually, about the breaking of spring, and is seen no more till next\nfrost. Then he appears again, in damaged homespun, combs the hayseed out\nof his hair, and takes a pilot-house berth for the winter. In this way\nhe pays the debts which his farming has achieved during the agricultural\nseason. So his river bondage is but half broken; he is still the river's\nslave the hardest half of the year.\n\nOne of these men bought a farm, but did not retire to it. He knew a\ntrick worth two of that. He did not propose to pauperize his farm by\napplying his personal ignorance to working it. No, he put the farm into\nthe hands of an agricultural expert to be worked on shares--out of every\nthree loads of corn the expert to have two and the pilot the third.\nBut at the end of the season the pilot received no corn. The expert\nexplained that his share was not reached. The farm produced only two\nloads.\n\nSome of the pilots whom I had known had had adventures--the outcome\nfortunate, sometimes, but not in all cases. Captain Montgomery, whom I\nhad steered for when he was a pilot, commanded the Confederate fleet\nin the great battle before Memphis; when his vessel went down, he swam\nashore, fought his way through a squad of soldiers, and made a gallant\nand narrow escape. He was always a cool man; nothing could disturb\nhis serenity. Once when he was captain of the 'Crescent City,' I was\nbringing the boat into port at New Orleans, and momently expecting\norders from the hurricane deck, but received none. I had stopped\nthe wheels, and there my authority and responsibility ceased. It was\nevening--dim twilight--the captain's hat was perched upon the big bell,\nand I supposed the intellectual end of the captain was in it, but such\nwas not the case. The captain was very strict; therefore I knew better\nthan to touch a bell without orders. My duty was to hold the boat\nsteadily on her calamitous course, and leave the consequences to take\ncare of themselves--which I did. So we went plowing past the sterns of\nsteamboats and getting closer and closer--the crash was bound to come\nvery soon--and still that hat never budged; for alas, the captain was\nnapping in the texas.... Things were becoming exceedingly nervous and\nuncomfortable. It seemed to me that the captain was not going to appear\nin time to see the entertainment. But he did. Just as we were walking\ninto the stern of a steamboat, he stepped out on deck, and said, with\nheavenly serenity, 'Set her back on both'--which I did; but a trifle\nlate, however, for the next moment we went smashing through that other\nboat's flimsy outer works with a most prodigious racket. The captain\nnever said a word to me about the matter afterwards, except to remark\nthat I had done right, and that he hoped I would not hesitate to act in\nthe same way again in like circumstances.\n\nOne of the pilots whom I had known when I was on the river had died a\nvery honorable death. His boat caught fire, and he remained at the wheel\nuntil he got her safe to land. Then he went out over the breast-board\nwith his clothing in flames, and was the last person to get ashore. He\ndied from his injuries in the course of two or three hours, and his was\nthe only life lost.\n\nThe history of Mississippi piloting affords six or seven instances of\nthis sort of martyrdom, and half a hundred instances of escapes from a\nlike fate which came within a second or two of being fatally too late;\n_but there is no instance of a pilot deserting his post to save his life\nwhile by remaining and sacrificing it he might secure other lives from\ndestruction._ It is well worth while to set down this noble fact, and\nwell worth while to put it in italics, too.\n\nThe 'cub' pilot is early admonished to despise all perils connected with\na pilot's calling, and to prefer any sort of death to the deep dishonor\nof deserting his post while there is any possibility of his being useful\nin it. And so effectively are these admonitions inculcated, that even\nyoung and but half-tried pilots can be depended upon to stick to the\nwheel, and die there when occasion requires. In a Memphis graveyard is\nburied a young fellow who perished at the wheel a great many years ago,\nin White River, to save the lives of other men. He said to the captain\nthat if the fire would give him time to reach a sand bar, some distance\naway, all could be saved, but that to land against the bluff bank of the\nriver would be to insure the loss of many lives. He reached the bar\nand grounded the boat in shallow water; but by that time the flames had\nclosed around him, and in escaping through them he was fatally burned.\nHe had been urged to fly sooner, but had replied as became a pilot to\nreply--\n\n'I will not go. If I go, nobody will be saved; if I stay, no one will be\nlost but me. I will stay.'\n\nThere were two hundred persons on board, and no life was lost but the\npilot's. There used to be a monument to this young fellow, in that\nMemphis graveyard. While we tarried in Memphis on our down trip, I\nstarted out to look for it, but our time was so brief that I was obliged\nto turn back before my object was accomplished.\n\nThe tug-boat gossip informed me that Dick Kennet was dead--blown up,\nnear Memphis, and killed; that several others whom I had known had\nfallen in the war--one or two of them shot down at the wheel; that\nanother and very particular friend, whom I had steered many trips for,\nhad stepped out of his house in New Orleans, one night years ago, to\ncollect some money in a remote part of the city, and had never been seen\nagain--was murdered and thrown into the river, it was thought; that Ben\nThornburgh was dead long ago; also his wild 'cub' whom I used to quarrel\nwith, all through every daylight watch. A heedless, reckless creature he\nwas, and always in hot water, always in mischief. An Arkansas passenger\nbrought an enormous bear aboard, one day, and chained him to a life-boat\non the hurricane deck. Thornburgh's 'cub' could not rest till he had\ngone there and unchained the bear, to 'see what he would do.' He was\npromptly gratified. The bear chased him around and around the deck,\nfor miles and miles, with two hundred eager faces grinning through the\nrailings for audience, and finally snatched off the lad's coat-tail and\nwent into the texas to chew it. The off-watch turned out with alacrity,\nand left the bear in sole possession. He presently grew lonesome, and\nstarted out for recreation. He ranged the whole boat--visited every part\nof it, with an advance guard of fleeing people in front of him and a\nvoiceless vacancy behind him; and when his owner captured him at last,\nthose two were the only visible beings anywhere; everybody else was in\nhiding, and the boat was a solitude.\n\nI was told that one of my pilot friends fell dead at the wheel, from\nheart disease, in 1869. The captain was on the roof at the time. He saw\nthe boat breaking for the shore; shouted, and got no answer; ran up, and\nfound the pilot lying dead on the floor.\n\nMr. Bixby had been blown up, in Madrid bend; was not injured, but the\nother pilot was lost.\n\nGeorge Ritchie had been blown up near Memphis--blown into the river from\nthe wheel, and disabled. The water was very cold; he clung to a cotton\nbale--mainly with his teeth--and floated until nearly exhausted, when\nhe was rescued by some deck hands who were on a piece of the wreck. They\ntore open the bale and packed him in the cotton, and warmed the life\nback into him, and got him safe to Memphis. He is one of Bixby's pilots\non the 'Baton Rouge' now.\n\nInto the life of a steamboat clerk, now dead, had dropped a bit of\nromance--somewhat grotesque romance, but romance nevertheless. When I\nknew him he was a shiftless young spendthrift, boisterous, goodhearted,\nfull of careless generosities, and pretty conspicuously promising to\nfool his possibilities away early, and come to nothing. In a Western\ncity lived a rich and childless old foreigner and his wife; and in their\nfamily was a comely young girl--sort of friend, sort of servant. The\nyoung clerk of whom I have been speaking--whose name was not George\nJohnson, but who shall be called George Johnson for the purposes of this\nnarrative--got acquainted with this young girl, and they sinned; and\nthe old foreigner found them out, and rebuked them. Being ashamed, they\nlied, and said they were married; that they had been privately married.\nThen the old foreigner's hurt was healed, and he forgave and blessed\nthem. After that, they were able to continue their sin without\nconcealment. By-and-bye the foreigner's wife died; and presently he\nfollowed after her. Friends of the family assembled to mourn; and among\nthe mourners sat the two young sinners. The will was opened and solemnly\nread. It bequeathed every penny of that old man's great wealth to _Mrs.\nGeorge Johnson!_\n\nAnd there was no such person. The young sinners fled forth then, and did\na very foolish thing: married themselves before an obscure Justice of\nthe Peace, and got him to antedate the thing. That did no sort of good.\nThe distant relatives flocked in and exposed the fraudful date with\nextreme suddenness and surprising ease, and carried off the fortune,\nleaving the Johnsons very legitimately, and legally, and irrevocably\nchained together in honorable marriage, but with not so much as a penny\nto bless themselves withal. Such are the actual facts; and not all\nnovels have for a base so telling a situation.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 50\n\nThe 'Original Jacobs'\n\nWE had some talk about Captain Isaiah Sellers, now many years dead. He\nwas a fine man, a high-minded man, and greatly respected both ashore and\non the river. He was very tall, well built, and handsome; and in his old\nage--as I remember him--his hair was as black as an Indian's, and his\neye and hand were as strong and steady and his nerve and judgment as\nfirm and clear as anybody's, young or old, among the fraternity of\npilots. He was the patriarch of the craft; he had been a keelboat pilot\nbefore the day of steamboats; and a steamboat pilot before any other\nsteamboat pilot, still surviving at the time I speak of, had ever turned\na wheel. Consequently his brethren held him in the sort of awe in\nwhich illustrious survivors of a bygone age are always held by their\nassociates. He knew how he was regarded, and perhaps this fact added\nsome trifle of stiffening to his natural dignity, which had been\nsufficiently stiff in its original state.\n\nHe left a diary behind him; but apparently it did not date back to his\nfirst steamboat trip, which was said to be 1811, the year the first\nsteamboat disturbed the waters of the Mississippi. At the time of his\ndeath a correspondent of the 'St. Louis Republican' culled the following\nitems from the diary--\n\n'In February, 1825, he shipped on board the steamer “Rambler,” at\nFlorence, Ala., and made during that year three trips to New Orleans and\nback--this on the “Gen. Carrol,” between Nashville and New Orleans. It\nwas during his stay on this boat that Captain Sellers introduced the tap\nof the bell as a signal to heave the lead, previous to which time it was\nthe custom for the pilot to speak to the men below when soundings were\nwanted. The proximity of the forecastle to the pilot-house, no doubt,\nrendered this an easy matter; but how different on one of our palaces of\nthe present day.\n\n'In 1827 we find him on board the “President,” a boat of two hundred and\neighty-five tons burden, and plying between Smithland and New Orleans.\nThence he joined the “Jubilee” in 1828, and on this boat he did his\nfirst piloting in the St. Louis trade; his first watch extending from\nHerculaneum to St. Genevieve. On May 26, 1836, he completed and left\nPittsburgh in charge of the steamer “Prairie,” a boat of four hundred\ntons, and the first steamer with a _State-Room cabin_ ever seen at St.\nLouis. In 1857 he introduced the signal for meeting boats, and which\nhas, with some slight change, been the universal custom of this day; in\nfact, is rendered obligatory by act of Congress.\n\n'As general items of river history, we quote the following marginal\nnotes from his general log--\n\n'In March, 1825, Gen. Lafayette left New Orleans for St. Louis on the\nlow-pressure steamer “Natchez.”\n\n'In January, 1828, twenty-one steamers left the New Orleans wharf to\ncelebrate the occasion of Gen. Jackson's visit to that city.\n\n'In 1830 the “North American” made the run from New Orleans to Memphis\nin six days--best time on record to that date. It has since been made in\ntwo days and ten hours.\n\n'In 1831 the Red River cut-off formed.\n\n'In 1832 steamer “Hudson” made the run from White River to Helena, a\ndistance of seventy-five miles, in twelve hours. This was the source of\nmuch talk and speculation among parties directly interested.\n\n'In 1839 Great Horseshoe cut-off formed.\n\n'Up to the present time, a term of thirty-five years, we ascertain, by\nreference to the diary, he has made four hundred and sixty round trips\nto New Orleans, which gives a distance of one million one hundred and\nfour thousand miles, or an average of eighty-six miles a day.'\n\nWhenever Captain Sellers approached a body of gossiping pilots, a chill\nfell there, and talking ceased. For this reason: whenever six pilots\nwere gathered together, there would always be one or two newly fledged\nones in the lot, and the elder ones would be always 'showing off' before\nthese poor fellows; making them sorrowfully feel how callow they were,\nhow recent their nobility, and how humble their degree, by talking\nlargely and vaporously of old-time experiences on the river; always\nmaking it a point to date everything back as far as they could, so as to\nmake the new men feel their newness to the sharpest degree possible,\nand envy the old stagers in the like degree. And how these complacent\nbaldheads _would_ swell, and brag, and lie, and date back--ten, fifteen,\ntwenty years,--and how they did enjoy the effect produced upon the\nmarveling and envying youngsters!\n\nAnd perhaps just at this happy stage of the proceedings, the stately\nfigure of Captain Isaiah Sellers, that real and only genuine Son of\nAntiquity, would drift solemnly into the midst. Imagine the size of the\nsilence that would result on the instant. And imagine the feelings of\nthose bald-heads, and the exultation of their recent audience when the\nancient captain would begin to drop casual and indifferent remarks of a\nreminiscent nature--about islands that had disappeared, and cutoffs that\nhad been made, a generation before the oldest bald-head in the company\nhad ever set his foot in a pilot-house!\n\nMany and many a time did this ancient mariner appear on the scene in the\nabove fashion, and spread disaster and humiliation around him. If one\nmight believe the pilots, he always dated his islands back to the misty\ndawn of river history; and he never used the same island twice; and\nnever did he employ an island that still existed, or give one a name\nwhich anybody present was old enough to have heard of before. If you\nmight believe the pilots, he was always conscientiously particular\nabout little details; never spoke of 'the State of Mississippi,' for\ninstance--no, he would say, 'When the State of Mississippi was where\nArkansas now is,' and would never speak of Louisiana or Missouri in\na general way, and leave an incorrect impression on your mind--no, he\nwould say, 'When Louisiana was up the river farther,' or 'When Missouri\nwas on the Illinois side.'\n\nThe old gentleman was not of literary turn or capacity, but he used\nto jot down brief paragraphs of plain practical information about the\nriver, and sign them '_Mark Twain_,' and give them to the 'New Orleans\nPicayune.' They related to the stage and condition of the river, and\nwere accurate and valuable; and thus far, they contained no poison.\nBut in speaking of the stage of the river to-day, at a given point, the\ncaptain was pretty apt to drop in a little remark about this being the\nfirst time he had seen the water so high or so low at that particular\npoint for forty-nine years; and now and then he would mention Island\nSo-and-so, and follow it, in parentheses, with some such observation\nas 'disappeared in 1807, if I remember rightly.' In these antique\ninterjections lay poison and bitterness for the other old pilots, and\nthey used to chaff the 'Mark Twain' paragraphs with unsparing mockery.\n\nIt so chanced that one of these paragraphs--{footnote [The original MS.\nof it, in the captain's own hand, has been sent to me from New Orleans.\nIt reads as follows--\n\nVICKSBURG May 4, 1859.\n\n'My opinion for the benefit of the citizens of New Orleans: The water\nis higher this far up than it has been since 8. My opinion is that the\nwater will be feet deep in Canal street before the first of next June.\nMrs. Turner's plantation at the head of Big Black Island is all under\nwater, and it has not been since 1815.\n\n'I. Sellers.']}\n\nbecame the text for my first newspaper article. I burlesqued it broadly,\nvery broadly, stringing my fantastics out to the extent of eight hundred\nor a thousand words. I was a 'cub' at the time. I showed my performance\nto some pilots, and they eagerly rushed it into print in the 'New\nOrleans True Delta.' It was a great pity; for it did nobody any worthy\nservice, and it sent a pang deep into a good man's heart. There was no\nmalice in my rubbish; but it laughed at the captain. It laughed at a man\nto whom such a thing was new and strange and dreadful. I did not know\nthen, though I do now, that there is no suffering comparable with that\nwhich a private person feels when he is for the first time pilloried in\nprint.\n\nCaptain Sellers did me the honor to profoundly detest me from that day\nforth. When I say he did me the honor, I am not using empty words. It\nwas a very real honor to be in the thoughts of so great a man as Captain\nSellers, and I had wit enough to appreciate it and be proud of it. It\nwas distinction to be loved by such a man; but it was a much greater\ndistinction to be hated by him, because he loved scores of people; but\nhe didn't sit up nights to hate anybody but me.\n\nHe never printed another paragraph while he lived, and he never again\nsigned 'Mark Twain' to anything. At the time that the telegraph brought\nthe news of his death, I was on the Pacific coast. I was a fresh new\njournalist, and needed a nom de guerre; so I confiscated the ancient\nmariner's discarded one, and have done my best to make it remain what it\nwas in his hands--a sign and symbol and warrant that whatever is found\nin its company may be gambled on as being the petrified truth; how I\nhave succeeded, it would not be modest in me to say.\n\nThe captain had an honorable pride in his profession and an abiding love\nfor it. He ordered his monument before he died, and kept it near\nhim until he did die. It stands over his grave now, in Bellefontaine\ncemetery, St. Louis. It is his image, in marble, standing on duty at\nthe pilot wheel; and worthy to stand and confront criticism, for it\nrepresents a man who in life would have stayed there till he burned to a\ncinder, if duty required it.\n\nThe finest thing we saw on our whole Mississippi trip, we saw as we\napproached New Orleans in the steam-tug. This was the curving frontage\nof the crescent city lit up with the white glare of five miles of\nelectric lights. It was a wonderful sight, and very beautiful.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 51\n\nReminiscences\n\nWE left for St. Louis in the 'City of Baton Rouge,' on a delightfully\nhot day, but with the main purpose of my visit but lamely accomplished.\nI had hoped to hunt up and talk with a hundred steamboatmen, but got so\npleasantly involved in the social life of the town that I got nothing\nmore than mere five-minute talks with a couple of dozen of the craft.\n\nI was on the bench of the pilot-house when we backed out and\n'straightened up' for the start--the boat pausing for a 'good ready,'\nin the old-fashioned way, and the black smoke piling out of the chimneys\nequally in the old-fashioned way. Then we began to gather momentum, and\npresently were fairly under way and booming along. It was all as natural\nand familiar--and so were the shoreward sights--as if there had been no\nbreak in my river life. There was a 'cub,' and I judged that he\nwould take the wheel now; and he did. Captain Bixby stepped into the\npilot-house. Presently the cub closed up on the rank of steamships. He\nmade me nervous, for he allowed too much water to show between our boat\nand the ships. I knew quite well what was going to happen, because\nI could date back in my own life and inspect the record. The captain\nlooked on, during a silent half-minute, then took the wheel himself, and\ncrowded the boat in, till she went scraping along within a hand-breadth\nof the ships. It was exactly the favor which he had done me, about a\nquarter of a century before, in that same spot, the first time I ever\nsteamed out of the port of New Orleans. It was a very great and sincere\npleasure to me to see the thing repeated--with somebody else as victim.\n\nWe made Natchez (three hundred miles) in twenty-two hours and a half--\nmuch the swiftest passage I have ever made over that piece of water.\n\nThe next morning I came on with the four o'clock watch, and saw Ritchie\nsuccessfully run half a dozen crossings in a fog, using for his guidance\nthe marked chart devised and patented by Bixby and himself. This\nsufficiently evidenced the great value of the chart.\n\nBy and by, when the fog began to clear off, I noticed that the\nreflection of a tree in the smooth water of an overflowed bank, six\nhundred yards away, was stronger and blacker than the ghostly tree\nitself. The faint spectral trees, dimly glimpsed through the shredding\nfog, were very pretty things to see.\n\nWe had a heavy thunder-storm at Natchez, another at Vicksburg, and\nstill another about fifty miles below Memphis. They had an old-fashioned\nenergy which had long been unfamiliar to me. This third storm was\naccompanied by a raging wind. We tied up to the bank when we saw the\ntempest coming, and everybody left the pilot-house but me. The wind bent\nthe young trees down, exposing the pale underside of the leaves; and\ngust after gust followed, in quick succession, thrashing the branches\nviolently up and down, and to this side and that, and creating swift\nwaves of alternating green and white according to the side of the leaf\nthat was exposed, and these waves raced after each other as do their\nkind over a wind-tossed field of oats. No color that was visible\nanywhere was quite natural--all tints were charged with a leaden tinge\nfrom the solid cloud-bank overhead. The river was leaden; all distances\nthe same; and even the far-reaching ranks of combing white-caps were\ndully shaded by the dark, rich atmosphere through which their swarming\nlegions marched. The thunder-peals were constant and deafening;\nexplosion followed explosion with but inconsequential intervals between,\nand the reports grew steadily sharper and higher-keyed, and more trying\nto the ear; the lightning was as diligent as the thunder, and produced\neffects which enchanted the eye and sent electric ecstasies of mixed\ndelight and apprehension shivering along every nerve in the body in\nunintermittent procession. The rain poured down in amazing volume; the\near-splitting thunder-peals broke nearer and nearer; the wind increased\nin fury and began to wrench off boughs and tree-tops and send them\nsailing away through space; the pilot-house fell to rocking and\nstraining and cracking and surging, and I went down in the hold to see\nwhat time it was.\n\nPeople boast a good deal about Alpine thunderstorms; but the storms\nwhich I have had the luck to see in the Alps were not the equals of some\nwhich I have seen in the Mississippi Valley. I may not have seen the\nAlps do their best, of course, and if they can beat the Mississippi, I\ndon't wish to.\n\nOn this up trip I saw a little towhead (infant island) half a mile long,\nwhich had been formed during the past nineteen years. Since there was\nso much time to spare that nineteen years of it could be devoted to\nthe construction of a mere towhead, where was the use, originally, in\nrushing this whole globe through in six days? It is likely that if more\ntime had been taken, in the first place, the world would have been made\nright, and this ceaseless improving and repairing would not be necessary\nnow. But if you hurry a world or a house, you are nearly sure to find\nout by and by that you have left out a towhead, or a broom-closet,\nor some other little convenience, here and there, which has got to be\nsupplied, no matter how much expense and vexation it may cost.\n\nWe had a succession of black nights, going up the river, and it was\nobservable that whenever we landed, and suddenly inundated the trees\nwith the intense sunburst of the electric light, a certain curious\neffect was always produced: hundreds of birds flocked instantly out\nfrom the masses of shining green foliage, and went careering hither and\nthither through the white rays, and often a song-bird tuned up and fell\nto singing. We judged that they mistook this superb artificial day\nfor the genuine article. We had a delightful trip in that thoroughly\nwell-ordered steamer, and regretted that it was accomplished so\nspeedily. By means of diligence and activity, we managed to hunt out\nnearly all the old friends. One was missing, however; he went to his\nreward, whatever it was, two years ago. But I found out all about him.\nHis case helped me to realize how lasting can be the effect of a\nvery trifling occurrence. When he was an apprentice-blacksmith in our\nvillage, and I a schoolboy, a couple of young Englishmen came to the\ntown and sojourned a while; and one day they got themselves up in cheap\nroyal finery and did the Richard III swordfight with maniac energy and\nprodigious powwow, in the presence of the village boys. This blacksmith\ncub was there, and the histrionic poison entered his bones. This\nvast, lumbering, ignorant, dull-witted lout was stage-struck, and\nirrecoverably. He disappeared, and presently turned up in St. Louis.\nI ran across him there, by and by. He was standing musing on a street\ncorner, with his left hand on his hip, the thumb of his right supporting\nhis chin, face bowed and frowning, slouch hat pulled down over his\nforehead--imagining himself to be Othello or some such character, and\nimagining that the passing crowd marked his tragic bearing and were\nawestruck.\n\nI joined him, and tried to get him down out of the clouds, but did not\nsucceed. However, he casually informed me, presently, that he was a\nmember of the Walnut Street theater company--and he tried to say it with\nindifference, but the indifference was thin, and a mighty exultation\nshowed through it. He said he was cast for a part in Julius Caesar, for\nthat night, and if I should come I would see him. _If_ I should come! I\nsaid I wouldn't miss it if I were dead.\n\nI went away stupefied with astonishment, and saying to myself, 'How\nstrange it is! _We_ always thought this fellow a fool; yet the moment he\ncomes to a great city, where intelligence and appreciation abound,\nthe talent concealed in this shabby napkin is at once discovered, and\npromptly welcomed and honored.'\n\nBut I came away from the theater that night disappointed and offended;\nfor I had had no glimpse of my hero, and his name was not in the bills.\nI met him on the street the next morning, and before I could speak, he\nasked--\n\n'Did you see me?'\n\n'No, you weren't there.'\n\nHe looked surprised and disappointed. He said--\n\n'Yes, I was. Indeed I was. I was a Roman soldier.'\n\n'Which one?'\n\n'Why didn't you see them Roman soldiers that stood back there in a rank,\nand sometimes marched in procession around the stage?'\n\n'Do you mean the Roman army?--those six sandaled roustabouts in\nnightshirts, with tin shields and helmets, that marched around treading\non each other's heels, in charge of a spider-legged consumptive dressed\nlike themselves?'\n\n'That's it! that's it! I was one of them Roman soldiers. I was the next\nto the last one. A half a year ago I used to always be the last one; but\nI've been promoted.'\n\nWell, they told me that that poor fellow remained a Roman soldier to\nthe last--a matter of thirty-four years. Sometimes they cast him for a\n'speaking part,' but not an elaborate one. He could be trusted to go\nand say, 'My lord, the carriage waits,' but if they ventured to add a\nsentence or two to this, his memory felt the strain and he was likely to\nmiss fire. Yet, poor devil, he had been patiently studying the part of\nHamlet for more than thirty years, and he lived and died in the belief\nthat some day he would be invited to play it!\n\nAnd this is what came of that fleeting visit of those young Englishmen\nto our village such ages and ages ago! What noble horseshoes this man\nmight have made, but for those Englishmen; and what an inadequate Roman\nsoldier he _did _make!\n\nA day or two after we reached St. Louis, I was walking along Fourth\nStreet when a grizzly-headed man gave a sort of start as he passed me,\nthen stopped, came back, inspected me narrowly, with a clouding brow,\nand finally said with deep asperity--\n\n'Look here, _have you got that drink yet?_'\n\nA maniac, I judged, at first. But all in a flash I recognized him. I\nmade an effort to blush that strained every muscle in me, and answered\nas sweetly and winningly as ever I knew how--\n\n'Been a little slow, but am just this minute closing in on the place\nwhere they keep it. Come in and help.'\n\nHe softened, and said make it a bottle of champagne and he was\nagreeable. He said he had seen my name in the papers, and had put all\nhis affairs aside and turned out, resolved to find me or die; and make\nme answer that question satisfactorily, or kill me; though the most of\nhis late asperity had been rather counterfeit than otherwise.\n\nThis meeting brought back to me the St. Louis riots of about thirty\nyears ago. I spent a week there, at that time, in a boarding-house, and\nhad this young fellow for a neighbor across the hall. We saw some of\nthe fightings and killings; and by and by we went one night to an armory\nwhere two hundred young men had met, upon call, to be armed and go forth\nagainst the rioters, under command of a military man. We drilled till\nabout ten o'clock at night; then news came that the mob were in great\nforce in the lower end of the town, and were sweeping everything before\nthem. Our column moved at once. It was a very hot night, and my musket\nwas very heavy. We marched and marched; and the nearer we approached the\nseat of war, the hotter I grew and the thirstier I got. I was behind my\nfriend; so, finally, I asked him to hold my musket while I dropped out\nand got a drink. Then I branched off and went home. I was not feeling\nany solicitude about him of course, because I knew he was so well armed,\nnow, that he could take care of himself without any trouble. If I had\nhad any doubts about that, I would have borrowed another musket for him.\nI left the city pretty early the next morning, and if this grizzled man\nhad not happened to encounter my name in the papers the other day in St.\nLouis, and felt moved to seek me out, I should have carried to my grave\na heart-torturing uncertainty as to whether he ever got out of the riots\nall right or not. I ought to have inquired, thirty years ago; I know\nthat. And I would have inquired, if I had had the muskets; but, in the\ncircumstances, he seemed better fixed to conduct the investigations than\nI was.\n\nOne Monday, near the time of our visit to St. Louis, the\n'Globe-Democrat' came out with a couple of pages of Sunday statistics,\nwhereby it appeared that 119,448 St. Louis people attended the morning\nand evening church services the day before, and 23,102 children attended\nSunday-school. Thus 142,550 persons, out of the city's total of 400,000\npopulation, respected the day religious-wise. I found these statistics,\nin a condensed form, in a telegram of the Associated Press, and\npreserved them. They made it apparent that St. Louis was in a higher\nstate of grace than she could have claimed to be in my time. But now\nthat I canvass the figures narrowly, I suspect that the telegraph\nmutilated them. It cannot be that there are more than 150,000 Catholics\nin the town; the other 250,000 must be classified as Protestants. Out\nof these 250,000, according to this questionable telegram, only 26,362\nattended church and Sunday-school, while out of the 150,000 Catholics,\n116,188 went to church and Sunday-school.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 52\n\nA Burning Brand\n\n_All _at once the thought came into my mind, 'I have not sought out Mr.\nBrown.'\n\nUpon that text I desire to depart from the direct line of my subject,\nand make a little excursion. I wish to reveal a secret which I have\ncarried with me nine years, and which has become burdensome.\n\nUpon a certain occasion, nine years ago, I had said, with strong\nfeeling, 'If ever I see St. Louis again, I will seek out Mr. Brown, the\ngreat grain merchant, and ask of him the privilege of shaking him by the\nhand.'\n\nThe occasion and the circumstances were as follows. A friend of mine, a\nclergyman, came one evening and said--\n\n'I have a most remarkable letter here, which I want to read to you, if\nI can do it without breaking down. I must preface it with some\nexplanations, however. The letter is written by an ex-thief and\nex-vagabond of the lowest origin and basest rearing, a man all stained\nwith crime and steeped in ignorance; but, thank God, with a mine of pure\ngold hidden away in him, as you shall see. His letter is written to a\nburglar named Williams, who is serving a nine-year term in a certain\nState prison, for burglary. Williams was a particularly daring burglar,\nand plied that trade during a number of years; but he was caught at last\nand jailed, to await trial in a town where he had broken into a house at\nnight, pistol in hand, and forced the owner to hand over to him $8,000\nin government bonds. Williams was not a common sort of person, by\nany means; he was a graduate of Harvard College, and came of good New\nEngland stock. His father was a clergyman. While lying in jail, his\nhealth began to fail, and he was threatened with consumption. This\nfact, together with the opportunity for reflection afforded by solitary\nconfinement, had its effect--its natural effect. He fell into serious\nthought; his early training asserted itself with power, and wrought with\nstrong influence upon his mind and heart. He put his old life behind\nhim, and became an earnest Christian. Some ladies in the town heard of\nthis, visited him, and by their encouraging words supported him in his\ngood resolutions and strengthened him to continue in his new life. The\ntrial ended in his conviction and sentence to the State prison for\nthe term of nine years, as I have before said. In the prison he became\nacquainted with the poor wretch referred to in the beginning of my talk,\nJack Hunt, the writer of the letter which I am going to read. You will\nsee that the acquaintanceship bore fruit for Hunt. When Hunt's time was\nout, he wandered to St. Louis; and from that place he wrote his letter\nto Williams. The letter got no further than the office of the prison\nwarden, of course; prisoners are not often allowed to receive letters\nfrom outside. The prison authorities read this letter, but did not\ndestroy it. They had not the heart to do it. They read it to several\npersons, and eventually it fell into the hands of those ladies of whom I\nspoke a while ago. The other day I came across an old friend of mine--a\nclergyman--who had seen this letter, and was full of it. The mere\nremembrance of it so moved him that he could not talk of it without\nhis voice breaking. He promised to get a copy of it for me; and here it\nis--an exact copy, with all the imperfections of the original preserved.\nIt has many slang expressions in it--thieves' argot--but their meaning\nhas been interlined, in parentheses, by the prison authorities'--\n\nSt. Louis, June 9th 1872.\n\nMr. W---- friend Charlie if i may call you so: i no you are surprised to\nget a letter from me, but i hope you won't be mad at my writing to you.\ni want to tell you my thanks for the way you talked to me when i was in\nprison--it has led me to try and be a better man; i guess you thought\ni did not cair for what you said, & at the first go off I didn't, but i\nnoed you was a man who had don big work with good men & want no sucker,\nnor want gasing & all the boys knod it.\n\nI used to think at nite what you said, & for it i nocked off swearing\nmonths before my time was up, for i saw it want no good, nohow--the day\nmy time was up you told me if i would shake the cross (_quit stealing_)\n& live on the square for months, it would be the best job i ever done\nin my life. The state agent give me a ticket to here, & on the car i\nthought more of what you said to me, but didn't make up my mind. When\nwe got to Chicago on the cars from there to here, I pulled off an old\nwoman's leather;\n\n(_Robbed her of her pocketbook_) i hadn't no more than got it off when i\nwished i hadn't done it, for awhile before that i made up my mind to be\na square bloke, for months on your word, but forgot it when i saw the\nleather was a grip (_easy to get_)--but i kept clos to her & when she\ngot out of the cars at a way place i said, marm have you lost anything.\n& she tumbled (_discovered_) her leather was off (_gone_)--is this\nit says i, giving it to her--well if you aint honest, says she, but i\nhadn't got cheak enough to stand that sort of talk, so i left her in a\nhurry. When i got here i had $1 and 25 cents left & i didn't get no work\nfor 3 days as i aint strong enough for roust about on a steam bote (_for\na deck hand_)--The afternoon of the 3rd day I spent my last 10 cts for\nmoons (_large, round sea-biscuit_) & cheese & i felt pretty rough & was\nthinking i would have to go on the dipe (_picking pockets_) again, when\ni thought of what you once said about a fellows calling on the Lord when\nhe was in hard luck, & i thought i would try it once anyhow, but when i\ntryed it i got stuck on the start, & all i could get off wos, Lord give\na poor fellow a chance to square it for 3 months for Christ's sake,\namen; & i kept a thinking, of it over and over as i went along--about an\nhour after that i was in 4th St. & this is what happened & is the cause\nof my being where i am now & about which i will tell you before i get\ndone writing. As i was walking along herd a big noise & saw a horse\nrunning away with a carriage with 2 children in it, & I grabed up a\npeace of box cover from the side walk & run in the middle of the street,\n& when the horse came up i smashed him over the head as hard as i could\ndrive--the bord split to peces & the horse checked up a little &\nI grabbed the reigns & pulled his head down until he stopped--the\ngentleman what owned him came running up & soon as he saw the children\nwere all rite, he shook hands with me and gave me a $50 green back, & my\nasking the Lord to help me come into my head, & i was so thunderstruck i\ncouldn't drop the reigns nor say nothing--he saw something was up, &\n\ncoming back to me said, my boy are you hurt? & the thought come into my\nhead just then to ask him for work; & i asked him to take back the bill\nand give me a job--says he, jump in here & lets talk about it, but keep\nthe money--he asked me if i could take care of horses & i said yes, for\ni used to hang round livery stables & often would help clean & drive\nhorses, he told me he wanted a man for that work, & would give me $16\na month & bord me. You bet i took that chance at once. that nite in my\nlittle room over the stable i sat a long time thinking over my past life\n& of what had just happened & i just got down on my nees & thanked the\nLord for the job & to help me to square it, & to bless you for putting\nme up to it, & the next morning i done it again & got me some new togs\n(clothes) & a bible for i made up my mind after what the Lord had done\nfor me i would read the bible every nite and morning, & ask him to keep\nan eye on me. When I had been there about a week Mr. Brown (that's his\nname) came in my room one nite and saw me reading the bible--he asked me\nif i was a Christian & i told him no--he asked me how it was i read the\nbible instead of papers & books--Well Charlie i thought i had better\ngive him a square deal in the start, so i told him all about my being in\nprison & about you, & how i had almost done give up looking for work &\nhow the Lord got me the job when I asked him; & the only way i had to\npay him back was to read the bible & square it, & i asked him to give me\na chance for 3 months--he talked to me like a father for a long time,\n& told me i could stay & then i felt better than ever i had done in my\nlife, for i had given Mr. Brown a fair start with me & now i didn't fear\nno one giving me a back cap (_exposing his past life_) & running me\noff the job--the next morning he called me into the library & gave me\nanother square talk, & advised me to study some every day, & he would\nhelp me one or 2 hours every nite, & he gave me a Arithmetic, a spelling\nbook, a Geography & a writing book, & he hers me every nite--he lets me\ncome into the house to prayers every morning, & got me put in a bible\nclass in the Sunday School which i likes very much for it helps me to\nunderstand my bible better.\n\nNow, Charlie the 3 months on the square are up 2 months ago, & as you\nsaid, it is the best job i ever did in my life, & i commenced another\nof the same sort right away, only it is to God helping me to last a\nlifetime Charlie--i wrote this letter to tell you I do think God has\nforgiven my sins & herd your prayers, for you told me you should pray\nfor me--i no i love to read his word & tell him all my troubles & he\nhelps me i know for i have plenty of chances to steal but i don't feel\nto as i once did & now i take more pleasure in going to church than to\nthe theater & that wasnt so once--our minister and others often talk\nwith me & a month ago they wanted me to join the church, but I said no,\nnot now, i may be mistaken in my feelings, i will wait awhile, but now\ni feel that God has called me & on the first Sunday in July i will join\nthe church--dear friend i wish i could write to you as i feel, but i\ncant do it yet--you no i learned to read and write while prisons & i\naint got well enough along to write as i would talk; i no i aint spelled\nall the words rite in this & lots of other mistakes but you will excuse\nit i no, for you no i was brought up in a poor house until i run away, &\nthat i never new who my father and mother was & i dont no my right name,\n& i hope you wont be mad at me, but i have as much rite to one name as\nanother & i have taken your name, for you wont use it when you get out\ni no, & you are the man i think most of in the world; so i hope you wont\nbe mad--I am doing well, i put $10 a month in bank with $25 of the $50--\nif you ever want any or all of it let me know, & it is yours. i wish\nyou would let me send you some now. I send you with this a receipt for\na year of Littles Living Age, i didn't know what you would like & i told\nMr. Brown & he said he thought you would like it--i wish i was nere you\nso i could send you chuck (_refreshments_) on holidays; it would spoil\nthis weather from here, but i will send you a box next thanksgiving any\nway--next week Mr. Brown takes me into his store as lite porter & will\nadvance me as soon as i know a little more--he keeps a big granary\nstore, wholesale--i forgot to tell you of my mission school, sunday\nschool class--the school is in the sunday afternoon, i went out two\nsunday afternoons, and picked up seven kids (_little boys_) & got them\nto come in. two of them new as much as i did & i had them put in a class\nwhere they could learn something. i dont no much myself, but as these\nkids cant read i get on nicely with them. i make sure of them by going\nafter them every Sunday hour before school time, I also got 4 girls\nto come. tell Mack and Harry about me, if they will come out here when\ntheir time is up i will get them jobs at once. i hope you will excuse\nthis long letter & all mistakes, i wish i could see you for i cant write\nas i would talk--i hope the warm weather is doing your lungs good--i was\nafraid when you was bleeding you would die--give my respects to all the\nboys and tell them how i am doing--i am doing well and every one here\ntreats me as kind as they can--Mr. Brown is going to write to you\nsometime--i hope some day you will write to me, this letter is from your\nvery true friend\n\nC---- W----\n\nwho you know as Jack Hunt.\n\nI send you Mr. Brown's card. Send my letter to him.\n\nHere was true eloquence; irresistible eloquence; and without a single\ngrace or ornament to help it out. I have seldom been so deeply stirred\nby any piece of writing. The reader of it halted, all the way through,\non a lame and broken voice; yet he had tried to fortify his feelings\nby several private readings of the letter before venturing into company\nwith it. He was practising upon me to see if there was any hope of his\nbeing able to read the document to his prayer-meeting with anything\nlike a decent command over his feelings. The result was not promising.\nHowever, he determined to risk it; and did. He got through tolerably\nwell; but his audience broke down early, and stayed in that condition to\nthe end.\n\nThe fame of the letter spread through the town. A brother minister came\nand borrowed the manuscript, put it bodily into a sermon, preached the\nsermon to twelve hundred people on a Sunday morning, and the letter\ndrowned them in their own tears. Then my friend put it into a sermon and\nwent before his Sunday morning congregation with it. It scored another\ntriumph. The house wept as one individual.\n\nMy friend went on summer vacation up into the fishing regions of our\nnorthern British neighbors, and carried this sermon with him, since he\nmight possibly chance to need a sermon. He was asked to preach, one day.\nThe little church was full. Among the people present were the late Dr.\nJ. G. Holland, the late Mr. Seymour of the 'New York Times,' Mr. Page,\nthe philanthropist and temperance advocate, and, I think, Senator Frye,\nof Maine. The marvelous letter did its wonted work; all the people were\nmoved, all the people wept; the tears flowed in a steady stream down Dr.\nHolland's cheeks, and nearly the same can be said with regard to all who\nwere there. Mr. Page was so full of enthusiasm over the letter that he\nsaid he would not rest until he made pilgrimage to that prison, and had\nspeech with the man who had been able to inspire a fellow-unfortunate to\nwrite so priceless a tract.\n\nAh, that unlucky Page!--and another man. If they had only been in\nJericho, that letter would have rung through the world and stirred all\nthe hearts of all the nations for a thousand years to come, and nobody\nmight ever have found out that it was the confoundedest, brazenest,\ningeniousest piece of fraud and humbuggery that was ever concocted to\nfool poor confiding mortals with!\n\nThe letter was a pure swindle, and that is the truth. And take it by and\nlarge, it was without a compeer among swindles. It was perfect, it was\nrounded, symmetrical, complete, colossal!\n\nThe reader learns it at this point; but we didn't learn it till some\nmiles and weeks beyond this stage of the affair. My friend came back\nfrom the woods, and he and other clergymen and lay missionaries began\nonce more to inundate audiences with their tears and the tears of\nsaid audiences; I begged hard for permission to print the letter in a\nmagazine and tell the watery story of its triumphs; numbers of people\ngot copies of the letter, with permission to circulate them in writing,\nbut not in print; copies were sent to the Sandwich Islands and other far\nregions.\n\nCharles Dudley Warner was at church, one day, when the worn letter\nwas read and wept over. At the church door, afterward, he dropped a\npeculiarly cold iceberg down the clergyman's back with the question--\n\n'Do you know that letter to be genuine?'\n\nIt was the first suspicion that had ever been voiced; but it had that\nsickening effect which first-uttered suspicions against one's idol\nalways have. Some talk followed--\n\n'Why--what should make you suspect that it isn't genuine?'\n\n'Nothing that I know of, except that it is too neat, and compact, and\nfluent, and nicely put together for an ignorant person, an unpractised\nhand. I think it was done by an educated man.'\n\nThe literary artist had detected the literary machinery. If you will\nlook at the letter now, you will detect it yourself--it is observable in\nevery line.\n\nStraightway the clergyman went off, with this seed of suspicion\nsprouting in him, and wrote to a minister residing in that town where\nWilliams had been jailed and converted; asked for light; and also asked\nif a person in the literary line (meaning me) might be allowed to print\nthe letter and tell its history. He presently received this answer--\n\nRev.--------\n\nMY dear friend,--In regard to that 'convict's letter' there can be no\ndoubt as to its genuineness. 'Williams,' to whom it was written, lay in\nour jail and professed to have been converted, and Rev. Mr.----, the\nchaplain, had great faith in the genuineness of the change--as much as\none can have in any such case.\n\nThe letter was sent to one of our ladies, who is a Sunday-school\nteacher,--sent either by Williams himself, or the chaplain of the\nState's prison, probably. She has been greatly annoyed in having so much\npublicity, lest it might seem a breach of confidence, or be an injury to\nWilliams. In regard to its publication, I can give no permission; though\nif the names and places were omitted, and especially if sent out of the\ncountry, I think you might take the responsibility and do it.\n\nIt is a wonderful letter, which no Christian genius, much less one\nunsanctified, could ever have written. As showing the work of grace in\na human heart, and in a very degraded and wicked one, it proves its own\norigin and reproves our weak faith in its power to cope with any form of\nwickedness.\n\n'Mr. Brown' of St. Louis, some one said, was a Hartford man. Do all whom\nyou send from Hartford serve their Master as well?\n\nP.S.--Williams is still in the State's prison, serving out a long\nsentence--of nine years, I think. He has been sick and threatened with\nconsumption, but I have not inquired after him lately. This lady that I\nspeak of corresponds with him, I presume, and will be quite sure to look\nafter him.\n\nThis letter arrived a few days after it was written--and up went Mr.\nWilliams's stock again. Mr. Warner's low-down suspicion was laid in the\ncold, cold grave, where it apparently belonged. It was a suspicion\nbased upon mere internal evidence, anyway; and when you come to internal\nevidence, it's a big field and a game that two can play at: as witness\nthis other internal evidence, discovered by the writer of the note above\nquoted, that 'it is a wonderful letter--which no Christian genius, much\nless one unsanctified, could ever have written.'\n\nI had permission now to print--provided I suppressed names and places\nand sent my narrative out of the country. So I chose an Australian\nmagazine for vehicle, as being far enough out of the country, and set\nmyself to work on my article. And the ministers set the pumps going\nagain, with the letter to work the handles.\n\nBut meantime Brother Page had been agitating. He had not visited the\npenitentiary, but he had sent a copy of the illustrious letter to\nthe chaplain of that institution, and accompanied it with--apparently\ninquiries. He got an answer, dated four days later than that other\nBrother's reassuring epistle; and before my article was complete, it\nwandered into my hands. The original is before me, now, and I here\nappend it. It is pretty well loaded with internal evidence of the most\nsolid description--\n\nSTATE'S PRISON, CHAPLAIN'S OFFICE, July 11, 1873.\n\n_Dear Bro. Page_,--Herewith please find the letter kindly loaned me.\nI am afraid its genuineness cannot be established. It purports to be\naddressed to some prisoner here. No such letter ever came to a prisoner\nhere. All letters received are carefully read by officers of the prison\nbefore they go into the hands of the convicts, and any such letter could\nnot be forgotten. Again, Charles Williams is not a Christian man, but a\ndissolute, cunning prodigal, whose father is a minister of the gospel.\nHis name is an assumed one. I am glad to have made your acquaintance.\nI am preparing a lecture upon life seen through prison bars, and should\nlike to deliver the same in your vicinity.\n\nAnd so ended that little drama. My poor article went into the fire;\nfor whereas the materials for it were now more abundant and infinitely\nricher than they had previously been, there were parties all around\nme, who, although longing for the publication before, were a unit\nfor suppression at this stage and complexion of the game. They said:\n'Wait--the wound is too fresh, yet.' All the copies of the famous\nletter except mine disappeared suddenly; and from that time onward, the\naforetime same old drought set in in the churches. As a rule, the town\nwas on a spacious grin for a while, but there were places in it where\nthe grin did not appear, and where it was dangerous to refer to the\nex-convict's letter.\n\nA word of explanation. 'Jack Hunt,' the professed writer of the letter,\nwas an imaginary person. The burglar Williams--Harvard graduate, son of\na minister--wrote the letter himself, to himself: got it smuggled out of\nthe prison; got it conveyed to persons who had supported and encouraged\nhim in his conversion--where he knew two things would happen: the\ngenuineness of the letter would not be doubted or inquired into; and the\nnub of it would be noticed, and would have valuable effect--the effect,\nindeed, of starting a movement to get Mr. Williams pardoned out of\nprison.\n\nThat 'nub' is so ingeniously, so casually, flung in, and immediately\nleft there in the tail of the letter, undwelt upon, that an indifferent\nreader would never suspect that it was the heart and core of the\nepistle, if he even took note of it at all, This is the 'nub'--\n\n'i hope the warm weather is doing your lungs good--_I was afraid when\nyou was bleeding you would die_--give my respects,' etc.\n\nThat is all there is of it--simply touch and go--no dwelling upon it.\nNevertheless it was intended for an eye that would be swift to see it;\nand it was meant to move a kind heart to try to effect the liberation\nof a poor reformed and purified fellow lying in the fell grip of\nconsumption.\n\nWhen I for the first time heard that letter read, nine years ago, I felt\nthat it was the most remarkable one I had ever encountered. And it\nso warmed me toward Mr. Brown of St. Louis that I said that if ever I\nvisited that city again, I would seek out that excellent man and kiss\nthe hem of his garment if it was a new one. Well, I visited St. Louis,\nbut I did not hunt for Mr. Brown; for, alas! the investigations of long\nago had proved that the benevolent Brown, like 'Jack Hunt,' was not a\nreal person, but a sheer invention of that gifted rascal, Williams--\nburglar, Harvard graduate, son of a clergyman.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 53\n\nMy Boyhood's Home\n\nWE took passage in one of the fast boats of the St. Louis and St. Paul\nPacket Company, and started up the river.\n\nWhen I, as a boy, first saw the mouth of the Missouri River, it was\ntwenty-two or twenty-three miles above St. Louis, according to the\nestimate of pilots; the wear and tear of the banks have moved it down\neight miles since then; and the pilots say that within five years the\nriver will cut through and move the mouth down five miles more, which\nwill bring it within ten miles of St. Louis.\n\nAbout nightfall we passed the large and flourishing town of Alton,\nIllinois; and before daylight next morning the town of Louisiana,\nMissouri, a sleepy village in my day, but a brisk railway center now;\nhowever, all the towns out there are railway centers now. I could not\nclearly recognize the place. This seemed odd to me, for when I retired\nfrom the rebel army in '61 I retired upon Louisiana in good order; at\nleast in good enough order for a person who had not yet learned how\nto retreat according to the rules of war, and had to trust to native\ngenius. It seemed to me that for a first attempt at a retreat it was not\nbadly done. I had done no advancing in all that campaign that was at all\nequal to it.\n\nThere was a railway bridge across the river here well sprinkled with\nglowing lights, and a very beautiful sight it was.\n\nAt seven in the morning we reached Hannibal, Missouri, where my boyhood\nwas spent. I had had a glimpse of it fifteen years ago, and another\nglimpse six years earlier, but both were so brief that they hardly\ncounted. The only notion of the town that remained in my mind was the\nmemory of it as I had known it when I first quitted it twenty-nine\nyears ago. That picture of it was still as clear and vivid to me as a\nphotograph. I stepped ashore with the feeling of one who returns out of\na dead-and-gone generation. I had a sort of realizing sense of what the\nBastille prisoners must have felt when they used to come out and look\nupon Paris after years of captivity, and note how curiously the familiar\nand the strange were mixed together before them. I saw the new houses--\nsaw them plainly enough--but they did not affect the older picture in\nmy mind, for through their solid bricks and mortar I saw the vanished\nhouses, which had formerly stood there, with perfect distinctness.\n\nIt was Sunday morning, and everybody was abed yet. So I passed through\nthe vacant streets, still seeing the town as it was, and not as it is,\nand recognizing and metaphorically shaking hands with a hundred familiar\nobjects which no longer exist; and finally climbed Holiday's Hill to get\na comprehensive view. The whole town lay spread out below me then, and I\ncould mark and fix every locality, every detail. Naturally, I was a good\ndeal moved. I said, 'Many of the people I once knew in this tranquil\nrefuge of my childhood are now in heaven; some, I trust, are in the\nother place.' The things about me and before me made me feel like a boy\nagain--convinced me that I was a boy again, and that I had simply been\ndreaming an unusually long dream; but my reflections spoiled all that;\nfor they forced me to say, 'I see fifty old houses down yonder, into\neach of which I could enter and find either a man or a woman who was a\nbaby or unborn when I noticed those houses last, or a grandmother who\nwas a plump young bride at that time.'\n\nFrom this vantage ground the extensive view up and down the river, and\nwide over the wooded expanses of Illinois, is very beautiful--one of the\nmost beautiful on the Mississippi, I think; which is a hazardous remark\nto make, for the eight hundred miles of river between St. Louis and St.\nPaul afford an unbroken succession of lovely pictures. It may be that\nmy affection for the one in question biases my judgment in its favor; I\ncannot say as to that. No matter, it was satisfyingly beautiful to me,\nand it had this advantage over all the other friends whom I was about\nto greet again: it had suffered no change; it was as young and fresh\nand comely and gracious as ever it had been; whereas, the faces of the\nothers would be old, and scarred with the campaigns of life, and marked\nwith their griefs and defeats, and would give me no upliftings of\nspirit.\n\nAn old gentleman, out on an early morning walk, came along, and we\ndiscussed the weather, and then drifted into other matters. I could not\nremember his face. He said he had been living here twenty-eight years.\nSo he had come after my time, and I had never seen him before. I asked\nhim various questions; first about a mate of mine in Sunday school--what\nbecame of him?\n\n'He graduated with honor in an Eastern college, wandered off into the\nworld somewhere, succeeded at nothing, passed out of knowledge and\nmemory years ago, and is supposed to have gone to the dogs.'\n\n'He was bright, and promised well when he was a boy.'\n\n'Yes, but the thing that happened is what became of it all.'\n\nI asked after another lad, altogether the brightest in our village\nschool when I was a boy.\n\n'He, too, was graduated with honors, from an Eastern college; but life\nwhipped him in every battle, straight along, and he died in one of the\nTerritories, years ago, a defeated man.'\n\nI asked after another of the bright boys.\n\n'He is a success, always has been, always will be, I think.'\n\nI inquired after a young fellow who came to the town to study for one of\nthe professions when I was a boy.\n\n'He went at something else before he got through--went from medicine to\nlaw, or from law to medicine--then to some other new thing; went away\nfor a year, came back with a young wife; fell to drinking, then to\ngambling behind the door; finally took his wife and two young children\nto her father's, and went off to Mexico; went from bad to worse, and\nfinally died there, without a cent to buy a shroud, and without a friend\nto attend the funeral.'\n\n'Pity, for he was the best-natured, and most cheery and hopeful young\nfellow that ever was.'\n\nI named another boy.\n\n'Oh, he is all right. Lives here yet; has a wife and children, and is\nprospering.'\n\nSame verdict concerning other boys.\n\nI named three school-girls.\n\n'The first two live here, are married and have children; the other is\nlong ago dead--never married.'\n\nI named, with emotion, one of my early sweethearts.\n\n'She is all right. Been married three times; buried two husbands,\ndivorced from the third, and I hear she is getting ready to marry an old\nfellow out in Colorado somewhere. She's got children scattered around\nhere and there, most everywheres.'\n\nThe answer to several other inquiries was brief and simple--\n\n'Killed in the war.'\n\nI named another boy.\n\n'Well, now, his case is curious! There wasn't a human being in this town\nbut knew that that boy was a perfect chucklehead; perfect dummy; just\na stupid ass, as you may say. Everybody knew it, and everybody said it.\nWell, if that very boy isn't the first lawyer in the State of Missouri\nto-day, I'm a Democrat!'\n\n'Is that so?'\n\n'It's actually so. I'm telling you the truth.'\n\n'How do you account for it?'\n\n'Account for it? There ain't any accounting for it, except that if you\nsend a damned fool to St. Louis, and you don't tell them he's a damned\nfool they'll never find it out. There's one thing sure--if I had a\ndamned fool I should know what to do with him: ship him to St. Louis--\nit's the noblest market in the world for that kind of property. Well,\nwhen you come to look at it all around, and chew at it and think it\nover, don't it just bang anything you ever heard of?'\n\n'Well, yes, it does seem to. But don't you think maybe it was the\nHannibal people who were mistaken about the boy, and not the St. Louis\npeople.'\n\n'Oh, nonsense! The people here have known him from the very cradle--\nthey knew him a hundred times better than the St. Louis idiots could\nhave known him. No, if you have got any damned fools that you want to\nrealize on, take my advice--send them to St. Louis.'\n\nI mentioned a great number of people whom I had formerly known. Some\nwere dead, some were gone away, some had prospered, some had come\nto naught; but as regarded a dozen or so of the lot, the answer was\ncomforting:\n\n'Prosperous--live here yet--town littered with their children.'\n\nI asked about Miss----.\n\nDied in the insane asylum three or four years ago--never was out of it\nfrom the time she went in; and was always suffering, too; never got a\nshred of her mind back.'\n\nIf he spoke the truth, here was a heavy tragedy, indeed. Thirty-six\nyears in a madhouse, that some young fools might have some fun! I was\na small boy, at the time; and I saw those giddy young ladies come\ntiptoeing into the room where Miss ---- sat reading at midnight by a\nlamp. The girl at the head of the file wore a shroud and a doughface,\nshe crept behind the victim, touched her on the shoulder, and she looked\nup and screamed, and then fell into convulsions. She did not recover\nfrom the fright, but went mad. In these days it seems incredible that\npeople believed in ghosts so short a time ago. But they did.\n\nAfter asking after such other folk as I could call to mind, I finally\ninquired about _myself_:\n\n'Oh, he succeeded well enough--another case of damned fool. If they'd\nsent him to St. Louis, he'd have succeeded sooner.'\n\nIt was with much satisfaction that I recognized the wisdom of having\ntold this candid gentleman, in the beginning, that my name was Smith.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 54\n\nPast and Present\n\nBeing left to myself, up there, I went on picking out old houses in the\ndistant town, and calling back their former inmates out of the moldy\npast. Among them I presently recognized the house of the father of Lem\nHackett (fictitious name). It carried me back more than a generation in\na moment, and landed me in the midst of a time when the happenings of\nlife were not the natural and logical results of great general laws,\nbut of special orders, and were freighted with very precise and distinct\npurposes--partly punitive in intent, partly admonitory; and usually\nlocal in application.\n\nWhen I was a small boy, Lem Hackett was drowned--on a Sunday. He fell\nout of an empty flat-boat, where he was playing. Being loaded with sin,\nhe went to the bottom like an anvil. He was the only boy in the village\nwho slept that night. We others all lay awake, repenting. We had not\nneeded the information, delivered from the pulpit that evening, that\nLem's was a case of special judgment--we knew that, already. There was\na ferocious thunder-storm, that night, and it raged continuously until\nnear dawn. The winds blew, the windows rattled, the rain swept along\nthe roof in pelting sheets, and at the briefest of intervals the inky\nblackness of the night vanished, the houses over the way glared out\nwhite and blinding for a quivering instant, then the solid darkness shut\ndown again and a splitting peal of thunder followed, which seemed to\nrend everything in the neighborhood to shreds and splinters. I sat up\nin bed quaking and shuddering, waiting for the destruction of the world,\nand expecting it. To me there was nothing strange or incongruous in\nheaven's making such an uproar about Lem Hackett. Apparently it was the\nright and proper thing to do. Not a doubt entered my mind that all the\nangels were grouped together, discussing this boy's case and observing\nthe awful bombardment of our beggarly little village with satisfaction\nand approval. There was one thing which disturbed me in the most serious\nway; that was the thought that this centering of the celestial interest\non our village could not fail to attract the attention of the observers\nto people among us who might otherwise have escaped notice for years.\nI felt that I was not only one of those people, but the very one most\nlikely to be discovered. That discovery could have but one result: I\nshould be in the fire with Lem before the chill of the river had been\nfairly warmed out of him. I knew that this would be only just and fair.\nI was increasing the chances against myself all the time, by feeling a\nsecret bitterness against Lem for having attracted this fatal attention\nto me, but I could not help it--this sinful thought persisted in\ninfesting my breast in spite of me. Every time the lightning glared\nI caught my breath, and judged I was gone. In my terror and misery, I\nmeanly began to suggest other boys, and mention acts of theirs which\nwere wickeder than mine, and peculiarly needed punishment--and I tried\nto pretend to myself that I was simply doing this in a casual way, and\nwithout intent to divert the heavenly attention to them for the purpose\nof getting rid of it myself. With deep sagacity I put these\nmentions into the form of sorrowing recollections and left-handed\nsham-supplications that the sins of those boys might be allowed to pass\nunnoticed--'Possibly they may repent.' 'It is true that Jim Smith broke\na window and lied about it--but maybe he did not mean any harm. And\nalthough Tom Holmes says more bad words than any other boy in the\nvillage, he probably intends to repent--though he has never said he\nwould. And whilst it is a fact that John Jones did fish a little on\nSunday, once, he didn't really catch anything but only just one small\nuseless mud-cat; and maybe that wouldn't have been so awful if he had\nthrown it back--as he says he did, but he didn't. Pity but they would\nrepent of these dreadful things--and maybe they will yet.'\n\nBut while I was shamefully trying to draw attention to these poor\nchaps--who were doubtless directing the celestial attention to me at the\nsame moment, though I never once suspected that--I had heedlessly\nleft my candle burning. It was not a time to neglect even trifling\nprecautions. There was no occasion to add anything to the facilities for\nattracting notice to me--so I put the light out.\n\nIt was a long night to me, and perhaps the most distressful one I\never spent. I endured agonies of remorse for sins which I knew I had\ncommitted, and for others which I was not certain about, yet was sure\nthat they had been set down against me in a book by an angel who was\nwiser than I and did not trust such important matters to memory.\nIt struck me, by and by, that I had been making a most foolish and\ncalamitous mistake, in one respect: doubtless I had not only made my\nown destruction sure by directing attention to those other boys, but had\nalready accomplished theirs!--Doubtless the lightning had stretched them\nall dead in their beds by this time! The anguish and the fright which\nthis thought gave me made my previous sufferings seem trifling by\ncomparison.\n\nThings had become truly serious. I resolved to turn over a new leaf\ninstantly; I also resolved to connect myself with the church the next\nday, if I survived to see its sun appear. I resolved to cease from sin\nin all its forms, and to lead a high and blameless life for ever after.\nI would be punctual at church and Sunday-school; visit the sick;\ncarry baskets of victuals to the poor (simply to fulfil the regulation\nconditions, although I knew we had none among us so poor but they would\nsmash the basket over my head for my pains); I would instruct other boys\nin right ways, and take the resulting trouncings meekly; I would subsist\nentirely on tracts; I would invade the rum shop and warn the drunkard--\nand finally, if I escaped the fate of those who early become too good to\nlive, I would go for a missionary.\n\nThe storm subsided toward daybreak, and I dozed gradually to sleep with\na sense of obligation to Lem Hackett for going to eternal suffering in\nthat abrupt way, and thus preventing a far more dreadful disaster--my\nown loss.\n\nBut when I rose refreshed, by and by, and found that those other boys\nwere still alive, I had a dim sense that perhaps the whole thing was\na false alarm; that the entire turmoil had been on Lem's account and\nnobody's else. The world looked so bright and safe that there did not\nseem to be any real occasion to turn over a new leaf. I was a little\nsubdued, during that day, and perhaps the next; after that, my purpose\nof reforming slowly dropped out of my mind, and I had a peaceful,\ncomfortable time again, until the next storm.\n\nThat storm came about three weeks later; and it was the most\nunaccountable one, to me, that I had ever experienced; for on the\nafternoon of that day, 'Dutchy' was drowned. Dutchy belonged to our\nSunday-school. He was a German lad who did not know enough to come in\nout of the rain; but he was exasperatingly good, and had a prodigious\nmemory. One Sunday he made himself the envy of all the youth and the\ntalk of all the admiring village, by reciting three thousand verses of\nScripture without missing a word; then he went off the very next day and\ngot drowned.\n\nCircumstances gave to his death a peculiar impressiveness. We were all\nbathing in a muddy creek which had a deep hole in it, and in this hole\nthe coopers had sunk a pile of green hickory hoop poles to soak, some\ntwelve feet under water. We were diving and 'seeing who could stay under\nlongest.' We managed to remain down by holding on to the hoop poles.\nDutchy made such a poor success of it that he was hailed with laughter\nand derision every time his head appeared above water. At last he seemed\nhurt with the taunts, and begged us to stand still on the bank and be\nfair with him and give him an honest count--'be friendly and kind just\nthis once, and not miscount for the sake of having the fun of laughing\nat him.' Treacherous winks were exchanged, and all said 'All right,\nDutchy--go ahead, we'll play fair.'\n\nDutchy plunged in, but the boys, instead of beginning to count, followed\nthe lead of one of their number and scampered to a range of blackberry\nbushes close by and hid behind it. They imagined Dutchy's humiliation,\nwhen he should rise after a superhuman effort and find the place silent\nand vacant, nobody there to applaud. They were 'so full of laugh' with\nthe idea, that they were continually exploding into muffled cackles.\nTime swept on, and presently one who was peeping through the briers,\nsaid, with surprise--\n\n'Why, he hasn't come up, yet!'\n\nThe laughing stopped.\n\n'Boys, it 's a splendid dive,' said one.\n\n'Never mind that,' said another, 'the joke on him is all the better for\nit.'\n\nThere was a remark or two more, and then a pause. Talking ceased, and\nall began to peer through the vines. Before long, the boys' faces\nbegan to look uneasy, then anxious, then terrified. Still there was no\nmovement of the placid water. Hearts began to beat fast, and faces\nto turn pale. We all glided out, silently, and stood on the bank, our\nhorrified eyes wandering back and forth from each other's countenances\nto the water.\n\n'Somebody must go down and see!'\n\nYes, that was plain; but nobody wanted that grisly task.\n\n'Draw straws!'\n\nSo we did--with hands which shook so, that we hardly knew what we were\nabout. The lot fell to me, and I went down. The water was so muddy I\ncould not see anything, but I felt around among the hoop poles, and\npresently grasped a limp wrist which gave me no response--and if it\nhad I should not have known it, I let it go with such a frightened\nsuddenness.\n\nThe boy had been caught among the hoop poles and entangled there,\nhelplessly. I fled to the surface and told the awful news. Some of\nus knew that if the boy were dragged out at once he might possibly\nbe resuscitated, but we never thought of that. We did not think of\nanything; we did not know what to do, so we did nothing--except that the\nsmaller lads cried, piteously, and we all struggled frantically into\nour clothes, putting on anybody's that came handy, and getting them\nwrong-side-out and upside-down, as a rule. Then we scurried away and\ngave the alarm, but none of us went back to see the end of the tragedy.\nWe had a more important thing to attend to: we all flew home, and lost\nnot a moment in getting ready to lead a better life.\n\nThe night presently closed down. Then came on that tremendous and\nutterly unaccountable storm. I was perfectly dazed; I could not\nunderstand it. It seemed to me that there must be some mistake. The\nelements were turned loose, and they rattled and banged and blazed away\nin the most blind and frantic manner. All heart and hope went out of\nme, and the dismal thought kept floating through my brain, 'If a boy who\nknows three thousand verses by heart is not satisfactory, what chance is\nthere for anybody else?'\n\nOf course I never questioned for a moment that the storm was on Dutchy's\naccount, or that he or any other inconsequential animal was worthy of\nsuch a majestic demonstration from on high; the lesson of it was the\nonly thing that troubled me; for it convinced me that if Dutchy, with\nall his perfections, was not a delight, it would be vain for me to turn\nover a new leaf, for I must infallibly fall hopelessly short of that\nboy, no matter how hard I might try. Nevertheless I did turn it over--a\nhighly educated fear compelled me to do that--but succeeding days of\ncheerfulness and sunshine came bothering around, and within a month\nI had so drifted backward that again I was as lost and comfortable as\never.\n\nBreakfast time approached while I mused these musings and called these\nancient happenings back to mind; so I got me back into the present and\nwent down the hill.\n\nOn my way through town to the hotel, I saw the house which was my home\nwhen I was a boy. At present rates, the people who now occupy it are of\nno more value than I am; but in my time they would have been worth not\nless than five hundred dollars apiece. They are colored folk.\n\nAfter breakfast, I went out alone again, intending to hunt up some of\nthe Sunday-schools and see how this generation of pupils might compare\nwith their progenitors who had sat with me in those places and had\nprobably taken me as a model--though I do not remember as to that now.\nBy the public square there had been in my day a shabby little brick\nchurch called the 'Old Ship of Zion,' which I had attended as a\nSunday-school scholar; and I found the locality easily enough, but not\nthe old church; it was gone, and a trig and rather hilarious new edifice\nwas in its place. The pupils were better dressed and better looking\nthan were those of my time; consequently they did not resemble their\nancestors; and consequently there was nothing familiar to me in their\nfaces. Still, I contemplated them with a deep interest and a yearning\nwistfulness, and if I had been a girl I would have cried; for they were\nthe offspring, and represented, and occupied the places, of boys and\ngirls some of whom I had loved to love, and some of whom I had loved to\nhate, but all of whom were dear to me for the one reason or the other,\nso many years gone by--and, Lord, where be they now!\n\nI was mightily stirred, and would have been grateful to be allowed to\nremain unmolested and look my fill; but a bald-summited superintendent\nwho had been a tow-headed Sunday-school mate of mine on that spot in the\nearly ages, recognized me, and I talked a flutter of wild nonsense to\nthose children to hide the thoughts which were in me, and which could\nnot have been spoken without a betrayal of feeling that would have been\nrecognized as out of character with me.\n\nMaking speeches without preparation is no gift of mine; and I was\nresolved to shirk any new opportunity, but in the next and larger\nSunday-school I found myself in the rear of the assemblage; so I was\nvery willing to go on the platform a moment for the sake of getting a\ngood look at the scholars. On the spur of the moment I could not recall\nany of the old idiotic talks which visitors used to insult me with when\nI was a pupil there; and I was sorry for this, since it would have given\nme time and excuse to dawdle there and take a long and satisfying look\nat what I feel at liberty to say was an array of fresh young comeliness\nnot matchable in another Sunday-school of the same size. As I talked\nmerely to get a chance to inspect; and as I strung out the random\nrubbish solely to prolong the inspection, I judged it but decent to\nconfess these low motives, and I did so.\n\nIf the Model Boy was in either of these Sunday-schools, I did not see\nhim. The Model Boy of my time--we never had but the one--was perfect:\nperfect in manners, perfect in dress, perfect in conduct, perfect in\nfilial piety, perfect in exterior godliness; but at bottom he was a\nprig; and as for the contents of his skull, they could have changed\nplace with the contents of a pie and nobody would have been the worse\noff for it but the pie. This fellow's reproachlessness was a standing\nreproach to every lad in the village. He was the admiration of all the\nmothers, and the detestation of all their sons. I was told what became\nof him, but as it was a disappointment to me, I will not enter into\ndetails. He succeeded in life.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 55\n\nA Vendetta and Other Things\n\nDURING my three days' stay in the town, I woke up every morning with the\nimpression that I was a boy--for in my dreams the faces were all young\nagain, and looked as they had looked in the old times--but I went to bed\na hundred years old, every night--for meantime I had been seeing those\nfaces as they are now.\n\nOf course I suffered some surprises, along at first, before I had become\nadjusted to the changed state of things. I met young ladies who did not\nseem to have changed at all; but they turned out to be the daughters of\nthe young ladies I had in mind--sometimes their grand-daughters. When\nyou are told that a stranger of fifty is a grandmother, there is nothing\nsurprising about it; but if, on the contrary, she is a person whom you\nknew as a little girl, it seems impossible. You say to yourself, 'How\ncan a little girl be a grandmother.' It takes some little time to accept\nand realize the fact that while you have been growing old, your friends\nhave not been standing still, in that matter.\n\nI noticed that the greatest changes observable were with the women, not\nthe men. I saw men whom thirty years had changed but slightly; but their\nwives had grown old. These were good women; it is very wearing to be\ngood.\n\nThere was a saddler whom I wished to see; but he was gone. Dead, these\nmany years, they said. Once or twice a day, the saddler used to go\ntearing down the street, putting on his coat as he went; and then\neverybody knew a steamboat was coming. Everybody knew, also, that John\nStavely was not expecting anybody by the boat--or any freight, either;\nand Stavely must have known that everybody knew this, still it made no\ndifference to him; he liked to seem to himself to be expecting a hundred\nthousand tons of saddles by this boat, and so he went on all his life,\nenjoying being faithfully on hand to receive and receipt for those\nsaddles, in case by any miracle they should come. A malicious Quincy\npaper used always to refer to this town, in derision as 'Stavely's\nLanding.' Stavely was one of my earliest admirations; I envied him his\nrush of imaginary business, and the display he was able to make of it,\nbefore strangers, as he went flying down the street struggling with his\nfluttering coat.\n\nBut there was a carpenter who was my chiefest hero. He was a mighty\nliar, but I did not know that; I believed everything he said. He was a\nromantic, sentimental, melodramatic fraud, and his bearing impressed\nme with awe. I vividly remember the first time he took me into his\nconfidence. He was planing a board, and every now and then he would\npause and heave a deep sigh; and occasionally mutter broken sentences--\nconfused and not intelligible--but out of their midst an ejaculation\nsometimes escaped which made me shiver and did me good: one was, 'O God,\nit is his blood!' I sat on the tool-chest and humbly and shudderingly\nadmired him; for I judged he was full of crime. At last he said in a low\nvoice--\n\n'My little friend, can you keep a secret?'\n\nI eagerly said I could.\n\n'A dark and dreadful one?'\n\nI satisfied him on that point.\n\n'Then I will tell you some passages in my history; for oh, I _must\n_relieve my burdened soul, or I shall die!'\n\nHe cautioned me once more to be 'as silent as the grave;' then he told\nme he was a 'red-handed murderer.' He put down his plane, held his hands\nout before him, contemplated them sadly, and said--\n\n'Look--with these hands I have taken the lives of thirty human beings!'\n\nThe effect which this had upon me was an inspiration to him, and he\nturned himself loose upon his subject with interest and energy. He\nleft generalizing, and went into details,--began with his first murder;\ndescribed it, told what measures he had taken to avert suspicion; then\npassed to his second homicide, his third, his fourth, and so on. He had\nalways done his murders with a bowie-knife, and he made all my hairs\nrise by suddenly snatching it out and showing it to me.\n\nAt the end of this first seance I went home with six of his fearful\nsecrets among my freightage, and found them a great help to my dreams,\nwhich had been sluggish for a while back. I sought him again and again,\non my Saturday holidays; in fact I spent the summer with him--all of\nit which was valuable to me. His fascinations never diminished, for\nhe threw something fresh and stirring, in the way of horror, into each\nsuccessive murder. He always gave names, dates, places--everything. This\nby and by enabled me to note two things: that he had killed his victims\nin every quarter of the globe, and that these victims were always named\nLynch. The destruction of the Lynches went serenely on, Saturday after\nSaturday, until the original thirty had multiplied to sixty--and more to\nbe heard from yet; then my curiosity got the better of my timidity, and\nI asked how it happened that these justly punished persons all bore the\nsame name.\n\nMy hero said he had never divulged that dark secret to any living being;\nbut felt that he could trust me, and therefore he would lay bare before\nme the story of his sad and blighted life. He had loved one 'too fair\nfor earth,' and she had reciprocated 'with all the sweet affection of\nher pure and noble nature.' But he had a rival, a 'base hireling' named\nArchibald Lynch, who said the girl should be his, or he would 'dye his\nhands in her heart's best blood.' The carpenter, 'innocent and happy\nin love's young dream,' gave no weight to the threat, but led his\n'golden-haired darling to the altar,' and there, the two were made one;\nthere also, just as the minister's hands were stretched in blessing over\ntheir heads, the fell deed was done--with a knife--and the bride fell\na corpse at her husband's feet. And what did the husband do? He plucked\nforth that knife, and kneeling by the body of his lost one, swore to\n'consecrate his life to the extermination of all the human scum that\nbear the hated name of Lynch.'\n\nThat was it. He had been hunting down the Lynches and slaughtering\nthem, from that day to this--twenty years. He had always used that same\nconsecrated knife; with it he had murdered his long array of Lynches,\nand with it he had left upon the forehead of each victim a peculiar\nmark--a cross, deeply incised. Said he--\n\n'The cross of the Mysterious Avenger is known in Europe, in America,\nin China, in Siam, in the Tropics, in the Polar Seas, in the deserts of\nAsia, in all the earth. Wherever in the uttermost parts of the globe,\na Lynch has penetrated, there has the Mysterious Cross been seen, and\nthose who have seen it have shuddered and said, “It is his mark, he has\nbeen here.” You have heard of the Mysterious Avenger--look upon him, for\nbefore you stands no less a person! But beware--breathe not a word to\nany soul. Be silent, and wait. Some morning this town will flock aghast\nto view a gory corpse; on its brow will be seen the awful sign, and\nmen will tremble and whisper, “He has been here--it is the Mysterious\nAvenger's mark!” You will come here, but I shall have vanished; you will\nsee me no more.'\n\nThis ass had been reading the 'Jibbenainosay,' no doubt, and had had\nhis poor romantic head turned by it; but as I had not yet seen the book\nthen, I took his inventions for truth, and did not suspect that he was a\nplagiarist.\n\nHowever, we had a Lynch living in the town; and the more I reflected\nupon his impending doom, the more I could not sleep. It seemed my plain\nduty to save him, and a still plainer and more important duty to get\nsome sleep for myself, so at last I ventured to go to Mr. Lynch and tell\nhim what was about to happen to him--under strict secrecy. I advised him\nto 'fly,' and certainly expected him to do it. But he laughed at me; and\nhe did not stop there; he led me down to the carpenter's shop, gave the\ncarpenter a jeering and scornful lecture upon his silly pretensions,\nslapped his face, made him get down on his knees and beg--then went off\nand left me to contemplate the cheap and pitiful ruin of what, in my\neyes, had so lately been a majestic and incomparable hero.\n\nThe carpenter blustered, flourished his knife, and doomed this Lynch in\nhis usual volcanic style, the size of his fateful words undiminished;\nbut it was all wasted upon me; he was a hero to me no longer, but only\na poor, foolish, exposed humbug. I was ashamed of him, and ashamed of\nmyself; I took no further interest in him, and never went to his shop\nany more. He was a heavy loss to me, for he was the greatest hero I\nhad ever known. The fellow must have had some talent; for some of his\nimaginary murders were so vividly and dramatically described that I\nremember all their details yet.\n\nThe people of Hannibal are not more changed than is the town. It is\nno longer a village; it is a city, with a mayor, and a council, and\nwater-works, and probably a debt. It has fifteen thousand people, is a\nthriving and energetic place, and is paved like the rest of the west\nand south--where a well-paved street and a good sidewalk are things so\nseldom seen, that one doubts them when he does see them. The customary\nhalf-dozen railways center in Hannibal now, and there is a new depot\nwhich cost a hundred thousand dollars. In my time the town had no\nspecialty, and no commercial grandeur; the daily packet usually landed\na passenger and bought a catfish, and took away another passenger and a\nhatful of freight; but now a huge commerce in lumber has grown up and\na large miscellaneous commerce is one of the results. A deal of money\nchanges hands there now.\n\nBear Creek--so called, perhaps, because it was always so particularly\nbare of bears--is hidden out of sight now, under islands and continents\nof piled lumber, and nobody but an expert can find it. I used to get\ndrowned in it every summer regularly, and be drained out, and inflated\nand set going again by some chance enemy; but not enough of it is\nunoccupied now to drown a person in. It was a famous breeder of chills\nand fever in its day. I remember one summer when everybody in town had\nthis disease at once. Many chimneys were shaken down, and all the houses\nwere so racked that the town had to be rebuilt. The chasm or gorge\nbetween Lover's Leap and the hill west of it is supposed by scientists\nto have been caused by glacial action. This is a mistake.\n\nThere is an interesting cave a mile or two below Hannibal, among the\nbluffs. I would have liked to revisit it, but had not time. In my\ntime the person who then owned it turned it into a mausoleum for his\ndaughter, aged fourteen. The body of this poor child was put into a\ncopper cylinder filled with alcohol, and this was suspended in one of\nthe dismal avenues of the cave. The top of the cylinder was removable;\nand it was said to be a common thing for the baser order of tourists to\ndrag the dead face into view and examine it and comment upon it.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 56\n\nA Question of Law\n\nTHE slaughter-house is gone from the mouth of Bear Creek and so is the\nsmall jail (or 'calaboose') which once stood in its neighborhood. A\ncitizen asked, 'Do you remember when Jimmy Finn, the town drunkard, was\nburned to death in the calaboose?'\n\nObserve, now, how history becomes defiled, through lapse of time and\nthe help of the bad memories of men. Jimmy Finn was not burned in the\ncalaboose, but died a natural death in a tan vat, of a combination of\ndelirium tremens and spontaneous combustion. When I say natural death, I\nmean it was a natural death for Jimmy Finn to die. The calaboose victim\nwas not a citizen; he was a poor stranger, a harmless whiskey-sodden\ntramp. I know more about his case than anybody else; I knew too much\nof it, in that bygone day, to relish speaking of it. That tramp was\nwandering about the streets one chilly evening, with a pipe in his\nmouth, and begging for a match; he got neither matches nor courtesy; on\nthe contrary, a troop of bad little boys followed him around and amused\nthemselves with nagging and annoying him. I assisted; but at last, some\nappeal which the wayfarer made for forbearance, accompanying it with a\npathetic reference to his forlorn and friendless condition, touched such\nsense of shame and remnant of right feeling as were left in me, and I\nwent away and got him some matches, and then hied me home and to bed,\nheavily weighted as to conscience, and unbuoyant in spirit. An hour or\ntwo afterward, the man was arrested and locked up in the calaboose by\nthe marshal--large name for a constable, but that was his title. At two\nin the morning, the church bells rang for fire, and everybody turned\nout, of course--I with the rest. The tramp had used his matches\ndisastrously: he had set his straw bed on fire, and the oaken sheathing\nof the room had caught. When I reached the ground, two hundred men,\nwomen, and children stood massed together, transfixed with horror, and\nstaring at the grated windows of the jail. Behind the iron bars, and\ntugging frantically at them, and screaming for help, stood the tramp; he\nseemed like a black object set against a sun, so white and intense was\nthe light at his back. That marshal could not be found, and he had the\nonly key. A battering-ram was quickly improvised, and the thunder of its\nblows upon the door had so encouraging a sound that the spectators broke\ninto wild cheering, and believed the merciful battle won. But it was not\nso. The timbers were too strong; they did not yield. It was said that\nthe man's death-grip still held fast to the bars after he was dead; and\nthat in this position the fires wrapped him about and consumed him. As\nto this, I do not know. What was seen after I recognized the face that\nwas pleading through the bars was seen by others, not by me.\n\nI saw that face, so situated, every night for a long time afterward; and\nI believed myself as guilty of the man's death as if I had given him the\nmatches purposely that he might burn himself up with them. I had not a\ndoubt that I should be hanged if my connection with this tragedy were\nfound out. The happenings and the impressions of that time are burnt\ninto my memory, and the study of them entertains me as much now as they\nthemselves distressed me then. If anybody spoke of that grisly matter,\nI was all ears in a moment, and alert to hear what might be said, for I\nwas always dreading and expecting to find out that I was suspected; and\nso fine and so delicate was the perception of my guilty conscience,\nthat it often detected suspicion in the most purposeless remarks, and in\nlooks, gestures, glances of the eye which had no significance, but which\nsent me shivering away in a panic of fright, just the same. And how sick\nit made me when somebody dropped, howsoever carelessly and barren of\nintent, the remark that 'murder will out!' For a boy of ten years, I was\ncarrying a pretty weighty cargo.\n\nAll this time I was blessedly forgetting one thing--the fact that I was\nan inveterate talker in my sleep. But one night I awoke and found my\nbed-mate--my younger brother--sitting up in bed and contemplating me by\nthe light of the moon. I said--\n\n'What is the matter?'\n\n'You talk so much I can't sleep.'\n\nI came to a sitting posture in an instant, with my kidneys in my throat\nand my hair on end.\n\n'What did I say. Quick--out with it--what did I say?'\n\n'Nothing much.'\n\n'It's a lie--you know everything.'\n\n'Everything about what?'\n\n'You know well enough. About _that_.'\n\n'About _what_?--I don't know what you are talking about. I think you are\nsick or crazy or something. But anyway, you're awake, and I'll get to\nsleep while I've got a chance.'\n\nHe fell asleep and I lay there in a cold sweat, turning this new terror\nover in the whirling chaos which did duty as my mind. The burden of\nmy thought was, How much did I divulge? How much does he know?--what a\ndistress is this uncertainty! But by and by I evolved an idea--I would\nwake my brother and probe him with a supposititious case. I shook him\nup, and said--\n\n'Suppose a man should come to you drunk--'\n\n'This is foolish--I never get drunk.'\n\n'I don't mean you, idiot--I mean the man. Suppose a _man _should come\nto you drunk, and borrow a knife, or a tomahawk, or a pistol, and you\nforgot to tell him it was loaded, and--'\n\n'How could you load a tomahawk?'\n\n'I don't mean the tomahawk, and I didn't say the tomahawk; I said\nthe pistol. Now don't you keep breaking in that way, because this is\nserious. There's been a man killed.'\n\n'What! in this town?'\n\n'Yes, in this town.'\n\n'Well, go on--I won't say a single word.'\n\n'Well, then, suppose you forgot to tell him to be careful with it,\nbecause it was loaded, and he went off and shot himself with that\npistol--fooling with it, you know, and probably doing it by accident,\nbeing drunk. Well, would it be murder?'\n\n'No--suicide.'\n\n'No, no. I don't mean _his _act, I mean yours: would you be a murderer\nfor letting him have that pistol?'\n\nAfter deep thought came this answer--\n\n'Well, I should think I was guilty of something--maybe murder--yes,\nprobably murder, but I don't quite know.'\n\nThis made me very uncomfortable. However, it was not a decisive verdict.\nI should have to set out the real case--there seemed to be no other\nway. But I would do it cautiously, and keep a watch out for suspicious\neffects. I said--\n\n'I was supposing a case, but I am coming to the real one now. Do you\nknow how the man came to be burned up in the calaboose?'\n\n'No.'\n\n'Haven't you the least idea?'\n\n'Not the least.'\n\n'Wish you may die in your tracks if you have?'\n\n'Yes, wish I may die in my tracks.'\n\n'Well, the way of it was this. The man wanted some matches to light his\npipe. A boy got him some. The man set fire to the calaboose with those\nvery matches, and burnt himself up.'\n\n'Is that so?'\n\n'Yes, it is. Now, is that boy a murderer, do you think?'\n\n'Let me see. The man was drunk?'\n\n'Yes, he was drunk.'\n\n'Very drunk?'\n\n'Yes.'\n\n'And the boy knew it?'\n\n'Yes, he knew it.'\n\nThere was a long pause. Then came this heavy verdict--\n\n'If the man was drunk, and the boy knew it, the boy murdered that man.\nThis is certain.'\n\nFaint, sickening sensations crept along all the fibers of my body, and\nI seemed to know how a person feels who hears his death sentence\npronounced from the bench. I waited to hear what my brother would say\nnext. I believed I knew what it would be, and I was right. He said--\n\n'I know the boy.'\n\nI had nothing to say; so I said nothing. I simply shuddered. Then he\nadded--\n\n'Yes, before you got half through telling about the thing, I knew\nperfectly well who the boy was; it was Ben Coontz!'\n\nI came out of my collapse as one who rises from the dead. I said, with\nadmiration--\n\n'Why, how in the world did you ever guess it?'\n\n'You told it in your sleep.'\n\nI said to myself, 'How splendid that is! This is a habit which must be\ncultivated.'\n\nMy brother rattled innocently on--\n\n'When you were talking in your sleep, you kept mumbling something about\n“matches,” which I couldn't make anything out of; but just now, when\nyou began to tell me about the man and the calaboose and the matches,\nI remembered that in your sleep you mentioned Ben Coontz two or three\ntimes; so I put this and that together, you see, and right away I knew\nit was Ben that burnt that man up.'\n\nI praised his sagacity effusively. Presently he asked--\n\n'Are you going to give him up to the law?'\n\n'No,' I said; 'I believe that this will be a lesson to him. I shall keep\nan eye on him, of course, for that is but right; but if he stops where\nhe is and reforms, it shall never be said that I betrayed him.'\n\n'How good you are!'\n\n'Well, I try to be. It is all a person can do in a world like this.'\n\nAnd now, my burden being shifted to other shoulders, my terrors soon\nfaded away.\n\nThe day before we left Hannibal, a curious thing fell under my\nnotice--the surprising spread which longitudinal time undergoes there.\nI learned it from one of the most unostentatious of men--the colored\ncoachman of a friend of mine, who lives three miles from town. He was\nto call for me at the Park Hotel at 7.30 P.M., and drive me out. But he\nmissed it considerably--did not arrive till ten. He excused himself by\nsaying--\n\n'De time is mos' an hour en a half slower in de country en what it is in\nde town; you'll be in plenty time, boss. Sometimes we shoves out early\nfor church, Sunday, en fetches up dah right plum in de middle er de\nsermon. Diffunce in de time. A body can't make no calculations 'bout\nit.'\n\nI had lost two hours and a half; but I had learned a fact worth four.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 57\n\nAn Archangel\n\nFROM St. Louis northward there are all the enlivening signs of the\npresence of active, energetic, intelligent, prosperous, practical\nnineteenth-century populations. The people don't dream, they work. The\nhappy result is manifest all around in the substantial outside aspect\nof things, and the suggestions of wholesome life and comfort that\neverywhere appear.\n\nQuincy is a notable example--a brisk, handsome, well-ordered city; and\nnow, as formerly, interested in art, letters, and other high things.\n\nBut Marion City is an exception. Marion City has gone backwards in\na most unaccountable way. This metropolis promised so well that the\nprojectors tacked 'city' to its name in the very beginning, with full\nconfidence; but it was bad prophecy. When I first saw Marion City,\nthirty-five years ago, it contained one street, and nearly or quite six\nhouses. It contains but one house now, and this one, in a state of ruin,\nis getting ready to follow the former five into the river. Doubtless\nMarion City was too near to Quincy. It had another disadvantage: it was\nsituated in a flat mud bottom, below high-water mark, whereas Quincy\nstands high up on the slope of a hill.\n\nIn the beginning Quincy had the aspect and ways of a model New England\ntown: and these she has yet: broad, clean streets, trim, neat dwellings\nand lawns, fine mansions, stately blocks of commercial buildings. And\nthere are ample fair-grounds, a well kept park, and many attractive\ndrives; library, reading-rooms, a couple of colleges, some handsome and\ncostly churches, and a grand court-house, with grounds which occupy a\nsquare. The population of the city is thirty thousand. There are some\nlarge factories here, and manufacturing, of many sorts, is done on a\ngreat scale.\n\nLa Grange and Canton are growing towns, but I missed Alexandria; was\ntold it was under water, but would come up to blow in the summer.\n\nKeokuk was easily recognizable. I lived there in 1857--an extraordinary\nyear there in real-estate matters. The 'boom' was something wonderful.\nEverybody bought, everybody sold--except widows and preachers; they\nalways hold on; and when the tide ebbs, they get left. Anything in the\nsemblance of a town lot, no matter how situated, was salable, and at a\nfigure which would still have been high if the ground had been sodded\nwith greenbacks.\n\nThe town has a population of fifteen thousand now, and is progressing\nwith a healthy growth. It was night, and we could not see details, for\nwhich we were sorry, for Keokuk has the reputation of being a beautiful\ncity. It was a pleasant one to live in long ago, and doubtless has\nadvanced, not retrograded, in that respect.\n\nA mighty work which was in progress there in my day is finished now.\nThis is the canal over the Rapids. It is eight miles long, three hundred\nfeet wide, and is in no place less than six feet deep. Its masonry is\nof the majestic kind which the War Department usually deals in, and will\nendure like a Roman aqueduct. The work cost four or five millions.\n\nAfter an hour or two spent with former friends, we started up the river\nagain. Keokuk, a long time ago, was an occasional loafing-place of that\nerratic genius, Henry Clay Dean. I believe I never saw him but once; but\nhe was much talked of when I lived there. This is what was said of him--\n\nHe began life poor and without education. But he educated himself--on\nthe curbstones of Keokuk. He would sit down on a curbstone with his\nbook, careless or unconscious of the clatter of commerce and the tramp\nof the passing crowds, and bury himself in his studies by the hour,\nnever changing his position except to draw in his knees now and then\nto let a dray pass unobstructed; and when his book was finished, its\ncontents, however abstruse, had been burnt into his memory, and were his\npermanent possession. In this way he acquired a vast hoard of all sorts\nof learning, and had it pigeon-holed in his head where he could put his\nintellectual hand on it whenever it was wanted.\n\nHis clothes differed in no respect from a 'wharf-rat's,' except that\nthey were raggeder, more ill-assorted and inharmonious (and therefore\nmore extravagantly picturesque), and several layers dirtier. Nobody\ncould infer the master-mind in the top of that edifice from the edifice\nitself.\n\nHe was an orator--by nature in the first place, and later by the\ntraining of experience and practice. When he was out on a canvass, his\nname was a lodestone which drew the farmers to his stump from fifty\nmiles around. His theme was always politics. He used no notes, for\na volcano does not need notes. In 1862, a son of Keokuk's late\ndistinguished citizen, Mr. Claggett, gave me this incident concerning\nDean--\n\nThe war feeling was running high in Keokuk (in '61), and a great\nmass meeting was to be held on a certain day in the new Athenaeum. A\ndistinguished stranger was to address the house. After the building had\nbeen packed to its utmost capacity with sweltering folk of both sexes,\nthe stage still remained vacant--the distinguished stranger had failed\nto connect. The crowd grew impatient, and by and by indignant and\nrebellious. About this time a distressed manager discovered Dean on a\ncurb-stone, explained the dilemma to him, took his book away from him,\nrushed him into the building the back way, and told him to make for the\nstage and save his country.\n\nPresently a sudden silence fell upon the grumbling audience, and\neverybody's eyes sought a single point--the wide, empty, carpetless\nstage. A figure appeared there whose aspect was familiar to hardly a\ndozen persons present. It was the scarecrow Dean--in foxy shoes, down at\nthe heels; socks of odd colors, also 'down;' damaged trousers, relics of\nantiquity, and a world too short, exposing some inches of naked ankle;\nan unbuttoned vest, also too short, and exposing a zone of soiled and\nwrinkled linen between it and the waistband; shirt bosom open; long\nblack handkerchief, wound round and round the neck like a bandage;\nbob-tailed blue coat, reaching down to the small of the back,\nwith sleeves which left four inches of forearm unprotected; small,\nstiff-brimmed soldier-cap hung on a corner of the bump of--whichever\nbump it was. This figure moved gravely out upon the stage and, with\nsedate and measured step, down to the front, where it paused, and\ndreamily inspected the house, saying no word. The silence of surprise\nheld its own for a moment, then was broken by a just audible ripple\nof merriment which swept the sea of faces like the wash of a wave.\nThe figure remained as before, thoughtfully inspecting. Another wave\nstarted--laughter, this time. It was followed by another, then a\nthird--this last one boisterous.\n\nAnd now the stranger stepped back one pace, took off his soldier-cap,\ntossed it into the wing, and began to speak, with deliberation, nobody\nlistening, everybody laughing and whispering. The speaker talked on\nunembarrassed, and presently delivered a shot which went home, and\nsilence and attention resulted. He followed it quick and fast, with\nother telling things; warmed to his work and began to pour his words\nout, instead of dripping them; grew hotter and hotter, and fell to\ndischarging lightnings and thunder--and now the house began to break\ninto applause, to which the speaker gave no heed, but went hammering\nstraight on; unwound his black bandage and cast it away, still\nthundering; presently discarded the bob tailed coat and flung it aside,\nfiring up higher and higher all the time; finally flung the vest after\nthe coat; and then for an untimed period stood there, like another\nVesuvius, spouting smoke and flame, lava and ashes, raining pumice-stone\nand cinders, shaking the moral earth with intellectual crash upon crash,\nexplosion upon explosion, while the mad multitude stood upon their feet\nin a solid body, answering back with a ceaseless hurricane of cheers,\nthrough a thrashing snowstorm of waving handkerchiefs.\n\n'When Dean came,' said Claggett, 'the people thought he was an escaped\nlunatic; but when he went, they thought he was an escaped archangel.'\n\nBurlington, home of the sparkling Burdette, is another hill city; and\nalso a beautiful one; unquestionably so; a fine and flourishing\ncity, with a population of twenty-five thousand, and belted with busy\nfactories of nearly every imaginable description. It was a very sober\ncity, too--for the moment--for a most sobering bill was pending; a bill\nto forbid the manufacture, exportation, importation, purchase, sale,\nborrowing, lending, stealing, drinking, smelling, or possession, by\nconquest, inheritance, intent, accident, or otherwise, in the State of\nIowa, of each and every deleterious beverage known to the human race,\nexcept water. This measure was approved by all the rational people in\nthe State; but not by the bench of Judges.\n\nBurlington has the progressive modern city's full equipment of devices\nfor right and intelligent government; including a paid fire department,\na thing which the great city of New Orleans is without, but still\nemploys that relic of antiquity, the independent system.\n\nIn Burlington, as in all these Upper-River towns, one breathes a\ngo-ahead atmosphere which tastes good in the nostrils. An opera-house\nhas lately been built there which is in strong contrast with the shabby\ndens which usually do duty as theaters in cities of Burlington's size.\n\nWe had not time to go ashore in Muscatine, but had a daylight view of it\nfrom the boat. I lived there awhile, many years ago, but the place, now,\nhad a rather unfamiliar look; so I suppose it has clear outgrown the\ntown which I used to know. In fact, I know it has; for I remember it as\na small place--which it isn't now. But I remember it best for a\nlunatic who caught me out in the fields, one Sunday, and extracted a\nbutcher-knife from his boot and proposed to carve me up with it,\nunless I acknowledged him to be the only son of the Devil. I tried\nto compromise on an acknowledgment that he was the only member of the\nfamily I had met; but that did not satisfy him; he wouldn't have any\nhalf-measures; I must say he was the sole and only son of the Devil--he\nwhetted his knife on his boot. It did not seem worth while to make\ntrouble about a little thing like that; so I swung round to his view of\nthe matter and saved my skin whole. Shortly afterward, he went to visit\nhis father; and as he has not turned up since, I trust he is there yet.\n\nAnd I remember Muscatine--still more pleasantly--for its summer sunsets.\nI have never seen any, on either side of the ocean, that equaled them.\nThey used the broad smooth river as a canvas, and painted on it every\nimaginable dream of color, from the mottled daintinesses and delicacies\nof the opal, all the way up, through cumulative intensities, to blinding\npurple and crimson conflagrations which were enchanting to the eye, but\nsharply tried it at the same time. All the Upper Mississippi region\nhas these extraordinary sunsets as a familiar spectacle. It is the true\nSunset Land: I am sure no other country can show so good a right to the\nname. The sunrises are also said to be exceedingly fine. I do not know.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 58\n\nOn the Upper River\n\nTHE big towns drop in, thick and fast, now: and between stretch\nprocessions of thrifty farms, not desolate solitude. Hour by hour, the\nboat plows deeper and deeper into the great and populous North-west; and\nwith each successive section of it which is revealed, one's surprise\nand respect gather emphasis and increase. Such a people, and such\nachievements as theirs, compel homage. This is an independent race who\nthink for themselves, and who are competent to do it, because they are\neducated and enlightened; they read, they keep abreast of the best\nand newest thought, they fortify every weak place in their land with a\nschool, a college, a library, and a newspaper; and they live under law.\nSolicitude for the future of a race like this is not in order.\n\nThis region is new; so new that it may be said to be still in its\nbabyhood. By what it has accomplished while still teething, one may\nforecast what marvels it will do in the strength of its maturity. It\nis so new that the foreign tourist has not heard of it yet; and has not\nvisited it. For sixty years, the foreign tourist has steamed up and\ndown the river between St. Louis and New Orleans, and then gone home and\nwritten his book, believing he had seen all of the river that was worth\nseeing or that had anything to see. In not six of all these books is\nthere mention of these Upper River towns--for the reason that the five\nor six tourists who penetrated this region did it before these towns\nwere projected. The latest tourist of them all (1878) made the same old\nregulation trip--he had not heard that there was anything north of St.\nLouis.\n\nYet there was. There was this amazing region, bristling with great\ntowns, projected day before yesterday, so to speak, and built next\nmorning. A score of them number from fifteen hundred to five thousand\npeople. Then we have Muscatine, ten thousand; Winona, ten thousand;\nMoline, ten thousand; Rock Island, twelve thousand; La Crosse, twelve\nthousand; Burlington, twenty-five thousand; Dubuque, twenty-five\nthousand; Davenport, thirty thousand; St. Paul, fifty-eight thousand,\nMinneapolis, sixty thousand and upward.\n\nThe foreign tourist has never heard of these; there is no note of them\nin his books. They have sprung up in the night, while he slept. So new\nis this region, that I, who am comparatively young, am yet older than\nit is. When I was born, St. Paul had a population of three persons,\nMinneapolis had just a third as many. The then population of Minneapolis\ndied two years ago; and when he died he had seen himself undergo an\nincrease, in forty years, of fifty-nine thousand nine hundred and\nninety-nine persons. He had a frog's fertility.\n\nI must explain that the figures set down above, as the population of St.\nPaul and Minneapolis, are several months old. These towns are far larger\nnow. In fact, I have just seen a newspaper estimate which gives the\nformer seventy-one thousand, and the latter seventy-eight thousand. This\nbook will not reach the public for six or seven months yet; none of the\nfigures will be worth much then.\n\nWe had a glimpse of Davenport, which is another beautiful city, crowning\na hill--a phrase which applies to all these towns; for they are all\ncomely, all well built, clean, orderly, pleasant to the eye, and\ncheering to the spirit; and they are all situated upon hills. Therefore\nwe will give that phrase a rest. The Indians have a tradition that\nMarquette and Joliet camped where Davenport now stands, in 1673. The\nnext white man who camped there, did it about a hundred and seventy\nyears later--in 1834. Davenport has gathered its thirty thousand people\nwithin the past thirty years. She sends more children to her schools\nnow, than her whole population numbered twenty-three years ago. She has\nthe usual Upper River quota of factories, newspapers, and institutions\nof learning; she has telephones, local telegraphs, an electric alarm,\nand an admirable paid fire department, consisting of six hook and ladder\ncompanies, four steam fire engines, and thirty churches. Davenport is\nthe official residence of two bishops--Episcopal and Catholic.\n\nOpposite Davenport is the flourishing town of Rock Island, which lies at\nthe foot of the Upper Rapids. A great railroad bridge connects the two\ntowns--one of the thirteen which fret the Mississippi and the pilots,\nbetween St. Louis and St. Paul.\n\nThe charming island of Rock Island, three miles long and half a mile\nwide, belongs to the United States, and the Government has turned it\ninto a wonderful park, enhancing its natural attractions by art, and\nthreading its fine forests with many miles of drives. Near the center\nof the island one catches glimpses, through the trees, of ten vast stone\nfour-story buildings, each of which covers an acre of ground. These\nare the Government workshops; for the Rock Island establishment is a\nnational armory and arsenal.\n\nWe move up the river--always through enchanting scenery, there being no\nother kind on the Upper Mississippi--and pass Moline, a center of vast\nmanufacturing industries; and Clinton and Lyons, great lumber centers;\nand presently reach Dubuque, which is situated in a rich mineral region.\nThe lead mines are very productive, and of wide extent. Dubuque has a\ngreat number of manufacturing establishments; among them a plow factory\nwhich has for customers all Christendom in general. At least so I was\ntold by an agent of the concern who was on the boat. He said--\n\n'You show me any country under the sun where they really know how to\nplow, and if I don't show you our mark on the plow they use, I'll eat\nthat plow; and I won't ask for any Woostershyre sauce to flavor it up\nwith, either.'\n\nAll this part of the river is rich in Indian history and traditions.\nBlack Hawk's was once a puissant name hereabouts; as was\nKeokuk's, further down. A few miles below Dubuque is the Tete de\nMort--Death's-head rock, or bluff--to the top of which the French drove\na band of Indians, in early times, and cooped them up there, with death\nfor a certainty, and only the manner of it matter of choice--to starve,\nor jump off and kill themselves. Black Hawk adopted the ways of the\nwhite people, toward the end of his life; and when he died he was\nburied, near Des Moines, in Christian fashion, modified by Indian\ncustom; that is to say, clothed in a Christian military uniform, and\nwith a Christian cane in his hand, but deposited in the grave in a\nsitting posture. Formerly, a horse had always been buried with a chief.\nThe substitution of the cane shows that Black Hawk's haughty nature was\nreally humbled, and he expected to walk when he got over.\n\nWe noticed that above Dubuque the water of the Mississippi was\nolive-green--rich and beautiful and semi-transparent, with the sun on\nit. Of course the water was nowhere as clear or of as fine a complexion\nas it is in some other seasons of the year; for now it was at flood\nstage, and therefore dimmed and blurred by the mud manufactured from\ncaving banks.\n\nThe majestic bluffs that overlook the river, along through this region,\ncharm one with the grace and variety of their forms, and the soft\nbeauty of their adornment. The steep verdant slope, whose base is at\nthe water's edge is topped by a lofty rampart of broken, turreted rocks,\nwhich are exquisitely rich and mellow in color--mainly dark browns\nand dull greens, but splashed with other tints. And then you have the\nshining river, winding here and there and yonder, its sweep interrupted\nat intervals by clusters of wooded islands threaded by silver channels;\nand you have glimpses of distant villages, asleep upon capes; and of\nstealthy rafts slipping along in the shade of the forest walls; and of\nwhite steamers vanishing around remote points. And it is all as\ntranquil and reposeful as dreamland, and has nothing this-worldly about\nit--nothing to hang a fret or a worry upon.\n\nUntil the unholy train comes tearing along--which it presently does,\nripping the sacred solitude to rags and tatters with its devil's\nwarwhoop and the roar and thunder of its rushing wheels--and straightway\nyou are back in this world, and with one of its frets ready to hand for\nyour entertainment: for you remember that this is the very road whose\nstock always goes down after you buy it, and always goes up again as\nsoon as you sell it. It makes me shudder to this day, to remember that\nI once came near not getting rid of my stock at all. It must be an awful\nthing to have a railroad left on your hands.\n\nThe locomotive is in sight from the deck of the steamboat almost\nthe whole way from St. Louis to St. Paul--eight hundred miles. These\nrailroads have made havoc with the steamboat commerce. The clerk of our\nboat was a steamboat clerk before these roads were built. In that day\nthe influx of population was so great, and the freight business so\nheavy, that the boats were not able to keep up with the demands made\nupon their carrying capacity; consequently the captains were very\nindependent and airy--pretty 'biggity,' as Uncle Remus would say. The\nclerk nut-shelled the contrast between the former time and the present,\nthus--\n\n'Boat used to land--captain on hurricane roof--mighty stiff and\nstraight--iron ramrod for a spine--kid gloves, plug tile, hair parted\nbehind--man on shore takes off hat and says--\n\n'“Got twenty-eight tons of wheat, cap'n--be great favor if you can take\nthem.”\n\n'Captain says--\n\n'“'ll take two of them”--and don't even condescend to look at him.\n\n'But nowadays the captain takes off his old slouch, and smiles all the\nway around to the back of his ears, and gets off a bow which he hasn't\ngot any ramrod to interfere with, and says--\n\n'“Glad to see you, Smith, glad to see you--you're looking well--haven't\nseen you looking so well for years--what you got for us?”\n\n'“Nuth'n”, says Smith; and keeps his hat on, and just turns his back and\ngoes to talking with somebody else.\n\n'Oh, yes, eight years ago, the captain was on top; but it's Smith's turn\nnow. Eight years ago a boat used to go up the river with every stateroom\nfull, and people piled five and six deep on the cabin floor; and a solid\ndeck-load of immigrants and harvesters down below, into the bargain. To\nget a first-class stateroom, you'd got to prove sixteen quarterings of\nnobility and four hundred years of descent, or be personally acquainted\nwith the nigger that blacked the captain's boots. But it's all changed\nnow; plenty staterooms above, no harvesters below--there's a patent\nself-binder now, and they don't have harvesters any more; they've gone\nwhere the woodbine twineth--and they didn't go by steamboat, either;\nwent by the train.'\n\nUp in this region we met massed acres of lumber rafts coming down--but\nnot floating leisurely along, in the old-fashioned way, manned with\njoyous and reckless crews of fiddling, song-singing, whiskey-drinking,\nbreakdown-dancing rapscallions; no, the whole thing was shoved swiftly\nalong by a powerful stern-wheeler, modern fashion, and the small\ncrews were quiet, orderly men, of a sedate business aspect, with not a\nsuggestion of romance about them anywhere.\n\nAlong here, somewhere, on a black night, we ran some exceedingly narrow\nand intricate island-chutes by aid of the electric light. Behind was\nsolid blackness--a crackless bank of it; ahead, a narrow elbow of water,\ncurving between dense walls of foliage that almost touched our bows on\nboth sides; and here every individual leaf, and every individual ripple\nstood out in its natural color, and flooded with a glare as of noonday\nintensified. The effect was strange, and fine, and very striking.\n\nWe passed Prairie du Chien, another of Father Marquette's\ncamping-places; and after some hours of progress through varied and\nbeautiful scenery, reached La Crosse. Here is a town of twelve or\nthirteen thousand population, with electric lighted streets, and with\nblocks of buildings which are stately enough, and also architecturally\nfine enough, to command respect in any city. It is a choice town, and we\nmade satisfactory use of the hour allowed us, in roaming it over, though\nthe weather was rainier than necessary.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 59\n\nLegends and Scenery\n\nWE added several passengers to our list, at La Crosse; among others an\nold gentleman who had come to this north-western region with the early\nsettlers, and was familiar with every part of it. Pardonably proud of\nit, too. He said--\n\n'You'll find scenery between here and St. Paul that can give the Hudson\npoints. You'll have the Queen's Bluff--seven hundred feet high, and\njust as imposing a spectacle as you can find anywheres; and Trempeleau\nIsland, which isn't like any other island in America, I believe, for it\nis a gigantic mountain, with precipitous sides, and is full of Indian\ntraditions, and used to be full of rattlesnakes; if you catch the sun\njust right there, you will have a picture that will stay with you. And\nabove Winona you'll have lovely prairies; and then come the Thousand\nIslands, too beautiful for anything; green? why you never saw foliage so\ngreen, nor packed so thick; it's like a thousand plush cushions afloat\non a looking-glass--when the water 's still; and then the monstrous\nbluffs on both sides of the river--ragged, rugged, dark-complected--just\nthe frame that's wanted; you always want a strong frame, you know, to\nthrow up the nice points of a delicate picture and make them stand out.'\n\nThe old gentleman also told us a touching Indian legend or two--but not\nvery powerful ones.\n\nAfter this excursion into history, he came back to the scenery, and\ndescribed it, detail by detail, from the Thousand Islands to St. Paul;\nnaming its names with such facility, tripping along his theme with such\nnimble and confident ease, slamming in a three-ton word, here and\nthere, with such a complacent air of 't\nisn't-anything,-I-can-do-it-any-time-I-want-to, and letting off fine\nsurprises of lurid eloquence at such judicious intervals, that I\npresently began to suspect--\n\nBut no matter what I began to suspect. Hear him--\n\n'Ten miles above Winona we come to Fountain City, nestling sweetly at\nthe feet of cliffs that lift their awful fronts, Jovelike, toward the\nblue depths of heaven, bathing them in virgin atmospheres that have\nknown no other contact save that of angels' wings.\n\n'And next we glide through silver waters, amid lovely and stupendous\naspects of nature that attune our hearts to adoring admiration, about\ntwelve miles, and strike Mount Vernon, six hundred feet high, with\nromantic ruins of a once first-class hotel perched far among the cloud\nshadows that mottle its dizzy heights--sole remnant of once-flourishing\nMount Vernon, town of early days, now desolate and utterly deserted.\n\n'And so we move on. Past Chimney Rock we fly--noble shaft of six hundred\nfeet; then just before landing at Minnieska our attention is attracted\nby a most striking promontory rising over five hundred feet--the ideal\nmountain pyramid. Its conic shape--thickly-wooded surface girding its\nsides, and its apex like that of a cone, cause the spectator to wonder\nat nature's workings. From its dizzy heights superb views of the\nforests, streams, bluffs, hills and dales below and beyond for miles are\nbrought within its focus. What grander river scenery can be conceived,\nas we gaze upon this enchanting landscape, from the uppermost point of\nthese bluffs upon the valleys below? The primeval wildness and awful\nloneliness of these sublime creations of nature and nature's God, excite\nfeelings of unbounded admiration, and the recollection of which can\nnever be effaced from the memory, as we view them in any direction.\n\n'Next we have the Lion's Head and the Lioness's Head, carved by nature's\nhand, to adorn and dominate the beauteous stream; and then anon the\nriver widens, and a most charming and magnificent view of the valley\nbefore us suddenly bursts upon our vision; rugged hills, clad with\nverdant forests from summit to base, level prairie lands, holding in\ntheir lap the beautiful Wabasha, City of the Healing Waters, puissant\nfoe of Bright's disease, and that grandest conception of nature's\nworks, incomparable Lake Pepin--these constitute a picture whereon the\ntourist's eye may gaze uncounted hours, with rapture unappeased and\nunappeasable.\n\n'And so we glide along; in due time encountering those majestic domes,\nthe mighty Sugar Loaf, and the sublime Maiden's Rock--which latter,\nromantic superstition has invested with a voice; and oft-times as the\nbirch canoe glides near, at twilight, the dusky paddler fancies he hears\nthe soft sweet music of the long-departed Winona, darling of Indian song\nand story.\n\n'Then Frontenac looms upon our vision, delightful resort of jaded summer\ntourists; then progressive Red Wing; and Diamond Bluff, impressive and\npreponderous in its lone sublimity; then Prescott and the St. Croix; and\nanon we see bursting upon us the domes and steeples of St. Paul, giant\nyoung chief of the North, marching with seven-league stride in the\nvan of progress, banner-bearer of the highest and newest civilization,\ncarving his beneficent way with the tomahawk of commercial enterprise,\nsounding the warwhoop of Christian culture, tearing off the reeking\nscalp of sloth and superstition to plant there the steam-plow and the\nschool-house--ever in his front stretch arid lawlessness, ignorance,\ncrime, despair; ever in his wake bloom the jail, the gallows, and the\npulpit; and ever--'\n\n'Have you ever traveled with a panorama?'\n\n'I have formerly served in that capacity.'\n\nMy suspicion was confirmed.\n\n'Do you still travel with it?'\n\n'No, she is laid up till the fall season opens. I am helping now to work\nup the materials for a Tourist's Guide which the St. Louis and St.\nPaul Packet Company are going to issue this summer for the benefit of\ntravelers who go by that line.'\n\n'When you were talking of Maiden's Rock, you spoke of the long-departed\nWinona, darling of Indian song and story. Is she the maiden of the\nrock?--and are the two connected by legend?'\n\n'Yes, and a very tragic and painful one. Perhaps the most celebrated, as\nwell as the most pathetic, of all the legends of the Mississippi.'\n\nWe asked him to tell it. He dropped out of his conversational vein and\nback into his lecture-gait without an effort, and rolled on as follows--\n\n'A little distance above Lake City is a famous point known as Maiden's\nRock, which is not only a picturesque spot, but is full of romantic\ninterest from the event which gave it its name, Not many years ago this\nlocality was a favorite resort for the Sioux Indians on account of the\nfine fishing and hunting to be had there, and large numbers of them were\nalways to be found in this locality. Among the families which used\nto resort here, was one belonging to the tribe of Wabasha. We-no-na\n(first-born) was the name of a maiden who had plighted her troth to a\nlover belonging to the same band. But her stern parents had promised her\nhand to another, a famous warrior, and insisted on her wedding him. The\nday was fixed by her parents, to her great grief. She appeared to accede\nto the proposal and accompany them to the rock, for the purpose of\ngathering flowers for the feast. On reaching the rock, We-no-na ran\nto its summit and standing on its edge upbraided her parents who were\nbelow, for their cruelty, and then singing a death-dirge, threw herself\nfrom the precipice and dashed them in pieces on the rock below.'\n\n'Dashed who in pieces--her parents?'\n\n'Yes.'\n\n'Well, it certainly was a tragic business, as you say. And moreover,\nthere is a startling kind of dramatic surprise about it which I was not\nlooking for. It is a distinct improvement upon the threadbare form of\nIndian legend. There are fifty Lover's Leaps along the Mississippi from\nwhose summit disappointed Indian girls have jumped, but this is the only\njump in the lot hat turned out in the right and satisfactory way. What\nbecame of Winona?'\n\n'She was a good deal jarred up and jolted: but she got herself together\nand disappeared before the coroner reached the fatal spot; and 'tis\nsaid she sought and married her true love, and wandered with him to\nsome distant clime, where she lived happy ever after, her gentle spirit\nmellowed and chastened by the romantic incident which had so early\ndeprived her of the sweet guidance of a mother's love and a father's\nprotecting arm, and thrown her, all unfriended, upon the cold charity of\na censorious world.'\n\nI was glad to hear the lecturer's description of the scenery, for it\nassisted my appreciation of what I saw of it, and enabled me to imagine\nsuch of it as we lost by the intrusion of night.\n\nAs the lecturer remarked, this whole region is blanketed with Indian\ntales and traditions. But I reminded him that people usually merely\nmention this fact--doing it in a way to make a body's mouth water--and\njudiciously stopped there. Why? Because the impression left, was that\nthese tales were full of incident and imagination--a pleasant impression\nwhich would be promptly dissipated if the tales were told. I showed him\na lot of this sort of literature which I had been collecting, and he\nconfessed that it was poor stuff, exceedingly sorry rubbish; and I\nventured to add that the legends which he had himself told us were of\nthis character, with the single exception of the admirable story of\nWinona. He granted these facts, but said that if I would hunt up Mr.\nSchoolcraft's book, published near fifty years ago, and now doubtless\nout of print, I would find some Indian inventions in it that were very\nfar from being barren of incident and imagination; that the tales in\nHiawatha were of this sort, and they came from Schoolcraft's book; and\nthat there were others in the same book which Mr. Longfellow could have\nturned into verse with good effect. For instance, there was the legend\nof 'The Undying Head.' He could not tell it, for many of the details\nhad grown dim in his memory; but he would recommend me to find it and\nenlarge my respect for the Indian imagination. He said that this tale,\nand most of the others in the book, were current among the Indians\nalong this part of the Mississippi when he first came here; and that\nthe contributors to Schoolcraft's book had got them directly from Indian\nlips, and had written them down with strict exactness, and without\nembellishments of their own.\n\nI have found the book. The lecturer was right. There are several legends\nin it which confirm what he said. I will offer two of them--'The Undying\nHead,' and 'Peboan and Seegwun, an Allegory of the Seasons.' The latter\nis used in Hiawatha; but it is worth reading in the original form, if\nonly that one may see how effective a genuine poem can be without the\nhelps and graces of poetic measure and rhythm--\n\nPEBOAN AND SEEGWUN.\n\nAn old man was sitting alone in his lodge, by the side of a frozen\nstream. It was the close of winter, and his fire was almost out, He\nappeared very old and very desolate. His locks were white with age, and\nhe trembled in every joint. Day after day passed in solitude, and he\nheard nothing but the sound of the tempest, sweeping before it the\nnew-fallen snow.\n\nOne day, as his fire was just dying, a handsome young man approached and\nentered his dwelling. His cheeks were red with the blood of youth,\nhis eyes sparkled with animation, and a smile played upon his lips. He\nwalked with a light and quick step. His forehead was bound with a wreath\nof sweet grass, in place of a warrior's frontlet, and he carried a bunch\nof flowers in his hand.\n\n'Ah, my son,' said the old man, 'I am happy to see you. Come in. Come\nand tell me of your adventures, and what strange lands you have been to\nsee. Let us pass the night together. I will tell you of my prowess and\nexploits, and what I can perform. You shall do the same, and we will\namuse ourselves.'\n\nHe then drew from his sack a curiously wrought antique pipe, and having\nfilled it with tobacco, rendered mild by a mixture of certain leaves,\nhanded it to his guest. When this ceremony was concluded they began to\nspeak.\n\n'I blow my breath,' said the old man, 'and the stream stands still. The\nwater becomes stiff and hard as clear stone.'\n\n'I breathe,' said the young man, 'and flowers spring up over the plain.'\n\n'I shake my locks,' retorted the old man, 'and snow covers the land. The\nleaves fall from the trees at my command, and my breath blows them away.\nThe birds get up from the water, and fly to a distant land. The animals\nhide themselves from my breath, and the very ground becomes as hard as\nflint.'\n\n'I shake my ringlets,' rejoined the young man, 'and warm showers of\nsoft rain fall upon the earth. The plants lift up their heads out of\nthe earth, like the eyes of children glistening with delight. My voice\nrecalls the birds. The warmth of my breath unlocks the streams. Music\nfills the groves wherever I walk, and all nature rejoices.'\n\nAt length the sun began to rise. A gentle warmth came over the place.\nThe tongue of the old man became silent. The robin and bluebird began\nto sing on the top of the lodge. The stream began to murmur by the door,\nand the fragrance of growing herbs and flowers came softly on the vernal\nbreeze.\n\nDaylight fully revealed to the young man the character of his\nentertainer. When he looked upon him, he had the icy visage of\nPeboan.{footnote [Winter.]} Streams began to flow from his eyes. As the\nsun increased, he grew less and less in stature, and anon had melted\ncompletely away. Nothing remained on the place of his lodge-fire but the\nmiskodeed,{footnote [The trailing arbutus.]} a small white flower, with\na pink border, which is one of the earliest species of northern plants.\n\n'The Undying Head' is a rather long tale, but it makes up in weird\nconceits, fairy-tale prodigies, variety of incident, and energy of\nmovement, for what it lacks in brevity.{footnote [See appendix D.]}\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 60\n\nSpeculations and Conclusions\n\nWE reached St. Paul, at the head of navigation of the Mississippi, and\nthere our voyage of two thousand miles from New Orleans ended. It is\nabout a ten-day trip by steamer. It can probably be done quicker by\nrail. I judge so because I know that one may go by rail from St. Louis\nto Hannibal--a distance of at least a hundred and twenty miles--in seven\nhours. This is better than walking; unless one is in a hurry.\n\nThe season being far advanced when we were in New Orleans, the roses and\nmagnolia blossoms were falling; but here in St. Paul it was the snow,\nIn New Orleans we had caught an occasional withering breath from over a\ncrater, apparently; here in St. Paul we caught a frequent benumbing one\nfrom over a glacier, apparently.\n\nBut I wander from my theme. St. Paul is a wonderful town. It is put\ntogether in solid blocks of honest brick and stone, and has the air of\nintending to stay. Its post-office was established thirty-six years ago;\nand by and by, when the postmaster received a letter, he carried it to\nWashington, horseback, to inquire what was to be done with it. Such is\nthe legend. Two frame houses were built that year, and several persons\nwere added to the population. A recent number of the leading St. Paul\npaper, the 'Pioneer Press,' gives some statistics which furnish a vivid\ncontrast to that old state of things, to wit: Population, autumn of the\npresent year (1882), 71,000; number of letters handled, first half of\nthe year, 1,209,387; number of houses built during three-quarters of\nthe year, 989; their cost, $3,186,000. The increase of letters over the\ncorresponding six months of last year was fifty per cent. Last year\nthe new buildings added to the city cost above $4,500,000. St.\nPaul's strength lies in her commerce--I mean his commerce. He is a\nmanufacturing city, of course--all the cities of that region are--but\nhe is peculiarly strong in the matter of commerce. Last year his jobbing\ntrade amounted to upwards of $52,000,000.\n\nHe has a custom-house, and is building a costly capitol to replace the\none recently burned--for he is the capital of the State. He has churches\nwithout end; and not the cheap poor kind, but the kind that the rich\nProtestant puts up, the kind that the poor Irish 'hired-girl' delights\nto erect. What a passion for building majestic churches the Irish\nhired-girl has. It is a fine thing for our architecture but too often we\nenjoy her stately fanes without giving her a grateful thought. In\nfact, instead of reflecting that 'every brick and every stone in this\nbeautiful edifice represents an ache or a pain, and a handful of sweat,\nand hours of heavy fatigue, contributed by the back and forehead and\nbones of poverty,' it is our habit to forget these things entirely,\nand merely glorify the mighty temple itself, without vouchsafing one\npraiseful thought to its humble builder, whose rich heart and withered\npurse it symbolizes.\n\nThis is a land of libraries and schools. St. Paul has three public\nlibraries, and they contain, in the aggregate, some forty thousand\nbooks. He has one hundred and sixteen school-houses, and pays out more\nthan seventy thousand dollars a year in teachers' salaries.\n\nThere is an unusually fine railway station; so large is it, in fact,\nthat it seemed somewhat overdone, in the matter of size, at first;\nbut at the end of a few months it was perceived that the mistake was\ndistinctly the other way. The error is to be corrected.\n\nThe town stands on high ground; it is about seven hundred feet above\nthe sea level. It is so high that a wide view of river and lowland is\noffered from its streets.\n\nIt is a very wonderful town indeed, and is not finished yet. All\nthe streets are obstructed with building material, and this is being\ncompacted into houses as fast as possible, to make room for more--for\nother people are anxious to build, as soon as they can get the use of\nthe streets to pile up their bricks and stuff in.\n\nHow solemn and beautiful is the thought, that the earliest pioneer of\ncivilization, the van-leader of civilization, is never the steamboat,\nnever the railroad, never the newspaper, never the Sabbath-school, never\nthe missionary--but always whiskey! Such is the case. Look history over;\nyou will see. The missionary comes after the whiskey--I mean he arrives\nafter the whiskey has arrived; next comes the poor immigrant, with ax\nand hoe and rifle; next, the trader; next, the miscellaneous rush; next,\nthe gambler, the desperado, the highwayman, and all their kindred in sin\nof both sexes; and next, the smart chap who has bought up an old grant\nthat covers all the land; this brings the lawyer tribe; the vigilance\ncommittee brings the undertaker. All these interests bring the\nnewspaper; the newspaper starts up politics and a railroad; all hands\nturn to and build a church and a jail--and behold, civilization\nis established for ever in the land. But whiskey, you see, was the\nvan-leader in this beneficent work. It always is. It was like a\nforeigner--and excusable in a foreigner--to be ignorant of this great\ntruth, and wander off into astronomy to borrow a symbol. But if he had\nbeen conversant with the facts, he would have said--\n\nWestward the Jug of Empire takes its way.\n\nThis great van-leader arrived upon the ground which St. Paul now\noccupies, in June 1837. Yes, at that date, Pierre Parrant, a Canadian,\nbuilt the first cabin, uncorked his jug, and began to sell whiskey to\nthe Indians. The result is before us.\n\nAll that I have said of the newness, briskness, swift progress, wealth,\nintelligence, fine and substantial architecture, and general slash\nand go, and energy of St. Paul, will apply to his near neighbor,\nMinneapolis--with the addition that the latter is the bigger of the two\ncities.\n\nThese extraordinary towns were ten miles apart, a few months ago, but\nwere growing so fast that they may possibly be joined now, and getting\nalong under a single mayor. At any rate, within five years from\nnow there will be at least such a substantial ligament of buildings\nstretching between them and uniting them that a stranger will not be\nable to tell where the one Siamese twin leaves off and the other begins.\nCombined, they will then number a population of two hundred and fifty\nthousand, if they continue to grow as they are now growing. Thus, this\ncenter of population at the head of Mississippi navigation, will then\nbegin a rivalry as to numbers, with that center of population at the\nfoot of it--New Orleans.\n\nMinneapolis is situated at the falls of St. Anthony, which stretch\nacross the river, fifteen hundred feet, and have a fall of eighty-two\nfeet--a waterpower which, by art, has been made of inestimable\nvalue, business-wise, though somewhat to the damage of the Falls as\na spectacle, or as a background against which to get your photograph\ntaken.\n\nThirty flouring-mills turn out two million barrels of the very choicest\nof flour every year; twenty sawmills produce two hundred million feet\nof lumber annually; then there are woolen mills, cotton mills, paper\nand oil mills; and sash, nail, furniture, barrel, and other factories,\nwithout number, so to speak. The great flouring-mills here and at St.\nPaul use the 'new process' and mash the wheat by rolling, instead of\ngrinding it.\n\nSixteen railroads meet in Minneapolis, and sixty-five passenger trains\narrive and depart daily. In this place, as in St. Paul, journalism\nthrives. Here there are three great dailies, ten weeklies, and three\nmonthlies.\n\nThere is a university, with four hundred students--and, better still,\nits good efforts are not confined to enlightening the one sex. There are\nsixteen public schools, with buildings which cost $500,000; there are\nsix thousand pupils and one hundred and twenty-eight teachers. There\nare also seventy churches existing, and a lot more projected. The banks\naggregate a capital of $3,000,000, and the wholesale jobbing trade of\nthe town amounts to $50,000,000 a year.\n\nNear St. Paul and Minneapolis are several points of interest--Fort\nSnelling, a fortress occupying a river-bluff a hundred feet high; the\nfalls of Minnehaha, White-bear Lake, and so forth. The beautiful falls\nof Minnehaha are sufficiently celebrated--they do not need a lift from\nme, in that direction. The White-bear Lake is less known. It is a lovely\nsheet of water, and is being utilized as a summer resort by the wealth\nand fashion of the State. It has its club-house, and its hotel, with the\nmodern improvements and conveniences; its fine summer residences; and\nplenty of fishing, hunting, and pleasant drives. There are a dozen minor\nsummer resorts around about St. Paul and Minneapolis, but the White-bear\nLake is the resort. Connected with White-bear Lake is a most idiotic\nIndian legend. I would resist the temptation to print it here, if I\ncould, but the task is beyond my strength. The guide-book names the\npreserver of the legend, and compliments his 'facile pen.' Without\nfurther comment or delay then, let us turn the said facile pen loose\nupon the reader--\n\nA LEGEND OF WHITE-BEAR LAKE.\n\nEvery spring, for perhaps a century, or as long as there has been a\nnation of red men, an island in the middle of White-bear Lake has been\nvisited by a band of Indians for the purpose of making maple sugar.\n\nTradition says that many springs ago, while upon this island, a young\nwarrior loved and wooed the daughter of his chief, and it is said, also,\nthe maiden loved the warrior. He had again and again been refused her\nhand by her parents, the old chief alleging that he was no brave, and\nhis old consort called him a woman!\n\nThe sun had again set upon the 'sugar-bush,' and the bright moon rose\nhigh in the bright blue heavens, when the young warrior took down his\nflute and went out alone, once more to sing the story of his love, the\nmild breeze gently moved the two gay feathers in his head-dress, and as\nhe mounted on the trunk of a leaning tree, the damp snow fell from his\nfeet heavily. As he raised his flute to his lips, his blanket slipped\nfrom his well-formed shoulders, and lay partly on the snow beneath. He\nbegan his weird, wild love-song, but soon felt that he was cold, and as\nhe reached back for his blanket, some unseen hand laid it gently on his\nshoulders; it was the hand of his love, his guardian angel. She took her\nplace beside him, and for the present they were happy; for the Indian\nhas a heart to love, and in this pride he is as noble as in his own\nfreedom, which makes him the child of the forest. As the legend runs, a\nlarge white-bear, thinking, perhaps, that polar snows and dismal winter\nweather extended everywhere, took up his journey southward. He at length\napproached the northern shore of the lake which now bears his name,\nwalked down the bank and made his way noiselessly through the deep heavy\nsnow toward the island. It was the same spring ensuing that the lovers\nmet. They had left their first retreat, and were now seated among the\nbranches of a large elm which hung far over the lake. (The same tree is\nstill standing, and excites universal curiosity and interest.) For fear\nof being detected, they talked almost in a whisper, and now, that they\nmight get back to camp in good time and thereby avoid suspicion, they\nwere just rising to return, when the maiden uttered a shriek which was\nheard at the camp, and bounding toward the young brave, she caught his\nblanket, but missed the direction of her foot and fell, bearing the\nblanket with her into the great arms of the ferocious monster. Instantly\nevery man, woman, and child of the band were upon the bank, but all\nunarmed. Cries and wailings went up from every mouth. What was to be\ndone'? In the meantime this white and savage beast held the breathless\nmaiden in his huge grasp, and fondled with his precious prey as if he\nwere used to scenes like this. One deafening yell from the lover warrior\nis heard above the cries of hundreds of his tribe, and dashing away\nto his wigwam he grasps his faithful knife, returns almost at a single\nbound to the scene of fear and fright, rushes out along the leaning tree\nto the spot where his treasure fell, and springing with the fury of\na mad panther, pounced upon his prey. The animal turned, and with one\nstroke of his huge paw brought the lovers heart to heart, but the next\nmoment the warrior, with one plunge of the blade of his knife, opened\nthe crimson sluices of death, and the dying bear relaxed his hold.\n\nThat night there was no more sleep for the band or the lovers, and as\nthe young and the old danced about the carcass of the dead monster, the\ngallant warrior was presented with another plume, and ere another moon\nhad set he had a living treasure added to his heart. Their children for\nmany years played upon the skin of the white-bear--from which the lake\nderives its name--and the maiden and the brave remembered long the\nfearful scene and rescue that made them one, for Kis-se-me-pa and\nKa-go-ka could never forget their fearful encounter with the huge\nmonster that came so near sending them to the happy hunting-ground.\n\nIt is a perplexing business. First, she fell down out of the tree--she\nand the blanket; and the bear caught her and fondled her--her and the\nblanket; then she fell up into the tree again--leaving the blanket;\nmeantime the lover goes war-whooping home and comes back 'heeled,'\nclimbs the tree, jumps down on the bear, the girl jumps down after\nhim--apparently, for she was up the tree--resumes her place in the\nbear's arms along with the blanket, the lover rams his knife into the\nbear, and saves--whom, the blanket? No--nothing of the sort. You get\nyourself all worked up and excited about that blanket, and then all of\na sudden, just when a happy climax seems imminent you are let down\nflat--nothing saved but the girl. Whereas, one is not interested in\nthe girl; she is not the prominent feature of the legend. Nevertheless,\nthere you are left, and there you must remain; for if you live a\nthousand years you will never know who got the blanket. A dead man could\nget up a better legend than this one. I don't mean a fresh dead man\neither; I mean a man that's been dead weeks and weeks.\n\nWe struck the home-trail now, and in a few hours were in that\nastonishing Chicago--a city where they are always rubbing the lamp, and\nfetching up the genii, and contriving and achieving new impossibilities.\nIt is hopeless for the occasional visitor to try to keep up with\nChicago--she outgrows his prophecies faster than he can make them.\nShe is always a novelty; for she is never the Chicago you saw when you\npassed through the last time. The Pennsylvania road rushed us to New\nYork without missing schedule time ten minutes anywhere on the route;\nand there ended one of the most enjoyable five-thousand-mile journeys I\nhave ever had the good fortune to make.\n\nAPPENDIX\n\nAPPENDIX A\n\n(FROM THE NEW ORLEANS TIMES DEMOCRAT OF MARCH 29, 1882.)\n\nVOYAGE OF THE TIMES-DEMOCRAT'S RELIEF BOAT THROUGH THE INUNDATED REGIONS\n\nIT was nine o'clock Thursday morning when the 'Susie' left the\nMississippi and entered Old River, or what is now called the mouth of\nthe Red. Ascending on the left, a flood was pouring in through and over\nthe levees on the Chandler plantation, the most northern point in Pointe\nCoupee parish. The water completely covered the place, although the\nlevees had given way but a short time before. The stock had been\ngathered in a large flat-boat, where, without food, as we passed, the\nanimals were huddled together, waiting for a boat to tow them off. On\nthe right-hand side of the river is Turnbull's Island, and on it is a\nlarge plantation which formerly was pronounced one of the most fertile\nin the State. The water has hitherto allowed it to go scot-free in usual\nfloods, but now broad sheets of water told only where fields were. The\ntop of the protecting levee could be seen here and there, but nearly all\nof it was submerged.\n\nThe trees have put on a greener foliage since the water has poured in,\nand the woods look bright and fresh, but this pleasant aspect to the eye\nis neutralized by the interminable waste of water. We pass mile after\nmile, and it is nothing but trees standing up to their branches in\nwater. A water-turkey now and again rises and flies ahead into the long\navenue of silence. A pirogue sometimes flits from the bushes and crosses\nthe Red River on its way out to the Mississippi, but the sad-faced\npaddlers never turn their heads to look at our boat. The puffing of the\nboat is music in this gloom, which affects one most curiously. It is not\nthe gloom of deep forests or dark caverns, but a peculiar kind of solemn\nsilence and impressive awe that holds one perforce to its recognition.\nWe passed two negro families on a raft tied up in the willows this\nmorning. They were evidently of the well-to-do class, as they had a\nsupply of meal and three or four hogs with them. Their rafts were about\ntwenty feet square, and in front of an improvised shelter earth had been\nplaced, on which they built their fire.\n\nThe current running down the Atchafalaya was very swift, the Mississippi\nshowing a predilection in that direction, which needs only to be seen to\nenforce the opinion of that river's desperate endeavors to find a short\nway to the Gulf. Small boats, skiffs, pirogues, etc., are in great\ndemand, and many have been stolen by piratical negroes, who take them\nwhere they will bring the greatest price. From what was told me by Mr.\nC. P. Ferguson, a planter near Red River Landing, whose place has just\ngone under, there is much suffering in the rear of that place. The\nnegroes had given up all thoughts of a crevasse there, as the upper\nlevee had stood so long, and when it did come they were at its mercy.\nOn Thursday a number were taken out of trees and off of cabin roofs and\nbrought in, many yet remaining.\n\nOne does not appreciate the sight of earth until he has traveled through\na flood. At sea one does not expect or look for it, but here, with\nfluttering leaves, shadowy forest aisles, house-tops barely visible, it\nis expected. In fact a grave-yard, if the mounds were above water, would\nbe appreciated. The river here is known only because there is an opening\nin the trees, and that is all. It is in width, from Fort Adams on the\nleft bank of the Mississippi to the bank of Rapides Parish, a distance\nof about sixty miles. A large portion of this was under cultivation,\nparticularly along the Mississippi and back of the Red. When Red River\nproper was entered, a strong current was running directly across it,\npursuing the same direction as that of the Mississippi.\n\nAfter a run of some hours, Black River was reached. Hardly was it\nentered before signs of suffering became visible. All the willows\nalong the banks were stripped of their leaves. One man, whom your\ncorrespondent spoke to, said that he had had one hundred and fifty head\nof cattle and one hundred head of hogs. At the first appearance of water\nhe had started to drive them to the high lands of Avoyelles, thirty-five\nmiles off, but he lost fifty head of the beef cattle and sixty hogs.\nBlack River is quite picturesque, even if its shores are under water.\nA dense growth of ash, oak, gum, and hickory make the shores almost\nimpenetrable, and where one can get a view down some avenue in\nthe trees, only the dim outlines of distant trunks can be barely\ndistinguished in the gloom.\n\nA few miles up this river, the depth of water on the banks was fully\neight feet, and on all sides could be seen, still holding against the\nstrong current, the tops of cabins. Here and there one overturned was\nsurrounded by drift-wood, forming the nucleus of possibly some future\nisland.\n\nIn order to save coal, as it was impossible to get that fuel at any\npoint to be touched during the expedition, a look-out was kept for a\nwood-pile. On rounding a point a pirogue, skilfully paddled by a youth,\nshot out, and in its bow was a girl of fifteen, of fair face, beautiful\nblack eyes, and demure manners. The boy asked for a paper, which was\nthrown to him, and the couple pushed their tiny craft out into the swell\nof the boat.\n\nPresently a little girl, not certainly over twelve years, paddled out in\nthe smallest little canoe and handled it with all the deftness of an old\nvoyageur. The little one looked more like an Indian than a white child,\nand laughed when asked if she were afraid. She had been raised in a\npirogue and could go anywhere. She was bound out to pick willow leaves\nfor the stock, and she pointed to a house near by with water three\ninches deep on the floors. At its back door was moored a raft about\nthirty feet square, with a sort of fence built upon it, and inside of\nthis some sixteen cows and twenty hogs were standing. The family did not\ncomplain, except on account of losing their stock, and promptly brought\na supply of wood in a flat.\n\nFrom this point to the Mississippi River, fifteen miles, there is not\na spot of earth above water, and to the westward for thirty-five miles\nthere is nothing but the river's flood. Black River had risen during\nThursday, the 23rd, 1{three-quarters} inches, and was going up at night\nstill. As we progress up the river habitations become more frequent,\nbut are yet still miles apart. Nearly all of them are deserted, and the\nout-houses floated off. To add to the gloom, almost every living thing\nseems to have departed, and not a whistle of a bird nor the bark of\nthe squirrel can be heard in this solitude. Sometimes a morose gar\nwill throw his tail aloft and disappear in the river, but beyond this\neverything is quiet--the quiet of dissolution. Down the river floats\nnow a neatly whitewashed hen-house, then a cluster of neatly split\nfence-rails, or a door and a bloated carcass, solemnly guarded by a pair\nof buzzards, the only bird to be seen, which feast on the carcass as it\nbears them along. A picture-frame in which there was a cheap lithograph\nof a soldier on horseback, as it floated on told of some hearth invaded\nby the water and despoiled of this ornament.\n\nAt dark, as it was not prudent to run, a place alongside the woods was\nhunted and to a tall gum-tree the boat was made fast for the night.\n\nA pretty quarter of the moon threw a pleasant light over forest and\nriver, making a picture that would be a delightful piece of landscape\nstudy, could an artist only hold it down to his canvas. The motion of\nthe engines had ceased, the puffing of the escaping steam was stilled,\nand the enveloping silence closed upon us, and such silence it was!\nUsually in a forest at night one can hear the piping of frogs, the hum\nof insects, or the dropping of limbs; but here nature was dumb. The dark\nrecesses, those aisles into this cathedral, gave forth no sound, and\neven the ripplings of the current die away.\n\nAt daylight Friday morning all hands were up, and up the Black we\nstarted. The morning was a beautiful one, and the river, which is\nremarkably straight, put on its loveliest garb. The blossoms of the haw\nperfumed the air deliciously, and a few birds whistled blithely along\nthe banks. The trees were larger, and the forest seemed of older growth\nthan below. More fields were passed than nearer the mouth, but the same\nscene presented itself--smoke-houses drifting out in the pastures,\nnegro quarters anchored in confusion against some oak, and the modest\nresidence just showing its eaves above water. The sun came up in a\nglory of carmine, and the trees were brilliant in their varied shades\nof green. Not a foot of soil is to be seen anywhere, and the water is\napparently growing deeper and deeper, for it reaches up to the branches\nof the largest trees. All along, the bordering willows have been denuded\nof leaves, showing how long the people have been at work gathering this\nfodder for their animals. An old man in a pirogue was asked how the\nwillow leaves agreed with his cattle. He stopped in his work, and with\nan ominous shake of his head replied: 'Well, sir, it 's enough to keep\nwarmth in their bodies and that's all we expect, but it's hard on the\nhogs, particularly the small ones. They is dropping off powerful fast.\nBut what can you do? It 's all we've got.'\n\nAt thirty miles above the mouth of Black River the water extends from\nNatchez on the Mississippi across to the pine hills of Louisiana, a\ndistance of seventy-three miles, and there is hardly a spot that is not\nten feet under it. The tendency of the current up the Black is toward\nthe west. In fact, so much is this the case, the waters of Red River\nhave been driven down from toward the Calcasieu country, and the waters\nof the Black enter the Red some fifteen miles above the mouth of the\nformer, a thing never before seen by even the oldest steamboatmen. The\nwater now in sight of us is entirely from the Mississippi.\n\nUp to Trinity, or rather Troy, which is but a short distance below,\nthe people have nearly all moved out, those remaining having enough for\ntheir present personal needs. Their cattle, though, are suffering and\ndying off quite fast, as the confinement on rafts and the food they get\nbreeds disease.\n\nAfter a short stop we started, and soon came to a section where there\nwere many open fields and cabins thickly scattered about. Here were seen\nmore pictures of distress. On the inside of the houses the inmates\nhad built on boxes a scaffold on which they placed the furniture. The\nbed-posts were sawed off on top, as the ceiling was not more than four\nfeet from the improvised floor. The buildings looked very insecure,\nand threatened every moment to float off. Near the houses were cattle\nstanding breast high in the water, perfectly impassive. They did not\nmove in their places, but stood patiently waiting for help to come. The\nsight was a distressing one, and the poor creatures will be sure to\ndie unless speedily rescued. Cattle differ from horses in this peculiar\nquality. A horse, after finding no relief comes, will swim off in search\nof food, whereas a beef will stand in its tracks until with exhaustion\nit drops in the water and drowns.\n\nAt half-past twelve o'clock a hail was given from a flat-boat inside the\nline of the bank. Rounding to we ran alongside, and General York stepped\naboard. He was just then engaged in getting off stock, and welcomed the\n'Times-Democrat' boat heartily, as he said there was much need for her.\nHe said that the distress was not exaggerated in the least. People were\nin a condition it was difficult even for one to imagine. The water was\nso high there was great danger of their houses being swept away. It had\nalready risen so high that it was approaching the eaves, and when it\nreaches this point there is always imminent risk of their being swept\naway. If this occurs, there will be great loss of life. The General\nspoke of the gallant work of many of the people in their attempts to\nsave their stock, but thought that fully twenty-five per cent. had\nperished. Already twenty-five hundred people had received rations from\nTroy, on Black River, and he had towed out a great many cattle, but a\nvery great quantity remained and were in dire need. The water was now\neighteen inches higher than in 1874, and there was no land between\nVidalia and the hills of Catahoula.\n\nAt two o'clock the 'Susie' reached Troy, sixty-five miles above the\nmouth of Black River. Here on the left comes in Little River; just\nbeyond that the Ouachita, and on the right the Tensas. These three\nrivers form the Black River. Troy, or a portion of it, is situated on\nand around three large Indian mounds, circular in shape, which rise\nabove the present water about twelve feet. They are about one hundred\nand fifty feet in diameter, and are about two hundred yards apart. The\nhouses are all built between these mounds, and hence are all flooded to\na depth of eighteen inches on their floors.\n\nThese elevations, built by the aborigines, hundreds of years ago, are\nthe only points of refuge for miles. When we arrived we found them\ncrowded with stock, all of which was thin and hardly able to stand up.\nThey were mixed together, sheep, hogs, horses, mules, and cattle. One of\nthese mounds has been used for many years as the grave-yard, and to-day\nwe saw attenuated cows lying against the marble tomb-stones, chewing\ntheir cud in contentment, after a meal of corn furnished by General\nYork. Here, as below, the remarkable skill of the women and girls in the\nmanagement of the smaller pirogues was noticed. Children were paddling\nabout in these most ticklish crafts with all the nonchalance of adepts.\n\nGeneral York has put into operation a perfect system in regard to\nfurnishing relief. He makes a personal inspection of the place where it\nis asked, sees what is necessary to be done, and then, having two boats\nchartered, with flats, sends them promptly to the place, when the cattle\nare loaded and towed to the pine hills and uplands of Catahoula. He\nhas made Troy his headquarters, and to this point boats come for their\nsupply of feed for cattle. On the opposite side of Little River, which\nbranches to the left out of Black, and between it and the Ouachita,\nis situated the town of Trinity, which is hourly threatened with\ndestruction. It is much lower than Troy, and the water is eight and nine\nfeet deep in the houses. A strong current sweeps through it, and it is\nremarkable that all of its houses have not gone before. The residents of\nboth Troy and Trinity have been cared for, yet some of their stock have\nto be furnished with food.\n\nAs soon as the 'Susie' reached Troy, she was turned over to General\nYork, and placed at his disposition to carry out the work of relief more\nrapidly. Nearly all her supplies were landed on one of the mounds to\nlighten her, and she was headed down stream to relieve those below.\nAt Tom Hooper's place, a few miles from Troy, a large flat, with about\nfifty head of stock on board, was taken in tow. The animals were fed,\nand soon regained some strength. To-day we go on Little River, where the\nsuffering is greatest.\n\nDOWN BLACK RIVER\n\nSaturday Evening, March 25.\n\nWe started down Black River quite early, under the direction of General\nYork, to bring out what stock could be reached. Going down river a flat\nin tow was left in a central locality, and from there men poled her back\nin the rear of plantations, picking up the animals wherever found. In\nthe loft of a gin-house there were seventeen head found, and after a\ngangway was built they were led down into the flat without difficulty.\nTaking a skiff with the General, your reporter was pulled up to a little\nhouse of two rooms, in which the water was standing two feet on the\nfloors. In one of the large rooms were huddled the horses and cows of\nthe place, while in the other the Widow Taylor and her son were seated\non a scaffold raised on the floor. One or two dug-outs were drifting\nabout in the roam ready to be put in service at any time. When the flat\nwas brought up, the side of the house was cut away as the only means of\ngetting the animals out, and the cattle were driven on board the boat.\nGeneral York, in this as in every case, inquired if the family desired\nto leave, informing them that Major Burke, of 'The Times-Democrat,' has\nsent the 'Susie' up for that purpose. Mrs. Taylor said she thanked Major\nBurke, but she would try and hold out. The remarkable tenacity of the\npeople here to their homes is beyond all comprehension. Just below, at\na point sixteen miles from Troy, information was received that the\nhouse of Mr. Tom Ellis was in danger, and his family were all in it. We\nsteamed there immediately, and a sad picture was presented. Looking out\nof the half of the window left above water, was Mrs. Ellis, who is in\nfeeble health, whilst at the door were her seven children, the oldest\nnot fourteen years. One side of the house was given up to the work\nanimals, some twelve head, besides hogs. In the next room the family\nlived, the water coming within two inches of the bed-rail. The stove was\nbelow water, and the cooking was done on a fire on top of it. The house\nthreatened to give way at any moment: one end of it was sinking, and,\nin fact, the building looked a mere shell. As the boat rounded to, Mr.\nEllis came out in a dug-out, and General York told him that he had come\nto his relief; that 'The Times-Democrat' boat was at his service, and\nwould remove his family at once to the hills, and on Monday a flat\nwould take out his stock, as, until that time, they would be busy.\nNotwithstanding the deplorable situation himself and family were in,\nMr. Ellis did not want to leave. He said he thought he would wait until\nMonday, and take the risk of his house falling. The children around the\ndoor looked perfectly contented, seeming to care little for the danger\nthey were in. These are but two instances of the many. After weeks of\nprivation and suffering, people still cling to their houses and leave\nonly when there is not room between the water and the ceiling to build\na scaffold on which to stand. It seemed to be incomprehensible, yet the\nlove for the old place was stronger than that for safety.\n\nAfter leaving the Ellis place, the next spot touched at was the Oswald\nplace. Here the flat was towed alongside the gin-house where there were\nfifteen head standing in water; and yet, as they stood on scaffolds,\ntheir heads were above the top of the entrance. It was found impossible\nto get them out without cutting away a portion of the front; and so\naxes were brought into requisition and a gap made. After much labor the\nhorses and mules were securely placed on the flat.\n\nAt each place we stop there are always three, four, or more dug-outs\narriving, bringing information of stock in other places in need.\nNotwithstanding the fact that a great many had driven a part of their\nstock to the hills some time ago, there yet remains a large quantity,\nwhich General York, who is working with indomitable energy, will get\nlanded in the pine hills by Tuesday.\n\nAll along Black River the 'Susie' has been visited by scores of\nplanters, whose tales are the repetition of those already heard of\nsuffering and loss. An old planter, who has lived on the river since\n1844, said there never was such a rise, and he was satisfied more than\none quarter of the stock has been lost. Luckily the people cared first\nfor their work stock, and when they could find it horses and mules were\nhoused in a place of safety. The rise which still continues, and was two\ninches last night, compels them to get them out to the hills; hence it\nis that the work of General York is of such a great value. From daylight\nto late at night he is going this way and that, cheering by his\nkindly words and directing with calm judgment what is to be done. One\nunpleasant story, of a certain merchant in New Orleans, is told all\nalong the river. It appears for some years past the planters have been\ndealing with this individual, and many of them had balances in his\nhands. When the overflow came they wrote for coffee, for meal, and, in\nfact, for such little necessities as were required. No response to these\nletters came, and others were written, and yet these old customers, with\nplantations under water, were refused even what was necessary to sustain\nlife. It is needless to say he is not popular now on Back River.\n\nThe hills spoken of as the place of refuge for the people and stock on\nBlack River are in Catahoula parish, twenty-four miles from Black River.\n\nAfter filling the flat with cattle we took on board the family of T. S.\nHooper, seven in number, who could not longer remain in their dwelling,\nand we are now taking them up Little River to the hills.\n\nTHE FLOOD STILL RISING\n\nTroy: March 27, 1882, noon.\n\nThe flood here is rising about three and a half inches every twenty-four\nhours, and rains have set in which will increase this. General York\nfeels now that our efforts ought to be directed towards saving life, as\nthe increase of the water has jeopardized many houses. We intend to\ngo up the Tensas in a few minutes, and then we will return and go\ndown Black River to take off families. There is a lack of steam\ntransportation here to meet the emergency. The General has three boats\nchartered, with flats in tow, but the demand for these to tow out stock\nis greater than they can meet with promptness. All are working night and\nday, and the 'Susie' hardly stops for more than an hour anywhere. The\nrise has placed Trinity in a dangerous plight, and momentarily it\nis expected that some of the houses will float off. Troy is a little\nhigher, yet all are in the water. Reports have come in that a woman\nand child have been washed away below here, and two cabins floated\noff. Their occupants are the same who refused to come off day before\nyesterday. One would not believe the utter passiveness of the people.\n\nAs yet no news has been received of the steamer 'Delia,' which is\nsupposed to be the one sunk in yesterday's storm on Lake Catahoula.\nShe is due here now, but has not arrived. Even the mail here is most\nuncertain, and this I send by skiff to Natchez to get it to you. It is\nimpossible to get accurate data as to past crops, etc., as those who\nknow much about the matter have gone, and those who remain are not well\nversed in the production of this section.\n\nGeneral York desires me to say that the amount of rations formerly sent\nshould be duplicated and sent at once. It is impossible to make any\nestimate, for the people are fleeing to the hills, so rapid is the\nrise. The residents here are in a state of commotion that can only be\nappreciated when seen, and complete demoralization has set in.\n\nIf rations are drawn for any particular section hereabouts, they would\nnot be certain to be distributed, so everything should be sent to Troy\nas a center, and the General will have it properly disposed of. He\nhas sent for one hundred tents, and, if all go to the hills who are in\nmotion now, two hundred will be required.\n\nAPPENDIX B\n\nTHE MISSISSIPPI RIVER COMMISSION\n\nTHE condition of this rich valley of the Lower Mississippi, immediately\nafter and since the war, constituted one of the disastrous effects of\nwar most to be deplored. Fictitious property in slaves was not only\nrighteously destroyed, but very much of the work which had depended upon\nthe slave labor was also destroyed or greatly impaired, especially the\nlevee system.\n\nIt might have been expected by those who have not investigated the\nsubject, that such important improvements as the construction and\nmaintenance of the levees would have been assumed at once by the several\nStates. But what can the State do where the people are under subjection\nto rates of interest ranging from 18 to 30 per cent., and are also under\nthe necessity of pledging their crops in advance even of planting, at\nthese rates, for the privilege of purchasing all of their supplies at\n100 per cent. profit?\n\nIt has needed but little attention to make it perfectly obvious that\nthe control of the Mississippi River, if undertaken at all, must be\nundertaken by the national government, and cannot be compassed by\nStates. The river must be treated as a unit; its control cannot be\ncompassed under a divided or separate system of administration.\n\nNeither are the States especially interested competent to combine among\nthemselves for the necessary operations. The work must begin far up the\nriver; at least as far as Cairo, if not beyond; and must be conducted\nupon a consistent general plan throughout the course of the river.\n\nIt does not need technical or scientific knowledge to comprehend the\nelements of the case if one will give a little time and attention to the\nsubject, and when a Mississippi River commission has been constituted,\nas the existing commission is, of thoroughly able men of different walks\nin life, may it not be suggested that their verdict in the case should\nbe accepted as conclusive, so far as any a priori theory of construction\nor control can be considered conclusive?\n\nIt should be remembered that upon this board are General Gilmore,\nGeneral Comstock, and General Suter, of the United States Engineers;\nProfessor Henry Mitchell (the most competent authority on the question\nof hydrography), of the United States Coast Survey; B. B. Harrod,\nthe State Engineer of Louisiana; Jas. B. Eads, whose success with the\njetties at New Orleans is a warrant of his competency, and Judge Taylor,\nof Indiana.\n\nIt would be presumption on the part of any single man, however skilled,\nto contest the judgment of such a board as this.\n\nThe method of improvement proposed by the commission is at once in\naccord with the results of engineering experience and with observations\nof nature where meeting our wants. As in nature the growth of trees and\ntheir proneness where undermined to fall across the slope and support\nthe bank secures at some points a fair depth of channel and some degree\nof permanence, so in the project of the engineer the use of timber and\nbrush and the encouragement of forest growth are the main features. It\nis proposed to reduce the width where excessive by brushwood dykes, at\nfirst low, but raised higher and higher as the mud of the river settles\nunder their shelter, and finally slope them back at the angle upon which\nwillows will grow freely. In this work there are many details connected\nwith the forms of these shelter dykes, their arrangements so as to\npresent a series of settling basins, etc., a description of which would\nonly complicate the conception. Through the larger part of the river\nworks of contraction will not be required, but nearly all the banks\non the concave side of the beds must be held against the wear of the\nstream, and much of the opposite banks defended at critical points.\nThe works having in view this conservative object may be generally\ndesignated works of revetment; and these also will be largely of\nbrushwood, woven in continuous carpets, or twined into wire-netting.\nThis veneering process has been successfully employed on the Missouri\nRiver; and in some cases they have so covered themselves with sediments,\nand have become so overgrown with willows, that they may be regarded as\npermanent. In securing these mats rubble-stone is to be used in small\nquantities, and in some instances the dressed slope between high and low\nriver will have to be more or less paved with stone.\n\nAny one who has been on the Rhine will have observed operations not\nunlike those to which we have just referred; and, indeed, most of the\nrivers of Europe flowing among their own alluvia have required similar\ntreatment in the interest of navigation and agriculture.\n\nThe levee is the crowning work of bank revetment, although not\nnecessarily in immediate connection. It may be set back a short distance\nfrom the revetted bank; but it is, in effect, the requisite parapet.\nThe flood river and the low river cannot be brought into register, and\ncompelled to unite in the excavation of a single permanent channel,\nwithout a complete control of all the stages; and even the abnormal rise\nmust be provided against, because this would endanger the levee, and\nonce in force behind the works of revetment would tear them also away.\n\nUnder the general principle that the local slope of a river is the\nresult and measure of the resistance of its bed, it is evident that\na narrow and deep stream should have less slope, because it has less\nfrictional surface in proportion to capacity; i.e., less perimeter in\nproportion to area of cross section. The ultimate effect of levees and\nrevetments confining the floods and bringing all the stages of the river\ninto register is to deepen the channel and let down the slope. The first\neffect of the levees is to raise the surface; but this, by inducing\ngreater velocity of flow, inevitably causes an enlargement of section,\nand if this enlargement is prevented from being made at the expense of\nthe banks, the bottom must give way and the form of the waterway be so\nimproved as to admit this flow with less rise. The actual experience\nwith levees upon the Mississippi River, with no attempt to hold the\nbanks, has been favorable, and no one can doubt, upon the evidence\nfurnished in the reports of the commission, that if the earliest levees\nhad been accompanied by revetment of banks, and made complete, we should\nhave to-day a river navigable at low water, and an adjacent country safe\nfrom inundation.\n\nOf course it would be illogical to conclude that the constrained river\ncan ever lower its flood slope so as to make levees unnecessary, but it\nis believed that, by this lateral constraint, the river as a conduit may\nbe so improved in form that even those rare floods which result from the\ncoincident rising of many tributaries will find vent without destroying\nlevees of ordinary height. That the actual capacity of a channel through\nalluvium depends upon its service during floods has been often shown,\nbut this capacity does not include anomalous, but recurrent, floods.\n\nIt is hardly worth while to consider the projects for relieving\nthe Mississippi River floods by creating new outlets, since these\nsensational propositions have commended themselves only to unthinking\nminds, and have no support among engineers. Were the river bed\ncast-iron, a resort to openings for surplus waters might be a necessity;\nbut as the bottom is yielding, and the best form of outlet is a single\ndeep channel, as realizing the least ratio of perimeter to area of\ncross section, there could not well be a more unphilosophical method of\ntreatment than the multiplication of avenues of escape.\n\nIn the foregoing statement the attempt has been made to condense in\nas limited a space as the importance of the subject would permit,\nthe general elements of the problem, and the general features of the\nproposed method of improvement which has been adopted by the Mississippi\nRiver Commission.\n\nThe writer cannot help feeling that it is somewhat presumptuous on his\npart to attempt to present the facts relating to an enterprise which\ncalls for the highest scientific skill; but it is a matter which\ninterests every citizen of the United States, and is one of the methods\nof reconstruction which ought to be approved. It is a war claim which\nimplies no private gain, and no compensation except for one of the cases\nof destruction incident to war, which may well be repaired by the people\nof the whole country.\n\nEDWARD ATKINSON.\n\nBoston: April 14, 1882.\n\nAPPENDIX C\n\nRECEPTION OF CAPTAIN BASIL HALL'S BOOK IN THE UNITED STATES\n\nHAVING now arrived nearly at the end of our travels, I am induced, ere I\nconclude, again to mention what I consider as one of the most remarkable\ntraits in the national character of the Americans; namely, their\nexquisite sensitiveness and soreness respecting everything said or\nwritten concerning them. Of this, perhaps, the most remarkable example I\ncan give is the effect produced on nearly every class of readers by the\nappearance of Captain Basil Hall's 'Travels in North America.' In fact,\nit was a sort of moral earthquake, and the vibration it occasioned\nthrough the nerves of the republic, from one corner of the Union to\nthe other, was by no means over when I left the country in July 1831, a\ncouple of years after the shock.\n\nI was in Cincinnati when these volumes came out, but it was not till\nJuly 1830, that I procured a copy of them. One bookseller to whom I\napplied told me that he had had a few copies before he understood the\nnature of the work, but that, after becoming acquainted with it, nothing\nshould induce him to sell another. Other persons of his profession must,\nhowever, have been less scrupulous; for the book was read in city, town,\nvillage, and hamlet, steamboat, and stage-coach, and a sort of war-whoop\nwas sent forth perfectly unprecedented in my recollection upon any\noccasion whatever.\n\nAn ardent desire for approbation, and a delicate sensitiveness under\ncensure, have always, I believe, been considered as amiable traits of\ncharacter; but the condition into which the appearance of Captain Hall's\nwork threw the republic shows plainly that these feelings, if carried to\nexcess, produce a weakness which amounts to imbecility.\n\nIt was perfectly astonishing to hear men who, on other subjects, were\nof some judgment, utter their opinions upon this. I never heard of any\ninstance in which the commonsense generally found in national criticism\nwas so overthrown by passion. I do not speak of the want of justice, and\nof fair and liberal interpretation: these, perhaps, were hardly to be\nexpected. Other nations have been called thin-skinned, but the citizens\nof the Union have, apparently, no skins at all; they wince if a breeze\nblows over them, unless it be tempered with adulation. It was not,\ntherefore, very surprising that the acute and forcible observations of a\ntraveler they knew would be listened to should be received testily. The\nextraordinary features of the business were, first, the excess of the\nrage into which they lashed themselves; and, secondly, the puerility of\nthe inventions by which they attempted to account for the severity with\nwhich they fancied they had been treated.\n\nNot content with declaring that the volumes contained no word of truth,\nfrom beginning to end (which is an assertion I heard made very nearly as\noften as they were mentioned), the whole country set to work to discover\nthe causes why Captain Hall had visited the United States, and why he\nhad published his book.\n\nI have heard it said with as much precision and gravity as if the\nstatement had been conveyed by an official report, that Captain Hall\nhad been sent out by the British Government expressly for the purpose\nof checking the growing admiration of England for the Government of the\nUnited States,--that it was by a commission from the treasury he had\ncome, and that it was only in obedience to orders that he had found\nanything to object to.\n\nI do not give this as the gossip of a coterie; I am persuaded that it is\nthe belief of a very considerable portion of the country. So deep is\nthe conviction of this singular people that they cannot be seen without\nbeing admired, that they will not admit the possibility that any one\nshould honestly and sincerely find aught to disapprove in them or their\ncountry.\n\nThe American Reviews are, many of them, I believe, well known in\nEngland; I need not, therefore, quote them here, but I sometimes\nwondered that they, none of them, ever thought of translating Obadiah's\ncurse into classic American; if they had done so, on placing (he, Basil\nHall) between brackets, instead of (he, Obadiah) it would have saved\nthem a world of trouble.\n\nI can hardly describe the curiosity with which I sat down at length\nto peruse these tremendous volumes; still less can I do justice to my\nsurprise at their contents. To say that I found not one exaggerated\nstatement throughout the work is by no means saying enough. It is\nimpossible for any one who knows the country not to see that Captain\nHall earnestly sought out things to admire and commend. When he praises,\nit is with evident pleasure; and when he finds fault, it is with evident\nreluctance and restraint, excepting where motives purely patriotic urge\nhim to state roundly what it is for the benefit of his country should be\nknown.\n\nIn fact, Captain Hall saw the country to the greatest possible\nadvantage. Furnished, of course, with letters of introduction to the\nmost distinguished individuals, and with the still more influential\nrecommendation of his own reputation, he was received in full\ndrawing-room style and state from one end of the Union to the other.\nHe saw the country in full dress, and had little or no opportunity\nof judging of it unhouselled, unanointed, unannealed, with all its\nimperfections on its head, as I and my family too often had.\n\nCaptain Hall had certainly excellent opportunities of making himself\nacquainted with the form of the government and the laws; and of\nreceiving, moreover, the best oral commentary upon them, in conversation\nwith the most distinguished citizens. Of these opportunities he made\nexcellent use; nothing important met his eye which did not receive that\nsort of analytical attention which an experienced and philosophical\ntraveler alone can give. This has made his volumes highly interesting\nand valuable; but I am deeply persuaded, that were a man of equal\npenetration to visit the United States with no other means of becoming\nacquainted with the national character than the ordinary working-day\nintercourse of life, he would conceive an infinitely lower idea of the\nmoral atmosphere of the country than Captain Hall appears to have done;\nand the internal conviction on my mind is strong, that if Captain\nHall had not placed a firm restraint on himself, he must have given\nexpression to far deeper indignation than any he has uttered against\nmany points in the American character, with which he shows from other\ncircumstances that he was well acquainted. His rule appears to have been\nto state just so much of the truth as would leave on the mind of his\nreaders a correct impression, at the least cost of pain to the sensitive\nfolks he was writing about. He states his own opinions and feelings, and\nleaves it to be inferred that he has good grounds for adopting them;\nbut he spares the Americans the bitterness which a detail of the\ncircumstances would have produced.\n\nIf any one chooses to say that some wicked antipathy to twelve millions\nof strangers is the origin of my opinion, I must bear it; and were the\nquestion one of mere idle speculation, I certainly would not court the\nabuse I must meet for stating it. But it is not so.\n\n. . . . . . .\n\nThe candor which he expresses, and evidently feels, they mistake for\nirony, or totally distrust; his unwillingness to give pain to\npersons from whom he has received kindness, they scornfully reject as\naffectation, and although they must know right well, in their own secret\nhearts, how infinitely more they lay at his mercy than he has chosen to\nbetray; they pretend, even to themselves, that he has exaggerated the\nbad points of their character and institutions; whereas, the truth is,\nthat he has let them off with a degree of tenderness which may be quite\nsuitable for him to exercise, however little merited; while, at the\nsame time, he has most industriously magnified their merits, whenever he\ncould possibly find anything favorable.\n\nAPPENDIX D\n\nTHE UNDYING HEAD\n\nIN a remote part of the North lived a man and his sister, who had never\nseen a human being. Seldom, if ever, had the man any cause to go from\nhome; for, as his wants demanded food, he had only to go a little\ndistance from the lodge, and there, in some particular spot, place his\narrows, with their barbs in the ground. Telling his sister where they\nhad been placed, every morning she would go in search, and never fail\nof finding each stuck through the heart of a deer. She had then only to\ndrag them into the lodge and prepare their food. Thus she lived till she\nattained womanhood, when one day her brother, whose name was Iamo, said\nto her: 'Sister, the time is at hand when you will be ill. Listen to my\nadvice. If you do not, it will probably be the cause of my death. Take\nthe implements with which we kindle our fires. Go some distance from our\nlodge and build a separate fire. When you are in want of food, I will\ntell you where to find it. You must cook for yourself, and I will for\nmyself. When you are ill, do not attempt to come near the lodge, or\nbring any of the utensils you use. Be sure always to fasten to your belt\nthe implements you need, for you do not know when the time will come. As\nfor myself, I must do the best I can.' His sister promised to obey him\nin all he had said.\n\nShortly after, her brother had cause to go from home. She was alone in\nher lodge, combing her hair. She had just untied the belt to which the\nimplements were fastened, when suddenly the event, to which her brother\nhad alluded, occurred. She ran out of the lodge, but in her haste forgot\nthe belt. Afraid to return, she stood for some time thinking. Finally,\nshe decided to enter the lodge and get it. For, thought she, my brother\nis not at home, and I will stay but a moment to catch hold of it. She\nwent back. Running in suddenly, she caught hold of it, and was coming\nout when her brother came in sight. He knew what was the matter. 'Oh,'\nhe said, 'did I not tell you to take care. But now you have killed me.'\nShe was going on her way, but her brother said to her, 'What can you\ndo there now. The accident has happened. Go in, and stay where you have\nalways stayed. And what will become of you? You have killed me.'\n\nHe then laid aside his hunting-dress and accoutrements, and soon after\nboth his feet began to turn black, so that he could not move. Still he\ndirected his sister where to place the arrows, that she might always\nhave food. The inflammation continued to increase, and had now reached\nhis first rib; and he said: 'Sister, my end is near. You must do as\nI tell you. You see my medicine-sack, and my war-club tied to it. It\ncontains all my medicines, and my war-plumes, and my paints of all\ncolors. As soon as the inflammation reaches my breast, you will take my\nwar-club. It has a sharp point, and you will cut off my head. When it is\nfree from my body, take it, place its neck in the sack, which you must\nopen at one end. Then hang it up in its former place. Do not forget\nmy bow and arrows. One of the last you will take to procure food. The\nremainder, tie in my sack, and then hang it up, so that I can look\ntowards the door. Now and then I will speak to you, but not often.' His\nsister again promised to obey.\n\nIn a little time his breast was affected. 'Now,' said he, 'take the\nclub and strike off my head.' She was afraid, but he told her to muster\ncourage. 'Strike,' said he, and a smile was on his face. Mustering all\nher courage, she gave the blow and cut off the head. 'Now,' said the\nhead, 'place me where I told you.' And fearfully she obeyed it in all\nits commands. Retaining its animation, it looked around the lodge\nas usual, and it would command its sister to go in such places as it\nthought would procure for her the flesh of different animals she needed.\nOne day the head said: 'The time is not distant when I shall be freed\nfrom this situation, and I shall have to undergo many sore evils. So\nthe superior manito decrees, and I must bear all patiently.' In this\nsituation we must leave the head.\n\nIn a certain part of the country was a village inhabited by a numerous\nand warlike band of Indians. In this village was a family of ten young\nmen--brothers. It was in the spring of the year that the youngest of\nthese blackened his face and fasted. His dreams were propitious. Having\nended his fast, he went secretly for his brothers at night, so that none\nin the village could overhear or find out the direction they intended\nto go. Though their drum was heard, yet that was a common occurrence.\nHaving ended the usual formalities, he told how favorable his dreams\nwere, and that he had called them together to know if they would\naccompany him in a war excursion. They all answered they would. The\nthird brother from the eldest, noted for his oddities, coming up with\nhis war-club when his brother had ceased speaking, jumped up. 'Yes,'\nsaid he, 'I will go, and this will be the way I will treat those I am\ngoing to fight;' and he struck the post in the center of the lodge, and\ngave a yell. The others spoke to him, saying: 'Slow, slow, Mudjikewis,\nwhen you are in other people's lodges.' So he sat down. Then, in turn,\nthey took the drum, and sang their songs, and closed with a feast. The\nyoungest told them not to whisper their intention to their wives, but\nsecretly to prepare for their journey. They all promised obedience, and\nMudjikewis was the first to say so.\n\nThe time for their departure drew near. Word was given to assemble on a\ncertain night, when they would depart immediately. Mudjikewis was loud\nin his demands for his moccasins. Several times his wife asked him the\nreason. 'Besides,' said she, 'you have a good pair on.' 'Quick, quick,'\nsaid he, 'since you must know, we are going on a war excursion; so be\nquick.' He thus revealed the secret. That night they met and started.\nThe snow was on the ground, and they traveled all night, lest others\nshould follow them. When it was daylight, the leader took snow and made\na ball of it, then tossing it into the air, he said: 'It was in this way\nI saw snow fall in a dream, so that I could not be tracked.' And he told\nthem to keep close to each other for fear of losing themselves, as the\nsnow began to fall in very large flakes. Near as they walked, it was\nwith difficulty they could see each other. The snow continued falling\nall that day and the following night, so it was impossible to track\nthem.\n\nThey had now walked for several days, and Mudjikewis was always in\nthe rear. One day, running suddenly forward, he gave the\n_saw-saw-quan_,{footnote [War-whoop.]} and struck a tree with his\nwar-club, and it broke into pieces as if struck with lightning.\n'Brothers,' said he, 'this will be the way I will serve those we are\ngoing to fight.' The leader answered, 'Slow, slow, Mudjikewis, the one I\nlead you to is not to be thought of so lightly.' Again he fell back and\nthought to himself: 'What! what! who can this be he is leading us to?'\nHe felt fearful and was silent. Day after day they traveled on, till\nthey came to an extensive plain, on the borders of which human bones\nwere bleaching in the sun. The leader spoke: 'They are the bones of\nthose who have gone before us. None has ever yet returned to tell the\nsad tale of their fate.' Again Mudjikewis became restless, and, running\nforward, gave the accustomed yell. Advancing to a large rock which stood\nabove the ground, he struck it, and it fell to pieces. 'See, brothers,'\nsaid he, 'thus will I treat those whom we are going to fight.' 'Still,\nstill,' once more said the leader; 'he to whom I am leading you is not\nto be compared to the rock.'\n\nMudjikewis fell back thoughtful, saying to himself: 'I wonder who\nthis can be that he is going to attack;' and he was afraid. Still they\ncontinued to see the remains of former warriors, who had been to the\nplace where they were now going, some of whom had retreated as far back\nas the place where they first saw the bones, beyond which no one had\never escaped. At last they came to a piece of rising ground, from which\nthey plainly distinguished, sleeping on a distant mountain, a mammoth\nbear.\n\nThe distance between them was very great, but the size of the animal\ncaused him to be plainly seen. 'There,' said the leader, 'it is he to\nwhom I am leading you; here our troubles will commence, for he is a\nmishemokwa and a manito. It is he who has that we prize so dearly (i.e.\nwampum), to obtain which, the warriors whose bones we saw, sacrificed\ntheir lives. You must not be fearful: be manly. We shall find him\nasleep.' Then the leader went forward and touched the belt around the\nanimal's neck. 'This,' said he, 'is what we must get. It contains the\nwampum.' Then they requested the eldest to try and slip the belt over\nthe bear's head, who appeared to be fast asleep, as he was not in the\nleast disturbed by the attempt to obtain the belt. All their efforts\nwere in vain, till it came to the one next the youngest. He tried, and\nthe belt moved nearly over the monster's head, but he could get it no\nfarther. Then the youngest one, and the leader, made his attempt, and\nsucceeded. Placing it on the back of the oldest, he said, 'Now we must\nrun,' and off they started. When one became fatigued with its weight,\nanother would relieve him. Thus they ran till they had passed the bones\nof all former warriors, and were some distance beyond, when looking\nback, they saw the monster slowly rising. He stood some time before he\nmissed his wampum. Soon they heard his tremendous howl, like distant\nthunder, slowly filling all the sky; and then they heard him speak and\nsay, 'Who can it be that has dared to steal my wampum? earth is not\nso large but that I can find them;' and he descended from the hill in\npursuit. As if convulsed, the earth shook with every jump he made. Very\nsoon he approached the party. They, however, kept the belt, exchanging\nit from one to another, and encouraging each other; but he gained on\nthem fast. 'Brothers,' said the leader, 'has never any one of you,\nwhen fasting, dreamed of some friendly spirit who would aid you as a\nguardian?' A dead silence followed. 'Well,' said he, 'fasting, I dreamed\nof being in danger of instant death, when I saw a small lodge, with\nsmoke curling from its top. An old man lived in it, and I dreamed he\nhelped me; and may it be verified soon,' he said, running forward and\ngiving the peculiar yell, and a howl as if the sounds came from the\ndepths of his stomach, and what is called _checaudum_. Getting upon a\npiece of rising ground, behold! a lodge, with smoke curling from its\ntop, appeared. This gave them all new strength, and they ran forward\nand entered it. The leader spoke to the old man who sat in the lodge,\nsaying, 'Nemesho, help us; we claim your protection, for the great bear\nwill kill us.' 'Sit down and eat, my grandchildren,' said the old man.\n'Who is a great manito?' said he. 'There is none but me; but let me\nlook,' and he opened the door of the lodge, when, lo! at a little\ndistance he saw the enraged animal coming on, with slow but powerful\nleaps. He closed the door. 'Yes,' said he, 'he is indeed a great manito:\nmy grandchildren, you will be the cause of my losing my life; you asked\nmy protection, and I granted it; so now, come what may, I will protect\nyou. When the bear arrives at the door, you must run out of the other\ndoor of the lodge.' Then putting his hand to the side of the lodge where\nhe sat, he brought out a bag which he opened. Taking out two small\nblack dogs, he placed them before him. 'These are the ones I use when I\nfight,' said he; and he commenced patting with both hands the sides of\none of them, and he began to swell out, so that he soon filled the lodge\nby his bulk; and he had great strong teeth. When he attained his full\nsize he growled, and from that moment, as from instinct, he jumped out\nat the door and met the bear, who in another leap would have reached the\nlodge. A terrible combat ensued. The skies rang with the howls of the\nfierce monsters. The remaining dog soon took the field. The brothers,\nat the onset, took the advice of the old man, and escaped through the\nopposite side of the lodge. They had not proceeded far before they heard\nthe dying cry of one of the dogs, and soon after of the other. 'Well,'\nsaid the leader, 'the old man will share their fate: so run; he will\nsoon be after us.' They started with fresh vigor, for they had received\nfood from the old man: but very soon the bear came in sight, and again\nwas fast gaining upon them. Again the leader asked the brothers if they\ncould do nothing for their safety. All were silent. The leader, running\nforward, did as before. 'I dreamed,' he cried, 'that, being in great\ntrouble, an old man helped me who was a manito; we shall soon see his\nlodge.' Taking courage, they still went on. After going a short distance\nthey saw the lodge of the old manito. They entered immediately and\nclaimed his protection, telling him a manito was after them. The old\nman, setting meat before them, said: 'Eat! who is a manito? there is no\nmanito but me; there is none whom I fear;' and the earth trembled as\nthe monster advanced. The old man opened the door and saw him coming.\nHe shut it slowly, and said: 'Yes, my grandchildren, you have brought\ntrouble upon me.' Procuring his medicine-sack, he took out his small\nwar-clubs of black stone, and told the young men to run through the\nother side of the lodge. As he handled the clubs, they became very\nlarge, and the old man stepped out just as the bear reached the door.\nThen striking him with one of the clubs, it broke in pieces; the bear\nstumbled. Renewing the attempt with the other war-club, that also was\nbroken, but the bear fell senseless. Each blow the old man gave him\nsounded like a clap of thunder, and the howls of the bear ran along till\nthey filled the heavens.\n\nThe young men had now run some distance, when they looked back. They\ncould see that the bear was recovering from the blows. First he moved\nhis paws, and soon they saw him rise on his feet. The old man shared\nthe fate of the first, for they now heard his cries as he was torn in\npieces. Again the monster was in pursuit, and fast overtaking them. Not\nyet discouraged, the young men kept on their way; but the bear was now\nso close, that the leader once more applied to his brothers, but they\ncould do nothing. 'Well,' said he, 'my dreams will soon be exhausted;\nafter this I have but one more.' He advanced, invoking his guardian\nspirit to aid him. 'Once,' said he, 'I dreamed that, being sorely\npressed, I came to a large lake, on the shore of which was a canoe,\npartly out of water, having ten paddles all in readiness. Do not fear,'\nhe cried, 'we shall soon get it.' And so it was, even as he had said.\nComing to the lake, they saw the canoe with ten paddles, and immediately\nthey embarked. Scarcely had they reached the center of the lake, when\nthey saw the bear arrive at its borders. Lifting himself on his hind\nlegs, he looked all around. Then he waded into the water; then losing\nhis footing he turned back, and commenced making the circuit of the\nlake. Meantime the party remained stationary in the center to watch his\nmovements. He traveled all around, till at last he came to the place\nfrom whence he started. Then he commenced drinking up the water, and\nthey saw the current fast setting in towards his open mouth. The leader\nencouraged them to paddle hard for the opposite shore. When only a short\ndistance from land, the current had increased so much, that they were\ndrawn back by it, and all their efforts to reach it were in vain.\n\nThen the leader again spoke, telling them to meet their fates manfully.\n'Now is the time, Mudjikewis,' said he, 'to show your prowess. Take\ncourage and sit at the bow of the canoe; and when it approaches his\nmouth, try what effect your club will have on his head.' He obeyed, and\nstood ready to give the blow; while the leader, who steered, directed\nthe canoe for the open mouth of the monster.\n\nRapidly advancing, they were just about to enter his mouth, when\nMudjikewis struck him a tremendous blow on the head, and gave the\n_saw-saw-quan_. The bear's limbs doubled under him, and he fell, stunned\nby the blow. But before Mudjikewis could renew it, the monster disgorged\nall the water he had drank, with a force which sent the canoe with great\nvelocity to the opposite shore. Instantly leaving the canoe, again they\nfled, and on they went till they were completely exhausted. The earth\nagain shook, and soon they saw the monster hard after them. Their\nspirits drooped, and they felt discouraged. The leader exerted himself,\nby actions and words, to cheer them up; and once more he asked them if\nthey thought of nothing, or could do nothing for their rescue; and, as\nbefore, all were silent. 'Then,' he said, 'this is the last time I can\napply to my guardian spirit. Now, if we do not succeed, our fates are\ndecided.' He ran forward, invoking his spirit with great earnestness,\nand gave the yell. 'We shall soon arrive,' said he to his brothers, 'at\nthe place where my last guardian spirit dwells. In him I place great\nconfidence. Do not, do not be afraid, or your limbs will be fear-bound.\nWe shall soon reach his lodge. Run, run,' he cried.\n\nReturning now to Iamo, he had passed all the time in the same condition\nwe had left him, the head directing his sister, in order to procure\nfood, where to place the magic arrows, and speaking at long intervals.\nOne day the sister saw the eyes of the head brighten, as if with\npleasure. At last it spoke. 'Oh, sister,' it said, 'in what a pitiful\nsituation you have been the cause of placing me! Soon, very soon, a\nparty of young men will arrive and apply to me for aid; but alas! How\ncan I give what I would have done with so much pleasure? Nevertheless,\ntake two arrows, and place them where you have been in the habit of\nplacing the others, and have meat prepared and cooked before they\narrive. When you hear them coming and calling on my name, go out and\nsay, “Alas! it is long ago that an accident befell him. I was the cause\nof it.” If they still come near, ask them in, and set meat before them.\nAnd now you must follow my directions strictly. When the bear is near,\ngo out and meet him. You will take my medicine-sack, bows and arrows,\nand my head. You must then untie the sack, and spread out before you my\npaints of all colors, my war-eagle feathers, my tufts of dried hair,\nand whatever else it contains. As the bear approaches, you will take\nall these articles, one by one, and say to him, “This is my deceased\nbrother's paint,” and so on with all the other articles, throwing each\nof them as far as you can. The virtues contained in them will cause him\nto totter; and, to complete his destruction, you will take my head, and\nthat too you will cast as far off as you can, crying aloud, “See, this\nis my deceased brother's head.” He will then fall senseless. By this\ntime the young men will have eaten, and you will call them to your\nassistance. You must then cut the carcass into pieces, yes, into small\npieces, and scatter them to the four winds; for, unless you do this, he\nwill again revive.' She promised that all should be done as he said.\nShe had only time to prepare the meat, when the voice of the leader\nwas heard calling upon Iamo for aid. The woman went out and said as her\nbrother had directed. But the war party being closely pursued, came\nup to the lodge. She invited them in, and placed the meat before them.\nWhile they were eating, they heard the bear approaching. Untying the\nmedicine-sack and taking the head, she had all in readiness for his\napproach. When he came up she did as she had been told; and, before she\nhad expended the paints and feathers, the bear began to totter, but,\nstill advancing, came close to the woman. Saying as she was commanded,\nshe then took the head, and cast it as far from her as she could. As it\nrolled along the ground, the blood, excited by the feelings of the\nhead in this terrible scene, gushed from the nose and mouth. The bear,\ntottering, soon fell with a tremendous noise. Then she cried for help,\nand the young men came rushing out, having partially regained their\nstrength and spirits.\n\nMudjikewis, stepping up, gave a yell and struck him a blow upon the\nhead. This he repeated, till it seemed like a mass of brains, while the\nothers, as quick as possible, cut him into very small pieces, which they\nthen scattered in every direction. While thus employed, happening to\nlook around where they had thrown the meat, wonderful to behold, they\nsaw starting up and turning off in every direction small black bears,\nsuch as are seen at the present day. The country was soon overspread\nwith these black animals. And it was from this monster that the present\nrace of bears derived their origin.\n\nHaving thus overcome their pursuer, they returned to the lodge. In the\nmeantime, the woman, gathering the implements she had used, and the\nhead, placed them again in the sack. But the head did not speak again,\nprobably from its great exertion to overcome the monster.\n\nHaving spent so much time and traversed so vast a country in their\nflight, the young men gave up the idea of ever returning to their own\ncountry, and game being plenty, they determined to remain where they\nnow were. One day they moved off some distance from the lodge for the\npurpose of hunting, having left the wampum with the woman. They were\nvery successful, and amused themselves, as all young men do when alone,\nby talking and jesting with each other. One of them spoke and said, 'We\nhave all this sport to ourselves; let us go and ask our sister if she\nwill not let us bring the head to this place, as it is still alive. It\nmay be pleased to hear us talk, and be in our company. In the meantime\ntake food to our sister.' They went and requested the head. She told\nthem to take it, and they took it to their hunting-grounds, and tried\nto amuse it, but only at times did they see its eyes beam with pleasure.\nOne day, while busy in their encampment, they were unexpectedly attacked\nby unknown Indians. The skirmish was long contested and bloody; many of\ntheir foes were slain, but still they were thirty to one. The young men\nfought desperately till they were all killed. The attacking party then\nretreated to a height of ground, to muster their men, and to count the\nnumber of missing and slain. One of their young men had stayed away,\nand, in endeavoring to overtake them, came to the place where the head\nwas hung up. Seeing that alone retain animation, he eyed it for some\ntime with fear and surprise. However, he took it down and opened the\nsack, and was much pleased to see the beautiful feathers, one of which\nhe placed on his head.\n\nStarting off, it waved gracefully over him till he reached his party,\nwhen he threw down the head and sack, and told them how he had found it,\nand that the sack was full of paints and feathers. They all looked at\nthe head and made sport of it. Numbers of the young men took the paint\nand painted themselves, and one of the party took the head by the hair\nand said--\n\n'Look, you ugly thing, and see your paints on the faces of warriors.'\n\nBut the feathers were so beautiful, that numbers of them also placed\nthem on their heads. Then again they used all kinds of indignity to the\nhead, for which they were in turn repaid by the death of those who\nhad used the feathers. Then the chief commanded them to throw away all\nexcept the head. 'We will see,' said he, 'when we get home, what we can\ndo with it. We will try to make it shut its eyes.'\n\nWhen they reached their homes they took it to the council-lodge, and\nhung it up before the fire, fastening it with raw hide soaked, which\nwould shrink and become tightened by the action of the fire. 'We will\nthen see,' they said, 'if we cannot make it shut its eyes.'\n\nMeantime, for several days, the sister had been waiting for the young\nmen to bring back the head; till, at last, getting impatient, she went\nin search of it. The young men she found lying within short distances\nof each other, dead, and covered with wounds. Various other bodies lay\nscattered in different directions around them. She searched for the head\nand sack, but they were nowhere to be found. She raised her voice and\nwept, and blackened her face. Then she walked in different directions,\ntill she came to the place from whence the head had been taken. Then she\nfound the magic bow and arrows, where the young men, ignorant of their\nqualities, had left them. She thought to herself that she would find her\nbrother's head, and came to a piece of rising ground, and there saw some\nof his paints and feathers. These she carefully put up, and hung upon\nthe branch of a tree till her return.\n\nAt dusk she arrived at the first lodge of a very extensive village. Here\nshe used a charm, common among Indians when they wish to meet with a\nkind reception. On applying to the old man and woman of the lodge, she\nwas kindly received. She made known her errand. The old man promised to\naid her, and told her the head was hung up before the council-fire, and\nthat the chiefs of the village, with their young men, kept watch over\nit continually. The former are considered as manitoes. She said she only\nwished to see it, and would be satisfied if she could only get to the\ndoor of the lodge. She knew she had not sufficient power to take it by\nforce. 'Come with me,' said the Indian, 'I will take you there.' They\nwent, and they took their seats near the door. The council-lodge was\nfilled with warriors, amusing themselves with games, and constantly\nkeeping up a fire to smoke the head, as they said, to make dry meat.\nThey saw the head move, and not knowing what to make of it, one spoke\nand said: 'Ha! ha! It is beginning to feel the effects of the smoke.'\nThe sister looked up from the door, and her eyes met those of her\nbrother, and tears rolled down the cheeks of the head. 'Well,' said the\nchief, 'I thought we would make you do something at last. Look! look at\nit--shedding tears,' said he to those around him; and they all laughed\nand passed their jokes upon it. The chief, looking around, and observing\nthe woman, after some time said to the man who came with her: 'Who have\nyou got there? I have never seen that woman before in our village.'\n'Yes,' replied the man, 'you have seen her; she is a relation of mine,\nand seldom goes out. She stays at my lodge, and asked me to allow her to\ncome with me to this place.' In the center of the lodge sat one of those\nyoung men who are always forward, and fond of boasting and displaying\nthemselves before others. 'Why,' said he, 'I have seen her often, and it\nis to this lodge I go almost every night to court her.' All the others\nlaughed and continued their games. The young man did not know he was\ntelling a lie to the woman's advantage, who by that means escaped.\n\nShe returned to the man's lodge, and immediately set out for her own\ncountry. Coming to the spot where the bodies of her adopted brothers\nlay, she placed them together, their feet toward the east. Then taking\nan ax which she had, she cast it up into the air, crying out, 'Brothers,\nget up from under it, or it will fall on you.' This she repeated three\ntimes, and the third time the brothers all arose and stood on their\nfeet.\n\nMudjikewis commenced rubbing his eyes and stretching himself. 'Why,'\nsaid he, 'I have overslept myself.' 'No, indeed,' said one of the\nothers, 'do you not know we were all killed, and that it is our sister\nwho has brought us to life?' The young men took the bodies of their\nenemies and burned them. Soon after, the woman went to procure wives for\nthem, in a distant country, they knew not where; but she returned with\nten young women, which she gave to the ten young men, beginning with the\neldest. Mudjikewis stepped to and fro, uneasy lest he should not get the\none he liked. But he was not disappointed, for she fell to his lot. And\nthey were well matched, for she was a female magician. They then all\nmoved into a very large lodge, and their sister told them that the women\nmust now take turns in going to her brother's head every night, trying\nto untie it. They all said they would do so with pleasure. The eldest\nmade the first attempt, and with a rushing noise she fled through the\nair.\n\nToward daylight she returned. She had been unsuccessful, as she\nsucceeded in untying only one of the knots. All took their turns\nregularly, and each one succeeded in untying only one knot each time.\nBut when the youngest went, she commenced the work as soon as she\nreached the lodge; although it had always been occupied, still the\nIndians never could see any one. For ten nights now, the smoke had not\nascended, but filled the lodge and drove them out. This last night they\nwere all driven out, and the young woman carried off the head.\n\nThe young people and the sister heard the young woman coming high\nthrough the air, and they heard her saying: 'Prepare the body of our\nbrother.' And as soon as they heard it, they went to a small lodge where\nthe black body of Iamo lay. His sister commenced cutting the neck part,\nfrom which the neck had been severed. She cut so deep as to cause it to\nbleed; and the others who were present, by rubbing the body and applying\nmedicines, expelled the blackness. In the meantime, the one who brought\nit, by cutting the neck of the head, caused that also to bleed.\n\nAs soon as she arrived, they placed that close to the body, and, by aid\nof medicines and various other means, succeeded in restoring Iamo to all\nhis former beauty and manliness. All rejoiced in the happy termination\nof their troubles, and they had spent some time joyfully together, when\nIamo said: 'Now I will divide the wampum,' and getting the belt which\ncontained it, he commenced with the eldest, giving it in equal portions.\nBut the youngest got the most splendid and beautiful, as the bottom of\nthe belt held the richest and rarest.\n\nThey were told that, since they had all once died, and were restored to\nlife, they were no longer mortal, but spirits, and they were assigned\ndifferent stations in the invisible world. Only Mudjikewis's place was,\nhowever, named. He was to direct the west wind, hence generally called\nKebeyun, there to remain for ever. They were commanded, as they had\nit in their power, to do good to the inhabitants of the earth, and,\nforgetting their sufferings in procuring the wampum, to give all things\nwith a liberal hand. And they were also commanded that it should also\nbe held by them sacred; those grains or shells of the pale hue to be\nemblematic of peace, while those of the darker hue would lead to evil\nand war.\n\nThe spirits then, amid songs and shouts, took their flight to their\nrespective abodes on high; while Iamo, with his sister Iamoqua,\ndescended into the depths below.",
