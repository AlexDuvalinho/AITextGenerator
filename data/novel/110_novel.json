My thanks are tendered\nto the editors and proprietors of those periodicals for enabling me now\nto piece the trunk and limbs of the novel together, and print it\ncomplete, as originally written two years ago.\n\nI will just add that the story is sent out in all sincerity of purpose,\nas an attempt to give artistic form to a true sequence of things; and\nin respect of the book’s opinions and sentiments, I would ask any too\ngenteel reader, who cannot endure to have said what everybody nowadays\nthinks and feels, to remember a well-worn sentence of St. Jerome’s: If\nan offense come out of the truth, better it is that the offense come\nthan that the truth be concealed.\n\nT.H.\n\n\n_November_ 1891.\n\nAuthor’s Preface to the Fifth and Later Editions\n\nThis novel being one wherein the great campaign of the heroine begins\nafter an event in her experience which has usually been treated as\nfatal to her part of protagonist, or at least as the virtual ending of\nher enterprises and hopes, it was quite contrary to avowed conventions\nthat the public should welcome the book and agree with me in holding\nthat there was something more to be said in fiction than had been said\nabout the shaded side of a well-known catastrophe. But the responsive\nspirit in which _Tess of the d’Urbervilles_ has been received by the\nreaders of England and America would seem to prove that the plan of\nlaying down a story on the lines of tacit opinion, instead of making it\nto square with the merely vocal formulae of society, is not altogether\na wrong one, even when exemplified in so unequal and partial an\nachievement as the present. For this responsiveness I cannot refrain\nfrom expressing my thanks; and my regret is that, in a world where one\nso often hungers in vain for friendship, where even not to be wilfully\nmisunderstood is felt as a kindness, I shall never meet in person these\nappreciative readers, male and female, and shake them by the hand.\n\nI include amongst them the reviewers—by far the majority—who have so\ngenerously welcomed the tale. Their words show that they, like the\nothers, have only too largely repaired my defects of narration by their\nown imaginative intuition.\n\nNevertheless, though the novel was intended to be neither didactic nor\naggressive, but in the scenic parts to be representative simply and in\nthe contemplative to be oftener charged with impressions than with\nconvictions, there have been objectors both to the matter and to the\nrendering.\n\nThe more austere of these maintain a conscientious difference of\nopinion concerning, among other things, subjects fit for art, and\nreveal an inability to associate the idea of the sub-title adjective\nwith any but the artificial and derivative meaning which has resulted\nto it from the ordinances of civilization. They ignore the meaning of\nthe word in Nature, together with all aesthetic claims upon it, not to\nmention the spiritual interpretation afforded by the finest side of\ntheir own Christianity. Others dissent on grounds which are\nintrinsically no more than an assertion that the novel embodies the\nviews of life prevalent at the end of the nineteenth century, and not\nthose of an earlier and simpler generation—an assertion which I can\nonly hope may be well founded. Let me repeat that a novel is an\nimpression, not an argument; and there the matter must rest; as one is\nreminded by a passage which occurs in the letters of Schiller to Goethe\non judges of this class: “They are those who seek only their own ideas\nin a representation, and prize that which should be as higher than what\nis. The cause of the dispute, therefore, lies in the very first\nprinciples, and it would be utterly impossible to come to an\nunderstanding with them.” And again: “As soon as I observe that any\none, when judging of poetical representations, considers anything more\nimportant than the inner Necessity and Truth, I have done with him.”\n\nIn the introductory words to the first edition I suggested the possible\nadvent of the genteel person who would not be able to endure something\nor other in these pages. That person duly appeared among the aforesaid\nobjectors. In one case he felt upset that it was not possible for him\nto read the book through three times, owing to my not having made that\ncritical effort which “alone can prove the salvation of such an one.”\nIn another, he objected to such vulgar articles as the Devil’s\npitchfork, a lodging-house carving-knife, and a shame-bought parasol,\nappearing in a respectable story. In another place he was a gentleman\nwho turned Christian for half-an-hour the better to express his grief\nthat a disrespectful phrase about the Immortals should have been used;\nthough the same innate gentility compelled him to excuse the author in\nwords of pity that one cannot be too thankful for: “He does but give us\nof his best.” I can assure this great critic that to exclaim\nillogically against the gods, singular or plural, is not such an\noriginal sin of mine as he seems to imagine. True, it may have some\nlocal originality; though if Shakespeare were an authority on history,\nwhich perhaps he is not, I could show that the sin was introduced into\nWessex as early as the Heptarchy itself. Says Glo’ster in _Lear_,\notherwise Ina, king of that country:\n\n    As flies to wanton boys are we to the gods;\n    They kill us for their sport.\n\nThe remaining two or three manipulators of Tess were of the\npredetermined sort whom most writers and readers would gladly forget;\nprofessed literary boxers, who put on their convictions for the\noccasion; modern “Hammers of Heretics”; sworn Discouragers, ever on the\nwatch to prevent the tentative half-success from becoming the whole\nsuccess later on; who pervert plain meanings, and grow personal under\nthe name of practising the great historical method. However, they may\nhave causes to advance, privileges to guard, traditions to keep going;\nsome of which a mere tale-teller, who writes down how the things of the\nworld strike him, without any ulterior intentions whatever, has\noverlooked, and may by pure inadvertence have run foul of when in the\nleast aggressive mood. Perhaps some passing perception, the outcome of\na dream hour, would, if generally acted on, cause such an assailant\nconsiderable inconvenience with respect to position, interests, family,\nservant, ox, ass, neighbour, or neighbour’s wife. He therefore\nvaliantly hides his personality behind a publisher’s shutters, and\ncries “Shame!” So densely is the world with any shifting of positions,\neven the best warranted advance, galls somebody’s kibe. Such shiftings\noften begin in sentiment, and such sentiment sometimes begins in a\nnovel.\n\n_July_ 1892.\n\nThe foregoing remarks were written during the early career of this\nstory, when a spirited public and private criticism of its points was\nstill fresh to the feelings. The pages are allowed to stand for what\nthey are worth, as something once said; but probably they would not\nhave been written now. Even in the first short time which has elapsed\nsince the book was first published, some of the critics who have\nprovoked the reply have “gone down into silence,” as if to remind one\nof the infinite unimportance of both their say and mine.\n\n_January_ 1895.\n\nThe present edition of this novel contains a few pages that have never\nappeared in any previous edition. When the detached episodes were\ncollected as stated in the preface of 1891, these pages were\noverlooked, though they were in the original manuscript. They occur in\nChapter X.\n\nRespecting the sub-title, to which allusion was made above, I may add\nthat it was appended at the last moment, after reading the final\nproofs, as being the estimate left in a candid mind of the heroine’s\ncharacter—an estimate that nobody would be likely to dispute. It was\ndisputed more than anything else in the book. _Melius fuerat non\nscibere._ But there it stands.\n\nThe novel was first published complete, in three volumes, in November,\n1891.\n\nT.H.\n\n_March_ 1912.\n\n\nPhase the First:\n\nThe Maiden\n\n\nI\n\nOn an evening in the latter part of May a middle-aged man was walking\nhomeward from Shaston to the village of Marlott, in the adjoining Vale\nof Blakemore, or Blackmoor. The pair of legs that carried him were\nrickety, and there was a bias in his gait which inclined him somewhat\nto the left of a straight line. He occasionally gave a smart nod, as if\nin confirmation of some opinion, though he was not thinking of anything\nin particular. An empty egg-basket was slung upon his arm, the nap of\nhis hat was ruffled, a patch being quite worn away at its brim where\nhis thumb came in taking it off. Presently he was met by an elderly\nparson astride on a gray mare, who, as he rode, hummed a wandering\ntune.\n\n“Good night t’ee,” said the man with the basket.\n\n“Good night, Sir John,” said the parson.\n\nThe pedestrian, after another pace or two, halted, and turned round.\n\n“Now, sir, begging your pardon; we met last market-day on this road\nabout this time, and I said ‘Good night,’ and you made reply ‘_Good\nnight, Sir John_,’ as now.”\n\n“I did,” said the parson.\n\n“And once before that—near a month ago.”\n\n“I may have.”\n\n“Then what might your meaning be in calling me ‘Sir John’ these\ndifferent times, when I be plain Jack Durbeyfield, the haggler?”\n\nThe parson rode a step or two nearer.\n\n“It was only my whim,” he said; and, after a moment’s hesitation: “It\nwas on account of a discovery I made some little time ago, whilst I was\nhunting up pedigrees for the new county history. I am Parson Tringham,\nthe antiquary, of Stagfoot Lane. Don’t you really know, Durbeyfield,\nthat you are the lineal representative of the ancient and knightly\nfamily of the d’Urbervilles, who derive their descent from Sir Pagan\nd’Urberville, that renowned knight who came from Normandy with William\nthe Conqueror, as appears by Battle Abbey Roll?”\n\n“Never heard it before, sir!”\n\n“Well it’s true. Throw up your chin a moment, so that I may catch the\nprofile of your face better. Yes, that’s the d’Urberville nose and\nchin—a little debased. Your ancestor was one of the twelve knights who\nassisted the Lord of Estremavilla in Normandy in his conquest of\nGlamorganshire. Branches of your family held manors over all this part\nof England; their names appear in the Pipe Rolls in the time of King\nStephen. In the reign of King John one of them was rich enough to give\na manor to the Knights Hospitallers; and in Edward the Second’s time\nyour forefather Brian was summoned to Westminster to attend the great\nCouncil there. You declined a little in Oliver Cromwell’s time, but to\nno serious extent, and in Charles the Second’s reign you were made\nKnights of the Royal Oak for your loyalty. Aye, there have been\ngenerations of Sir Johns among you, and if knighthood were hereditary,\nlike a baronetcy, as it practically was in old times, when men were\nknighted from father to son, you would be Sir John now.”\n\n“Ye don’t say so!”\n\n“In short,” concluded the parson, decisively smacking his leg with his\nswitch, “there’s hardly such another family in England.”\n\n“Daze my eyes, and isn’t there?” said Durbeyfield. “And here have I\nbeen knocking about, year after year, from pillar to post, as if I was\nno more than the commonest feller in the parish.... And how long hev\nthis news about me been knowed, Pa’son Tringham?”\n\nThe clergyman explained that, as far as he was aware, it had quite died\nout of knowledge, and could hardly be said to be known at all. His own\ninvestigations had begun on a day in the preceding spring when, having\nbeen engaged in tracing the vicissitudes of the d’Urberville family, he\nhad observed Durbeyfield’s name on his waggon, and had thereupon been\nled to make inquiries about his father and grandfather till he had no\ndoubt on the subject.\n\n“At first I resolved not to disturb you with such a useless piece of\ninformation,” said he. “However, our impulses are too strong for our\njudgement sometimes. I thought you might perhaps know something of it\nall the while.”\n\n“Well, I have heard once or twice, ’tis true, that my family had seen\nbetter days afore they came to Blackmoor. But I took no notice o’t,\nthinking it to mean that we had once kept two horses where we now keep\nonly one. I’ve got a wold silver spoon, and a wold graven seal at home,\ntoo; but, Lord, what’s a spoon and seal?... And to think that I and\nthese noble d’Urbervilles were one flesh all the time. ’Twas said that\nmy gr’t-granfer had secrets, and didn’t care to talk of where he came\nfrom.... And where do we raise our smoke, now, parson, if I may make so\nbold; I mean, where do we d’Urbervilles live?”\n\n“You don’t live anywhere. You are extinct—as a county family.”\n\n“That’s bad.”\n\n“Yes—what the mendacious family chronicles call extinct in the male\nline—that is, gone down—gone under.”\n\n“Then where do we lie?”\n\n“At Kingsbere-sub-Greenhill: rows and rows of you in your vaults, with\nyour effigies under Purbeck-marble canopies.”\n\n“And where be our family mansions and estates?”\n\n“You haven’t any.”\n\n“Oh? No lands neither?”\n\n“None; though you once had ’em in abundance, as I said, for your family\nconsisted of numerous branches. In this county there was a seat of\nyours at Kingsbere, and another at Sherton, and another in Millpond,\nand another at Lullstead, and another at Wellbridge.”\n\n“And shall we ever come into our own again?”\n\n“Ah—that I can’t tell!”\n\n“And what had I better do about it, sir?” asked Durbeyfield, after a\npause.\n\n“Oh—nothing, nothing; except chasten yourself with the thought of ‘how\nare the mighty fallen.’ It is a fact of some interest to the local\nhistorian and genealogist, nothing more. There are several families\namong the cottagers of this county of almost equal lustre. Good night.”\n\n“But you’ll turn back and have a quart of beer wi’ me on the strength\no’t, Pa’son Tringham? There’s a very pretty brew in tap at The Pure\nDrop—though, to be sure, not so good as at Rolliver’s.”\n\n“No, thank you—not this evening, Durbeyfield. You’ve had enough\nalready.” Concluding thus, the parson rode on his way, with doubts as\nto his discretion in retailing this curious bit of lore.\n\nWhen he was gone, Durbeyfield walked a few steps in a profound reverie,\nand then sat down upon the grassy bank by the roadside, depositing his\nbasket before him. In a few minutes a youth appeared in the distance,\nwalking in the same direction as that which had been pursued by\nDurbeyfield. The latter, on seeing him, held up his hand, and the lad\nquickened his pace and came near.\n\n“Boy, take up that basket! I want ’ee to go on an errand for me.”\n\nThe lath-like stripling frowned. “Who be you, then, John Durbeyfield,\nto order me about and call me ‘boy’? You know my name as well as I know\nyours!”\n\n“Do you, do you? That’s the secret—that’s the secret! Now obey my\norders, and take the message I’m going to charge ’ee wi’... Well, Fred,\nI don’t mind telling you that the secret is that I’m one of a noble\nrace—it has been just found out by me this present afternoon, p.m.” And\nas he made the announcement, Durbeyfield, declining from his sitting\nposition, luxuriously stretched himself out upon the bank among the\ndaisies.\n\nThe lad stood before Durbeyfield, and contemplated his length from\ncrown to toe.\n\n“Sir John d’Urberville—that’s who I am,” continued the prostrate man.\n“That is if knights were baronets—which they be. ’Tis recorded in\nhistory all about me. Dost know of such a place, lad, as\nKingsbere-sub-Greenhill?”\n\n“Ees. I’ve been there to Greenhill Fair.”\n\n“Well, under the church of that city there lie—”\n\n“’Tisn’t a city, the place I mean; leastwise ’twaddn’ when I was\nthere—’twas a little one-eyed, blinking sort o’ place.”\n\n“Never you mind the place, boy, that’s not the question before us.\nUnder the church of that there parish lie my ancestors—hundreds of\n’em—in coats of mail and jewels, in gr’t lead coffins weighing tons and\ntons. There’s not a man in the county o’ South-Wessex that’s got\ngrander and nobler skillentons in his family than I.”\n\n“Oh?”\n\n“Now take up that basket, and goo on to Marlott, and when you’ve come\nto The Pure Drop Inn, tell ’em to send a horse and carriage to me\nimmed’ately, to carry me hwome. And in the bottom o’ the carriage they\nbe to put a noggin o’ rum in a small bottle, and chalk it up to my\naccount. And when you’ve done that goo on to my house with the basket,\nand tell my wife to put away that washing, because she needn’t finish\nit, and wait till I come hwome, as I’ve news to tell her.”\n\nAs the lad stood in a dubious attitude, Durbeyfield put his hand in his\npocket, and produced a shilling, one of the chronically few that he\npossessed.\n\n“Here’s for your labour, lad.”\n\nThis made a difference in the young man’s estimate of the position.\n\n“Yes, Sir John. Thank ’ee. Anything else I can do for ’ee, Sir John?”\n\n“Tell ’em at hwome that I should like for supper,—well, lamb’s fry if\nthey can get it; and if they can’t, black-pot; and if they can’t get\nthat, well chitterlings will do.”\n\n“Yes, Sir John.”\n\nThe boy took up the basket, and as he set out the notes of a brass band\nwere heard from the direction of the village.\n\n“What’s that?” said Durbeyfield. “Not on account o’ I?”\n\n“’Tis the women’s club-walking, Sir John. Why, your da’ter is one o’\nthe members.”\n\n“To be sure—I’d quite forgot it in my thoughts of greater things! Well,\nvamp on to Marlott, will ye, and order that carriage, and maybe I’ll\ndrive round and inspect the club.”\n\nThe lad departed, and Durbeyfield lay waiting on the grass and daisies\nin the evening sun. Not a soul passed that way for a long while, and\nthe faint notes of the band were the only human sounds audible within\nthe rim of blue hills.\n\n\nII\n\nThe village of Marlott lay amid the north-eastern undulations of the\nbeautiful Vale of Blakemore, or Blackmoor, aforesaid, an engirdled and\nsecluded region, for the most part untrodden as yet by tourist or\nlandscape-painter, though within a four hours’ journey from London.\n\nIt is a vale whose acquaintance is best made by viewing it from the\nsummits of the hills that surround it—except perhaps during the\ndroughts of summer. An unguided ramble into its recesses in bad weather\nis apt to engender dissatisfaction with its narrow, tortuous, and miry\nways.\n\nThis fertile and sheltered tract of country, in which the fields are\nnever brown and the springs never dry, is bounded on the south by the\nbold chalk ridge that embraces the prominences of Hambledon Hill,\nBulbarrow, Nettlecombe-Tout, Dogbury, High Stoy, and Bubb Down. The\ntraveller from the coast, who, after plodding northward for a score of\nmiles over calcareous downs and corn-lands, suddenly reaches the verge\nof one of these escarpments, is surprised and delighted to behold,\nextended like a map beneath him, a country differing absolutely from\nthat which he has passed through. Behind him the hills are open, the\nsun blazes down upon fields so large as to give an unenclosed character\nto the landscape, the lanes are white, the hedges low and plashed, the\natmosphere colourless. Here, in the valley, the world seems to be\nconstructed upon a smaller and more delicate scale; the fields are mere\npaddocks, so reduced that from this height their hedgerows appear a\nnetwork of dark green threads overspreading the paler green of the\ngrass. The atmosphere beneath is languorous, and is so tinged with\nazure that what artists call the middle distance partakes also of that\nhue, while the horizon beyond is of the deepest ultramarine. Arable\nlands are few and limited; with but slight exceptions the prospect is a\nbroad rich mass of grass and trees, mantling minor hills and dales\nwithin the major. Such is the Vale of Blackmoor.\n\nThe district is of historic, no less than of topographical interest.\nThe Vale was known in former times as the Forest of White Hart, from a\ncurious legend of King Henry III’s reign, in which the killing by a\ncertain Thomas de la Lynd of a beautiful white hart which the king had\nrun down and spared, was made the occasion of a heavy fine. In those\ndays, and till comparatively recent times, the country was densely\nwooded. Even now, traces of its earlier condition are to be found in\nthe old oak copses and irregular belts of timber that yet survive upon\nits slopes, and the hollow-trunked trees that shade so many of its\npastures.\n\nThe forests have departed, but some old customs of their shades remain.\nMany, however, linger only in a metamorphosed or disguised form. The\nMay-Day dance, for instance, was to be discerned on the afternoon under\nnotice, in the guise of the club revel, or “club-walking,” as it was\nthere called.\n\nIt was an interesting event to the younger inhabitants of Marlott,\nthough its real interest was not observed by the participators in the\nceremony. Its singularity lay less in the retention of a custom of\nwalking in procession and dancing on each anniversary than in the\nmembers being solely women. In men’s clubs such celebrations were,\nthough expiring, less uncommon; but either the natural shyness of the\nsofter sex, or a sarcastic attitude on the part of male relatives, had\ndenuded such women’s clubs as remained (if any other did) or this their\nglory and consummation. The club of Marlott alone lived to uphold the\nlocal Cerealia. It had walked for hundreds of years, if not as\nbenefit-club, as votive sisterhood of some sort; and it walked still.\n\nThe banded ones were all dressed in white gowns—a gay survival from Old\nStyle days, when cheerfulness and May-time were synonyms—days before\nthe habit of taking long views had reduced emotions to a monotonous\naverage. Their first exhibition of themselves was in a processional\nmarch of two and two round the parish. Ideal and real clashed slightly\nas the sun lit up their figures against the green hedges and\ncreeper-laced house-fronts; for, though the whole troop wore white\ngarments, no two whites were alike among them. Some approached pure\nblanching; some had a bluish pallor; some worn by the older characters\n(which had possibly lain by folded for many a year) inclined to a\ncadaverous tint, and to a Georgian style.\n\nIn addition to the distinction of a white frock, every woman and girl\ncarried in her right hand a peeled willow wand, and in her left a bunch\nof white flowers. The peeling of the former, and the selection of the\nlatter, had been an operation of personal care.\n\nThere were a few middle-aged and even elderly women in the train, their\nsilver-wiry hair and wrinkled faces, scourged by time and trouble,\nhaving almost a grotesque, certainly a pathetic, appearance in such a\njaunty situation. In a true view, perhaps, there was more to be\ngathered and told of each anxious and experienced one, to whom the\nyears were drawing nigh when she should say, “I have no pleasure in\nthem,” than of her juvenile comrades. But let the elder be passed over\nhere for those under whose bodices the life throbbed quick and warm.\n\nThe young girls formed, indeed, the majority of the band, and their\nheads of luxuriant hair reflected in the sunshine every tone of gold,\nand black, and brown. Some had beautiful eyes, others a beautiful nose,\nothers a beautiful mouth and figure: few, if any, had all. A difficulty\nof arranging their lips in this crude exposure to public scrutiny, an\ninability to balance their heads, and to dissociate self-consciousness\nfrom their features, was apparent in them, and showed that they were\ngenuine country girls, unaccustomed to many eyes.\n\nAnd as each and all of them were warmed without by the sun, so each had\na private little sun for her soul to bask in; some dream, some\naffection, some hobby, at least some remote and distant hope which,\nthough perhaps starving to nothing, still lived on, as hopes will. They\nwere all cheerful, and many of them merry.\n\nThey came round by The Pure Drop Inn, and were turning out of the high\nroad to pass through a wicket-gate into the meadows, when one of the\nwomen said—\n\n“The Load-a-Lord! Why, Tess Durbeyfield, if there isn’t thy father\nriding hwome in a carriage!”\n\nA young member of the band turned her head at the exclamation. She was\na fine and handsome girl—not handsomer than some others, possibly—but\nher mobile peony mouth and large innocent eyes added eloquence to\ncolour and shape. She wore a red ribbon in her hair, and was the only\none of the white company who could boast of such a pronounced\nadornment. As she looked round Durbeyfield was seen moving along the\nroad in a chaise belonging to The Pure Drop, driven by a frizzle-headed\nbrawny damsel with her gown-sleeves rolled above her elbows. This was\nthe cheerful servant of that establishment, who, in her part of\nfactotum, turned groom and ostler at times. Durbeyfield, leaning back,\nand with his eyes closed luxuriously, was waving his hand above his\nhead, and singing in a slow recitative—\n\n“I’ve-got-a-gr’t-family-vault-at-Kingsbere—and\nknighted-forefathers-in-lead-coffins-there!”\n\nThe clubbists tittered, except the girl called Tess—in whom a slow heat\nseemed to rise at the sense that her father was making himself foolish\nin their eyes.\n\n“He’s tired, that’s all,” she said hastily, “and he has got a lift\nhome, because our own horse has to rest to-day.”\n\n“Bless thy simplicity, Tess,” said her companions. “He’s got his\nmarket-nitch. Haw-haw!”\n\n“Look here; I won’t walk another inch with you, if you say any jokes\nabout him!” Tess cried, and the colour upon her cheeks spread over her\nface and neck. In a moment her eyes grew moist, and her glance drooped\nto the ground. Perceiving that they had really pained her they said no\nmore, and order again prevailed. Tess’s pride would not allow her to\nturn her head again, to learn what her father’s meaning was, if he had\nany; and thus she moved on with the whole body to the enclosure where\nthere was to be dancing on the green. By the time the spot was reached\nshe had recovered her equanimity, and tapped her neighbour with her\nwand and talked as usual.\n\nTess Durbeyfield at this time of her life was a mere vessel of emotion\nuntinctured by experience. The dialect was on her tongue to some\nextent, despite the village school: the characteristic intonation of\nthat dialect for this district being the voicing approximately rendered\nby the syllable UR, probably as rich an utterance as any to be found in\nhuman speech. The pouted-up deep red mouth to which this syllable was\nnative had hardly as yet settled into its definite shape, and her lower\nlip had a way of thrusting the middle of her top one upward, when they\nclosed together after a word.\n\nPhases of her childhood lurked in her aspect still. As she walked along\nto-day, for all her bouncing handsome womanliness, you could sometimes\nsee her twelfth year in her cheeks, or her ninth sparkling from her\neyes; and even her fifth would flit over the curves of her mouth now\nand then.\n\nYet few knew, and still fewer considered this. A small minority, mainly\nstrangers, would look long at her in casually passing by, and grow\nmomentarily fascinated by her freshness, and wonder if they would ever\nsee her again: but to almost everybody she was a fine and picturesque\ncountry girl, and no more.\n\nNothing was seen or heard further of Durbeyfield in his triumphal\nchariot under the conduct of the ostleress, and the club having entered\nthe allotted space, dancing began. As there were no men in the company,\nthe girls danced at first with each other, but when the hour for the\nclose of labour drew on, the masculine inhabitants of the village,\ntogether with other idlers and pedestrians, gathered round the spot,\nand appeared inclined to negotiate for a partner.\n\nAmong these on-lookers were three young men of a superior class,\ncarrying small knapsacks strapped to their shoulders, and stout sticks\nin their hands. Their general likeness to each other, and their\nconsecutive ages, would almost have suggested that they might be, what\nin fact they were, brothers. The eldest wore the white tie, high\nwaistcoat, and thin-brimmed hat of the regulation curate; the second\nwas the normal undergraduate; the appearance of the third and youngest\nwould hardly have been sufficient to characterize him; there was an\nuncribbed, uncabined aspect in his eyes and attire, implying that he\nhad hardly as yet found the entrance to his professional groove. That\nhe was a desultory tentative student of something and everything might\nonly have been predicted of him.\n\nThese three brethren told casual acquaintance that they were spending\ntheir Whitsun holidays in a walking tour through the Vale of Blackmoor,\ntheir course being south-westerly from the town of Shaston on the\nnorth-east.\n\nThey leant over the gate by the highway, and inquired as to the meaning\nof the dance and the white-frocked maids. The two elder of the brothers\nwere plainly not intending to linger more than a moment, but the\nspectacle of a bevy of girls dancing without male partners seemed to\namuse the third, and make him in no hurry to move on. He unstrapped his\nknapsack, put it, with his stick, on the hedge-bank, and opened the\ngate.\n\n“What are you going to do, Angel?” asked the eldest.\n\n“I am inclined to go and have a fling with them. Why not all of us—just\nfor a minute or two—it will not detain us long?”\n\n“No—no; nonsense!” said the first. “Dancing in public with a troop of\ncountry hoydens—suppose we should be seen! Come along, or it will be\ndark before we get to Stourcastle, and there’s no place we can sleep at\nnearer than that; besides, we must get through another chapter of _A\nCounterblast to Agnosticism_ before we turn in, now I have taken the\ntrouble to bring the book.”\n\n“All right—I’ll overtake you and Cuthbert in five minutes; don’t stop;\nI give my word that I will, Felix.”\n\nThe two elder reluctantly left him and walked on, taking their\nbrother’s knapsack to relieve him in following, and the youngest\nentered the field.\n\n“This is a thousand pities,” he said gallantly, to two or three of the\ngirls nearest him, as soon as there was a pause in the dance. “Where\nare your partners, my dears?”\n\n“They’ve not left off work yet,” answered one of the boldest. “They’ll\nbe here by and by. Till then, will you be one, sir?”\n\n“Certainly. But what’s one among so many!”\n\n“Better than none. ’Tis melancholy work facing and footing it to one of\nyour own sort, and no clipsing and colling at all. Now, pick and\nchoose.”\n\n“’Ssh—don’t be so for’ard!” said a shyer girl.\n\nThe young man, thus invited, glanced them over, and attempted some\ndiscrimination; but, as the group were all so new to him, he could not\nvery well exercise it. He took almost the first that came to hand,\nwhich was not the speaker, as she had expected; nor did it happen to be\nTess Durbeyfield. Pedigree, ancestral skeletons, monumental record, the\nd’Urberville lineaments, did not help Tess in her life’s battle as yet,\neven to the extent of attracting to her a dancing-partner over the\nheads of the commonest peasantry. So much for Norman blood unaided by\nVictorian lucre.\n\nThe name of the eclipsing girl, whatever it was, has not been handed\ndown; but she was envied by all as the first who enjoyed the luxury of\na masculine partner that evening. Yet such was the force of example\nthat the village young men, who had not hastened to enter the gate\nwhile no intruder was in the way, now dropped in quickly, and soon the\ncouples became leavened with rustic youth to a marked extent, till at\nlength the plainest woman in the club was no longer compelled to foot\nit on the masculine side of the figure.\n\nThe church clock struck, when suddenly the student said that he must\nleave—he had been forgetting himself—he had to join his companions. As\nhe fell out of the dance his eyes lighted on Tess Durbeyfield, whose\nown large orbs wore, to tell the truth, the faintest aspect of reproach\nthat he had not chosen her. He, too, was sorry then that, owing to her\nbackwardness, he had not observed her; and with that in his mind he\nleft the pasture.\n\nOn account of his long delay he started in a flying-run down the lane\nwestward, and had soon passed the hollow and mounted the next rise. He\nhad not yet overtaken his brothers, but he paused to get breath, and\nlooked back. He could see the white figures of the girls in the green\nenclosure whirling about as they had whirled when he was among them.\nThey seemed to have quite forgotten him already.\n\nAll of them, except, perhaps, one. This white shape stood apart by the\nhedge alone. From her position he knew it to be the pretty maiden with\nwhom he had not danced. Trifling as the matter was, he yet\ninstinctively felt that she was hurt by his oversight. He wished that\nhe had asked her; he wished that he had inquired her name. She was so\nmodest, so expressive, she had looked so soft in her thin white gown\nthat he felt he had acted stupidly.\n\nHowever, it could not be helped, and turning, and bending himself to a\nrapid walk, he dismissed the subject from his mind.\n\n\nIII\n\nAs for Tess Durbeyfield, she did not so easily dislodge the incident\nfrom her consideration. She had no spirit to dance again for a long\ntime, though she might have had plenty of partners; but ah! they did\nnot speak so nicely as the strange young man had done. It was not till\nthe rays of the sun had absorbed the young stranger’s retreating figure\non the hill that she shook off her temporary sadness and answered her\nwould-be partner in the affirmative.\n\nShe remained with her comrades till dusk, and participated with a\ncertain zest in the dancing; though, being heart-whole as yet, she\nenjoyed treading a measure purely for its own sake; little divining\nwhen she saw “the soft torments, the bitter sweets, the pleasing pains,\nand the agreeable distresses” of those girls who had been wooed and\nwon, what she herself was capable of in that kind. The struggles and\nwrangles of the lads for her hand in a jig were an amusement to her—no\nmore; and when they became fierce she rebuked them.\n\nShe might have stayed even later, but the incident of her father’s odd\nappearance and manner returned upon the girl’s mind to make her\nanxious, and wondering what had become of him she dropped away from the\ndancers and bent her steps towards the end of the village at which the\nparental cottage lay.\n\nWhile yet many score yards off, other rhythmic sounds than those she\nhad quitted became audible to her; sounds that she knew well—so well.\nThey were a regular series of thumpings from the interior of the house,\noccasioned by the violent rocking of a cradle upon a stone floor, to\nwhich movement a feminine voice kept time by singing, in a vigorous\ngallopade, the favourite ditty of “The Spotted Cow”—\n\n    I saw her lie do′-own in yon′-der green gro′-ove;\n    Come, love!′ and I'll tell′ you where!′\n\nThe cradle-rocking and the song would cease simultaneously for a\nmoment, and an exclamation at highest vocal pitch would take the place\nof the melody.\n\n“God bless thy diment eyes! And thy waxen cheeks! And thy cherry mouth!\nAnd thy Cubit’s thighs! And every bit o’ thy blessed body!”\n\nAfter this invocation the rocking and the singing would recommence, and\nthe “Spotted Cow” proceed as before. So matters stood when Tess opened\nthe door and paused upon the mat within it, surveying the scene.\n\nThe interior, in spite of the melody, struck upon the girl’s senses\nwith an unspeakable dreariness. From the holiday gaieties of the\nfield—the white gowns, the nosegays, the willow-wands, the whirling\nmovements on the green, the flash of gentle sentiment towards the\nstranger—to the yellow melancholy of this one-candled spectacle, what a\nstep! Besides the jar of contrast there came to her a chill\nself-reproach that she had not returned sooner, to help her mother in\nthese domesticities, instead of indulging herself out-of-doors.\n\nThere stood her mother amid the group of children, as Tess had left\nher, hanging over the Monday washing-tub, which had now, as always,\nlingered on to the end of the week. Out of that tub had come the day\nbefore—Tess felt it with a dreadful sting of remorse—the very white\nfrock upon her back which she had so carelessly greened about the skirt\non the damping grass—which had been wrung up and ironed by her mother’s\nown hands.\n\nAs usual, Mrs Durbeyfield was balanced on one foot beside the tub, the\nother being engaged in the aforesaid business of rocking her youngest\nchild. The cradle-rockers had done hard duty for so many years, under\nthe weight of so many children, on that flagstone floor, that they were\nworn nearly flat, in consequence of which a huge jerk accompanied each\nswing of the cot, flinging the baby from side to side like a weaver’s\nshuttle, as Mrs Durbeyfield, excited by her song, trod the rocker with\nall the spring that was left in her after a long day’s seething in the\nsuds.\n\nNick-knock, nick-knock, went the cradle; the candle-flame stretched\nitself tall, and began jigging up and down; the water dribbled from the\nmatron’s elbows, and the song galloped on to the end of the verse, Mrs\nDurbeyfield regarding her daughter the while. Even now, when burdened\nwith a young family, Joan Durbeyfield was a passionate lover of tune.\nNo ditty floated into Blackmoor Vale from the outer world but Tess’s\nmother caught up its notation in a week.\n\nThere still faintly beamed from the woman’s features something of the\nfreshness, and even the prettiness, of her youth; rendering it probable\nthat the personal charms which Tess could boast of were in main part\nher mother’s gift, and therefore unknightly, unhistorical.\n\n“I’ll rock the cradle for ’ee, mother,” said the daughter gently. “Or\nI’ll take off my best frock and help you wring up? I thought you had\nfinished long ago.”\n\nHer mother bore Tess no ill-will for leaving the housework to her\nsingle-handed efforts for so long; indeed, Joan seldom upbraided her\nthereon at any time, feeling but slightly the lack of Tess’s assistance\nwhilst her instinctive plan for relieving herself of her labours lay in\npostponing them. To-night, however, she was even in a blither mood than\nusual. There was a dreaminess, a pre-occupation, an exaltation, in the\nmaternal look which the girl could not understand.\n\n“Well, I’m glad you’ve come,” her mother said, as soon as the last note\nhad passed out of her. “I want to go and fetch your father; but what’s\nmore’n that, I want to tell ’ee what have happened. Y’ll be fess\nenough, my poppet, when th’st know!” (Mrs Durbeyfield habitually spoke\nthe dialect; her daughter, who had passed the Sixth Standard in the\nNational School under a London-trained mistress, spoke two languages:\nthe dialect at home, more or less; ordinary English abroad and to\npersons of quality.)\n\n“Since I’ve been away?” Tess asked.\n\n“Ay!”\n\n“Had it anything to do with father’s making such a mommet of himself in\nthik carriage this afternoon? Why did ’er? I felt inclined to sink into\nthe ground with shame!”\n\n“That wer all a part of the larry! We’ve been found to be the greatest\ngentlefolk in the whole county—reaching all back long before Oliver\nGrumble’s time—to the days of the Pagan Turks—with monuments, and\nvaults, and crests, and ’scutcheons, and the Lord knows what all. In\nSaint Charles’s days we was made Knights o’ the Royal Oak, our real\nname being d’Urberville!... Don’t that make your bosom plim? ’Twas on\nthis account that your father rode home in the vlee; not because he’d\nbeen drinking, as people supposed.”\n\n“I’m glad of that. Will it do us any good, mother?”\n\n“O yes! ’Tis thoughted that great things may come o’t. No doubt a\nmampus of volk of our own rank will be down here in their carriages as\nsoon as ’tis known. Your father learnt it on his way hwome from\nShaston, and he has been telling me the whole pedigree of the matter.”\n\n“Where is father now?” asked Tess suddenly.\n\nHer mother gave irrelevant information by way of answer: “He called to\nsee the doctor to-day in Shaston. It is not consumption at all, it\nseems. It is fat round his heart, ’a says. There, it is like this.”\nJoan Durbeyfield, as she spoke, curved a sodden thumb and forefinger to\nthe shape of the letter C, and used the other forefinger as a pointer.\n“‘At the present moment,’ he says to your father, ‘your heart is\nenclosed all round there, and all round there; this space is still\nopen,’ ’a says. ‘As soon as it do meet, so,’”—Mrs Durbeyfield closed\nher fingers into a circle complete—“‘off you will go like a shadder, Mr\nDurbeyfield,’ ’a says. ‘You mid last ten years; you mid go off in ten\nmonths, or ten days.’”\n\nTess looked alarmed. Her father possibly to go behind the eternal cloud\nso soon, notwithstanding this sudden greatness!\n\n“But where _is_ father?” she asked again.\n\nHer mother put on a deprecating look. “Now don’t you be bursting out\nangry! The poor man—he felt so rafted after his uplifting by the\npa’son’s news—that he went up to Rolliver’s half an hour ago. He do\nwant to get up his strength for his journey to-morrow with that load of\nbeehives, which must be delivered, family or no. He’ll have to start\nshortly after twelve to-night, as the distance is so long.”\n\n“Get up his strength!” said Tess impetuously, the tears welling to her\neyes. “O my God! Go to a public-house to get up his strength! And you\nas well agreed as he, mother!”\n\nHer rebuke and her mood seemed to fill the whole room, and to impart a\ncowed look to the furniture, and candle, and children playing about,\nand to her mother’s face.\n\n“No,” said the latter touchily, “I be not agreed. I have been waiting\nfor ’ee to bide and keep house while I go fetch him.”\n\n“I’ll go.”\n\n“O no, Tess. You see, it would be no use.”\n\nTess did not expostulate. She knew what her mother’s objection meant.\nMrs Durbeyfield’s jacket and bonnet were already hanging slily upon a\nchair by her side, in readiness for this contemplated jaunt, the reason\nfor which the matron deplored more than its necessity.\n\n“And take the _Compleat Fortune-Teller_ to the outhouse,” Joan\ncontinued, rapidly wiping her hands, and donning the garments.\n\nThe _Compleat Fortune-Teller_ was an old thick volume, which lay on a\ntable at her elbow, so worn by pocketing that the margins had reached\nthe edge of the type. Tess took it up, and her mother started.\n\nThis going to hunt up her shiftless husband at the inn was one of Mrs\nDurbeyfield’s still extant enjoyments in the muck and muddle of rearing\nchildren. To discover him at Rolliver’s, to sit there for an hour or\ntwo by his side and dismiss all thought and care of the children during\nthe interval, made her happy. A sort of halo, an occidental glow, came\nover life then. Troubles and other realities took on themselves a\nmetaphysical impalpability, sinking to mere mental phenomena for serene\ncontemplation, and no longer stood as pressing concretions which chafed\nbody and soul. The youngsters, not immediately within sight, seemed\nrather bright and desirable appurtenances than otherwise; the incidents\nof daily life were not without humorousness and jollity in their aspect\nthere. She felt a little as she had used to feel when she sat by her\nnow wedded husband in the same spot during his wooing, shutting her\neyes to his defects of character, and regarding him only in his ideal\npresentation as lover.\n\nTess, being left alone with the younger children, went first to the\nouthouse with the fortune-telling book, and stuffed it into the thatch.\nA curious fetishistic fear of this grimy volume on the part of her\nmother prevented her ever allowing it to stay in the house all night,\nand hither it was brought back whenever it had been consulted. Between\nthe mother, with her fast-perishing lumber of superstitions, folk-lore,\ndialect, and orally transmitted ballads, and the daughter, with her\ntrained National teachings and Standard knowledge under an infinitely\nRevised Code, there was a gap of two hundred years as ordinarily\nunderstood. When they were together the Jacobean and the Victorian ages\nwere juxtaposed.\n\nReturning along the garden path Tess mused on what the mother could\nhave wished to ascertain from the book on this particular day. She\nguessed the recent ancestral discovery to bear upon it, but did not\ndivine that it solely concerned herself. Dismissing this, however, she\nbusied herself with sprinkling the linen dried during the day-time, in\ncompany with her nine-year-old brother Abraham, and her sister\nEliza-Louisa of twelve and a half, called “’Liza-Lu,” the youngest ones\nbeing put to bed. There was an interval of four years and more between\nTess and the next of the family, the two who had filled the gap having\ndied in their infancy, and this lent her a deputy-maternal attitude\nwhen she was alone with her juniors. Next in juvenility to Abraham came\ntwo more girls, Hope and Modesty; then a boy of three, and then the\nbaby, who had just completed his first year.\n\nAll these young souls were passengers in the Durbeyfield ship—entirely\ndependent on the judgement of the two Durbeyfield adults for their\npleasures, their necessities, their health, even their existence. If\nthe heads of the Durbeyfield household chose to sail into difficulty,\ndisaster, starvation, disease, degradation, death, thither were these\nhalf-dozen little captives under hatches compelled to sail with\nthem—six helpless creatures, who had never been asked if they wished\nfor life on any terms, much less if they wished for it on such hard\nconditions as were involved in being of the shiftless house of\nDurbeyfield. Some people would like to know whence the poet whose\nphilosophy is in these days deemed as profound and trustworthy as his\nsong is breezy and pure, gets his authority for speaking of “Nature’s\nholy plan.”\n\nIt grew later, and neither father nor mother reappeared. Tess looked\nout of the door, and took a mental journey through Marlott. The village\nwas shutting its eyes. Candles and lamps were being put out everywhere:\nshe could inwardly behold the extinguisher and the extended hand.\n\nHer mother’s fetching simply meant one more to fetch. Tess began to\nperceive that a man in indifferent health, who proposed to start on a\njourney before one in the morning, ought not to be at an inn at this\nlate hour celebrating his ancient blood.\n\n“Abraham,” she said to her little brother, “do you put on your hat—you\nbain’t afraid?—and go up to Rolliver’s, and see what has gone wi’\nfather and mother.”\n\nThe boy jumped promptly from his seat, and opened the door, and the\nnight swallowed him up. Half an hour passed yet again; neither man,\nwoman, nor child returned. Abraham, like his parents, seemed to have\nbeen limed and caught by the ensnaring inn.\n\n“I must go myself,” she said.\n\n’Liza-Lu then went to bed, and Tess, locking them all in, started on\nher way up the dark and crooked lane or street not made for hasty\nprogress; a street laid out before inches of land had value, and when\none-handed clocks sufficiently subdivided the day.\n\n\nIV\n\nRolliver’s inn, the single alehouse at this end of the long and broken\nvillage, could only boast of an off-licence; hence, as nobody could\nlegally drink on the premises, the amount of overt accommodation for\nconsumers was strictly limited to a little board about six inches wide\nand two yards long, fixed to the garden palings by pieces of wire, so\nas to form a ledge. On this board thirsty strangers deposited their\ncups as they stood in the road and drank, and threw the dregs on the\ndusty ground to the pattern of Polynesia, and wished they could have a\nrestful seat inside.\n\nThus the strangers. But there were also local customers who felt the\nsame wish; and where there’s a will there’s a way.\n\nIn a large bedroom upstairs, the window of which was thickly curtained\nwith a great woollen shawl lately discarded by the landlady, Mrs\nRolliver, were gathered on this evening nearly a dozen persons, all\nseeking beatitude; all old inhabitants of the nearer end of Marlott,\nand frequenters of this retreat. Not only did the distance to the The\nPure Drop, the fully-licensed tavern at the further part of the\ndispersed village, render its accommodation practically unavailable for\ndwellers at this end; but the far more serious question, the quality of\nthe liquor, confirmed the prevalent opinion that it was better to drink\nwith Rolliver in a corner of the housetop than with the other landlord\nin a wide house.\n\nA gaunt four-post bedstead which stood in the room afforded\nsitting-space for several persons gathered round three of its sides; a\ncouple more men had elevated themselves on a chest of drawers; another\nrested on the oak-carved “cwoffer”; two on the wash-stand; another on\nthe stool; and thus all were, somehow, seated at their ease. The stage\nof mental comfort to which they had arrived at this hour was one\nwherein their souls expanded beyond their skins, and spread their\npersonalities warmly through the room. In this process the chamber and\nits furniture grew more and more dignified and luxurious; the shawl\nhanging at the window took upon itself the richness of tapestry; the\nbrass handles of the chest of drawers were as golden knockers; and the\ncarved bedposts seemed to have some kinship with the magnificent\npillars of Solomon’s temple.\n\nMrs Durbeyfield, having quickly walked hitherward after parting from\nTess, opened the front door, crossed the downstairs room, which was in\ndeep gloom, and then unfastened the stair-door like one whose fingers\nknew the tricks of the latches well. Her ascent of the crooked\nstaircase was a slower process, and her face, as it rose into the light\nabove the last stair, encountered the gaze of all the party assembled\nin the bedroom.\n\n“—Being a few private friends I’ve asked in to keep up club-walking at\nmy own expense,” the landlady exclaimed at the sound of footsteps, as\nglibly as a child repeating the Catechism, while she peered over the\nstairs. “Oh, ’tis you, Mrs Durbeyfield—Lard—how you frightened me!—I\nthought it might be some gaffer sent by Gover’ment.”\n\nMrs Durbeyfield was welcomed with glances and nods by the remainder of\nthe conclave, and turned to where her husband sat. He was humming\nabsently to himself, in a low tone: “I be as good as some folks here\nand there! I’ve got a great family vault at Kingsbere-sub-Greenhill,\nand finer skillentons than any man in Wessex!”\n\n“I’ve something to tell ’ee that’s come into my head about that—a grand\nprojick!” whispered his cheerful wife. “Here, John, don’t ’ee see me?”\nShe nudged him, while he, looking through her as through a window-pane,\nwent on with his recitative.\n\n“Hush! Don’t ’ee sing so loud, my good man,” said the landlady; “in\ncase any member of the Gover’ment should be passing, and take away my\nlicends.”\n\n“He’s told ’ee what’s happened to us, I suppose?” asked Mrs\nDurbeyfield.\n\n“Yes—in a way. D’ye think there’s any money hanging by it?”\n\n“Ah, that’s the secret,” said Joan Durbeyfield sagely. “However, ’tis\nwell to be kin to a coach, even if you don’t ride in ’en.” She dropped\nher public voice, and continued in a low tone to her husband: “I’ve\nbeen thinking since you brought the news that there’s a great rich lady\nout by Trantridge, on the edge o’ The Chase, of the name of\nd’Urberville.”\n\n“Hey—what’s that?” said Sir John.\n\nShe repeated the information. “That lady must be our relation,” she\nsaid. “And my projick is to send Tess to claim kin.”\n\n“There _is_ a lady of the name, now you mention it,” said Durbeyfield.\n“Pa’son Tringham didn’t think of that. But she’s nothing beside we—a\njunior branch of us, no doubt, hailing long since King Norman’s day.”\n\nWhile this question was being discussed neither of the pair noticed, in\ntheir preoccupation, that little Abraham had crept into the room, and\nwas awaiting an opportunity of asking them to return.\n\n“She is rich, and she’d be sure to take notice o’ the maid,” continued\nMrs Durbeyfield; “and ’twill be a very good thing. I don’t see why two\nbranches o’ one family should not be on visiting terms.”\n\n“Yes; and we’ll all claim kin!” said Abraham brightly from under the\nbedstead. “And we’ll all go and see her when Tess has gone to live with\nher; and we’ll ride in her coach and wear black clothes!”\n\n“How do you come here, child? What nonsense be ye talking! Go away, and\nplay on the stairs till father and mother be ready!... Well, Tess ought\nto go to this other member of our family. She’d be sure to win the\nlady—Tess would; and likely enough ’twould lead to some noble gentleman\nmarrying her. In short, I know it.”\n\n“How?”\n\n“I tried her fate in the _Fortune-Teller_, and it brought out that very\nthing!... You should ha’ seen how pretty she looked to-day; her skin is\nas sumple as a duchess’.”\n\n“What says the maid herself to going?”\n\n“I’ve not asked her. She don’t know there is any such lady-relation\nyet. But it would certainly put her in the way of a grand marriage, and\nshe won’t say nay to going.”\n\n“Tess is queer.”\n\n“But she’s tractable at bottom. Leave her to me.”\n\nThough this conversation had been private, sufficient of its import\nreached the understandings of those around to suggest to them that the\nDurbeyfields had weightier concerns to talk of now than common folks\nhad, and that Tess, their pretty eldest daughter, had fine prospects in\nstore.\n\n“Tess is a fine figure o’ fun, as I said to myself to-day when I zeed\nher vamping round parish with the rest,” observed one of the elderly\nboozers in an undertone. “But Joan Durbeyfield must mind that she don’t\nget green malt in floor.” It was a local phrase which had a peculiar\nmeaning, and there was no reply.\n\nThe conversation became inclusive, and presently other footsteps were\nheard crossing the room below.\n\n“—Being a few private friends asked in to-night to keep up club-walking\nat my own expense.” The landlady had rapidly re-used the formula she\nkept on hand for intruders before she recognized that the newcomer was\nTess.\n\nEven to her mother’s gaze the girl’s young features looked sadly out of\nplace amid the alcoholic vapours which floated here as no unsuitable\nmedium for wrinkled middle-age; and hardly was a reproachful flash from\nTess’s dark eyes needed to make her father and mother rise from their\nseats, hastily finish their ale, and descend the stairs behind her, Mrs\nRolliver’s caution following their footsteps.\n\n“No noise, please, if ye’ll be so good, my dears; or I mid lose my\nlicends, and be summons’d, and I don’t know what all! ’Night t’ye!”\n\nThey went home together, Tess holding one arm of her father, and Mrs\nDurbeyfield the other. He had, in truth, drunk very little—not a fourth\nof the quantity which a systematic tippler could carry to church on a\nSunday afternoon without a hitch in his eastings or genuflections; but\nthe weakness of Sir John’s constitution made mountains of his petty\nsins in this kind. On reaching the fresh air he was sufficiently\nunsteady to incline the row of three at one moment as if they were\nmarching to London, and at another as if they were marching to\nBath—which produced a comical effect, frequent enough in families on\nnocturnal homegoings; and, like most comical effects, not quite so\ncomic after all. The two women valiantly disguised these forced\nexcursions and countermarches as well as they could from Durbeyfield,\ntheir cause, and from Abraham, and from themselves; and so they\napproached by degrees their own door, the head of the family bursting\nsuddenly into his former refrain as he drew near, as if to fortify his\nsoul at sight of the smallness of his present residence—\n\n“I’ve got a fam—ily vault at Kingsbere!”\n\n“Hush—don’t be so silly, Jacky,” said his wife. “Yours is not the only\nfamily that was of ’count in wold days. Look at the Anktells, and\nHorseys, and the Tringhams themselves—gone to seed a’most as much as\nyou—though you was bigger folks than they, that’s true. Thank God, I\nwas never of no family, and have nothing to be ashamed of in that way!”\n\n“Don’t you be so sure o’ that. From your nater ’tis my belief you’ve\ndisgraced yourselves more than any o’ us, and was kings and queens\noutright at one time.”\n\nTess turned the subject by saying what was far more prominent in her\nown mind at the moment than thoughts of her ancestry—“I am afraid\nfather won’t be able to take the journey with the beehives to-morrow so\nearly.”\n\n“I? I shall be all right in an hour or two,” said Durbeyfield.\n\nIt was eleven o’clock before the family were all in bed, and two\no’clock next morning was the latest hour for starting with the beehives\nif they were to be delivered to the retailers in Casterbridge before\nthe Saturday market began, the way thither lying by bad roads over a\ndistance of between twenty and thirty miles, and the horse and waggon\nbeing of the slowest. At half-past one Mrs Durbeyfield came into the\nlarge bedroom where Tess and all her little brothers and sisters slept.\n\n“The poor man can’t go,” she said to her eldest daughter, whose great\neyes had opened the moment her mother’s hand touched the door.\n\nTess sat up in bed, lost in a vague interspace between a dream and this\ninformation.\n\n“But somebody must go,” she replied. “It is late for the hives already.\nSwarming will soon be over for the year; and it we put off taking ’em\ntill next week’s market the call for ’em will be past, and they’ll be\nthrown on our hands.”\n\nMrs Durbeyfield looked unequal to the emergency. “Some young feller,\nperhaps, would go? One of them who were so much after dancing with ’ee\nyesterday,” she presently suggested.\n\n“O no—I wouldn’t have it for the world!” declared Tess proudly. “And\nletting everybody know the reason—such a thing to be ashamed of! I\nthink _I_ could go if Abraham could go with me to kip me company.”\n\nHer mother at length agreed to this arrangement. Little Abraham was\naroused from his deep sleep in a corner of the same apartment, and made\nto put on his clothes while still mentally in the other world.\nMeanwhile Tess had hastily dressed herself; and the twain, lighting a\nlantern, went out to the stable. The rickety little waggon was already\nladen, and the girl led out the horse, Prince, only a degree less\nrickety than the vehicle.\n\nThe poor creature looked wonderingly round at the night, at the\nlantern, at their two figures, as if he could not believe that at that\nhour, when every living thing was intended to be in shelter and at\nrest, he was called upon to go out and labour. They put a stock of\ncandle-ends into the lantern, hung the latter to the off-side of the\nload, and directed the horse onward, walking at his shoulder at first\nduring the uphill parts of the way, in order not to overload an animal\nof so little vigour. To cheer themselves as well as they could, they\nmade an artificial morning with the lantern, some bread and butter, and\ntheir own conversation, the real morning being far from come. Abraham,\nas he more fully awoke (for he had moved in a sort of trance so far),\nbegan to talk of the strange shapes assumed by the various dark objects\nagainst the sky; of this tree that looked like a raging tiger springing\nfrom a lair; of that which resembled a giant’s head.\n\nWhen they had passed the little town of Stourcastle, dumbly somnolent\nunder its thick brown thatch, they reached higher ground. Still higher,\non their left, the elevation called Bulbarrow, or Bealbarrow, well-nigh\nthe highest in South Wessex, swelled into the sky, engirdled by its\nearthen trenches. From hereabout the long road was fairly level for\nsome distance onward. They mounted in front of the waggon, and Abraham\ngrew reflective.\n\n“Tess!” he said in a preparatory tone, after a silence.\n\n“Yes, Abraham.”\n\n“Bain’t you glad that we’ve become gentlefolk?”\n\n“Not particular glad.”\n\n“But you be glad that you ’m going to marry a gentleman?”\n\n“What?” said Tess, lifting her face.\n\n“That our great relation will help ’ee to marry a gentleman.”\n\n“I? Our great relation? We have no such relation. What has put that\ninto your head?”\n\n“I heard ’em talking about it up at Rolliver’s when I went to find\nfather. There’s a rich lady of our family out at Trantridge, and mother\nsaid that if you claimed kin with the lady, she’d put ’ee in the way of\nmarrying a gentleman.”\n\nHis sister became abruptly still, and lapsed into a pondering silence.\nAbraham talked on, rather for the pleasure of utterance than for\naudition, so that his sister’s abstraction was of no account. He leant\nback against the hives, and with upturned face made observations on the\nstars, whose cold pulses were beating amid the black hollows above, in\nserene dissociation from these two wisps of human life. He asked how\nfar away those twinklers were, and whether God was on the other side of\nthem. But ever and anon his childish prattle recurred to what impressed\nhis imagination even more deeply than the wonders of creation. If Tess\nwere made rich by marrying a gentleman, would she have money enough to\nbuy a spyglass so large that it would draw the stars as near to her as\nNettlecombe-Tout?\n\nThe renewed subject, which seemed to have impregnated the whole family,\nfilled Tess with impatience.\n\n“Never mind that now!” she exclaimed.\n\n“Did you say the stars were worlds, Tess?”\n\n“Yes.”\n\n“All like ours?”\n\n“I don’t know; but I think so. They sometimes seem to be like the\napples on our stubbard-tree. Most of them splendid and sound—a few\nblighted.”\n\n“Which do we live on—a splendid one or a blighted one?”\n\n“A blighted one.”\n\n“’Tis very unlucky that we didn’t pitch on a sound one, when there were\nso many more of ’em!”\n\n“Yes.”\n\n“Is it like that _really_, Tess?” said Abraham, turning to her much\nimpressed, on reconsideration of this rare information. “How would it\nhave been if we had pitched on a sound one?”\n\n“Well, father wouldn’t have coughed and creeped about as he does, and\nwouldn’t have got too tipsy to go on this journey; and mother wouldn’t\nhave been always washing, and never getting finished.”\n\n“And you would have been a rich lady ready-made, and not have had to be\nmade rich by marrying a gentleman?”\n\n“O Aby, don’t—don’t talk of that any more!”\n\nLeft to his reflections Abraham soon grew drowsy. Tess was not skilful\nin the management of a horse, but she thought that she could take upon\nherself the entire conduct of the load for the present and allow\nAbraham to go to sleep if he wished to do so. She made him a sort of\nnest in front of the hives, in such a manner that he could not fall,\nand, taking the reins into her own hands, jogged on as before.\n\nPrince required but slight attention, lacking energy for superfluous\nmovements of any sort. With no longer a companion to distract her, Tess\nfell more deeply into reverie than ever, her back leaning against the\nhives. The mute procession past her shoulders of trees and hedges\nbecame attached to fantastic scenes outside reality, and the occasional\nheave of the wind became the sigh of some immense sad soul,\nconterminous with the universe in space, and with history in time.\n\nThen, examining the mesh of events in her own life, she seemed to see\nthe vanity of her father’s pride; the gentlemanly suitor awaiting\nherself in her mother’s fancy; to see him as a grimacing personage,\nlaughing at her poverty and her shrouded knightly ancestry. Everything\ngrew more and more extravagant, and she no longer knew how time passed.\nA sudden jerk shook her in her seat, and Tess awoke from the sleep into\nwhich she, too, had fallen.\n\nThey were a long way further on than when she had lost consciousness,\nand the waggon had stopped. A hollow groan, unlike anything she had\never heard in her life, came from the front, followed by a shout of\n“Hoi there!”\n\nThe lantern hanging at her waggon had gone out, but another was shining\nin her face—much brighter than her own had been. Something terrible had\nhappened. The harness was entangled with an object which blocked the\nway.\n\nIn consternation Tess jumped down, and discovered the dreadful truth.\nThe groan had proceeded from her father’s poor horse Prince. The\nmorning mail-cart, with its two noiseless wheels, speeding along these\nlanes like an arrow, as it always did, had driven into her slow and\nunlighted equipage. The pointed shaft of the cart had entered the\nbreast of the unhappy Prince like a sword, and from the wound his\nlife’s blood was spouting in a stream, and falling with a hiss into the\nroad.\n\nIn her despair Tess sprang forward and put her hand upon the hole, with\nthe only result that she became splashed from face to skirt with the\ncrimson drops. Then she stood helplessly looking on. Prince also stood\nfirm and motionless as long as he could; till he suddenly sank down in\na heap.\n\nBy this time the mail-cart man had joined her, and began dragging and\nunharnessing the hot form of Prince. But he was already dead, and,\nseeing that nothing more could be done immediately, the mail-cart man\nreturned to his own animal, which was uninjured.\n\n“You was on the wrong side,” he said. “I am bound to go on with the\nmail-bags, so that the best thing for you to do is bide here with your\nload. I’ll send somebody to help you as soon as I can. It is getting\ndaylight, and you have nothing to fear.”\n\nHe mounted and sped on his way; while Tess stood and waited. The\natmosphere turned pale, the birds shook themselves in the hedges,\narose, and twittered; the lane showed all its white features, and Tess\nshowed hers, still whiter. The huge pool of blood in front of her was\nalready assuming the iridescence of coagulation; and when the sun rose\na hundred prismatic hues were reflected from it. Prince lay alongside,\nstill and stark; his eyes half open, the hole in his chest looking\nscarcely large enough to have let out all that had animated him.\n\n“’Tis all my doing—all mine!” the girl cried, gazing at the spectacle.\n“No excuse for me—none. What will mother and father live on now? Aby,\nAby!” She shook the child, who had slept soundly through the whole\ndisaster. “We can’t go on with our load—Prince is killed!”\n\nWhen Abraham realized all, the furrows of fifty years were extemporized\non his young face.\n\n“Why, I danced and laughed only yesterday!” she went on to herself. “To\nthink that I was such a fool!”\n\n“’Tis because we be on a blighted star, and not a sound one, isn’t it,\nTess?” murmured Abraham through his tears.\n\nIn silence they waited through an interval which seemed endless. At\nlength a sound, and an approaching object, proved to them that the\ndriver of the mail-car had been as good as his word. A farmer’s man\nfrom near Stourcastle came up, leading a strong cob. He was harnessed\nto the waggon of beehives in the place of Prince, and the load taken on\ntowards Casterbridge.\n\nThe evening of the same day saw the empty waggon reach again the spot\nof the accident. Prince had lain there in the ditch since the morning;\nbut the place of the blood-pool was still visible in the middle of the\nroad, though scratched and scraped over by passing vehicles. All that\nwas left of Prince was now hoisted into the waggon he had formerly\nhauled, and with his hoofs in the air, and his shoes shining in the\nsetting sunlight, he retraced the eight or nine miles to Marlott.\n\nTess had gone back earlier. How to break the news was more than she\ncould think. It was a relief to her tongue to find from the faces of\nher parents that they already knew of their loss, though this did not\nlessen the self-reproach which she continued to heap upon herself for\nher negligence.\n\nBut the very shiftlessness of the household rendered the misfortune a\nless terrifying one to them than it would have been to a thriving\nfamily, though in the present case it meant ruin, and in the other it\nwould only have meant inconvenience. In the Durbeyfield countenances\nthere was nothing of the red wrath that would have burnt upon the girl\nfrom parents more ambitious for her welfare. Nobody blamed Tess as she\nblamed herself.\n\nWhen it was discovered that the knacker and tanner would give only a\nvery few shillings for Prince’s carcase because of his decrepitude,\nDurbeyfield rose to the occasion.\n\n“No,” said he stoically, “I won’t sell his old body. When we\nd’Urbervilles was knights in the land, we didn’t sell our chargers for\ncat’s meat. Let ’em keep their shillings! He’ve served me well in his\nlifetime, and I won’t part from him now.”\n\nHe worked harder the next day in digging a grave for Prince in the\ngarden than he had worked for months to grow a crop for his family.\nWhen the hole was ready, Durbeyfield and his wife tied a rope round the\nhorse and dragged him up the path towards it, the children following in\nfuneral train. Abraham and ’Liza-Lu sobbed, Hope and Modesty discharged\ntheir griefs in loud blares which echoed from the walls; and when\nPrince was tumbled in they gathered round the grave. The bread-winner\nhad been taken away from them; what would they do?\n\n“Is he gone to heaven?” asked Abraham, between the sobs.\n\nThen Durbeyfield began to shovel in the earth, and the children cried\nanew. All except Tess. Her face was dry and pale, as though she\nregarded herself in the light of a murderess.\n\n\nV\n\nThe haggling business, which had mainly depended on the horse, became\ndisorganized forthwith. Distress, if not penury, loomed in the\ndistance. Durbeyfield was what was locally called a slack-twisted\nfellow; he had good strength to work at times; but the times could not\nbe relied on to coincide with the hours of requirement; and, having\nbeen unaccustomed to the regular toil of the day-labourer, he was not\nparticularly persistent when they did so coincide.\n\nTess, meanwhile, as the one who had dragged her parents into this\nquagmire, was silently wondering what she could do to help them out of\nit; and then her mother broached her scheme.\n\n“We must take the ups wi’ the downs, Tess,” said she; “and never could\nyour high blood have been found out at a more called-for moment. You\nmust try your friends. Do ye know that there is a very rich Mrs\nd’Urberville living on the outskirts o’ The Chase, who must be our\nrelation? You must go to her and claim kin, and ask for some help in\nour trouble.”\n\n“I shouldn’t care to do that,” says Tess. “If there is such a lady,\n’twould be enough for us if she were friendly—not to expect her to give\nus help.”\n\n“You could win her round to do anything, my dear. Besides, perhaps\nthere’s more in it than you know of. I’ve heard what I’ve heard,\ngood-now.”\n\nThe oppressive sense of the harm she had done led Tess to be more\ndeferential than she might otherwise have been to the maternal wish;\nbut she could not understand why her mother should find such\nsatisfaction in contemplating an enterprise of, to her, such doubtful\nprofit. Her mother might have made inquiries, and have discovered that\nthis Mrs d’Urberville was a lady of unequalled virtues and charity. But\nTess’s pride made the part of poor relation one of particular distaste\nto her.\n\n“I’d rather try to get work,” she murmured.\n\n“Durbeyfield, you can settle it,” said his wife, turning to where he\nsat in the background. “If you say she ought to go, she will go.”\n\n“I don’t like my children going and making themselves beholden to\nstrange kin,” murmured he. “I’m the head of the noblest branch o’ the\nfamily, and I ought to live up to it.”\n\nHis reasons for staying away were worse to Tess than her own objections\nto going. “Well, as I killed the horse, mother,” she said mournfully,\n“I suppose I ought to do something. I don’t mind going and seeing her,\nbut you must leave it to me about asking for help. And don’t go\nthinking about her making a match for me—it is silly.”\n\n“Very well said, Tess!” observed her father sententiously.\n\n“Who said I had such a thought?” asked Joan.\n\n“I fancy it is in your mind, mother. But I’ll go.”\n\nRising early next day she walked to the hill-town called Shaston, and\nthere took advantage of a van which twice in the week ran from Shaston\neastward to Chaseborough, passing near Trantridge, the parish in which\nthe vague and mysterious Mrs d’Urberville had her residence.\n\nTess Durbeyfield’s route on this memorable morning lay amid the\nnorth-eastern undulations of the Vale in which she had been born, and\nin which her life had unfolded. The Vale of Blackmoor was to her the\nworld, and its inhabitants the races thereof. From the gates and stiles\nof Marlott she had looked down its length in the wondering days of\ninfancy, and what had been mystery to her then was not much less than\nmystery to her now. She had seen daily from her chamber-window towers,\nvillages, faint white mansions; above all, the town of Shaston standing\nmajestically on its height; its windows shining like lamps in the\nevening sun. She had hardly ever visited the place, only a small tract\neven of the Vale and its environs being known to her by close\ninspection. Much less had she been far outside the valley. Every\ncontour of the surrounding hills was as personal to her as that of her\nrelatives’ faces; but for what lay beyond, her judgment was dependent\non the teaching of the village school, where she had held a leading\nplace at the time of her leaving, a year or two before this date.\n\nIn those early days she had been much loved by others of her own sex\nand age, and had used to be seen about the village as one of three—all\nnearly of the same year—walking home from school side by side; Tess the\nmiddle one—in a pink print pinafore, of a finely reticulated pattern,\nworn over a stuff frock that had lost its original colour for a\nnondescript tertiary—marching on upon long stalky legs, in tight\nstockings which had little ladder-like holes at the knees, torn by\nkneeling in the roads and banks in search of vegetable and mineral\ntreasures; her then earth-coloured hair hanging like pot-hooks; the\narms of the two outside girls resting round the waist of Tess; her arms\non the shoulders of the two supporters.\n\nAs Tess grew older, and began to see how matters stood, she felt quite\na Malthusian towards her mother for thoughtlessly giving her so many\nlittle sisters and brothers, when it was such a trouble to nurse and\nprovide for them. Her mother’s intelligence was that of a happy child:\nJoan Durbeyfield was simply an additional one, and that not the eldest,\nto her own long family of waiters on Providence.\n\nHowever, Tess became humanely beneficent towards the small ones, and to\nhelp them as much as possible she used, as soon as she left school, to\nlend a hand at haymaking or harvesting on neighbouring farms; or, by\npreference, at milking or butter-making processes, which she had learnt\nwhen her father had owned cows; and being deft-fingered it was a kind\nof work in which she excelled.\n\nEvery day seemed to throw upon her young shoulders more of the family\nburdens, and that Tess should be the representative of the Durbeyfields\nat the d’Urberville mansion came as a thing of course. In this instance\nit must be admitted that the Durbeyfields were putting their fairest\nside outward.\n\nShe alighted from the van at Trantridge Cross, and ascended on foot a\nhill in the direction of the district known as The Chase, on the\nborders of which, as she had been informed, Mrs d’Urberville’s seat,\nThe Slopes, would be found. It was not a manorial home in the ordinary\nsense, with fields, and pastures, and a grumbling farmer, out of whom\nthe owner had to squeeze an income for himself and his family by hook\nor by crook. It was more, far more; a country-house built for enjoyment\npure and simple, with not an acre of troublesome land attached to it\nbeyond what was required for residential purposes, and for a little\nfancy farm kept in hand by the owner, and tended by a bailiff.\n\nThe crimson brick lodge came first in sight, up to its eaves in dense\nevergreens. Tess thought this was the mansion itself till, passing\nthrough the side wicket with some trepidation, and onward to a point at\nwhich the drive took a turn, the house proper stood in full view. It\nwas of recent erection—indeed almost new—and of the same rich red\ncolour that formed such a contrast with the evergreens of the lodge.\nFar behind the corner of the house—which rose like a geranium bloom\nagainst the subdued colours around—stretched the soft azure landscape\nof The Chase—a truly venerable tract of forest land, one of the few\nremaining woodlands in England of undoubted primaeval date, wherein\nDruidical mistletoe was still found on aged oaks, and where enormous\nyew-trees, not planted by the hand of man grew as they had grown when\nthey were pollarded for bows. All this sylvan antiquity, however,\nthough visible from The Slopes, was outside the immediate boundaries of\nthe estate.\n\nEverything on this snug property was bright, thriving, and well kept;\nacres of glass-houses stretched down the inclines to the copses at\ntheir feet. Everything looked like money—like the last coin issued from\nthe Mint. The stables, partly screened by Austrian pines and evergreen\noaks, and fitted with every late appliance, were as dignified as\nChapels-of-Ease. On the extensive lawn stood an ornamental tent, its\ndoor being towards her.\n\nSimple Tess Durbeyfield stood at gaze, in a half-alarmed attitude, on\nthe edge of the gravel sweep. Her feet had brought her onward to this\npoint before she had quite realized where she was; and now all was\ncontrary to her expectation.\n\n“I thought we were an old family; but this is all new!” she said, in\nher artlessness. She wished that she had not fallen in so readily with\nher mother’s plans for “claiming kin,” and had endeavoured to gain\nassistance nearer home.\n\nThe d’Urbervilles—or Stoke-d’Urbervilles, as they at first called\nthemselves—who owned all this, were a somewhat unusual family to find\nin such an old-fashioned part of the country. Parson Tringham had\nspoken truly when he said that our shambling John Durbeyfield was the\nonly really lineal representative of the old d’Urberville family\nexisting in the county, or near it; he might have added, what he knew\nvery well, that the Stoke-d’Urbervilles were no more d’Urbervilles of\nthe true tree then he was himself. Yet it must be admitted that this\nfamily formed a very good stock whereon to regraft a name which sadly\nwanted such renovation.\n\nWhen old Mr Simon Stoke, latterly deceased, had made his fortune as an\nhonest merchant (some said money-lender) in the North, he decided to\nsettle as a county man in the South of England, out of hail of his\nbusiness district; and in doing this he felt the necessity of\nrecommencing with a name that would not too readily identify him with\nthe smart tradesman of the past, and that would be less commonplace\nthan the original bald, stark words. Conning for an hour in the British\nMuseum the pages of works devoted to extinct, half-extinct, obscured,\nand ruined families appertaining to the quarter of England in which he\nproposed to settle, he considered that _d’Urberville_ looked and\nsounded as well as any of them: and d’Urberville accordingly was\nannexed to his own name for himself and his heirs eternally. Yet he was\nnot an extravagant-minded man in this, and in constructing his family\ntree on the new basis was duly reasonable in framing his\ninter-marriages and aristocratic links, never inserting a single title\nabove a rank of strict moderation.\n\nOf this work of imagination poor Tess and her parents were naturally in\nignorance—much to their discomfiture; indeed, the very possibility of\nsuch annexations was unknown to them; who supposed that, though to be\nwell-favoured might be the gift of fortune, a family name came by\nnature.\n\nTess still stood hesitating like a bather about to make his plunge,\nhardly knowing whether to retreat or to persevere, when a figure came\nforth from the dark triangular door of the tent. It was that of a tall\nyoung man, smoking.\n\nHe had an almost swarthy complexion, with full lips, badly moulded,\nthough red and smooth, above which was a well-groomed black moustache\nwith curled points, though his age could not be more than three- or\nfour-and-twenty. Despite the touches of barbarism in his contours,\nthere was a singular force in the gentleman’s face, and in his bold\nrolling eye.\n\n“Well, my Beauty, what can I do for you?” said he, coming forward. And\nperceiving that she stood quite confounded: “Never mind me. I am Mr\nd’Urberville. Have you come to see me or my mother?”\n\nThis embodiment of a d’Urberville and a namesake differed even more\nfrom what Tess had expected than the house and grounds had differed.\nShe had dreamed of an aged and dignified face, the sublimation of all\nthe d’Urberville lineaments, furrowed with incarnate memories\nrepresenting in hieroglyphic the centuries of her family’s and\nEngland’s history. But she screwed herself up to the work in hand,\nsince she could not get out of it, and answered—\n\n“I came to see your mother, sir.”\n\n“I am afraid you cannot see her—she is an invalid,” replied the present\nrepresentative of the spurious house; for this was Mr Alec, the only\nson of the lately deceased gentleman. “Cannot I answer your purpose?\nWhat is the business you wish to see her about?”\n\n“It isn’t business—it is—I can hardly say what!”\n\n“Pleasure?”\n\n“Oh no. Why, sir, if I tell you, it will seem—”\n\nTess’s sense of a certain ludicrousness in her errand was now so strong\nthat, notwithstanding her awe of him, and her general discomfort at\nbeing here, her rosy lips curved towards a smile, much to the\nattraction of the swarthy Alexander.\n\n“It is so very foolish,” she stammered; “I fear I can’t tell you!”\n\n“Never mind; I like foolish things. Try again, my dear,” said he\nkindly.\n\n“Mother asked me to come,” Tess continued; “and, indeed, I was in the\nmind to do so myself likewise. But I did not think it would be like\nthis. I came, sir, to tell you that we are of the same family as you.”\n\n“Ho! Poor relations?”\n\n“Yes.”\n\n“Stokes?”\n\n“No; d’Urbervilles.”\n\n“Ay, ay; I mean d’Urbervilles.”\n\n“Our names are worn away to Durbeyfield; but we have several proofs\nthat we are d’Urbervilles. Antiquarians hold we are,—and—and we have an\nold seal, marked with a ramping lion on a shield, and a castle over\nhim. And we have a very old silver spoon, round in the bowl like a\nlittle ladle, and marked with the same castle. But it is so worn that\nmother uses it to stir the pea-soup.”\n\n“A castle argent is certainly my crest,” said he blandly. “And my arms\na lion rampant.”\n\n“And so mother said we ought to make ourselves beknown to you—as we’ve\nlost our horse by a bad accident, and are the oldest branch o’ the\nfamily.”\n\n“Very kind of your mother, I’m sure. And I, for one, don’t regret her\nstep.” Alec looked at Tess as he spoke, in a way that made her blush a\nlittle. “And so, my pretty girl, you’ve come on a friendly visit to us,\nas relations?”\n\n“I suppose I have,” faltered Tess, looking uncomfortable again.\n\n“Well—there’s no harm in it. Where do you live? What are you?”\n\nShe gave him brief particulars; and responding to further inquiries\ntold him that she was intending to go back by the same carrier who had\nbrought her.\n\n“It is a long while before he returns past Trantridge Cross. Supposing\nwe walk round the grounds to pass the time, my pretty Coz?”\n\nTess wished to abridge her visit as much as possible; but the young man\nwas pressing, and she consented to accompany him. He conducted her\nabout the lawns, and flower-beds, and conservatories; and thence to the\nfruit-garden and greenhouses, where he asked her if she liked\nstrawberries.\n\n“Yes,” said Tess, “when they come.”\n\n“They are already here.” D’Urberville began gathering specimens of the\nfruit for her, handing them back to her as he stooped; and, presently,\nselecting a specially fine product of the “British Queen” variety, he\nstood up and held it by the stem to her mouth.\n\n“No—no!” she said quickly, putting her fingers between his hand and her\nlips. “I would rather take it in my own hand.”\n\n“Nonsense!” he insisted; and in a slight distress she parted her lips\nand took it in.\n\nThey had spent some time wandering desultorily thus, Tess eating in a\nhalf-pleased, half-reluctant state whatever d’Urberville offered her.\nWhen she could consume no more of the strawberries he filled her little\nbasket with them; and then the two passed round to the rose-trees,\nwhence he gathered blossoms and gave her to put in her bosom. She\nobeyed like one in a dream, and when she could affix no more he himself\ntucked a bud or two into her hat, and heaped her basket with others in\nthe prodigality of his bounty. At last, looking at his watch, he said,\n“Now, by the time you have had something to eat, it will be time for\nyou to leave, if you want to catch the carrier to Shaston. Come here,\nand I’ll see what grub I can find.”\n\nStoke d’Urberville took her back to the lawn and into the tent, where\nhe left her, soon reappearing with a basket of light luncheon, which he\nput before her himself. It was evidently the gentleman’s wish not to be\ndisturbed in this pleasant _tête-à-tête_ by the servantry.\n\n“Do you mind my smoking?” he asked.\n\n“Oh, not at all, sir.”\n\nHe watched her pretty and unconscious munching through the skeins of\nsmoke that pervaded the tent, and Tess Durbeyfield did not divine, as\nshe innocently looked down at the roses in her bosom, that there behind\nthe blue narcotic haze was potentially the “tragic mischief” of her\ndrama—one who stood fair to be the blood-red ray in the spectrum of her\nyoung life. She had an attribute which amounted to a disadvantage just\nnow; and it was this that caused Alec d’Urberville’s eyes to rivet\nthemselves upon her. It was a luxuriance of aspect, a fulness of\ngrowth, which made her appear more of a woman than she really was. She\nhad inherited the feature from her mother without the quality it\ndenoted. It had troubled her mind occasionally, till her companions had\nsaid that it was a fault which time would cure.\n\nShe soon had finished her lunch. “Now I am going home, sir,” she said,\nrising.\n\n“And what do they call you?” he asked, as he accompanied her along the\ndrive till they were out of sight of the house.\n\n“Tess Durbeyfield, down at Marlott.”\n\n“And you say your people have lost their horse?”\n\n“I—killed him!” she answered, her eyes filling with tears as she gave\nparticulars of Prince’s death. “And I don’t know what to do for father\non account of it!”\n\n“I must think if I cannot do something. My mother must find a berth for\nyou. But, Tess, no nonsense about ‘d’Urberville’;—‘Durbeyfield’ only,\nyou know—quite another name.”\n\n“I wish for no better, sir,” said she with something of dignity.\n\nFor a moment—only for a moment—when they were in the turning of the\ndrive, between the tall rhododendrons and conifers, before the lodge\nbecame visible, he inclined his face towards her as if—but, no: he\nthought better of it, and let her go.\n\nThus the thing began. Had she perceived this meeting’s import she might\nhave asked why she was doomed to be seen and coveted that day by the\nwrong man, and not by some other man, the right and desired one in all\nrespects—as nearly as humanity can supply the right and desired; yet to\nhim who amongst her acquaintance might have approximated to this kind,\nshe was but a transient impression, half forgotten.\n\nIn the ill-judged execution of the well-judged plan of things the call\nseldom produces the comer, the man to love rarely coincides with the\nhour for loving. Nature does not often say “See!” to her poor creature\nat a time when seeing can lead to happy doing; or reply “Here!” to a\nbody’s cry of “Where?” till the hide-and-seek has become an irksome,\noutworn game. We may wonder whether at the acme and summit of the human\nprogress these anachronisms will be corrected by a finer intuition, a\ncloser interaction of the social machinery than that which now jolts us\nround and along; but such completeness is not to be prophesied, or even\nconceived as possible. Enough that in the present case, as in millions,\nit was not the two halves of a perfect whole that confronted each other\nat the perfect moment; a missing counterpart wandered independently\nabout the earth waiting in crass obtuseness till the late time came.\nOut of which maladroit delay sprang anxieties, disappointments, shocks,\ncatastrophes, and passing-strange destinies.\n\nWhen d’Urberville got back to the tent he sat down astride on a chair,\nreflecting, with a pleased gleam in his face. Then he broke into a loud\nlaugh.\n\n“Well, I’m damned! What a funny thing! Ha-ha-ha! And what a crumby\ngirl!”\n\n\nVI\n\nTess went down the hill to Trantridge Cross, and inattentively waited\nto take her seat in the van returning from Chaseborough to Shaston. She\ndid not know what the other occupants said to her as she entered,\nthough she answered them; and when they had started anew she rode along\nwith an inward and not an outward eye.\n\nOne among her fellow-travellers addressed her more pointedly than any\nhad spoken before: “Why, you be quite a posy! And such roses in early\nJune!”\n\nThen she became aware of the spectacle she presented to their surprised\nvision: roses at her breasts; roses in her hat; roses and strawberries\nin her basket to the brim. She blushed, and said confusedly that the\nflowers had been given to her. When the passengers were not looking she\nstealthily removed the more prominent blooms from her hat and placed\nthem in the basket, where she covered them with her handkerchief. Then\nshe fell to reflecting again, and in looking downwards a thorn of the\nrose remaining in her breast accidentally pricked her chin. Like all\nthe cottagers in Blackmoor Vale, Tess was steeped in fancies and\nprefigurative superstitions; she thought this an ill omen—the first she\nhad noticed that day.\n\nThe van travelled only so far as Shaston, and there were several miles\nof pedestrian descent from that mountain-town into the vale to Marlott.\nHer mother had advised her to stay here for the night, at the house of\na cottage-woman they knew, if she should feel too tired to come on; and\nthis Tess did, not descending to her home till the following afternoon.\n\nWhen she entered the house she perceived in a moment from her mother’s\ntriumphant manner that something had occurred in the interim.\n\n“Oh yes; I know all about it! I told ’ee it would be all right, and now\n’tis proved!”\n\n“Since I’ve been away? What has?” said Tess rather wearily.\n\nHer mother surveyed the girl up and down with arch approval, and went\non banteringly: “So you’ve brought ’em round!”\n\n“How do you know, mother?”\n\n“I’ve had a letter.”\n\nTess then remembered that there would have been time for this.\n\n“They say—Mrs d’Urberville says—that she wants you to look after a\nlittle fowl-farm which is her hobby. But this is only her artful way of\ngetting ’ee there without raising your hopes. She’s going to own ’ee as\nkin—that’s the meaning o’t.”\n\n“But I didn’t see her.”\n\n“You zid somebody, I suppose?”\n\n“I saw her son.”\n\n“And did he own ’ee?”\n\n“Well—he called me Coz.”\n\n“An’ I knew it! Jacky—he called her Coz!” cried Joan to her husband.\n“Well, he spoke to his mother, of course, and she do want ’ee there.”\n\n“But I don’t know that I am apt at tending fowls,” said the dubious\nTess.\n\n“Then I don’t know who is apt. You’ve be’n born in the business, and\nbrought up in it. They that be born in a business always know more\nabout it than any ’prentice. Besides, that’s only just a show of\nsomething for you to do, that you midn’t feel beholden.”\n\n“I don’t altogether think I ought to go,” said Tess thoughtfully. “Who\nwrote the letter? Will you let me look at it?”\n\n“Mrs d’Urberville wrote it. Here it is.”\n\nThe letter was in the third person, and briefly informed Mrs\nDurbeyfield that her daughter’s services would be useful to that lady\nin the management of her poultry-farm, that a comfortable room would be\nprovided for her if she could come, and that the wages would be on a\nliberal scale if they liked her.\n\n“Oh—that’s all!” said Tess.\n\n“You couldn’t expect her to throw her arms round ’ee, an’ to kiss and\nto coll ’ee all at once.”\n\nTess looked out of the window.\n\n“I would rather stay here with father and you,” she said.\n\n“But why?”\n\n“I’d rather not tell you why, mother; indeed, I don’t quite know why.”\n\nA week afterwards she came in one evening from an unavailing search for\nsome light occupation in the immediate neighbourhood. Her idea had been\nto get together sufficient money during the summer to purchase another\nhorse. Hardly had she crossed the threshold before one of the children\ndanced across the room, saying, “The gentleman’s been here!”\n\nHer mother hastened to explain, smiles breaking from every inch of her\nperson. Mrs d’Urberville’s son had called on horseback, having been\nriding by chance in the direction of Marlott. He had wished to know,\nfinally, in the name of his mother, if Tess could really come to manage\nthe old lady’s fowl-farm or not; the lad who had hitherto superintended\nthe birds having proved untrustworthy. “Mr d’Urberville says you must\nbe a good girl if you are at all as you appear; he knows you must be\nworth your weight in gold. He is very much interested in ’ee—truth to\ntell.”\n\nTess seemed for the moment really pleased to hear that she had won such\nhigh opinion from a stranger when, in her own esteem, she had sunk so\nlow.\n\n“It is very good of him to think that,” she murmured; “and if I was\nquite sure how it would be living there, I would go any-when.”\n\n“He is a mighty handsome man!”\n\n“I don’t think so,” said Tess coldly.\n\n“Well, there’s your chance, whether or no; and I’m sure he wears a\nbeautiful diamond ring!”\n\n“Yes,” said little Abraham, brightly, from the window-bench; “and I\nseed it! and it did twinkle when he put his hand up to his mistarshers.\nMother, why did our grand relation keep on putting his hand up to his\nmistarshers?”\n\n“Hark at that child!” cried Mrs Durbeyfield, with parenthetic\nadmiration.\n\n“Perhaps to show his diamond ring,” murmured Sir John, dreamily, from\nhis chair.\n\n“I’ll think it over,” said Tess, leaving the room.\n\n“Well, she’s made a conquest o’ the younger branch of us, straight\noff,” continued the matron to her husband, “and she’s a fool if she\ndon’t follow it up.”\n\n“I don’t quite like my children going away from home,” said the\nhaggler. “As the head of the family, the rest ought to come to me.”\n\n“But do let her go, Jacky,” coaxed his poor witless wife. “He’s struck\nwi’ her—you can see that. He called her Coz! He’ll marry her, most\nlikely, and make a lady of her; and then she’ll be what her forefathers\nwas.”\n\nJohn Durbeyfield had more conceit than energy or health, and this\nsupposition was pleasant to him.\n\n“Well, perhaps that’s what young Mr d’Urberville means,” he admitted;\n“and sure enough he mid have serious thoughts about improving his blood\nby linking on to the old line. Tess, the little rogue! And have she\nreally paid ’em a visit to such an end as this?”\n\nMeanwhile Tess was walking thoughtfully among the gooseberry-bushes in\nthe garden, and over Prince’s grave. When she came in her mother\npursued her advantage.\n\n“Well, what be you going to do?” she asked.\n\n“I wish I had seen Mrs d’Urberville,” said Tess.\n\n“I think you mid as well settle it. Then you’ll see her soon enough.”\n\nHer father coughed in his chair.\n\n“I don’t know what to say!” answered the girl restlessly. “It is for\nyou to decide. I killed the old horse, and I suppose I ought to do\nsomething to get ye a new one. But—but—I don’t quite like Mr\nd’Urberville being there!”\n\nThe children, who had made use of this idea of Tess being taken up by\ntheir wealthy kinsfolk (which they imagined the other family to be) as\na species of dolorifuge after the death of the horse, began to cry at\nTess’s reluctance, and teased and reproached her for hesitating.\n\n“Tess won’t go-o-o and be made a la-a-dy of!—no, she says she\nwo-o-on’t!” they wailed, with square mouths. “And we shan’t have a nice\nnew horse, and lots o’ golden money to buy fairlings! And Tess won’t\nlook pretty in her best cloze no mo-o-ore!”\n\nHer mother chimed in to the same tune: a certain way she had of making\nher labours in the house seem heavier than they were by prolonging them\nindefinitely, also weighed in the argument. Her father alone preserved\nan attitude of neutrality.\n\n“I will go,” said Tess at last.\n\nHer mother could not repress her consciousness of the nuptial vision\nconjured up by the girl’s consent.\n\n“That’s right! For such a pretty maid as ’tis, this is a fine chance!”\n\nTess smiled crossly.\n\n“I hope it is a chance for earning money. It is no other kind of\nchance. You had better say nothing of that silly sort about parish.”\n\nMrs Durbeyfield did not promise. She was not quite sure that she did\nnot feel proud enough, after the visitor’s remarks, to say a good deal.\n\nThus it was arranged; and the young girl wrote, agreeing to be ready to\nset out on any day on which she might be required. She was duly\ninformed that Mrs d’Urberville was glad of her decision, and that a\nspring-cart should be sent to meet her and her luggage at the top of\nthe Vale on the day after the morrow, when she must hold herself\nprepared to start. Mrs d’Urberville’s handwriting seemed rather\nmasculine.\n\n“A cart?” murmured Joan Durbeyfield doubtingly. “It might have been a\ncarriage for her own kin!”\n\nHaving at last taken her course Tess was less restless and abstracted,\ngoing about her business with some self-assurance in the thought of\nacquiring another horse for her father by an occupation which would not\nbe onerous. She had hoped to be a teacher at the school, but the fates\nseemed to decide otherwise. Being mentally older than her mother she\ndid not regard Mrs Durbeyfield’s matrimonial hopes for her in a serious\naspect for a moment. The light-minded woman had been discovering good\nmatches for her daughter almost from the year of her birth.\n\n\nVII\n\nOn the morning appointed for her departure Tess was awake before\ndawn—at the marginal minute of the dark when the grove is still mute,\nsave for one prophetic bird who sings with a clear-voiced conviction\nthat he at least knows the correct time of day, the rest preserving\nsilence as if equally convinced that he is mistaken. She remained\nupstairs packing till breakfast-time, and then came down in her\nordinary week-day clothes, her Sunday apparel being carefully folded in\nher box.\n\nHer mother expostulated. “You will never set out to see your folks\nwithout dressing up more the dand than that?”\n\n“But I am going to work!” said Tess.\n\n“Well, yes,” said Mrs Durbeyfield; and in a private tone, “at first\nthere mid be a little pretence o’t.... But I think it will be wiser of\n’ee to put your best side outward,” she added.\n\n“Very well; I suppose you know best,” replied Tess with calm\nabandonment.\n\nAnd to please her parent the girl put herself quite in Joan’s hands,\nsaying serenely—“Do what you like with me, mother.”\n\nMrs Durbeyfield was only too delighted at this tractability. First she\nfetched a great basin, and washed Tess’s hair with such thoroughness\nthat when dried and brushed it looked twice as much as at other times.\nShe tied it with a broader pink ribbon than usual. Then she put upon\nher the white frock that Tess had worn at the club-walking, the airy\nfulness of which, supplementing her enlarged _coiffure_, imparted to\nher developing figure an amplitude which belied her age, and might\ncause her to be estimated as a woman when she was not much more than a\nchild.\n\n“I declare there’s a hole in my stocking-heel!” said Tess.\n\n“Never mind holes in your stockings—they don’t speak! When I was a\nmaid, so long as I had a pretty bonnet the devil might ha’ found me in\nheels.”\n\nHer mother’s pride in the girl’s appearance led her to step back, like\na painter from his easel, and survey her work as a whole.\n\n“You must zee yourself!” she cried. “It is much better than you was\nt’other day.”\n\nAs the looking-glass was only large enough to reflect a very small\nportion of Tess’s person at one time, Mrs Durbeyfield hung a black\ncloak outside the casement, and so made a large reflector of the panes,\nas it is the wont of bedecking cottagers to do. After this she went\ndownstairs to her husband, who was sitting in the lower room.\n\n“I’ll tell ’ee what ’tis, Durbeyfield,” said she exultingly; “he’ll\nnever have the heart not to love her. But whatever you do, don’t zay\ntoo much to Tess of his fancy for her, and this chance she has got. She\nis such an odd maid that it mid zet her against him, or against going\nthere, even now. If all goes well, I shall certainly be for making some\nreturn to pa’son at Stagfoot Lane for telling us—dear, good man!”\n\nHowever, as the moment for the girl’s setting out drew nigh, when the\nfirst excitement of the dressing had passed off, a slight misgiving\nfound place in Joan Durbeyfield’s mind. It prompted the matron to say\nthat she would walk a little way—as far as to the point where the\nacclivity from the valley began its first steep ascent to the outer\nworld. At the top Tess was going to be met with the spring-cart sent by\nthe Stoke-d’Urbervilles, and her box had already been wheeled ahead\ntowards this summit by a lad with trucks, to be in readiness.\n\nSeeing their mother put on her bonnet, the younger children clamoured\nto go with her.\n\n“I do want to walk a little-ways wi’ Sissy, now she’s going to marry\nour gentleman-cousin, and wear fine cloze!”\n\n“Now,” said Tess, flushing and turning quickly, “I’ll hear no more o’\nthat! Mother, how could you ever put such stuff into their heads?”\n\n“Going to work, my dears, for our rich relation, and help get enough\nmoney for a new horse,” said Mrs Durbeyfield pacifically.\n\n“Goodbye, father,” said Tess, with a lumpy throat.\n\n“Goodbye, my maid,” said Sir John, raising his head from his breast as\nhe suspended his nap, induced by a slight excess this morning in honour\nof the occasion. “Well, I hope my young friend will like such a comely\nsample of his own blood. And tell’n, Tess, that being sunk, quite, from\nour former grandeur, I’ll sell him the title—yes, sell it—and at no\nonreasonable figure.”\n\n“Not for less than a thousand pound!” cried Lady Durbeyfield.\n\n“Tell’n—I’ll take a thousand pound. Well, I’ll take less, when I come\nto think o’t. He’ll adorn it better than a poor lammicken feller like\nmyself can. Tell’n he shall hae it for a hundred. But I won’t stand\nupon trifles—tell’n he shall hae it for fifty—for twenty pound! Yes,\ntwenty pound—that’s the lowest. Dammy, family honour is family honour,\nand I won’t take a penny less!”\n\nTess’s eyes were too full and her voice too choked to utter the\nsentiments that were in her. She turned quickly, and went out.\n\nSo the girls and their mother all walked together, a child on each side\nof Tess, holding her hand and looking at her meditatively from time to\ntime, as at one who was about to do great things; her mother just\nbehind with the smallest; the group forming a picture of honest beauty\nflanked by innocence, and backed by simple-souled vanity. They followed\nthe way till they reached the beginning of the ascent, on the crest of\nwhich the vehicle from Trantridge was to receive her, this limit having\nbeen fixed to save the horse the labour of the last slope. Far away\nbehind the first hills the cliff-like dwellings of Shaston broke the\nline of the ridge. Nobody was visible in the elevated road which\nskirted the ascent save the lad whom they had sent on before them,\nsitting on the handle of the barrow that contained all Tess’s worldly\npossessions.\n\n“Bide here a bit, and the cart will soon come, no doubt,” said Mrs\nDurbeyfield. “Yes, I see it yonder!”\n\nIt had come—appearing suddenly from behind the forehead of the nearest\nupland, and stopping beside the boy with the barrow. Her mother and the\nchildren thereupon decided to go no farther, and bidding them a hasty\ngoodbye, Tess bent her steps up the hill.\n\nThey saw her white shape draw near to the spring-cart, on which her box\nwas already placed. But before she had quite reached it another vehicle\nshot out from a clump of trees on the summit, came round the bend of\nthe road there, passed the luggage-cart, and halted beside Tess, who\nlooked up as if in great surprise.\n\nHer mother perceived, for the first time, that the second vehicle was\nnot a humble conveyance like the first, but a spick-and-span gig or\ndog-cart, highly varnished and equipped. The driver was a young man of\nthree- or four-and-twenty, with a cigar between his teeth; wearing a\ndandy cap, drab jacket, breeches of the same hue, white neckcloth,\nstick-up collar, and brown driving-gloves—in short, he was the\nhandsome, horsey young buck who had visited Joan a week or two before\nto get her answer about Tess.\n\nMrs Durbeyfield clapped her hands like a child. Then she looked down,\nthen stared again. Could she be deceived as to the meaning of this?\n\n“Is dat the gentleman-kinsman who’ll make Sissy a lady?” asked the\nyoungest child.\n\nMeanwhile the muslined form of Tess could be seen standing still,\nundecided, beside this turn-out, whose owner was talking to her. Her\nseeming indecision was, in fact, more than indecision: it was\nmisgiving. She would have preferred the humble cart. The young man\ndismounted, and appeared to urge her to ascend. She turned her face\ndown the hill to her relatives, and regarded the little group.\nSomething seemed to quicken her to a determination; possibly the\nthought that she had killed Prince. She suddenly stepped up; he mounted\nbeside her, and immediately whipped on the horse. In a moment they had\npassed the slow cart with the box, and disappeared behind the shoulder\nof the hill.\n\nDirectly Tess was out of sight, and the interest of the matter as a\ndrama was at an end, the little ones’ eyes filled with tears. The\nyoungest child said, “I wish poor, poor Tess wasn’t gone away to be a\nlady!” and, lowering the corners of his lips, burst out crying. The new\npoint of view was infectious, and the next child did likewise, and then\nthe next, till the whole three of them wailed loud.\n\nThere were tears also in Joan Durbeyfield’s eyes as she turned to go\nhome. But by the time she had got back to the village she was passively\ntrusting to the favour of accident. However, in bed that night she\nsighed, and her husband asked her what was the matter.\n\n“Oh, I don’t know exactly,” she said. “I was thinking that perhaps it\nwould ha’ been better if Tess had not gone.”\n\n“Oughtn’t ye to have thought of that before?”\n\n“Well, ’tis a chance for the maid—Still, if ’twere the doing again, I\nwouldn’t let her go till I had found out whether the gentleman is\nreally a good-hearted young man and choice over her as his kinswoman.”\n\n“Yes, you ought, perhaps, to ha’ done that,” snored Sir John.\n\nJoan Durbeyfield always managed to find consolation somewhere: “Well,\nas one of the genuine stock, she ought to make her way with ’en, if she\nplays her trump card aright. And if he don’t marry her afore he will\nafter. For that he’s all afire wi’ love for her any eye can see.”\n\n“What’s her trump card? Her d’Urberville blood, you mean?”\n\n“No, stupid; her face—as ’twas mine.”\n\n\nVIII\n\nHaving mounted beside her, Alec d’Urberville drove rapidly along the\ncrest of the first hill, chatting compliments to Tess as they went, the\ncart with her box being left far behind. Rising still, an immense\nlandscape stretched around them on every side; behind, the green valley\nof her birth, before, a gray country of which she knew nothing except\nfrom her first brief visit to Trantridge. Thus they reached the verge\nof an incline down which the road stretched in a long straight descent\nof nearly a mile.\n\nEver since the accident with her father’s horse Tess Durbeyfield,\ncourageous as she naturally was, had been exceedingly timid on wheels;\nthe least irregularity of motion startled her. She began to get uneasy\nat a certain recklessness in her conductor’s driving.\n\n“You will go down slow, sir, I suppose?” she said with attempted\nunconcern.\n\nD’Urberville looked round upon her, nipped his cigar with the tips of\nhis large white centre-teeth, and allowed his lips to smile slowly of\nthemselves.\n\n“Why, Tess,” he answered, after another whiff or two, “it isn’t a brave\nbouncing girl like you who asks that? Why, I always go down at full\ngallop. There’s nothing like it for raising your spirits.”\n\n“But perhaps you need not now?”\n\n“Ah,” he said, shaking his head, “there are two to be reckoned with. It\nis not me alone. Tib has to be considered, and she has a very queer\ntemper.”\n\n“Who?”\n\n“Why, this mare. I fancy she looked round at me in a very grim way just\nthen. Didn’t you notice it?”\n\n“Don’t try to frighten me, sir,” said Tess stiffly.\n\n“Well, I don’t. If any living man can manage this horse I can: I won’t\nsay any living man can do it—but if such has the power, I am he.”\n\n“Why do you have such a horse?”\n\n“Ah, well may you ask it! It was my fate, I suppose. Tib has killed one\nchap; and just after I bought her she nearly killed me. And then, take\nmy word for it, I nearly killed her. But she’s touchy still, very\ntouchy; and one’s life is hardly safe behind her sometimes.”\n\nThey were just beginning to descend; and it was evident that the horse,\nwhether of her own will or of his (the latter being the more likely),\nknew so well the reckless performance expected of her that she hardly\nrequired a hint from behind.\n\nDown, down, they sped, the wheels humming like a top, the dog-cart\nrocking right and left, its axis acquiring a slightly oblique set in\nrelation to the line of progress; the figure of the horse rising and\nfalling in undulations before them. Sometimes a wheel was off the\nground, it seemed, for many yards; sometimes a stone was sent spinning\nover the hedge, and flinty sparks from the horse’s hoofs outshone the\ndaylight. The aspect of the straight road enlarged with their advance,\nthe two banks dividing like a splitting stick; one rushing past at each\nshoulder.\n\nThe wind blew through Tess’s white muslin to her very skin, and her\nwashed hair flew out behind. She was determined to show no open fear,\nbut she clutched d’Urberville’s rein-arm.\n\n“Don’t touch my arm! We shall be thrown out if you do! Hold on round my\nwaist!”\n\nShe grasped his waist, and so they reached the bottom.\n\n“Safe, thank God, in spite of your fooling!” said she, her face on\nfire.\n\n“Tess—fie! that’s temper!” said d’Urberville.\n\n“’Tis truth.”\n\n“Well, you need not let go your hold of me so thanklessly the moment\nyou feel yourself out of danger.”\n\nShe had not considered what she had been doing; whether he were man or\nwoman, stick or stone, in her involuntary hold on him. Recovering her\nreserve, she sat without replying, and thus they reached the summit of\nanother declivity.\n\n“Now then, again!” said d’Urberville.\n\n“No, no!” said Tess. “Show more sense, do, please.”\n\n“But when people find themselves on one of the highest points in the\ncounty, they must get down again,” he retorted.\n\nHe loosened rein, and away they went a second time. D’Urberville turned\nhis face to her as they rocked, and said, in playful raillery: “Now\nthen, put your arms round my waist again, as you did before, my\nBeauty.”\n\n“Never!” said Tess independently, holding on as well as she could\nwithout touching him.\n\n“Let me put one little kiss on those holmberry lips, Tess, or even on\nthat warmed cheek, and I’ll stop—on my honour, I will!”\n\nTess, surprised beyond measure, slid farther back still on her seat, at\nwhich he urged the horse anew, and rocked her the more.\n\n“Will nothing else do?” she cried at length, in desperation, her large\neyes staring at him like those of a wild animal. This dressing her up\nso prettily by her mother had apparently been to lamentable purpose.\n\n“Nothing, dear Tess,” he replied.\n\n“Oh, I don’t know—very well; I don’t mind!” she panted miserably.\n\nHe drew rein, and as they slowed he was on the point of imprinting the\ndesired salute, when, as if hardly yet aware of her own modesty, she\ndodged aside. His arms being occupied with the reins there was left him\nno power to prevent her manœuvre.\n\n“Now, damn it—I’ll break both our necks!” swore her capriciously\npassionate companion. “So you can go from your word like that, you\nyoung witch, can you?”\n\n“Very well,” said Tess, “I’ll not move since you be so determined! But\nI—thought you would be kind to me, and protect me, as my kinsman!”\n\n“Kinsman be hanged! Now!”\n\n“But I don’t want anybody to kiss me, sir!” she implored, a big tear\nbeginning to roll down her face, and the corners of her mouth trembling\nin her attempts not to cry. “And I wouldn’t ha’ come if I had known!”\n\nHe was inexorable, and she sat still, and d’Urberville gave her the\nkiss of mastery. No sooner had he done so than she flushed with shame,\ntook out her handkerchief, and wiped the spot on her cheek that had\nbeen touched by his lips. His ardour was nettled at the sight, for the\nact on her part had been unconsciously done.\n\n“You are mighty sensitive for a cottage girl!” said the young man.\n\nTess made no reply to this remark, of which, indeed, she did not quite\ncomprehend the drift, unheeding the snub she had administered by her\ninstinctive rub upon her cheek. She had, in fact, undone the kiss, as\nfar as such a thing was physically possible. With a dim sense that he\nwas vexed she looked steadily ahead as they trotted on near Melbury\nDown and Wingreen, till she saw, to her consternation, that there was\nyet another descent to be undergone.\n\n“You shall be made sorry for that!” he resumed, his injured tone still\nremaining, as he flourished the whip anew. “Unless, that is, you agree\nwillingly to let me do it again, and no handkerchief.”\n\nShe sighed. “Very well, sir!” she said. “Oh—let me get my hat!”\n\nAt the moment of speaking her hat had blown off into the road, their\npresent speed on the upland being by no means slow. D’Urberville pulled\nup, and said he would get it for her, but Tess was down on the other\nside.\n\nShe turned back and picked up the article.\n\n“You look prettier with it off, upon my soul, if that’s possible,” he\nsaid, contemplating her over the back of the vehicle. “Now then, up\nagain! What’s the matter?”\n\nThe hat was in place and tied, but Tess had not stepped forward.\n\n“No, sir,” she said, revealing the red and ivory of her mouth as her\neye lit in defiant triumph; “not again, if I know it!”\n\n“What—you won’t get up beside me?”\n\n“No; I shall walk.”\n\n“’Tis five or six miles yet to Trantridge.”\n\n“I don’t care if ’tis dozens. Besides, the cart is behind.”\n\n“You artful hussy! Now, tell me—didn’t you make that hat blow off on\npurpose? I’ll swear you did!”\n\nHer strategic silence confirmed his suspicion.\n\nThen d’Urberville cursed and swore at her, and called her everything he\ncould think of for the trick. Turning the horse suddenly he tried to\ndrive back upon her, and so hem her in between the gig and the hedge.\nBut he could not do this short of injuring her.\n\n“You ought to be ashamed of yourself for using such wicked words!”\ncried Tess with spirit, from the top of the hedge into which she had\nscrambled. “I don’t like ’ee at all! I hate and detest you! I’ll go\nback to mother, I will!”\n\nD’Urberville’s bad temper cleared up at sight of hers; and he laughed\nheartily.\n\n“Well, I like you all the better,” he said. “Come, let there be peace.\nI’ll never do it any more against your will. My life upon it now!”\n\nStill Tess could not be induced to remount. She did not, however,\nobject to his keeping his gig alongside her; and in this manner, at a\nslow pace, they advanced towards the village of Trantridge. From time\nto time d’Urberville exhibited a sort of fierce distress at the sight\nof the tramping he had driven her to undertake by his misdemeanour. She\nmight in truth have safely trusted him now; but he had forfeited her\nconfidence for the time, and she kept on the ground progressing\nthoughtfully, as if wondering whether it would be wiser to return home.\nHer resolve, however, had been taken, and it seemed vacillating even to\nchildishness to abandon it now, unless for graver reasons. How could\nshe face her parents, get back her box, and disconcert the whole scheme\nfor the rehabilitation of her family on such sentimental grounds?\n\nA few minutes later the chimneys of The Slopes appeared in view, and in\na snug nook to the right the poultry-farm and cottage of Tess’s\ndestination.\n\n\nIX\n\nThe community of fowls to which Tess had been appointed as supervisor,\npurveyor, nurse, surgeon, and friend made its headquarters in an old\nthatched cottage standing in an enclosure that had once been a garden,\nbut was now a trampled and sanded square. The house was overrun with\nivy, its chimney being enlarged by the boughs of the parasite to the\naspect of a ruined tower. The lower rooms were entirely given over to\nthe birds, who walked about them with a proprietary air, as though the\nplace had been built by themselves, and not by certain dusty\ncopyholders who now lay east and west in the churchyard. The\ndescendants of these bygone owners felt it almost as a slight to their\nfamily when the house which had so much of their affection, had cost so\nmuch of their forefathers’ money, and had been in their possession for\nseveral generations before the d’Urbervilles came and built here, was\nindifferently turned into a fowl-house by Mrs Stoke-d’Urberville as\nsoon as the property fell into hand according to law. “’Twas good\nenough for Christians in grandfather’s time,” they said.\n\nThe rooms wherein dozens of infants had wailed at their nursing now\nresounded with the tapping of nascent chicks. Distracted hens in coops\noccupied spots where formerly stood chairs supporting sedate\nagriculturists. The chimney-corner and once-blazing hearth was now\nfilled with inverted beehives, in which the hens laid their eggs; while\nout of doors the plots that each succeeding householder had carefully\nshaped with his spade were torn by the cocks in wildest fashion.\n\nThe garden in which the cottage stood was surrounded by a wall, and\ncould only be entered through a door.\n\nWhen Tess had occupied herself about an hour the next morning in\naltering and improving the arrangements, according to her skilled ideas\nas the daughter of a professed poulterer, the door in the wall opened\nand a servant in white cap and apron entered. She had come from the\nmanor-house.\n\n“Mrs d’Urberville wants the fowls as usual,” she said; but perceiving\nthat Tess did not quite understand, she explained, “Mis’ess is a old\nlady, and blind.”\n\n“Blind!” said Tess.\n\nAlmost before her misgiving at the news could find time to shape itself\nshe took, under her companion’s direction, two of the most beautiful of\nthe Hamburghs in her arms, and followed the maid-servant, who had\nlikewise taken two, to the adjacent mansion, which, though ornate and\nimposing, showed traces everywhere on this side that some occupant of\nits chambers could bend to the love of dumb creatures—feathers floating\nwithin view of the front, and hen-coops standing on the grass.\n\nIn a sitting-room on the ground-floor, ensconced in an armchair with\nher back to the light, was the owner and mistress of the estate, a\nwhite-haired woman of not more than sixty, or even less, wearing a\nlarge cap. She had the mobile face frequent in those whose sight has\ndecayed by stages, has been laboriously striven after, and reluctantly\nlet go, rather than the stagnant mien apparent in persons long\nsightless or born blind. Tess walked up to this lady with her feathered\ncharges—one sitting on each arm.\n\n“Ah, you are the young woman come to look after my birds?” said Mrs\nd’Urberville, recognizing a new footstep. “I hope you will be kind to\nthem. My bailiff tells me you are quite the proper person. Well, where\nare they? Ah, this is Strut! But he is hardly so lively to-day, is he?\nHe is alarmed at being handled by a stranger, I suppose. And Phena\ntoo—yes, they are a little frightened—aren’t you, dears? But they will\nsoon get used to you.”\n\nWhile the old lady had been speaking Tess and the other maid, in\nobedience to her gestures, had placed the fowls severally in her lap,\nand she had felt them over from head to tail, examining their beaks,\ntheir combs, the manes of the cocks, their wings, and their claws. Her\ntouch enabled her to recognize them in a moment, and to discover if a\nsingle feather were crippled or draggled. She handled their crops, and\nknew what they had eaten, and if too little or too much; her face\nenacting a vivid pantomime of the criticisms passing in her mind.\n\nThe birds that the two girls had brought in were duly returned to the\nyard, and the process was repeated till all the pet cocks and hens had\nbeen submitted to the old woman—Hamburghs, Bantams, Cochins, Brahmas,\nDorkings, and such other sorts as were in fashion just then—her\nperception of each visitor being seldom at fault as she received the\nbird upon her knees.\n\nIt reminded Tess of a Confirmation, in which Mrs d’Urberville was the\nbishop, the fowls the young people presented, and herself and the\nmaid-servant the parson and curate of the parish bringing them up. At\nthe end of the ceremony Mrs d’Urberville abruptly asked Tess, wrinkling\nand twitching her face into undulations, “Can you whistle?”\n\n“Whistle, Ma’am?”\n\n“Yes, whistle tunes.”\n\nTess could whistle like most other country-girls, though the\naccomplishment was one which she did not care to profess in genteel\ncompany. However, she blandly admitted that such was the fact.\n\n“Then you will have to practise it every day. I had a lad who did it\nvery well, but he has left. I want you to whistle to my bullfinches; as\nI cannot see them, I like to hear them, and we teach ’em airs that way.\nTell her where the cages are, Elizabeth. You must begin to-morrow, or\nthey will go back in their piping. They have been neglected these\nseveral days.”\n\n“Mr d’Urberville whistled to ’em this morning, ma’am,” said Elizabeth.\n\n“He! Pooh!”\n\nThe old lady’s face creased into furrows of repugnance, and she made no\nfurther reply.\n\nThus the reception of Tess by her fancied kinswoman terminated, and the\nbirds were taken back to their quarters. The girl’s surprise at Mrs\nd’Urberville’s manner was not great; for since seeing the size of the\nhouse she had expected no more. But she was far from being aware that\nthe old lady had never heard a word of the so-called kinship. She\ngathered that no great affection flowed between the blind woman and her\nson. But in that, too, she was mistaken. Mrs d’Urberville was not the\nfirst mother compelled to love her offspring resentfully, and to be\nbitterly fond.\n\nIn spite of the unpleasant initiation of the day before, Tess inclined\nto the freedom and novelty of her new position in the morning when the\nsun shone, now that she was once installed there; and she was curious\nto test her powers in the unexpected direction asked of her, so as to\nascertain her chance of retaining her post. As soon as she was alone\nwithin the walled garden she sat herself down on a coop, and seriously\nscrewed up her mouth for the long-neglected practice. She found her\nformer ability to have degenerated to the production of a hollow rush\nof wind through the lips, and no clear note at all.\n\nShe remained fruitlessly blowing and blowing, wondering how she could\nhave so grown out of the art which had come by nature, till she became\naware of a movement among the ivy-boughs which cloaked the garden-wall\nno less then the cottage. Looking that way she beheld a form springing\nfrom the coping to the plot. It was Alec d’Urberville, whom she had not\nset eyes on since he had conducted her the day before to the door of\nthe gardener’s cottage where she had lodgings.\n\n“Upon my honour!” cried he, “there was never before such a beautiful\nthing in Nature or Art as you look, ‘Cousin’ Tess (‘Cousin’ had a faint\nring of mockery). I have been watching you from over the wall—sitting\nlike _Im_-patience on a monument, and pouting up that pretty red mouth\nto whistling shape, and whooing and whooing, and privately swearing,\nand never being able to produce a note. Why, you are quite cross\nbecause you can’t do it.”\n\n“I may be cross, but I didn’t swear.”\n\n“Ah! I understand why you are trying—those bullies! My mother wants you\nto carry on their musical education. How selfish of her! As if\nattending to these curst cocks and hens here were not enough work for\nany girl. I would flatly refuse, if I were you.”\n\n“But she wants me particularly to do it, and to be ready by to-morrow\nmorning.”\n\n“Does she? Well then—I’ll give you a lesson or two.”\n\n“Oh no, you won’t!” said Tess, withdrawing towards the door.\n\n“Nonsense; I don’t want to touch you. See—I’ll stand on this side of\nthe wire-netting, and you can keep on the other; so you may feel quite\nsafe. Now, look here; you screw up your lips too harshly. There\n’tis—so.”\n\nHe suited the action to the word, and whistled a line of “Take, O take\nthose lips away.” But the allusion was lost upon Tess.\n\n“Now try,” said d’Urberville.\n\nShe attempted to look reserved; her face put on a sculptural severity.\nBut he persisted in his demand, and at last, to get rid of him, she did\nput up her lips as directed for producing a clear note; laughing\ndistressfully, however, and then blushing with vexation that she had\nlaughed.\n\nHe encouraged her with “Try again!”\n\nTess was quite serious, painfully serious by this time; and she\ntried—ultimately and unexpectedly emitting a real round sound. The\nmomentary pleasure of success got the better of her; her eyes enlarged,\nand she involuntarily smiled in his face.\n\n“That’s it! Now I have started you—you’ll go on beautifully. There—I\nsaid I would not come near you; and, in spite of such temptation as\nnever before fell to mortal man, I’ll keep my word.... Tess, do you\nthink my mother a queer old soul?”\n\n“I don’t know much of her yet, sir.”\n\n“You’ll find her so; she must be, to make you learn to whistle to her\nbullfinches. I am rather out of her books just now, but you will be\nquite in favour if you treat her live-stock well. Good morning. If you\nmeet with any difficulties and want help here, don’t go to the bailiff,\ncome to me.”\n\nIt was in the economy of this _régime_ that Tess Durbeyfield had\nundertaken to fill a place. Her first day’s experiences were fairly\ntypical of those which followed through many succeeding days. A\nfamiliarity with Alec d’Urberville’s presence—which that young man\ncarefully cultivated in her by playful dialogue, and by jestingly\ncalling her his cousin when they were alone—removed much of her\noriginal shyness of him, without, however, implanting any feeling which\ncould engender shyness of a new and tenderer kind. But she was more\npliable under his hands than a mere companionship would have made her,\nowing to her unavoidable dependence upon his mother, and, through that\nlady’s comparative helplessness, upon him.\n\nShe soon found that whistling to the bullfinches in Mrs d’Urberville’s\nroom was no such onerous business when she had regained the art, for\nshe had caught from her musical mother numerous airs that suited those\nsongsters admirably. A far more satisfactory time than when she\npractised in the garden was this whistling by the cages each morning.\nUnrestrained by the young man’s presence she threw up her mouth, put\nher lips near the bars, and piped away in easeful grace to the\nattentive listeners.\n\nMrs d’Urberville slept in a large four-post bedstead hung with heavy\ndamask curtains, and the bullfinches occupied the same apartment, where\nthey flitted about freely at certain hours, and made little white spots\non the furniture and upholstery. Once while Tess was at the window\nwhere the cages were ranged, giving her lesson as usual, she thought\nshe heard a rustling behind the bed. The old lady was not present, and\nturning round the girl had an impression that the toes of a pair of\nboots were visible below the fringe of the curtains. Thereupon her\nwhistling became so disjointed that the listener, if such there were,\nmust have discovered her suspicion of his presence. She searched the\ncurtains every morning after that, but never found anybody within them.\nAlec d’Urberville had evidently thought better of his freak to terrify\nher by an ambush of that kind.\n\n\nX\n\nEvery village has its idiosyncrasy, its constitution, often its own\ncode of morality. The levity of some of the younger women in and about\nTrantridge was marked, and was perhaps symptomatic of the choice spirit\nwho ruled The Slopes in that vicinity. The place had also a more\nabiding defect; it drank hard. The staple conversation on the farms\naround was on the uselessness of saving money; and smock-frocked\narithmeticians, leaning on their ploughs or hoes, would enter into\ncalculations of great nicety to prove that parish relief was a fuller\nprovision for a man in his old age than any which could result from\nsavings out of their wages during a whole lifetime.\n\nThe chief pleasure of these philosophers lay in going every Saturday\nnight, when work was done, to Chaseborough, a decayed market-town two\nor three miles distant; and, returning in the small hours of the next\nmorning, to spend Sunday in sleeping off the dyspeptic effects of the\ncurious compounds sold to them as beer by the monopolizers of the\nonce-independent inns.\n\nFor a long time Tess did not join in the weekly pilgrimages. But under\npressure from matrons not much older than herself—for a field-man’s\nwages being as high at twenty-one as at forty, marriage was early\nhere—Tess at length consented to go. Her first experience of the\njourney afforded her more enjoyment than she had expected, the\nhilariousness of the others being quite contagious after her monotonous\nattention to the poultry-farm all the week. She went again and again.\nBeing graceful and interesting, standing moreover on the momentary\nthreshold of womanhood, her appearance drew down upon her some sly\nregards from loungers in the streets of Chaseborough; hence, though\nsometimes her journey to the town was made independently, she always\nsearched for her fellows at nightfall, to have the protection of their\ncompanionship homeward.\n\nThis had gone on for a month or two when there came a Saturday in\nSeptember, on which a fair and a market coincided; and the pilgrims\nfrom Trantridge sought double delights at the inns on that account.\nTess’s occupations made her late in setting out, so that her comrades\nreached the town long before her. It was a fine September evening, just\nbefore sunset, when yellow lights struggle with blue shades in hairlike\nlines, and the atmosphere itself forms a prospect without aid from more\nsolid objects, except the innumerable winged insects that dance in it.\nThrough this low-lit mistiness Tess walked leisurely along.\n\nShe did not discover the coincidence of the market with the fair till\nshe had reached the place, by which time it was close upon dusk. Her\nlimited marketing was soon completed; and then as usual she began to\nlook about for some of the Trantridge cottagers.\n\nAt first she could not find them, and she was informed that most of\nthem had gone to what they called a private little jig at the house of\na hay-trusser and peat-dealer who had transactions with their farm. He\nlived in an out-of-the-way nook of the townlet, and in trying to find\nher course thither her eyes fell upon Mr d’Urberville standing at a\nstreet corner.\n\n“What—my Beauty? You here so late?” he said.\n\nShe told him that she was simply waiting for company homeward.\n\n“I’ll see you again,” said he over her shoulder as she went on down the\nback lane.\n\nApproaching the hay-trussers, she could hear the fiddled notes of a\nreel proceeding from some building in the rear; but no sound of dancing\nwas audible—an exceptional state of things for these parts, where as a\nrule the stamping drowned the music. The front door being open she\ncould see straight through the house into the garden at the back as far\nas the shades of night would allow; and nobody appearing to her knock,\nshe traversed the dwelling and went up the path to the outhouse whence\nthe sound had attracted her.\n\nIt was a windowless erection used for storage, and from the open door\nthere floated into the obscurity a mist of yellow radiance, which at\nfirst Tess thought to be illuminated smoke. But on drawing nearer she\nperceived that it was a cloud of dust, lit by candles within the\nouthouse, whose beams upon the haze carried forward the outline of the\ndoorway into the wide night of the garden.\n\nWhen she came close and looked in she beheld indistinct forms racing up\nand down to the figure of the dance, the silence of their footfalls\narising from their being overshoe in “scroff”—that is to say, the\npowdery residuum from the storage of peat and other products, the\nstirring of which by their turbulent feet created the nebulosity that\ninvolved the scene. Through this floating, fusty _débris_ of peat and\nhay, mixed with the perspirations and warmth of the dancers, and\nforming together a sort of vegeto-human pollen, the muted fiddles\nfeebly pushed their notes, in marked contrast to the spirit with which\nthe measure was trodden out. They coughed as they danced, and laughed\nas they coughed. Of the rushing couples there could barely be discerned\nmore than the high lights—the indistinctness shaping them to satyrs\nclasping nymphs—a multiplicity of Pans whirling a multiplicity of\nSyrinxes; Lotis attempting to elude Priapus, and always failing.\n\nAt intervals a couple would approach the doorway for air, and the haze\nno longer veiling their features, the demigods resolved themselves into\nthe homely personalities of her own next-door neighbours. Could\nTrantridge in two or three short hours have metamorphosed itself thus\nmadly!\n\nSome Sileni of the throng sat on benches and hay-trusses by the wall;\nand one of them recognized her.\n\n“The maids don’t think it respectable to dance at The Flower-de-Luce,”\nhe explained. “They don’t like to let everybody see which be their\nfancy-men. Besides, the house sometimes shuts up just when their jints\nbegin to get greased. So we come here and send out for liquor.”\n\n“But when be any of you going home?” asked Tess with some anxiety.\n\n“Now—a’most directly. This is all but the last jig.”\n\nShe waited. The reel drew to a close, and some of the party were in the\nmind of starting. But others would not, and another dance was formed.\nThis surely would end it, thought Tess. But it merged in yet another.\nShe became restless and uneasy; yet, having waited so long, it was\nnecessary to wait longer; on account of the fair the roads were dotted\nwith roving characters of possibly ill intent; and, though not fearful\nof measurable dangers, she feared the unknown. Had she been near\nMarlott she would have had less dread.\n\n“Don’t ye be nervous, my dear good soul,” expostulated, between his\ncoughs, a young man with a wet face and his straw hat so far back upon\nhis head that the brim encircled it like the nimbus of a saint. “What’s\nyer hurry? To-morrow is Sunday, thank God, and we can sleep it off in\nchurch-time. Now, have a turn with me?”\n\nShe did not abhor dancing, but she was not going to dance here. The\nmovement grew more passionate: the fiddlers behind the luminous pillar\nof cloud now and then varied the air by playing on the wrong side of\nthe bridge or with the back of the bow. But it did not matter; the\npanting shapes spun onwards.\n\nThey did not vary their partners if their inclination were to stick to\nprevious ones. Changing partners simply meant that a satisfactory\nchoice had not as yet been arrived at by one or other of the pair, and\nby this time every couple had been suitably matched. It was then that\nthe ecstasy and the dream began, in which emotion was the matter of the\nuniverse, and matter but an adventitious intrusion likely to hinder you\nfrom spinning where you wanted to spin.\n\nSuddenly there was a dull thump on the ground: a couple had fallen, and\nlay in a mixed heap. The next couple, unable to check its progress,\ncame toppling over the obstacle. An inner cloud of dust rose around the\nprostrate figures amid the general one of the room, in which a\ntwitching entanglement of arms and legs was discernible.\n\n“You shall catch it for this, my gentleman, when you get home!” burst\nin female accents from the human heap—those of the unhappy partner of\nthe man whose clumsiness had caused the mishap; she happened also to be\nhis recently married wife, in which assortment there was nothing\nunusual at Trantridge as long as any affection remained between wedded\ncouples; and, indeed, it was not uncustomary in their later lives, to\navoid making odd lots of the single people between whom there might be\na warm understanding.\n\nA loud laugh from behind Tess’s back, in the shade of the garden,\nunited with the titter within the room. She looked round, and saw the\nred coal of a cigar: Alec d’Urberville was standing there alone. He\nbeckoned to her, and she reluctantly retreated towards him.\n\n“Well, my Beauty, what are you doing here?”\n\nShe was so tired after her long day and her walk that she confided her\ntrouble to him—that she had been waiting ever since he saw her to have\ntheir company home, because the road at night was strange to her. “But\nit seems they will never leave off, and I really think I will wait no\nlonger.”\n\n“Certainly do not. I have only a saddle-horse here to-day; but come to\nThe Flower-de-Luce, and I’ll hire a trap, and drive you home with me.”\n\nTess, though flattered, had never quite got over her original mistrust\nof him, and, despite their tardiness, she preferred to walk home with\nthe work-folk. So she answered that she was much obliged to him, but\nwould not trouble him. “I have said that I will wait for ’em, and they\nwill expect me to now.”\n\n“Very well, Miss Independence. Please yourself... Then I shall not\nhurry... My good Lord, what a kick-up they are having there!”\n\nHe had not put himself forward into the light, but some of them had\nperceived him, and his presence led to a slight pause and a\nconsideration of how the time was flying. As soon as he had re-lit a\ncigar and walked away the Trantridge people began to collect themselves\nfrom amid those who had come in from other farms, and prepared to leave\nin a body. Their bundles and baskets were gathered up, and half an hour\nlater, when the clock-chime sounded a quarter past eleven, they were\nstraggling along the lane which led up the hill towards their homes.\n\nIt was a three-mile walk, along a dry white road, made whiter to-night\nby the light of the moon.\n\nTess soon perceived as she walked in the flock, sometimes with this\none, sometimes with that, that the fresh night air was producing\nstaggerings and serpentine courses among the men who had partaken too\nfreely; some of the more careless women also were wandering in their\ngait—to wit, a dark virago, Car Darch, dubbed Queen of Spades, till\nlately a favourite of d’Urberville’s; Nancy, her sister, nicknamed the\nQueen of Diamonds; and the young married woman who had already tumbled\ndown. Yet however terrestrial and lumpy their appearance just now to\nthe mean unglamoured eye, to themselves the case was different. They\nfollowed the road with a sensation that they were soaring along in a\nsupporting medium, possessed of original and profound thoughts,\nthemselves and surrounding nature forming an organism of which all the\nparts harmoniously and joyously interpenetrated each other. They were\nas sublime as the moon and stars above them, and the moon and stars\nwere as ardent as they.\n\nTess, however, had undergone such painful experiences of this kind in\nher father’s house that the discovery of their condition spoilt the\npleasure she was beginning to feel in the moonlight journey. Yet she\nstuck to the party, for reasons above given.\n\nIn the open highway they had progressed in scattered order; but now\ntheir route was through a field-gate, and the foremost finding a\ndifficulty in opening it, they closed up together.\n\nThis leading pedestrian was Car the Queen of Spades, who carried a\nwicker-basket containing her mother’s groceries, her own draperies, and\nother purchases for the week. The basket being large and heavy, Car had\nplaced it for convenience of porterage on the top of her head, where it\nrode on in jeopardized balance as she walked with arms akimbo.\n\n“Well—whatever is that a-creeping down thy back, Car Darch?” said one\nof the group suddenly.\n\nAll looked at Car. Her gown was a light cotton print, and from the back\nof her head a kind of rope could be seen descending to some distance\nbelow her waist, like a Chinaman’s queue.\n\n“’Tis her hair falling down,” said another.\n\nNo; it was not her hair: it was a black stream of something oozing from\nher basket, and it glistened like a slimy snake in the cold still rays\nof the moon.\n\n“’Tis treacle,” said an observant matron.\n\nTreacle it was. Car’s poor old grandmother had a weakness for the sweet\nstuff. Honey she had in plenty out of her own hives, but treacle was\nwhat her soul desired, and Car had been about to give her a treat of\nsurprise. Hastily lowering the basket the dark girl found that the\nvessel containing the syrup had been smashed within.\n\nBy this time there had arisen a shout of laughter at the extraordinary\nappearance of Car’s back, which irritated the dark queen into getting\nrid of the disfigurement by the first sudden means available, and\nindependently of the help of the scoffers. She rushed excitedly into\nthe field they were about to cross, and flinging herself flat on her\nback upon the grass, began to wipe her gown as well as she could by\nspinning horizontally on the herbage and dragging herself over it upon\nher elbows.\n\nThe laughter rang louder; they clung to the gate, to the posts, rested\non their staves, in the weakness engendered by their convulsions at the\nspectacle of Car. Our heroine, who had hitherto held her peace, at this\nwild moment could not help joining in with the rest.\n\nIt was a misfortune—in more ways than one. No sooner did the dark queen\nhear the soberer richer note of Tess among those of the other\nwork-people than a long-smouldering sense of rivalry inflamed her to\nmadness. She sprang to her feet and closely faced the object of her\ndislike.\n\n“How darest th’ laugh at me, hussy!” she cried.\n\n“I couldn’t really help it when t’others did,” apologized Tess, still\ntittering.\n\n“Ah, th’st think th’ beest everybody, dostn’t, because th’ beest first\nfavourite with He just now! But stop a bit, my lady, stop a bit! I’m as\ngood as two of such! Look here—here’s at ’ee!”\n\nTo Tess’s horror the dark queen began stripping off the bodice of her\ngown—which for the added reason of its ridiculed condition she was only\ntoo glad to be free of—till she had bared her plump neck, shoulders,\nand arms to the moonshine, under which they looked as luminous and\nbeautiful as some Praxitelean creation, in their possession of the\nfaultless rotundities of a lusty country-girl. She closed her fists and\nsquared up at Tess.\n\n“Indeed, then, I shall not fight!” said the latter majestically; “and\nif I had known you was of that sort, I wouldn’t have so let myself down\nas to come with such a whorage as this is!”\n\nThe rather too inclusive speech brought down a torrent of vituperation\nfrom other quarters upon fair Tess’s unlucky head, particularly from\nthe Queen of Diamonds, who having stood in the relations to\nd’Urberville that Car had also been suspected of, united with the\nlatter against the common enemy. Several other women also chimed in,\nwith an animus which none of them would have been so fatuous as to show\nbut for the rollicking evening they had passed. Thereupon, finding Tess\nunfairly browbeaten, the husbands and lovers tried to make peace by\ndefending her; but the result of that attempt was directly to increase\nthe war.\n\nTess was indignant and ashamed. She no longer minded the loneliness of\nthe way and the lateness of the hour; her one object was to get away\nfrom the whole crew as soon as possible. She knew well enough that the\nbetter among them would repent of their passion next day. They were all\nnow inside the field, and she was edging back to rush off alone when a\nhorseman emerged almost silently from the corner of the hedge that\nscreened the road, and Alec d’Urberville looked round upon them.\n\n“What the devil is all this row about, work-folk?” he asked.\n\nThe explanation was not readily forthcoming; and, in truth, he did not\nrequire any. Having heard their voices while yet some way off he had\nridden creepingly forward, and learnt enough to satisfy himself.\n\nTess was standing apart from the rest, near the gate. He bent over\ntowards her. “Jump up behind me,” he whispered, “and we’ll get shot of\nthe screaming cats in a jiffy!”\n\nShe felt almost ready to faint, so vivid was her sense of the crisis.\nAt almost any other moment of her life she would have refused such\nproffered aid and company, as she had refused them several times\nbefore; and now the loneliness would not of itself have forced her to\ndo otherwise. But coming as the invitation did at the particular\njuncture when fear and indignation at these adversaries could be\ntransformed by a spring of the foot into a triumph over them, she\nabandoned herself to her impulse, climbed the gate, put her toe upon\nhis instep, and scrambled into the saddle behind him. The pair were\nspeeding away into the distant gray by the time that the contentious\nrevellers became aware of what had happened.\n\nThe Queen of Spades forgot the stain on her bodice, and stood beside\nthe Queen of Diamonds and the new-married, staggering young woman—all\nwith a gaze of fixity in the direction in which the horse’s tramp was\ndiminishing into silence on the road.\n\n“What be ye looking at?” asked a man who had not observed the incident.\n\n“Ho-ho-ho!” laughed dark Car.\n\n“Hee-hee-hee!” laughed the tippling bride, as she steadied herself on\nthe arm of her fond husband.\n\n“Heu-heu-heu!” laughed dark Car’s mother, stroking her moustache as she\nexplained laconically: “Out of the frying-pan into the fire!”\n\nThen these children of the open air, whom even excess of alcohol could\nscarce injure permanently, betook themselves to the field-path; and as\nthey went there moved onward with them, around the shadow of each one’s\nhead, a circle of opalized light, formed by the moon’s rays upon the\nglistening sheet of dew. Each pedestrian could see no halo but his or\nher own, which never deserted the head-shadow, whatever its vulgar\nunsteadiness might be; but adhered to it, and persistently beautified\nit; till the erratic motions seemed an inherent part of the\nirradiation, and the fumes of their breathing a component of the\nnight’s mist; and the spirit of the scene, and of the moonlight, and of\nNature, seemed harmoniously to mingle with the spirit of wine.\n\n\nXI\n\nThe twain cantered along for some time without speech, Tess as she\nclung to him still panting in her triumph, yet in other respects\ndubious. She had perceived that the horse was not the spirited one he\nsometimes rose, and felt no alarm on that score, though her seat was\nprecarious enough despite her tight hold of him. She begged him to slow\nthe animal to a walk, which Alec accordingly did.\n\n“Neatly done, was it not, dear Tess?” he said by and by.\n\n“Yes!” said she. “I am sure I ought to be much obliged to you.”\n\n“And are you?”\n\nShe did not reply.\n\n“Tess, why do you always dislike my kissing you?”\n\n“I suppose—because I don’t love you.”\n\n“You are quite sure?”\n\n“I am angry with you sometimes!”\n\n“Ah, I half feared as much.” Nevertheless, Alec did not object to that\nconfession. He knew that anything was better then frigidity. “Why\nhaven’t you told me when I have made you angry?”\n\n“You know very well why. Because I cannot help myself here.”\n\n“I haven’t offended you often by love-making?”\n\n“You have sometimes.”\n\n“How many times?”\n\n“You know as well as I—too many times.”\n\n“Every time I have tried?”\n\nShe was silent, and the horse ambled along for a considerable distance,\ntill a faint luminous fog, which had hung in the hollows all the\nevening, became general and enveloped them. It seemed to hold the\nmoonlight in suspension, rendering it more pervasive than in clear air.\nWhether on this account, or from absent-mindedness, or from sleepiness,\nshe did not perceive that they had long ago passed the point at which\nthe lane to Trantridge branched from the highway, and that her\nconductor had not taken the Trantridge track.\n\nShe was inexpressibly weary. She had risen at five o’clock every\nmorning of that week, had been on foot the whole of each day, and on\nthis evening had in addition walked the three miles to Chaseborough,\nwaited three hours for her neighbours without eating or drinking, her\nimpatience to start them preventing either; she had then walked a mile\nof the way home, and had undergone the excitement of the quarrel, till,\nwith the slow progress of their steed, it was now nearly one o’clock.\nOnly once, however, was she overcome by actual drowsiness. In that\nmoment of oblivion her head sank gently against him.\n\nD’Urberville stopped the horse, withdrew his feet from the stirrups,\nturned sideways on the saddle, and enclosed her waist with his arm to\nsupport her.\n\nThis immediately put her on the defensive, and with one of those sudden\nimpulses of reprisal to which she was liable she gave him a little push\nfrom her. In his ticklish position he nearly lost his balance and only\njust avoided rolling over into the road, the horse, though a powerful\none, being fortunately the quietest he rode.\n\n“That is devilish unkind!” he said. “I mean no harm—only to keep you\nfrom falling.”\n\nShe pondered suspiciously, till, thinking that this might after all be\ntrue, she relented, and said quite humbly, “I beg your pardon, sir.”\n\n“I won’t pardon you unless you show some confidence in me. Good God!”\nhe burst out, “what am I, to be repulsed so by a mere chit like you?\nFor near three mortal months have you trifled with my feelings, eluded\nme, and snubbed me; and I won’t stand it!”\n\n“I’ll leave you to-morrow, sir.”\n\n“No, you will not leave me to-morrow! Will you, I ask once more, show\nyour belief in me by letting me clasp you with my arm? Come, between us\ntwo and nobody else, now. We know each other well; and you know that I\nlove you, and think you the prettiest girl in the world, which you are.\nMayn’t I treat you as a lover?”\n\nShe drew a quick pettish breath of objection, writhing uneasily on her\nseat, looked far ahead, and murmured, “I don’t know—I wish—how can I\nsay yes or no when—”\n\nHe settled the matter by clasping his arm round her as he desired, and\nTess expressed no further negative. Thus they sidled slowly onward till\nit struck her they had been advancing for an unconscionable time—far\nlonger than was usually occupied by the short journey from\nChaseborough, even at this walking pace, and that they were no longer\non hard road, but in a mere trackway.\n\n“Why, where be we?” she exclaimed.\n\n“Passing by a wood.”\n\n“A wood—what wood? Surely we are quite out of the road?”\n\n“A bit of The Chase—the oldest wood in England. It is a lovely night,\nand why should we not prolong our ride a little?”\n\n“How could you be so treacherous!” said Tess, between archness and real\ndismay, and getting rid of his arm by pulling open his fingers one by\none, though at the risk of slipping off herself. “Just when I’ve been\nputting such trust in you, and obliging you to please you, because I\nthought I had wronged you by that push! Please set me down, and let me\nwalk home.”\n\n“You cannot walk home, darling, even if the air were clear. We are\nmiles away from Trantridge, if I must tell you, and in this growing fog\nyou might wander for hours among these trees.”\n\n“Never mind that,” she coaxed. “Put me down, I beg you. I don’t mind\nwhere it is; only let me get down, sir, please!”\n\n“Very well, then, I will—on one condition. Having brought you here to\nthis out-of-the-way place, I feel myself responsible for your\nsafe-conduct home, whatever you may yourself feel about it. As to your\ngetting to Trantridge without assistance, it is quite impossible; for,\nto tell the truth, dear, owing to this fog, which so disguises\neverything, I don’t quite know where we are myself. Now, if you will\npromise to wait beside the horse while I walk through the bushes till I\ncome to some road or house, and ascertain exactly our whereabouts, I’ll\ndeposit you here willingly. When I come back I’ll give you full\ndirections, and if you insist upon walking you may; or you may ride—at\nyour pleasure.”\n\nShe accepted these terms, and slid off on the near side, though not\ntill he had stolen a cursory kiss. He sprang down on the other side.\n\n“I suppose I must hold the horse?” said she.\n\n“Oh no; it’s not necessary,” replied Alec, patting the panting\ncreature. “He’s had enough of it for to-night.”\n\nHe turned the horse’s head into the bushes, hitched him on to a bough,\nand made a sort of couch or nest for her in the deep mass of dead\nleaves.\n\n“Now, you sit there,” he said. “The leaves have not got damp as yet.\nJust give an eye to the horse—it will be quite sufficient.”\n\nHe took a few steps away from her, but, returning, said, “By the bye,\nTess, your father has a new cob to-day. Somebody gave it to him.”\n\n“Somebody? You!”\n\nD’Urberville nodded.\n\n“O how very good of you that is!” she exclaimed, with a painful sense\nof the awkwardness of having to thank him just then.\n\n“And the children have some toys.”\n\n“I didn’t know—you ever sent them anything!” she murmured, much moved.\n“I almost wish you had not—yes, I almost wish it!”\n\n“Why, dear?”\n\n“It—hampers me so.”\n\n“Tessy—don’t you love me ever so little now?”\n\n“I’m grateful,” she reluctantly admitted. “But I fear I do not—” The\nsudden vision of his passion for herself as a factor in this result so\ndistressed her that, beginning with one slow tear, and then following\nwith another, she wept outright.\n\n“Don’t cry, dear, dear one! Now sit down here, and wait till I come.”\nShe passively sat down amid the leaves he had heaped, and shivered\nslightly. “Are you cold?” he asked.\n\n“Not very—a little.”\n\nHe touched her with his fingers, which sank into her as into down. “You\nhave only that puffy muslin dress on—how’s that?”\n\n“It’s my best summer one. ’Twas very warm when I started, and I didn’t\nknow I was going to ride, and that it would be night.”\n\n“Nights grow chilly in September. Let me see.” He pulled off a light\novercoat that he had worn, and put it round her tenderly. “That’s\nit—now you’ll feel warmer,” he continued. “Now, my pretty, rest there;\nI shall soon be back again.”\n\nHaving buttoned the overcoat round her shoulders he plunged into the\nwebs of vapour which by this time formed veils between the trees. She\ncould hear the rustling of the branches as he ascended the adjoining\nslope, till his movements were no louder than the hopping of a bird,\nand finally died away. With the setting of the moon the pale light\nlessened, and Tess became invisible as she fell into reverie upon the\nleaves where he had left her.\n\nIn the meantime Alec d’Urberville had pushed on up the slope to clear\nhis genuine doubt as to the quarter of The Chase they were in. He had,\nin fact, ridden quite at random for over an hour, taking any turning\nthat came to hand in order to prolong companionship with her, and\ngiving far more attention to Tess’s moonlit person than to any wayside\nobject. A little rest for the jaded animal being desirable, he did not\nhasten his search for landmarks. A clamber over the hill into the\nadjoining vale brought him to the fence of a highway whose contours he\nrecognized, which settled the question of their whereabouts.\nD’Urberville thereupon turned back; but by this time the moon had quite\ngone down, and partly on account of the fog The Chase was wrapped in\nthick darkness, although morning was not far off. He was obliged to\nadvance with outstretched hands to avoid contact with the boughs, and\ndiscovered that to hit the exact spot from which he had started was at\nfirst entirely beyond him. Roaming up and down, round and round, he at\nlength heard a slight movement of the horse close at hand; and the\nsleeve of his overcoat unexpectedly caught his foot.\n\n“Tess!” said d’Urberville.\n\nThere was no answer. The obscurity was now so great that he could see\nabsolutely nothing but a pale nebulousness at his feet, which\nrepresented the white muslin figure he had left upon the dead leaves.\nEverything else was blackness alike. D’Urberville stooped; and heard a\ngentle regular breathing. He knelt and bent lower, till her breath\nwarmed his face, and in a moment his cheek was in contact with hers.\nShe was sleeping soundly, and upon her eyelashes there lingered tears.\n\nDarkness and silence ruled everywhere around. Above them rose the\nprimaeval yews and oaks of The Chase, in which there poised gentle\nroosting birds in their last nap; and about them stole the hopping\nrabbits and hares. But, might some say, where was Tess’s guardian\nangel? where was the providence of her simple faith? Perhaps, like that\nother god of whom the ironical Tishbite spoke, he was talking, or he\nwas pursuing, or he was in a journey, or he was sleeping and not to be\nawaked.\n\nWhy it was that upon this beautiful feminine tissue, sensitive as\ngossamer, and practically blank as snow as yet, there should have been\ntraced such a coarse pattern as it was doomed to receive; why so often\nthe coarse appropriates the finer thus, the wrong man the woman, the\nwrong woman the man, many thousand years of analytical philosophy have\nfailed to explain to our sense of order. One may, indeed, admit the\npossibility of a retribution lurking in the present catastrophe.\nDoubtless some of Tess d’Urberville’s mailed ancestors rollicking home\nfrom a fray had dealt the same measure even more ruthlessly towards\npeasant girls of their time. But though to visit the sins of the\nfathers upon the children may be a morality good enough for divinities,\nit is scorned by average human nature; and it therefore does not mend\nthe matter.\n\nAs Tess’s own people down in those retreats are never tired of saying\namong each other in their fatalistic way: “It was to be.” There lay the\npity of it. An immeasurable social chasm was to divide our heroine’s\npersonality thereafter from that previous self of hers who stepped from\nher mother’s door to try her fortune at Trantridge poultry-farm.\n\n\nEnd of Phase the First\n\n\nPhase the Second:\n\nMaiden No More\n\n\nXII\n\nThe basket was heavy and the bundle was large, but she lugged them\nalong like a person who did not find her especial burden in material\nthings. Occasionally she stopped to rest in a mechanical way by some\ngate or post; and then, giving the baggage another hitch upon her full\nround arm, went steadily on again.\n\nIt was a Sunday morning in late October, about four months after Tess\nDurbeyfield’s arrival at Trantridge, and some few weeks subsequent to\nthe night ride in The Chase. The time was not long past daybreak, and\nthe yellow luminosity upon the horizon behind her back lighted the\nridge towards which her face was set—the barrier of the vale wherein\nshe had of late been a stranger—which she would have to climb over to\nreach her birthplace. The ascent was gradual on this side, and the soil\nand scenery differed much from those within Blakemore Vale. Even the\ncharacter and accent of the two peoples had shades of difference,\ndespite the amalgamating effects of a roundabout railway; so that,\nthough less than twenty miles from the place of her sojourn at\nTrantridge, her native village had seemed a far-away spot. The\nfield-folk shut in there traded northward and westward, travelled,\ncourted, and married northward and westward, thought northward and\nwestward; those on this side mainly directed their energies and\nattention to the east and south.\n\nThe incline was the same down which d’Urberville had driven her so\nwildly on that day in June. Tess went up the remainder of its length\nwithout stopping, and on reaching the edge of the escarpment gazed over\nthe familiar green world beyond, now half-veiled in mist. It was always\nbeautiful from here; it was terribly beautiful to Tess to-day, for\nsince her eyes last fell upon it she had learnt that the serpent hisses\nwhere the sweet birds sing, and her views of life had been totally\nchanged for her by the lesson. Verily another girl than the simple one\nshe had been at home was she who, bowed by thought, stood still here,\nand turned to look behind her. She could not bear to look forward into\nthe Vale.\n\nAscending by the long white road that Tess herself had just laboured\nup, she saw a two-wheeled vehicle, beside which walked a man, who held\nup his hand to attract her attention.\n\nShe obeyed the signal to wait for him with unspeculative repose, and in\na few minutes man and horse stopped beside her.\n\n“Why did you slip away by stealth like this?” said d’Urberville, with\nupbraiding breathlessness; “on a Sunday morning, too, when people were\nall in bed! I only discovered it by accident, and I have been driving\nlike the deuce to overtake you. Just look at the mare. Why go off like\nthis? You know that nobody wished to hinder your going. And how\nunnecessary it has been for you to toil along on foot, and encumber\nyourself with this heavy load! I have followed like a madman, simply to\ndrive you the rest of the distance, if you won’t come back.”\n\n“I shan’t come back,” said she.\n\n“I thought you wouldn’t—I said so! Well, then, put up your basket, and\nlet me help you on.”\n\nShe listlessly placed her basket and bundle within the dog-cart, and\nstepped up, and they sat side by side. She had no fear of him now, and\nin the cause of her confidence her sorrow lay.\n\nD’Urberville mechanically lit a cigar, and the journey was continued\nwith broken unemotional conversation on the commonplace objects by the\nwayside. He had quite forgotten his struggle to kiss her when, in the\nearly summer, they had driven in the opposite direction along the same\nroad. But she had not, and she sat now, like a puppet, replying to his\nremarks in monosyllables. After some miles they came in view of the\nclump of trees beyond which the village of Marlott stood. It was only\nthen that her still face showed the least emotion, a tear or two\nbeginning to trickle down.\n\n“What are you crying for?” he coldly asked.\n\n“I was only thinking that I was born over there,” murmured Tess.\n\n“Well—we must all be born somewhere.”\n\n“I wish I had never been born—there or anywhere else!”\n\n“Pooh! Well, if you didn’t wish to come to Trantridge why did you\ncome?”\n\nShe did not reply.\n\n“You didn’t come for love of me, that I’ll swear.”\n\n“’Tis quite true. If I had gone for love o’ you, if I had ever\nsincerely loved you, if I loved you still, I should not so loathe and\nhate myself for my weakness as I do now!... My eyes were dazed by you\nfor a little, and that was all.”\n\nHe shrugged his shoulders. She resumed—\n\n“I didn’t understand your meaning till it was too late.”\n\n“That’s what every woman says.”\n\n“How can you dare to use such words!” she cried, turning impetuously\nupon him, her eyes flashing as the latent spirit (of which he was to\nsee more some day) awoke in her. “My God! I could knock you out of the\ngig! Did it never strike your mind that what every woman says some\nwomen may feel?”\n\n“Very well,” he said, laughing; “I am sorry to wound you. I did wrong—I\nadmit it.” He dropped into some little bitterness as he continued:\n“Only you needn’t be so everlastingly flinging it in my face. I am\nready to pay to the uttermost farthing. You know you need not work in\nthe fields or the dairies again. You know you may clothe yourself with\nthe best, instead of in the bald plain way you have lately affected, as\nif you couldn’t get a ribbon more than you earn.”\n\nHer lip lifted slightly, though there was little scorn, as a rule, in\nher large and impulsive nature.\n\n“I have said I will not take anything more from you, and I will not—I\ncannot! I _should_ be your creature to go on doing that, and I won’t!”\n\n“One would think you were a princess from your manner, in addition to a\ntrue and original d’Urberville—ha! ha! Well, Tess, dear, I can say no\nmore. I suppose I am a bad fellow—a damn bad fellow. I was born bad,\nand I have lived bad, and I shall die bad in all probability. But, upon\nmy lost soul, I won’t be bad towards you again, Tess. And if certain\ncircumstances should arise—you understand—in which you are in the least\nneed, the least difficulty, send me one line, and you shall have by\nreturn whatever you require. I may not be at Trantridge—I am going to\nLondon for a time—I can’t stand the old woman. But all letters will be\nforwarded.”\n\nShe said that she did not wish him to drive her further, and they\nstopped just under the clump of trees. D’Urberville alighted, and\nlifted her down bodily in his arms, afterwards placing her articles on\nthe ground beside her. She bowed to him slightly, her eye just\nlingering in his; and then she turned to take the parcels for\ndeparture.\n\nAlec d’Urberville removed his cigar, bent towards her, and said—\n\n“You are not going to turn away like that, dear! Come!”\n\n“If you wish,” she answered indifferently. “See how you’ve mastered\nme!”\n\nShe thereupon turned round and lifted her face to his, and remained\nlike a marble term while he imprinted a kiss upon her cheek—half\nperfunctorily, half as if zest had not yet quite died out. Her eyes\nvaguely rested upon the remotest trees in the lane while the kiss was\ngiven, as though she were nearly unconscious of what he did.\n\n“Now the other side, for old acquaintance’ sake.”\n\nShe turned her head in the same passive way, as one might turn at the\nrequest of a sketcher or hairdresser, and he kissed the other side, his\nlips touching cheeks that were damp and smoothly chill as the skin of\nthe mushrooms in the fields around.\n\n“You don’t give me your mouth and kiss me back. You never willingly do\nthat—you’ll never love me, I fear.”\n\n“I have said so, often. It is true. I have never really and truly loved\nyou, and I think I never can.” She added mournfully, “Perhaps, of all\nthings, a lie on this thing would do the most good to me now; but I\nhave honour enough left, little as ’tis, not to tell that lie. If I did\nlove you, I may have the best o’ causes for letting you know it. But I\ndon’t.”\n\nHe emitted a laboured breath, as if the scene were getting rather\noppressive to his heart, or to his conscience, or to his gentility.\n\n“Well, you are absurdly melancholy, Tess. I have no reason for\nflattering you now, and I can say plainly that you need not be so sad.\nYou can hold your own for beauty against any woman of these parts,\ngentle or simple; I say it to you as a practical man and well-wisher.\nIf you are wise you will show it to the world more than you do before\nit fades... And yet, Tess, will you come back to me! Upon my soul, I\ndon’t like to let you go like this!”\n\n“Never, never! I made up my mind as soon as I saw—what I ought to have\nseen sooner; and I won’t come.”\n\n“Then good morning, my four months’ cousin—good-bye!”\n\nHe leapt up lightly, arranged the reins, and was gone between the tall\nred-berried hedges.\n\nTess did not look after him, but slowly wound along the crooked lane.\nIt was still early, and though the sun’s lower limb was just free of\nthe hill, his rays, ungenial and peering, addressed the eye rather than\nthe touch as yet. There was not a human soul near. Sad October and her\nsadder self seemed the only two existences haunting that lane.\n\nAs she walked, however, some footsteps approached behind her, the\nfootsteps of a man; and owing to the briskness of his advance he was\nclose at her heels and had said “Good morning” before she had been long\naware of his propinquity. He appeared to be an artisan of some sort,\nand carried a tin pot of red paint in his hand. He asked in a\nbusiness-like manner if he should take her basket, which she permitted\nhim to do, walking beside him.\n\n“It is early to be astir this Sabbath morn!” he said cheerfully.\n\n“Yes,” said Tess.\n\n“When most people are at rest from their week’s work.”\n\nShe also assented to this.\n\n“Though I do more real work to-day than all the week besides.”\n\n“Do you?”\n\n“All the week I work for the glory of man, and on Sunday for the glory\nof God. That’s more real than the other—hey? I have a little to do here\nat this stile.” The man turned, as he spoke, to an opening at the\nroadside leading into a pasture. “If you’ll wait a moment,” he added,\n“I shall not be long.”\n\nAs he had her basket she could not well do otherwise; and she waited,\nobserving him. He set down her basket and the tin pot, and stirring the\npaint with the brush that was in it began painting large square letters\non the middle board of the three composing the stile, placing a comma\nafter each word, as if to give pause while that word was driven well\nhome to the reader’s heart—\n\n    THY, DAMNATION, SLUMBERETH, NOT.\n        2 Pet. ii. 3.\n\nAgainst the peaceful landscape, the pale, decaying tints of the copses,\nthe blue air of the horizon, and the lichened stile-boards, these\nstaring vermilion words shone forth. They seemed to shout themselves\nout and make the atmosphere ring. Some people might have cried “Alas,\npoor Theology!” at the hideous defacement—the last grotesque phase of a\ncreed which had served mankind well in its time. But the words entered\nTess with accusatory horror. It was as if this man had known her recent\nhistory; yet he was a total stranger.\n\nHaving finished his text he picked up her basket, and she mechanically\nresumed her walk beside him.\n\n“Do you believe what you paint?” she asked in low tones.\n\n“Believe that tex? Do I believe in my own existence!”\n\n“But,” said she tremulously, “suppose your sin was not of your own\nseeking?”\n\nHe shook his head.\n\n“I cannot split hairs on that burning query,” he said. “I have walked\nhundreds of miles this past summer, painting these texes on every wall,\ngate, and stile the length and breadth of this district. I leave their\napplication to the hearts of the people who read ’em.”\n\n“I think they are horrible,” said Tess. “Crushing! Killing!”\n\n“That’s what they are meant to be!” he replied in a trade voice. “But\nyou should read my hottest ones—them I kips for slums and seaports.\nThey’d make ye wriggle! Not but what this is a very good tex for rural\ndistricts.... Ah—there’s a nice bit of blank wall up by that barn\nstanding to waste. I must put one there—one that it will be good for\ndangerous young females like yerself to heed. Will ye wait, missy?”\n\n“No,” said she; and taking her basket Tess trudged on. A little way\nforward she turned her head. The old gray wall began to advertise a\nsimilar fiery lettering to the first, with a strange and unwonted mien,\nas if distressed at duties it had never before been called upon to\nperform. It was with a sudden flush that she read and realized what was\nto be the inscription he was now halfway through—\n\n    THOU, SHALT, NOT, COMMIT—\n\nHer cheerful friend saw her looking, stopped his brush, and shouted—\n\n“If you want to ask for edification on these things of moment, there’s\na very earnest good man going to preach a charity-sermon to-day in the\nparish you are going to—Mr Clare of Emminster. I’m not of his\npersuasion now, but he’s a good man, and he’ll expound as well as any\nparson I know. ’Twas he began the work in me.”\n\nBut Tess did not answer; she throbbingly resumed her walk, her eyes\nfixed on the ground. “Pooh—I don’t believe God said such things!” she\nmurmured contemptuously when her flush had died away.\n\nA plume of smoke soared up suddenly from her father’s chimney, the\nsight of which made her heart ache. The aspect of the interior, when\nshe reached it, made her heart ache more. Her mother, who had just come\ndownstairs, turned to greet her from the fireplace, where she was\nkindling barked-oak twigs under the breakfast kettle. The young\nchildren were still above, as was also her father, it being Sunday\nmorning, when he felt justified in lying an additional half-hour.\n\n“Well!—my dear Tess!” exclaimed her surprised mother, jumping up and\nkissing the girl. “How be ye? I didn’t see you till you was in upon me!\nHave you come home to be married?”\n\n“No, I have not come for that, mother.”\n\n“Then for a holiday?”\n\n“Yes—for a holiday; for a long holiday,” said Tess.\n\n“What, isn’t your cousin going to do the handsome thing?”\n\n“He’s not my cousin, and he’s not going to marry me.”\n\nHer mother eyed her narrowly.\n\n“Come, you have not told me all,” she said.\n\nThen Tess went up to her mother, put her face upon Joan’s neck, and\ntold.\n\n“And yet th’st not got him to marry ’ee!” reiterated her mother. “Any\nwoman would have done it but you, after that!”\n\n“Perhaps any woman would except me.”\n\n“It would have been something like a story to come back with, if you\nhad!” continued Mrs Durbeyfield, ready to burst into tears of vexation.\n“After all the talk about you and him which has reached us here, who\nwould have expected it to end like this! Why didn’t ye think of doing\nsome good for your family instead o’ thinking only of yourself? See how\nI’ve got to teave and slave, and your poor weak father with his heart\nclogged like a dripping-pan. I did hope for something to come out o’\nthis! To see what a pretty pair you and he made that day when you drove\naway together four months ago! See what he has given us—all, as we\nthought, because we were his kin. But if he’s not, it must have been\ndone because of his love for ’ee. And yet you’ve not got him to marry!”\n\nGet Alec d’Urberville in the mind to marry her! He marry _her_! On\nmatrimony he had never once said a word. And what if he had? How a\nconvulsive snatching at social salvation might have impelled her to\nanswer him she could not say. But her poor foolish mother little knew\nher present feeling towards this man. Perhaps it was unusual in the\ncircumstances, unlucky, unaccountable; but there it was; and this, as\nshe had said, was what made her detest herself. She had never wholly\ncared for him; she did not at all care for him now. She had dreaded\nhim, winced before him, succumbed to adroit advantages he took of her\nhelplessness; then, temporarily blinded by his ardent manners, had been\nstirred to confused surrender awhile: had suddenly despised and\ndisliked him, and had run away. That was all. Hate him she did not\nquite; but he was dust and ashes to her, and even for her name’s sake\nshe scarcely wished to marry him.\n\n“You ought to have been more careful if you didn’t mean to get him to\nmake you his wife!”\n\n“O mother, my mother!” cried the agonized girl, turning passionately\nupon her parent as if her poor heart would break. “How could I be\nexpected to know? I was a child when I left this house four months ago.\nWhy didn’t you tell me there was danger in men-folk? Why didn’t you\nwarn me? Ladies know what to fend hands against, because they read\nnovels that tell them of these tricks; but I never had the chance o’\nlearning in that way, and you did not help me!”\n\nHer mother was subdued.\n\n“I thought if I spoke of his fond feelings and what they might lead to,\nyou would be hontish wi’ him and lose your chance,” she murmured,\nwiping her eyes with her apron. “Well, we must make the best of it, I\nsuppose. ’Tis nater, after all, and what do please God!”\n\n\nXIII\n\nThe event of Tess Durbeyfield’s return from the manor of her bogus\nkinsfolk was rumoured abroad, if rumour be not too large a word for a\nspace of a square mile. In the afternoon several young girls of\nMarlott, former schoolfellows and acquaintances of Tess, called to see\nher, arriving dressed in their best starched and ironed, as became\nvisitors to a person who had made a transcendent conquest (as they\nsupposed), and sat round the room looking at her with great curiosity.\nFor the fact that it was this said thirty-first cousin, Mr\nd’Urberville, who had fallen in love with her, a gentleman not\naltogether local, whose reputation as a reckless gallant and\nheartbreaker was beginning to spread beyond the immediate boundaries of\nTrantridge, lent Tess’s supposed position, by its fearsomeness, a far\nhigher fascination that it would have exercised if unhazardous.\n\nTheir interest was so deep that the younger ones whispered when her\nback was turned—\n\n“How pretty she is; and how that best frock do set her off! I believe\nit cost an immense deal, and that it was a gift from him.”\n\nTess, who was reaching up to get the tea-things from the\ncorner-cupboard, did not hear these commentaries. If she had heard\nthem, she might soon have set her friends right on the matter. But her\nmother heard, and Joan’s simple vanity, having been denied the hope of\na dashing marriage, fed itself as well as it could upon the sensation\nof a dashing flirtation. Upon the whole she felt gratified, even though\nsuch a limited and evanescent triumph should involve her daughter’s\nreputation; it might end in marriage yet, and in the warmth of her\nresponsiveness to their admiration she invited her visitors to stay to\ntea.\n\nTheir chatter, their laughter, their good-humoured innuendoes, above\nall, their flashes and flickerings of envy, revived Tess’s spirits\nalso; and, as the evening wore on, she caught the infection of their\nexcitement, and grew almost gay. The marble hardness left her face, she\nmoved with something of her old bounding step, and flushed in all her\nyoung beauty.\n\nAt moments, in spite of thought, she would reply to their inquiries\nwith a manner of superiority, as if recognizing that her experiences in\nthe field of courtship had, indeed, been slightly enviable. But so far\nwas she from being, in the words of Robert South, “in love with her own\nruin,” that the illusion was transient as lightning; cold reason came\nback to mock her spasmodic weakness; the ghastliness of her momentary\npride would convict her, and recall her to reserved listlessness again.\n\nAnd the despondency of the next morning’s dawn, when it was no longer\nSunday, but Monday; and no best clothes; and the laughing visitors were\ngone, and she awoke alone in her old bed, the innocent younger children\nbreathing softly around her. In place of the excitement of her return,\nand the interest it had inspired, she saw before her a long and stony\nhighway which she had to tread, without aid, and with little sympathy.\nHer depression was then terrible, and she could have hidden herself in\na tomb.\n\nIn the course of a few weeks Tess revived sufficiently to show herself\nso far as was necessary to get to church one Sunday morning. She liked\nto hear the chanting—such as it was—and the old Psalms, and to join in\nthe Morning Hymn. That innate love of melody, which she had inherited\nfrom her ballad-singing mother, gave the simplest music a power over\nher which could well-nigh drag her heart out of her bosom at times.\n\nTo be as much out of observation as possible for reasons of her own,\nand to escape the gallantries of the young men, she set out before the\nchiming began, and took a back seat under the gallery, close to the\nlumber, where only old men and women came, and where the bier stood on\nend among the churchyard tools.\n\nParishioners dropped in by twos and threes, deposited themselves in\nrows before her, rested three-quarters of a minute on their foreheads\nas if they were praying, though they were not; then sat up, and looked\naround. When the chants came on, one of her favourites happened to be\nchosen among the rest—the old double chant “Langdon”—but she did not\nknow what it was called, though she would much have liked to know. She\nthought, without exactly wording the thought, how strange and god-like\nwas a composer’s power, who from the grave could lead through sequences\nof emotion, which he alone had felt at first, a girl like her who had\nnever heard of his name, and never would have a clue to his\npersonality.\n\nThe people who had turned their heads turned them again as the service\nproceeded; and at last observing her, they whispered to each other. She\nknew what their whispers were about, grew sick at heart, and felt that\nshe could come to church no more.\n\nThe bedroom which she shared with some of the children formed her\nretreat more continually than ever. Here, under her few square yards of\nthatch, she watched winds, and snows, and rains, gorgeous sunsets, and\nsuccessive moons at their full. So close kept she that at length almost\neverybody thought she had gone away.\n\nThe only exercise that Tess took at this time was after dark; and it\nwas then, when out in the woods, that she seemed least solitary. She\nknew how to hit to a hair’s-breadth that moment of evening when the\nlight and the darkness are so evenly balanced that the constraint of\nday and the suspense of night neutralize each other, leaving absolute\nmental liberty. It is then that the plight of being alive becomes\nattenuated to its least possible dimensions. She had no fear of the\nshadows; her sole idea seemed to be to shun mankind—or rather that cold\naccretion called the world, which, so terrible in the mass, is so\nunformidable, even pitiable, in its units.\n\nOn these lonely hills and dales her quiescent glide was of a piece with\nthe element she moved in. Her flexuous and stealthy figure became an\nintegral part of the scene. At times her whimsical fancy would\nintensify natural processes around her till they seemed a part of her\nown story. Rather they became a part of it; for the world is only a\npsychological phenomenon, and what they seemed they were. The midnight\nairs and gusts, moaning amongst the tightly-wrapped buds and bark of\nthe winter twigs, were formulae of bitter reproach. A wet day was the\nexpression of irremediable grief at her weakness in the mind of some\nvague ethical being whom she could not class definitely as the God of\nher childhood, and could not comprehend as any other.\n\nBut this encompassment of her own characterization, based on shreds of\nconvention, peopled by phantoms and voices antipathetic to her, was a\nsorry and mistaken creation of Tess’s fancy—a cloud of moral hobgoblins\nby which she was terrified without reason. It was they that were out of\nharmony with the actual world, not she. Walking among the sleeping\nbirds in the hedges, watching the skipping rabbits on a moonlit warren,\nor standing under a pheasant-laden bough, she looked upon herself as a\nfigure of Guilt intruding into the haunts of Innocence. But all the\nwhile she was making a distinction where there was no difference.\nFeeling herself in antagonism, she was quite in accord. She had been\nmade to break an accepted social law, but no law known to the\nenvironment in which she fancied herself such an anomaly.\n\n\nXIV\n\nIt was a hazy sunrise in August. The denser nocturnal vapours, attacked\nby the warm beams, were dividing and shrinking into isolated fleeces\nwithin hollows and coverts, where they waited till they should be dried\naway to nothing.\n\nThe sun, on account of the mist, had a curious sentient, personal look,\ndemanding the masculine pronoun for its adequate expression. His\npresent aspect, coupled with the lack of all human forms in the scene,\nexplained the old-time heliolatries in a moment. One could feel that a\nsaner religion had never prevailed under the sky. The luminary was a\ngolden-haired, beaming, mild-eyed, God-like creature, gazing down in\nthe vigour and intentness of youth upon an earth that was brimming with\ninterest for him.\n\nHis light, a little later, broke though chinks of cottage shutters,\nthrowing stripes like red-hot pokers upon cupboards, chests of drawers,\nand other furniture within; and awakening harvesters who were not\nalready astir.\n\nBut of all ruddy things that morning the brightest were two broad arms\nof painted wood, which rose from the margin of yellow cornfield hard by\nMarlott village. They, with two others below, formed the revolving\nMaltese cross of the reaping-machine, which had been brought to the\nfield on the previous evening to be ready for operations this day. The\npaint with which they were smeared, intensified in hue by the sunlight,\nimparted to them a look of having been dipped in liquid fire.\n\nThe field had already been “opened”; that is to say, a lane a few feet\nwide had been hand-cut through the wheat along the whole circumference\nof the field for the first passage of the horses and machine.\n\nTwo groups, one of men and lads, the other of women, had come down the\nlane just at the hour when the shadows of the eastern hedge-top struck\nthe west hedge midway, so that the heads of the groups were enjoying\nsunrise while their feet were still in the dawn. They disappeared from\nthe lane between the two stone posts which flanked the nearest\nfield-gate.\n\nPresently there arose from within a ticking like the love-making of the\ngrasshopper. The machine had begun, and a moving concatenation of three\nhorses and the aforesaid long rickety machine was visible over the\ngate, a driver sitting upon one of the hauling horses, and an attendant\non the seat of the implement. Along one side of the field the whole\nwain went, the arms of the mechanical reaper revolving slowly, till it\npassed down the hill quite out of sight. In a minute it came up on the\nother side of the field at the same equable pace; the glistening brass\nstar in the forehead of the fore horse first catching the eye as it\nrose into view over the stubble, then the bright arms, and then the\nwhole machine.\n\nThe narrow lane of stubble encompassing the field grew wider with each\ncircuit, and the standing corn was reduced to a smaller area as the\nmorning wore on. Rabbits, hares, snakes, rats, mice, retreated inwards\nas into a fastness, unaware of the ephemeral nature of their refuge,\nand of the doom that awaited them later in the day when, their covert\nshrinking to a more and more horrible narrowness, they were huddled\ntogether, friends and foes, till the last few yards of upright wheat\nfell also under the teeth of the unerring reaper, and they were every\none put to death by the sticks and stones of the harvesters.\n\nThe reaping-machine left the fallen corn behind it in little heaps,\neach heap being of the quantity for a sheaf; and upon these the active\nbinders in the rear laid their hands—mainly women, but some of them men\nin print shirts, and trousers supported round their waists by leather\nstraps, rendering useless the two buttons behind, which twinkled and\nbristled with sunbeams at every movement of each wearer, as if they\nwere a pair of eyes in the small of his back.\n\nBut those of the other sex were the most interesting of this company of\nbinders, by reason of the charm which is acquired by woman when she\nbecomes part and parcel of outdoor nature, and is not merely an object\nset down therein as at ordinary times. A field-man is a personality\nafield; a field-woman is a portion of the field; she had somehow lost\nher own margin, imbibed the essence of her surrounding, and assimilated\nherself with it.\n\nThe women—or rather girls, for they were mostly young—wore drawn cotton\nbonnets with great flapping curtains to keep off the sun, and gloves to\nprevent their hands being wounded by the stubble. There was one wearing\na pale pink jacket, another in a cream-coloured tight-sleeved gown,\nanother in a petticoat as red as the arms of the reaping-machine; and\nothers, older, in the brown-rough “wropper” or over-all—the\nold-established and most appropriate dress of the field-woman, which\nthe young ones were abandoning. This morning the eye returns\ninvoluntarily to the girl in the pink cotton jacket, she being the most\nflexuous and finely-drawn figure of them all. But her bonnet is pulled\nso far over her brow that none of her face is disclosed while she\nbinds, though her complexion may be guessed from a stray twine or two\nof dark brown hair which extends below the curtain of her bonnet.\nPerhaps one reason why she seduces casual attention is that she never\ncourts it, though the other women often gaze around them.\n\nHer binding proceeds with clock-like monotony. From the sheaf last\nfinished she draws a handful of ears, patting their tips with her left\npalm to bring them even. Then, stooping low, she moves forward,\ngathering the corn with both hands against her knees, and pushing her\nleft gloved hand under the bundle to meet the right on the other side,\nholding the corn in an embrace like that of a lover. She brings the\nends of the bond together, and kneels on the sheaf while she ties it,\nbeating back her skirts now and then when lifted by the breeze. A bit\nof her naked arm is visible between the buff leather of the gauntlet\nand the sleeve of her gown; and as the day wears on its feminine\nsmoothness becomes scarified by the stubble and bleeds.\n\nAt intervals she stands up to rest, and to retie her disarranged apron,\nor to pull her bonnet straight. Then one can see the oval face of a\nhandsome young woman with deep dark eyes and long heavy clinging\ntresses, which seem to clasp in a beseeching way anything they fall\nagainst. The cheeks are paler, the teeth more regular, the red lips\nthinner than is usual in a country-bred girl.\n\nIt is Tess Durbeyfield, otherwise d’Urberville, somewhat changed—the\nsame, but not the same; at the present stage of her existence living as\na stranger and an alien here, though it was no strange land that she\nwas in. After a long seclusion she had come to a resolve to undertake\noutdoor work in her native village, the busiest season of the year in\nthe agricultural world having arrived, and nothing that she could do\nwithin the house being so remunerative for the time as harvesting in\nthe fields.\n\nThe movements of the other women were more or less similar to Tess’s,\nthe whole bevy of them drawing together like dancers in a quadrille at\nthe completion of a sheaf by each, every one placing her sheaf on end\nagainst those of the rest, till a shock, or “stitch” as it was here\ncalled, of ten or a dozen was formed.\n\nThey went to breakfast, and came again, and the work proceeded as\nbefore. As the hour of eleven drew near a person watching her might\nhave noticed that every now and then Tess’s glance flitted wistfully to\nthe brow of the hill, though she did not pause in her sheafing. On the\nverge of the hour the heads of a group of children, of ages ranging\nfrom six to fourteen, rose over the stubbly convexity of the hill.\n\nThe face of Tess flushed slightly, but still she did not pause.\n\nThe eldest of the comers, a girl who wore a triangular shawl, its\ncorner draggling on the stubble, carried in her arms what at first\nsight seemed to be a doll, but proved to be an infant in long clothes.\nAnother brought some lunch. The harvesters ceased working, took their\nprovisions, and sat down against one of the shocks. Here they fell to,\nthe men plying a stone jar freely, and passing round a cup.\n\nTess Durbeyfield had been one of the last to suspend her labours. She\nsat down at the end of the shock, her face turned somewhat away from\nher companions. When she had deposited herself a man in a rabbit-skin\ncap, and with a red handkerchief tucked into his belt, held the cup of\nale over the top of the shock for her to drink. But she did not accept\nhis offer. As soon as her lunch was spread she called up the big girl,\nher sister, and took the baby of her, who, glad to be relieved of the\nburden, went away to the next shock and joined the other children\nplaying there. Tess, with a curiously stealthy yet courageous movement,\nand with a still rising colour, unfastened her frock and began suckling\nthe child.\n\nThe men who sat nearest considerately turned their faces towards the\nother end of the field, some of them beginning to smoke; one, with\nabsent-minded fondness, regretfully stroking the jar that would no\nlonger yield a stream. All the women but Tess fell into animated talk,\nand adjusted the disarranged knots of their hair.\n\nWhen the infant had taken its fill, the young mother sat it upright in\nher lap, and looking into the far distance, dandled it with a gloomy\nindifference that was almost dislike; then all of a sudden she fell to\nviolently kissing it some dozens of times, as if she could never leave\noff, the child crying at the vehemence of an onset which strangely\ncombined passionateness with contempt.\n\n“She’s fond of that there child, though she mid pretend to hate en, and\nsay she wishes the baby and her too were in the churchyard,” observed\nthe woman in the red petticoat.\n\n“She’ll soon leave off saying that,” replied the one in buff. “Lord,\n’tis wonderful what a body can get used to o’ that sort in time!”\n\n“A little more than persuading had to do wi’ the coming o’t, I reckon.\nThere were they that heard a sobbing one night last year in The Chase;\nand it mid ha’ gone hard wi’ a certain party if folks had come along.”\n\n“Well, a little more, or a little less, ’twas a thousand pities that it\nshould have happened to she, of all others. But ’tis always the\ncomeliest! The plain ones be as safe as churches—hey, Jenny?” The\nspeaker turned to one of the group who certainly was not ill-defined as\nplain.\n\nIt was a thousand pities, indeed; it was impossible for even an enemy\nto feel otherwise on looking at Tess as she sat there, with her\nflower-like mouth and large tender eyes, neither black nor blue nor\ngrey nor violet; rather all those shades together, and a hundred\nothers, which could be seen if one looked into their irises—shade\nbehind shade—tint beyond tint—around pupils that had no bottom; an\nalmost standard woman, but for the slight incautiousness of character\ninherited from her race.\n\nA resolution which had surprised herself had brought her into the\nfields this week for the first time during many months. After wearing\nand wasting her palpitating heart with every engine of regret that\nlonely inexperience could devise, common sense had illuminated her. She\nfelt that she would do well to be useful again—to taste anew sweet\nindependence at any price. The past was past; whatever it had been, it\nwas no more at hand. Whatever its consequences, time would close over\nthem; they would all in a few years be as if they had never been, and\nshe herself grassed down and forgotten. Meanwhile the trees were just\nas green as before; the birds sang and the sun shone as clearly now as\never. The familiar surroundings had not darkened because of her grief,\nnor sickened because of her pain.\n\nShe might have seen that what had bowed her head so profoundly—the\nthought of the world’s concern at her situation—was founded on an\nillusion. She was not an existence, an experience, a passion, a\nstructure of sensations, to anybody but herself. To all humankind\nbesides, Tess was only a passing thought. Even to friends she was no\nmore than a frequently passing thought. If she made herself miserable\nthe livelong night and day it was only this much to them—“Ah, she makes\nherself unhappy.” If she tried to be cheerful, to dismiss all care, to\ntake pleasure in the daylight, the flowers, the baby, she could only be\nthis idea to them—“Ah, she bears it very well.” Moreover, alone in a\ndesert island would she have been wretched at what had happened to her?\nNot greatly. If she could have been but just created, to discover\nherself as a spouseless mother, with no experience of life except as\nthe parent of a nameless child, would the position have caused her to\ndespair? No, she would have taken it calmly, and found pleasure\ntherein. Most of the misery had been generated by her conventional\naspect, and not by her innate sensations.\n\nWhatever Tess’s reasoning, some spirit had induced her to dress herself\nup neatly as she had formerly done, and come out into the fields,\nharvest-hands being greatly in demand just then. This was why she had\nborne herself with dignity, and had looked people calmly in the face at\ntimes, even when holding the baby in her arms.\n\nThe harvest-men rose from the shock of corn, and stretched their limbs,\nand extinguished their pipes. The horses, which had been unharnessed\nand fed, were again attached to the scarlet machine. Tess, having\nquickly eaten her own meal, beckoned to her eldest sister to come and\ntake away the baby, fastened her dress, put on the buff gloves again,\nand stooped anew to draw a bond from the last completed sheaf for the\ntying of the next.\n\nIn the afternoon and evening the proceedings of the morning were\ncontinued, Tess staying on till dusk with the body of harvesters. Then\nthey all rode home in one of the largest wagons, in the company of a\nbroad tarnished moon that had risen from the ground to the eastwards,\nits face resembling the outworn gold-leaf halo of some worm-eaten\nTuscan saint. Tess’s female companions sang songs, and showed\nthemselves very sympathetic and glad at her reappearance out of doors,\nthough they could not refrain from mischievously throwing in a few\nverses of the ballad about the maid who went to the merry green wood\nand came back a changed state. There are counterpoises and\ncompensations in life; and the event which had made of her a social\nwarning had also for the moment made her the most interesting personage\nin the village to many. Their friendliness won her still farther away\nfrom herself, their lively spirits were contagious, and she became\nalmost gay.\n\nBut now that her moral sorrows were passing away a fresh one arose on\nthe natural side of her which knew no social law. When she reached home\nit was to learn to her grief that the baby had been suddenly taken ill\nsince the afternoon. Some such collapse had been probable, so tender\nand puny was its frame; but the event came as a shock nevertheless.\n\nThe baby’s offence against society in coming into the world was\nforgotten by the girl-mother; her soul’s desire was to continue that\noffence by preserving the life of the child. However, it soon grew\nclear that the hour of emancipation for that little prisoner of the\nflesh was to arrive earlier than her worst misgiving had conjectured.\nAnd when she had discovered this she was plunged into a misery which\ntranscended that of the child’s simple loss. Her baby had not been\nbaptized.\n\nTess had drifted into a frame of mind which accepted passively the\nconsideration that if she should have to burn for what she had done,\nburn she must, and there was an end of it. Like all village girls, she\nwas well grounded in the Holy Scriptures, and had dutifully studied the\nhistories of Aholah and Aholibah, and knew the inferences to be drawn\ntherefrom. But when the same question arose with regard to the baby, it\nhad a very different colour. Her darling was about to die, and no\nsalvation.\n\nIt was nearly bedtime, but she rushed downstairs and asked if she might\nsend for the parson. The moment happened to be one at which her\nfather’s sense of the antique nobility of his family was highest, and\nhis sensitiveness to the smudge which Tess had set upon that nobility\nmost pronounced, for he had just returned from his weekly booze at\nRolliver’s Inn. No parson should come inside his door, he declared,\nprying into his affairs, just then, when, by her shame, it had become\nmore necessary than ever to hide them. He locked the door and put the\nkey in his pocket.\n\nThe household went to bed, and, distressed beyond measure, Tess retired\nalso. She was continually waking as she lay, and in the middle of the\nnight found that the baby was still worse. It was obviously\ndying—quietly and painlessly, but none the less surely.\n\nIn her misery she rocked herself upon the bed. The clock struck the\nsolemn hour of one, that hour when fancy stalks outside reason, and\nmalignant possibilities stand rock-firm as facts. She thought of the\nchild consigned to the nethermost corner of hell, as its double doom\nfor lack of baptism and lack of legitimacy; saw the arch-fiend tossing\nit with his three-pronged fork, like the one they used for heating the\noven on baking days; to which picture she added many other quaint and\ncurious details of torment sometimes taught the young in this Christian\ncountry. The lurid presentment so powerfully affected her imagination\nin the silence of the sleeping house that her nightgown became damp\nwith perspiration, and the bedstead shook with each throb of her heart.\n\nThe infant’s breathing grew more difficult, and the mother’s mental\ntension increased. It was useless to devour the little thing with\nkisses; she could stay in bed no longer, and walked feverishly about\nthe room.\n\n“O merciful God, have pity; have pity upon my poor baby!” she cried.\n“Heap as much anger as you want to upon me, and welcome; but pity the\nchild!”\n\nShe leant against the chest of drawers, and murmured incoherent\nsupplications for a long while, till she suddenly started up.\n\n“Ah! perhaps baby can be saved! Perhaps it will be just the same!”\n\nShe spoke so brightly that it seemed as though her face might have\nshone in the gloom surrounding her. She lit a candle, and went to a\nsecond and a third bed under the wall, where she awoke her young\nsisters and brothers, all of whom occupied the same room. Pulling out\nthe washing-stand so that she could get behind it, she poured some\nwater from a jug, and made them kneel around, putting their hands\ntogether with fingers exactly vertical. While the children, scarcely\nawake, awe-stricken at her manner, their eyes growing larger and\nlarger, remained in this position, she took the baby from her bed—a\nchild’s child—so immature as scarce to seem a sufficient personality to\nendow its producer with the maternal title. Tess then stood erect with\nthe infant on her arm beside the basin; the next sister held the\nPrayer-Book open before her, as the clerk at church held it before the\nparson; and thus the girl set about baptizing her child.\n\nHer figure looked singularly tall and imposing as she stood in her long\nwhite nightgown, a thick cable of twisted dark hair hanging straight\ndown her back to her waist. The kindly dimness of the weak candle\nabstracted from her form and features the little blemishes which\nsunlight might have revealed—the stubble scratches upon her wrists, and\nthe weariness of her eyes—her high enthusiasm having a transfiguring\neffect upon the face which had been her undoing, showing it as a thing\nof immaculate beauty, with a touch of dignity which was almost regal.\nThe little ones kneeling round, their sleepy eyes blinking and red,\nawaited her preparations full of a suspended wonder which their\nphysical heaviness at that hour would not allow to become active.\n\nThe most impressed of them said:\n\n“Be you really going to christen him, Tess?”\n\nThe girl-mother replied in a grave affirmative.\n\n“What’s his name going to be?”\n\nShe had not thought of that, but a name suggested by a phrase in the\nbook of Genesis came into her head as she proceeded with the baptismal\nservice, and now she pronounced it:\n\n“SORROW, I baptize thee in the name of the Father, and of the Son, and\nof the Holy Ghost.”\n\nShe sprinkled the water, and there was silence.\n\n“Say ‘Amen,’ children.”\n\nThe tiny voices piped in obedient response, “Amen!”\n\nTess went on:\n\n“We receive this child”—and so forth—“and do sign him with the sign of\nthe Cross.”\n\nHere she dipped her hand into the basin, and fervently drew an immense\ncross upon the baby with her forefinger, continuing with the customary\nsentences as to his manfully fighting against sin, the world, and the\ndevil, and being a faithful soldier and servant unto his life’s end.\nShe duly went on with the Lord’s Prayer, the children lisping it after\nher in a thin gnat-like wail, till, at the conclusion, raising their\nvoices to clerk’s pitch, they again piped into silence, “Amen!”\n\nThen their sister, with much augmented confidence in the efficacy of\nthe sacrament, poured forth from the bottom of her heart the\nthanksgiving that follows, uttering it boldly and triumphantly in the\nstopt-diapason note which her voice acquired when her heart was in her\nspeech, and which will never be forgotten by those who knew her. The\necstasy of faith almost apotheosized her; it set upon her face a\nglowing irradiation, and brought a red spot into the middle of each\ncheek; while the miniature candle-flame inverted in her eye-pupils\nshone like a diamond. The children gazed up at her with more and more\nreverence, and no longer had a will for questioning. She did not look\nlike Sissy to them now, but as a being large, towering, and awful—a\ndivine personage with whom they had nothing in common.\n\nPoor Sorrow’s campaign against sin, the world, and the devil was doomed\nto be of limited brilliancy—luckily perhaps for himself, considering\nhis beginnings. In the blue of the morning that fragile soldier and\nservant breathed his last, and when the other children awoke they cried\nbitterly, and begged Sissy to have another pretty baby.\n\nThe calmness which had possessed Tess since the christening remained\nwith her in the infant’s loss. In the daylight, indeed, she felt her\nterrors about his soul to have been somewhat exaggerated; whether well\nfounded or not, she had no uneasiness now, reasoning that if Providence\nwould not ratify such an act of approximation she, for one, did not\nvalue the kind of heaven lost by the irregularity—either for herself or\nfor her child.\n\nSo passed away Sorrow the Undesired—that intrusive creature, that\nbastard gift of shameless Nature, who respects not the social law; a\nwaif to whom eternal Time had been a matter of days merely, who knew\nnot that such things as years and centuries ever were; to whom the\ncottage interior was the universe, the week’s weather climate, new-born\nbabyhood human existence, and the instinct to suck human knowledge.\n\nTess, who mused on the christening a good deal, wondered if it were\ndoctrinally sufficient to secure a Christian burial for the child.\nNobody could tell this but the parson of the parish, and he was a\nnew-comer, and did not know her. She went to his house after dusk, and\nstood by the gate, but could not summon courage to go in. The\nenterprise would have been abandoned if she had not by accident met him\ncoming homeward as she turned away. In the gloom she did not mind\nspeaking freely.\n\n“I should like to ask you something, sir.”\n\nHe expressed his willingness to listen, and she told the story of the\nbaby’s illness and the extemporized ordinance. “And now, sir,” she\nadded earnestly, “can you tell me this—will it be just the same for him\nas if you had baptized him?”\n\nHaving the natural feelings of a tradesman at finding that a job he\nshould have been called in for had been unskilfully botched by his\ncustomers among themselves, he was disposed to say no. Yet the dignity\nof the girl, the strange tenderness in her voice, combined to affect\nhis nobler impulses—or rather those that he had left in him after ten\nyears of endeavour to graft technical belief on actual scepticism. The\nman and the ecclesiastic fought within him, and the victory fell to the\nman.\n\n“My dear girl,” he said, “it will be just the same.”\n\n“Then will you give him a Christian burial?” she asked quickly.\n\nThe Vicar felt himself cornered. Hearing of the baby’s illness, he had\nconscientiously gone to the house after nightfall to perform the rite,\nand, unaware that the refusal to admit him had come from Tess’s father\nand not from Tess, he could not allow the plea of necessity for its\nirregular administration.\n\n“Ah—that’s another matter,” he said.\n\n“Another matter—why?” asked Tess, rather warmly.\n\n“Well—I would willingly do so if only we two were concerned. But I must\nnot—for certain reasons.”\n\n“Just for once, sir!”\n\n“Really I must not.”\n\n“O sir!” She seized his hand as she spoke.\n\nHe withdrew it, shaking his head.\n\n“Then I don’t like you!” she burst out, “and I’ll never come to your\nchurch no more!”\n\n“Don’t talk so rashly.”\n\n“Perhaps it will be just the same to him if you don’t?... Will it be\njust the same? Don’t for God’s sake speak as saint to sinner, but as\nyou yourself to me myself—poor me!”\n\nHow the Vicar reconciled his answer with the strict notions he supposed\nhimself to hold on these subjects it is beyond a layman’s power to\ntell, though not to excuse. Somewhat moved, he said in this case also—\n\n“It will be just the same.”\n\nSo the baby was carried in a small deal box, under an ancient woman’s\nshawl, to the churchyard that night, and buried by lantern-light, at\nthe cost of a shilling and a pint of beer to the sexton, in that shabby\ncorner of God’s allotment where He lets the nettles grow, and where all\nunbaptized infants, notorious drunkards, suicides, and others of the\nconjecturally damned are laid. In spite of the untoward surroundings,\nhowever, Tess bravely made a little cross of two laths and a piece of\nstring, and having bound it with flowers, she stuck it up at the head\nof the grave one evening when she could enter the churchyard without\nbeing seen, putting at the foot also a bunch of the same flowers in a\nlittle jar of water to keep them alive. What matter was it that on the\noutside of the jar the eye of mere observation noted the words\n“Keelwell’s Marmalade”? The eye of maternal affection did not see them\nin its vision of higher things.\n\n\nXV\n\n“By experience,” says Roger Ascham, “we find out a short way by a long\nwandering.” Not seldom that long wandering unfits us for further\ntravel, and of what use is our experience to us then? Tess\nDurbeyfield’s experience was of this incapacitating kind. At last she\nhad learned what to do; but who would now accept her doing?\n\nIf before going to the d’Urbervilles’ she had vigorously moved under\nthe guidance of sundry gnomic texts and phrases known to her and to the\nworld in general, no doubt she would never have been imposed on. But it\nhad not been in Tess’s power—nor is it in anybody’s power—to feel the\nwhole truth of golden opinions while it is possible to profit by them.\nShe—and how many more—might have ironically said to God with Saint\nAugustine: “Thou hast counselled a better course than Thou hast\npermitted.”\n\nShe remained at her father’s house during the winter months, plucking\nfowls, or cramming turkeys and geese, or making clothes for her sisters\nand brothers out of some finery which d’Urberville had given her, and\nshe had put by with contempt. Apply to him she would not. But she would\noften clasp her hands behind her head and muse when she was supposed to\nbe working hard.\n\nShe philosophically noted dates as they came past in the revolution of\nthe year; the disastrous night of her undoing at Trantridge with its\ndark background of The Chase; also the dates of the baby’s birth and\ndeath; also her own birthday; and every other day individualized by\nincidents in which she had taken some share. She suddenly thought one\nafternoon, when looking in the glass at her fairness, that there was\nyet another date, of greater importance to her than those; that of her\nown death, when all these charms would have disappeared; a day which\nlay sly and unseen among all the other days of the year, giving no sign\nor sound when she annually passed over it; but not the less surely\nthere. When was it? Why did she not feel the chill of each yearly\nencounter with such a cold relation? She had Jeremy Taylor’s thought\nthat some time in the future those who had known her would say: “It is\nthe ——th, the day that poor Tess Durbeyfield died”; and there would be\nnothing singular to their minds in the statement. Of that day, doomed\nto be her terminus in time through all the ages, she did not know the\nplace in month, week, season or year.\n\nAlmost at a leap Tess thus changed from simple girl to complex woman.\nSymbols of reflectiveness passed into her face, and a note of tragedy\nat times into her voice. Her eyes grew larger and more eloquent. She\nbecame what would have been called a fine creature; her aspect was fair\nand arresting; her soul that of a woman whom the turbulent experiences\nof the last year or two had quite failed to demoralize. But for the\nworld’s opinion those experiences would have been simply a liberal\neducation.\n\nShe had held so aloof of late that her trouble, never generally known,\nwas nearly forgotten in Marlott. But it became evident to her that she\ncould never be really comfortable again in a place which had seen the\ncollapse of her family’s attempt to “claim kin”—and, through her, even\ncloser union—with the rich d’Urbervilles. At least she could not be\ncomfortable there till long years should have obliterated her keen\nconsciousness of it. Yet even now Tess felt the pulse of hopeful life\nstill warm within her; she might be happy in some nook which had no\nmemories. To escape the past and all that appertained thereto was to\nannihilate it, and to do that she would have to get away.\n\nWas once lost always lost really true of chastity? she would ask\nherself. She might prove it false if she could veil bygones. The\nrecuperative power which pervaded organic nature was surely not denied\nto maidenhood alone.\n\nShe waited a long time without finding opportunity for a new departure.\nA particularly fine spring came round, and the stir of germination was\nalmost audible in the buds; it moved her, as it moved the wild animals,\nand made her passionate to go. At last, one day in early May, a letter\nreached her from a former friend of her mother’s, to whom she had\naddressed inquiries long before—a person whom she had never seen—that a\nskilful milkmaid was required at a dairy-house many miles to the\nsouthward, and that the dairyman would be glad to have her for the\nsummer months.\n\nIt was not quite so far off as could have been wished; but it was\nprobably far enough, her radius of movement and repute having been so\nsmall. To persons of limited spheres, miles are as geographical\ndegrees, parishes as counties, counties as provinces and kingdoms.\n\nOn one point she was resolved: there should be no more d’Urberville\nair-castles in the dreams and deeds of her new life. She would be the\ndairymaid Tess, and nothing more. Her mother knew Tess’s feeling on\nthis point so well, though no words had passed between them on the\nsubject, that she never alluded to the knightly ancestry now.\n\nYet such is human inconsistency that one of the interests of the new\nplace to her was the accidental virtues of its lying near her\nforefathers’ country (for they were not Blakemore men, though her\nmother was Blakemore to the bone). The dairy called Talbothays, for\nwhich she was bound, stood not remotely from some of the former estates\nof the d’Urbervilles, near the great family vaults of her granddames\nand their powerful husbands. She would be able to look at them, and\nthink not only that d’Urberville, like Babylon, had fallen, but that\nthe individual innocence of a humble descendant could lapse as\nsilently. All the while she wondered if any strange good thing might\ncome of her being in her ancestral land; and some spirit within her\nrose automatically as the sap in the twigs. It was unexpected youth,\nsurging up anew after its temporary check, and bringing with it hope,\nand the invincible instinct towards self-delight.\n\n\nEnd of Phase the Second\n\n\nPhase the Third:\n\nThe Rally\n\n\nXVI\n\nOn a thyme-scented, bird-hatching morning in May, between two and three\nyears after the return from Trantridge—silent, reconstructive years for\nTess Durbeyfield—she left her home for the second time.\n\nHaving packed up her luggage so that it could be sent to her later, she\nstarted in a hired trap for the little town of Stourcastle, through\nwhich it was necessary to pass on her journey, now in a direction\nalmost opposite to that of her first adventuring. On the curve of the\nnearest hill she looked back regretfully at Marlott and her father’s\nhouse, although she had been so anxious to get away.\n\nHer kindred dwelling there would probably continue their daily lives as\nheretofore, with no great diminution of pleasure in their\nconsciousness, although she would be far off, and they deprived of her\nsmile. In a few days the children would engage in their games as\nmerrily as ever, without the sense of any gap left by her departure.\nThis leaving of the younger children she had decided to be for the\nbest; were she to remain they would probably gain less good by her\nprecepts than harm by her example.\n\nShe went through Stourcastle without pausing and onward to a junction\nof highways, where she could await a carrier’s van that ran to the\nsouth-west; for the railways which engirdled this interior tract of\ncountry had never yet struck across it. While waiting, however, there\ncame along a farmer in his spring cart, driving approximately in the\ndirection that she wished to pursue. Though he was a stranger to her\nshe accepted his offer of a seat beside him, ignoring that its motive\nwas a mere tribute to her countenance. He was going to Weatherbury, and\nby accompanying him thither she could walk the remainder of the\ndistance instead of travelling in the van by way of Casterbridge.\n\nTess did not stop at Weatherbury, after this long drive, further than\nto make a slight nondescript meal at noon at a cottage to which the\nfarmer recommended her. Thence she started on foot, basket in hand, to\nreach the wide upland of heath dividing this district from the\nlow-lying meads of a further valley in which the dairy stood that was\nthe aim and end of her day’s pilgrimage.\n\nTess had never before visited this part of the country, and yet she\nfelt akin to the landscape. Not so very far to the left of her she\ncould discern a dark patch in the scenery, which inquiry confirmed her\nin supposing to be trees marking the environs of Kingsbere—in the\nchurch of which parish the bones of her ancestors—her useless\nancestors—lay entombed.\n\nShe had no admiration for them now; she almost hated them for the dance\nthey had led her; not a thing of all that had been theirs did she\nretain but the old seal and spoon. “Pooh—I have as much of mother as\nfather in me!” she said. “All my prettiness comes from her, and she was\nonly a dairymaid.”\n\nThe journey over the intervening uplands and lowlands of Egdon, when\nshe reached them, was a more troublesome walk than she had anticipated,\nthe distance being actually but a few miles. It was two hours, owing to\nsundry wrong turnings, ere she found herself on a summit commanding the\nlong-sought-for vale, the Valley of the Great Dairies, the valley in\nwhich milk and butter grew to rankness, and were produced more\nprofusely, if less delicately, than at her home—the verdant plain so\nwell watered by the river Var or Froom.\n\nIt was intrinsically different from the Vale of Little Dairies,\nBlackmoor Vale, which, save during her disastrous sojourn at\nTrantridge, she had exclusively known till now. The world was drawn to\na larger pattern here. The enclosures numbered fifty acres instead of\nten, the farmsteads were more extended, the groups of cattle formed\ntribes hereabout; there only families. These myriads of cows stretching\nunder her eyes from the far east to the far west outnumbered any she\nhad ever seen at one glance before. The green lea was speckled as\nthickly with them as a canvas by Van Alsloot or Sallaert with burghers.\nThe ripe hue of the red and dun kine absorbed the evening sunlight,\nwhich the white-coated animals returned to the eye in rays almost\ndazzling, even at the distant elevation on which she stood.\n\nThe bird’s-eye perspective before her was not so luxuriantly beautiful,\nperhaps, as that other one which she knew so well; yet it was more\ncheering. It lacked the intensely blue atmosphere of the rival vale,\nand its heavy soils and scents; the new air was clear, bracing,\nethereal. The river itself, which nourished the grass and cows of these\nrenowned dairies, flowed not like the streams in Blackmoor. Those were\nslow, silent, often turbid; flowing over beds of mud into which the\nincautious wader might sink and vanish unawares. The Froom waters were\nclear as the pure River of Life shown to the Evangelist, rapid as the\nshadow of a cloud, with pebbly shallows that prattled to the sky all\nday long. There the water-flower was the lily; the crow-foot here.\n\nEither the change in the quality of the air from heavy to light, or the\nsense of being amid new scenes where there were no invidious eyes upon\nher, sent up her spirits wonderfully. Her hopes mingled with the\nsunshine in an ideal photosphere which surrounded her as she bounded\nalong against the soft south wind. She heard a pleasant voice in every\nbreeze, and in every bird’s note seemed to lurk a joy.\n\nHer face had latterly changed with changing states of mind, continually\nfluctuating between beauty and ordinariness, according as the thoughts\nwere gay or grave. One day she was pink and flawless; another pale and\ntragical. When she was pink she was feeling less than when pale; her\nmore perfect beauty accorded with her less elevated mood; her more\nintense mood with her less perfect beauty. It was her best face\nphysically that was now set against the south wind.\n\nThe irresistible, universal, automatic tendency to find sweet pleasure\nsomewhere, which pervades all life, from the meanest to the highest,\nhad at length mastered Tess. Being even now only a young woman of\ntwenty, one who mentally and sentimentally had not finished growing, it\nwas impossible that any event should have left upon her an impression\nthat was not in time capable of transmutation.\n\nAnd thus her spirits, and her thankfulness, and her hopes, rose higher\nand higher. She tried several ballads, but found them inadequate; till,\nrecollecting the psalter that her eyes had so often wandered over of a\nSunday morning before she had eaten of the tree of knowledge, she\nchanted: “O ye Sun and Moon ... O ye Stars ... ye Green Things upon the\nEarth ... ye Fowls of the Air ... Beasts and Cattle ... Children of Men\n... bless ye the Lord, praise Him and magnify Him forever!”\n\nShe suddenly stopped and murmured: “But perhaps I don’t quite know the\nLord as yet.”\n\nAnd probably the half-unconscious rhapsody was a Fetishistic utterance\nin a Monotheistic setting; women whose chief companions are the forms\nand forces of outdoor Nature retain in their souls far more of the\nPagan fantasy of their remote forefathers than of the systematized\nreligion taught their race at later date. However, Tess found at least\napproximate expression for her feelings in the old _Benedicite_ that\nshe had lisped from infancy; and it was enough. Such high contentment\nwith such a slight initial performance as that of having started\ntowards a means of independent living was a part of the Durbeyfield\ntemperament. Tess really wished to walk uprightly, while her father did\nnothing of the kind; but she resembled him in being content with\nimmediate and small achievements, and in having no mind for laborious\neffort towards such petty social advancement as could alone be effected\nby a family so heavily handicapped as the once powerful d’Urbervilles\nwere now.\n\nThere was, it might be said, the energy of her mother’s unexpended\nfamily, as well as the natural energy of Tess’s years, rekindled after\nthe experience which had so overwhelmed her for the time. Let the truth\nbe told—women do as a rule live through such humiliations, and regain\ntheir spirits, and again look about them with an interested eye. While\nthere’s life there’s hope is a conviction not so entirely unknown to\nthe “betrayed” as some amiable theorists would have us believe.\n\nTess Durbeyfield, then, in good heart, and full of zest for life,\ndescended the Egdon slopes lower and lower towards the dairy of her\npilgrimage.\n\nThe marked difference, in the final particular, between the rival vales\nnow showed itself. The secret of Blackmoor was best discovered from the\nheights around; to read aright the valley before her it was necessary\nto descend into its midst. When Tess had accomplished this feat she\nfound herself to be standing on a carpeted level, which stretched to\nthe east and west as far as the eye could reach.\n\nThe river had stolen from the higher tracts and brought in particles to\nthe vale all this horizontal land; and now, exhausted, aged, and\nattenuated, lay serpentining along through the midst of its former\nspoils.\n\nNot quite sure of her direction, Tess stood still upon the hemmed\nexpanse of verdant flatness, like a fly on a billiard-table of\nindefinite length, and of no more consequence to the surroundings than\nthat fly. The sole effect of her presence upon the placid valley so far\nhad been to excite the mind of a solitary heron, which, after\ndescending to the ground not far from her path, stood with neck erect,\nlooking at her.\n\nSuddenly there arose from all parts of the lowland a prolonged and\nrepeated call—“Waow! waow! waow!”\n\nFrom the furthest east to the furthest west the cries spread as if by\ncontagion, accompanied in some cases by the barking of a dog. It was\nnot the expression of the valley’s consciousness that beautiful Tess\nhad arrived, but the ordinary announcement of milking-time—half-past\nfour o’clock, when the dairymen set about getting in the cows.\n\nThe red and white herd nearest at hand, which had been phlegmatically\nwaiting for the call, now trooped towards the steading in the\nbackground, their great bags of milk swinging under them as they\nwalked. Tess followed slowly in their rear, and entered the barton by\nthe open gate through which they had entered before her. Long thatched\nsheds stretched round the enclosure, their slopes encrusted with vivid\ngreen moss, and their eaves supported by wooden posts rubbed to a\nglossy smoothness by the flanks of infinite cows and calves of bygone\nyears, now passed to an oblivion almost inconceivable in its\nprofundity. Between the post were ranged the milchers, each exhibiting\nherself at the present moment to a whimsical eye in the rear as a\ncircle on two stalks, down the centre of which a switch moved\npendulum-wise; while the sun, lowering itself behind this patient row,\nthrew their shadows accurately inwards upon the wall. Thus it threw\nshadows of these obscure and homely figures every evening with as much\ncare over each contour as if it had been the profile of a court beauty\non a palace wall; copied them as diligently as it had copied Olympian\nshapes on marble _façades_ long ago, or the outline of Alexander,\nCaesar, and the Pharaohs.\n\nThey were the less restful cows that were stalled. Those that would\nstand still of their own will were milked in the middle of the yard,\nwhere many of such better behaved ones stood waiting now—all prime\nmilchers, such as were seldom seen out of this valley, and not always\nwithin it; nourished by the succulent feed which the water-meads\nsupplied at this prime season of the year. Those of them that were\nspotted with white reflected the sunshine in dazzling brilliancy, and\nthe polished brass knobs of their horns glittered with something of\nmilitary display. Their large-veined udders hung ponderous as sandbags,\nthe teats sticking out like the legs of a gipsy’s crock; and as each\nanimal lingered for her turn to arrive the milk oozed forth and fell in\ndrops to the ground.\n\n\nXVII\n\nThe dairymaids and men had flocked down from their cottages and out of\nthe dairy-house with the arrival of the cows from the meads; the maids\nwalking in pattens, not on account of the weather, but to keep their\nshoes above the mulch of the barton. Each girl sat down on her\nthree-legged stool, her face sideways, her right cheek resting against\nthe cow, and looked musingly along the animal’s flank at Tess as she\napproached. The male milkers, with hat-brims turned down, resting flat\non their foreheads and gazing on the ground, did not observe her.\n\nOne of these was a sturdy middle-aged man—whose long white “pinner” was\nsomewhat finer and cleaner than the wraps of the others, and whose\njacket underneath had a presentable marketing aspect—the\nmaster-dairyman, of whom she was in quest, his double character as a\nworking milker and butter maker here during six days, and on the\nseventh as a man in shining broad-cloth in his family pew at church,\nbeing so marked as to have inspired a rhyme:\n\n    Dairyman Dick\n    All the week:\n    On Sundays Mister Richard Crick.\n\nSeeing Tess standing at gaze he went across to her.\n\nThe majority of dairymen have a cross manner at milking time, but it\nhappened that Mr Crick was glad to get a new hand—for the days were\nbusy ones now—and he received her warmly; inquiring for her mother and\nthe rest of the family—(though this as a matter of form merely, for in\nreality he had not been aware of Mrs Durbeyfield’s existence till\napprised of the fact by a brief business-letter about Tess).\n\n“Oh—ay, as a lad I knowed your part o’ the country very well,” he said\nterminatively. “Though I’ve never been there since. And a aged woman of\nninety that use to live nigh here, but is dead and gone long ago, told\nme that a family of some such name as yours in Blackmoor Vale came\noriginally from these parts, and that ’twere a old ancient race that\nhad all but perished off the earth—though the new generations didn’t\nknow it. But, Lord, I took no notice of the old woman’s ramblings, not\nI.”\n\n“Oh no—it is nothing,” said Tess.\n\nThen the talk was of business only.\n\n“You can milk ’em clean, my maidy? I don’t want my cows going azew at\nthis time o’ year.”\n\nShe reassured him on that point, and he surveyed her up and down. She\nhad been staying indoors a good deal, and her complexion had grown\ndelicate.\n\n“Quite sure you can stand it? ’Tis comfortable enough here for rough\nfolk; but we don’t live in a cowcumber frame.”\n\nShe declared that she could stand it, and her zest and willingness\nseemed to win him over.\n\n“Well, I suppose you’ll want a dish o’ tay, or victuals of some sort,\nhey? Not yet? Well, do as ye like about it. But faith, if ’twas I, I\nshould be as dry as a kex wi’ travelling so far.”\n\n“I’ll begin milking now, to get my hand in,” said Tess.\n\nShe drank a little milk as temporary refreshment—to the\nsurprise—indeed, slight contempt—of Dairyman Crick, to whose mind it\nhad apparently never occurred that milk was good as a beverage.\n\n“Oh, if ye can swaller that, be it so,” he said indifferently, while\nholding up the pail that she sipped from. “’Tis what I hain’t touched\nfor years—not I. Rot the stuff; it would lie in my innerds like lead.\nYou can try your hand upon she,” he pursued, nodding to the nearest\ncow. “Not but what she do milk rather hard. We’ve hard ones and we’ve\neasy ones, like other folks. However, you’ll find out that soon\nenough.”\n\nWhen Tess had changed her bonnet for a hood, and was really on her\nstool under the cow, and the milk was squirting from her fists into the\npail, she appeared to feel that she really had laid a new foundation\nfor her future. The conviction bred serenity, her pulse slowed, and she\nwas able to look about her.\n\nThe milkers formed quite a little battalion of men and maids, the men\noperating on the hard-teated animals, the maids on the kindlier\nnatures. It was a large dairy. There were nearly a hundred milchers\nunder Crick’s management, all told; and of the herd the master-dairyman\nmilked six or eight with his own hands, unless away from home. These\nwere the cows that milked hardest of all; for his journey-milkmen being\nmore or less casually hired, he would not entrust this half-dozen to\ntheir treatment, lest, from indifference, they should not milk them\nfully; nor to the maids, lest they should fail in the same way for lack\nof finger-grip; with the result that in course of time the cows would\n“go azew”—that is, dry up. It was not the loss for the moment that made\nslack milking so serious, but that with the decline of demand there\ncame decline, and ultimately cessation, of supply.\n\nAfter Tess had settled down to her cow there was for a time no talk in\nthe barton, and not a sound interfered with the purr of the milk-jets\ninto the numerous pails, except a momentary exclamation to one or other\nof the beasts requesting her to turn round or stand still. The only\nmovements were those of the milkers’ hands up and down, and the swing\nof the cows’ tails. Thus they all worked on, encompassed by the vast\nflat mead which extended to either slope of the valley—a level\nlandscape compounded of old landscapes long forgotten, and, no doubt,\ndiffering in character very greatly from the landscape they composed\nnow.\n\n“To my thinking,” said the dairyman, rising suddenly from a cow he had\njust finished off, snatching up his three-legged stool in one hand and\nthe pail in the other, and moving on to the next hard-yielder in his\nvicinity, “to my thinking, the cows don’t gie down their milk to-day as\nusual. Upon my life, if Winker do begin keeping back like this, she’ll\nnot be worth going under by midsummer.”\n\n“’Tis because there’s a new hand come among us,” said Jonathan Kail.\n“I’ve noticed such things afore.”\n\n“To be sure. It may be so. I didn’t think o’t.”\n\n“I’ve been told that it goes up into their horns at such times,” said a\ndairymaid.\n\n“Well, as to going up into their horns,” replied Dairyman Crick\ndubiously, as though even witchcraft might be limited by anatomical\npossibilities, “I couldn’t say; I certainly could not. But as nott cows\nwill keep it back as well as the horned ones, I don’t quite agree to\nit. Do ye know that riddle about the nott cows, Jonathan? Why do nott\ncows give less milk in a year than horned?”\n\n“I don’t!” interposed the milkmaid, “Why do they?”\n\n“Because there bain’t so many of ’em,” said the dairyman. “Howsomever,\nthese gam’sters do certainly keep back their milk to-day. Folks, we\nmust lift up a stave or two—that’s the only cure for’t.”\n\nSongs were often resorted to in dairies hereabout as an enticement to\nthe cows when they showed signs of withholding their usual yield; and\nthe band of milkers at this request burst into melody—in purely\nbusiness-like tones, it is true, and with no great spontaneity; the\nresult, according to their own belief, being a decided improvement\nduring the song’s continuance. When they had gone through fourteen or\nfifteen verses of a cheerful ballad about a murderer who was afraid to\ngo to bed in the dark because he saw certain brimstone flames around\nhim, one of the male milkers said—\n\n“I wish singing on the stoop didn’t use up so much of a man’s wind! You\nshould get your harp, sir; not but what a fiddle is best.”\n\nTess, who had given ear to this, thought the words were addressed to\nthe dairyman, but she was wrong. A reply, in the shape of “Why?” came\nas it were out of the belly of a dun cow in the stalls; it had been\nspoken by a milker behind the animal, whom she had not hitherto\nperceived.\n\n“Oh yes; there’s nothing like a fiddle,” said the dairyman. “Though I\ndo think that bulls are more moved by a tune than cows—at least that’s\nmy experience. Once there was an old aged man over at Mellstock—William\nDewy by name—one of the family that used to do a good deal of business\nas tranters over there—Jonathan, do ye mind?—I knowed the man by sight\nas well as I know my own brother, in a manner of speaking. Well, this\nman was a coming home along from a wedding, where he had been playing\nhis fiddle, one fine moonlight night, and for shortness’ sake he took a\ncut across Forty-acres, a field lying that way, where a bull was out to\ngrass. The bull seed William, and took after him, horns aground, begad;\nand though William runned his best, and hadn’t _much_ drink in him\n(considering ’twas a wedding, and the folks well off), he found he’d\nnever reach the fence and get over in time to save himself. Well, as a\nlast thought, he pulled out his fiddle as he runned, and struck up a\njig, turning to the bull, and backing towards the corner. The bull\nsoftened down, and stood still, looking hard at William Dewy, who\nfiddled on and on; till a sort of a smile stole over the bull’s face.\nBut no sooner did William stop his playing and turn to get over hedge\nthan the bull would stop his smiling and lower his horns towards the\nseat of William’s breeches. Well, William had to turn about and play\non, willy-nilly; and ’twas only three o’clock in the world, and ’a\nknowed that nobody would come that way for hours, and he so leery and\ntired that ’a didn’t know what to do. When he had scraped till about\nfour o’clock he felt that he verily would have to give over soon, and\nhe said to himself, ‘There’s only this last tune between me and eternal\nwelfare! Heaven save me, or I’m a done man.’ Well, then he called to\nmind how he’d seen the cattle kneel o’ Christmas Eves in the dead o’\nnight. It was not Christmas Eve then, but it came into his head to play\na trick upon the bull. So he broke into the ’Tivity Hymm, just as at\nChristmas carol-singing; when, lo and behold, down went the bull on his\nbended knees, in his ignorance, just as if ’twere the true ’Tivity\nnight and hour. As soon as his horned friend were down, William turned,\nclinked off like a long-dog, and jumped safe over hedge, before the\npraying bull had got on his feet again to take after him. William used\nto say that he’d seen a man look a fool a good many times, but never\nsuch a fool as that bull looked when he found his pious feelings had\nbeen played upon, and ’twas not Christmas Eve. Yes, William Dewy, that\nwas the man’s name; and I can tell you to a foot where’s he a-lying in\nMellstock Churchyard at this very moment—just between the second\nyew-tree and the north aisle.”\n\n“It’s a curious story; it carries us back to medieval times, when faith\nwas a living thing!”\n\nThe remark, singular for a dairy-yard, was murmured by the voice behind\nthe dun cow; but as nobody understood the reference, no notice was\ntaken, except that the narrator seemed to think it might imply\nscepticism as to his tale.\n\n“Well, ’tis quite true, sir, whether or no. I knowed the man well.”\n\n“Oh yes; I have no doubt of it,” said the person behind the dun cow.\n\nTess’s attention was thus attracted to the dairyman’s interlocutor, of\nwhom she could see but the merest patch, owing to his burying his head\nso persistently in the flank of the milcher. She could not understand\nwhy he should be addressed as “sir” even by the dairyman himself. But\nno explanation was discernible; he remained under the cow long enough\nto have milked three, uttering a private ejaculation now and then, as\nif he could not get on.\n\n“Take it gentle, sir; take it gentle,” said the dairyman. “’Tis knack,\nnot strength, that does it.”\n\n“So I find,” said the other, standing up at last and stretching his\narms. “I think I have finished her, however, though she made my fingers\nache.”\n\nTess could then see him at full length. He wore the ordinary white\npinner and leather leggings of a dairy-farmer when milking, and his\nboots were clogged with the mulch of the yard; but this was all his\nlocal livery. Beneath it was something educated, reserved, subtle, sad,\ndiffering.\n\nBut the details of his aspect were temporarily thrust aside by the\ndiscovery that he was one whom she had seen before. Such vicissitudes\nhad Tess passed through since that time that for a moment she could not\nremember where she had met him; and then it flashed upon her that he\nwas the pedestrian who had joined in the club-dance at Marlott—the\npassing stranger who had come she knew not whence, had danced with\nothers but not with her, and slightingly left her, and gone on his way\nwith his friends.\n\nThe flood of memories brought back by this revival of an incident\nanterior to her troubles produced a momentary dismay lest, recognizing\nher also, he should by some means discover her story. But it passed\naway when she found no sign of remembrance in him. She saw by degrees\nthat since their first and only encounter his mobile face had grown\nmore thoughtful, and had acquired a young man’s shapely moustache and\nbeard—the latter of the palest straw colour where it began upon his\ncheeks, and deepening to a warm brown farther from its root. Under his\nlinen milking-pinner he wore a dark velveteen jacket, cord breeches and\ngaiters, and a starched white shirt. Without the milking-gear nobody\ncould have guessed what he was. He might with equal probability have\nbeen an eccentric landowner or a gentlemanly ploughman. That he was but\na novice at dairy work she had realized in a moment, from the time he\nhad spent upon the milking of one cow.\n\nMeanwhile many of the milkmaids had said to one another of the\nnewcomer, “How pretty she is!” with something of real generosity and\nadmiration, though with a half hope that the auditors would qualify the\nassertion—which, strictly speaking, they might have done, prettiness\nbeing an inexact definition of what struck the eye in Tess. When the\nmilking was finished for the evening they straggled indoors, where Mrs\nCrick, the dairyman’s wife—who was too respectable to go out milking\nherself, and wore a hot stuff gown in warm weather because the\ndairymaids wore prints—was giving an eye to the leads and things.\n\nOnly two or three of the maids, Tess learnt, slept in the dairy-house\nbesides herself, most of the helpers going to their homes. She saw\nnothing at supper-time of the superior milker who had commented on the\nstory, and asked no questions about him, the remainder of the evening\nbeing occupied in arranging her place in the bed-chamber. It was a\nlarge room over the milk-house, some thirty feet long; the\nsleeping-cots of the other three indoor milkmaids being in the same\napartment. They were blooming young women, and, except one, rather\nolder than herself. By bedtime Tess was thoroughly tired, and fell\nasleep immediately.\n\nBut one of the girls, who occupied an adjoining bed, was more wakeful\nthan Tess, and would insist upon relating to the latter various\nparticulars of the homestead into which she had just entered. The\ngirl’s whispered words mingled with the shades, and, to Tess’s drowsy\nmind, they seemed to be generated by the darkness in which they\nfloated.\n\n“Mr Angel Clare—he that is learning milking, and that plays the\nharp—never says much to us. He is a pa’son’s son, and is too much taken\nup wi’ his own thoughts to notice girls. He is the dairyman’s\npupil—learning farming in all its branches. He has learnt sheep-farming\nat another place, and he’s now mastering dairy-work.... Yes, he is\nquite the gentleman-born. His father is the Reverend Mr Clare at\nEmminster—a good many miles from here.”\n\n“Oh—I have heard of him,” said her companion, now awake. “A very\nearnest clergyman, is he not?”\n\n“Yes—that he is—the earnestest man in all Wessex, they say—the last of\nthe old Low Church sort, they tell me—for all about here be what they\ncall High. All his sons, except our Mr Clare, be made pa’sons too.”\n\nTess had not at this hour the curiosity to ask why the present Mr Clare\nwas not made a parson like his brethren, and gradually fell asleep\nagain, the words of her informant coming to her along with the smell of\nthe cheeses in the adjoining cheeseloft, and the measured dripping of\nthe whey from the wrings downstairs.\n\n\nXVIII\n\nAngel Clare rises out of the past not altogether as a distinct figure,\nbut as an appreciative voice, a long regard of fixed, abstracted eyes,\nand a mobility of mouth somewhat too small and delicately lined for a\nman’s, though with an unexpectedly firm close of the lower lip now and\nthen; enough to do away with any inference of indecision. Nevertheless,\nsomething nebulous, preoccupied, vague, in his bearing and regard,\nmarked him as one who probably had no very definite aim or concern\nabout his material future. Yet as a lad people had said of him that he\nwas one who might do anything if he tried.\n\nHe was the youngest son of his father, a poor parson at the other end\nof the county, and had arrived at Talbothays Dairy as a six months’\npupil, after going the round of some other farms, his object being to\nacquire a practical skill in the various processes of farming, with a\nview either to the Colonies or the tenure of a home-farm, as\ncircumstances might decide.\n\nHis entry into the ranks of the agriculturists and breeders was a step\nin the young man’s career which had been anticipated neither by himself\nnor by others.\n\nMr Clare the elder, whose first wife had died and left him a daughter,\nmarried a second late in life. This lady had somewhat unexpectedly\nbrought him three sons, so that between Angel, the youngest, and his\nfather the Vicar there seemed to be almost a missing generation. Of\nthese boys the aforesaid Angel, the child of his old age, was the only\nson who had not taken a University degree, though he was the single one\nof them whose early promise might have done full justice to an\nacademical training.\n\nSome two or three years before Angel’s appearance at the Marlott dance,\non a day when he had left school and was pursuing his studies at home,\na parcel came to the Vicarage from the local bookseller’s, directed to\nthe Reverend James Clare. The Vicar having opened it and found it to\ncontain a book, read a few pages; whereupon he jumped up from his seat\nand went straight to the shop with the book under his arm.\n\n“Why has this been sent to my house?” he asked peremptorily, holding up\nthe volume.\n\n“It was ordered, sir.”\n\n“Not by me, or any one belonging to me, I am happy to say.”\n\nThe shopkeeper looked into his order-book.\n\n“Oh, it has been misdirected, sir,” he said. “It was ordered by Mr\nAngel Clare, and should have been sent to him.”\n\nMr Clare winced as if he had been struck. He went home pale and\ndejected, and called Angel into his study.\n\n“Look into this book, my boy,” he said. “What do you know about it?”\n\n“I ordered it,” said Angel simply.\n\n“What for?”\n\n“To read.”\n\n“How can you think of reading it?”\n\n“How can I? Why—it is a system of philosophy. There is no more moral,\nor even religious, work published.”\n\n“Yes—moral enough; I don’t deny that. But religious!—and for _you_, who\nintend to be a minister of the Gospel!”\n\n“Since you have alluded to the matter, father,” said the son, with\nanxious thought upon his face, “I should like to say, once for all,\nthat I should prefer not to take Orders. I fear I could not\nconscientiously do so. I love the Church as one loves a parent. I shall\nalways have the warmest affection for her. There is no institution for\nwhose history I have a deeper admiration; but I cannot honestly be\nordained her minister, as my brothers are, while she refuses to\nliberate her mind from an untenable redemptive theolatry.”\n\nIt had never occurred to the straightforward and simple-minded Vicar\nthat one of his own flesh and blood could come to this! He was\nstultified, shocked, paralysed. And if Angel were not going to enter\nthe Church, what was the use of sending him to Cambridge? The\nUniversity as a step to anything but ordination seemed, to this man of\nfixed ideas, a preface without a volume. He was a man not merely\nreligious, but devout; a firm believer—not as the phrase is now\nelusively construed by theological thimble-riggers in the Church and\nout of it, but in the old and ardent sense of the Evangelical school:\none who could\n\n    Indeed opine\n    That the Eternal and Divine\n    Did, eighteen centuries ago\n    In very truth...\n\nAngel’s father tried argument, persuasion, entreaty.\n\n“No, father; I cannot underwrite Article Four (leave alone the rest),\ntaking it ‘in the literal and grammatical sense’ as required by the\nDeclaration; and, therefore, I can’t be a parson in the present state\nof affairs,” said Angel. “My whole instinct in matters of religion is\ntowards reconstruction; to quote your favorite Epistle to the Hebrews,\n‘the removing of those things that are shaken, as of things that are\nmade, that those things which cannot be shaken may remain.’”\n\nHis father grieved so deeply that it made Angel quite ill to see him.\n\n“What is the good of your mother and me economizing and stinting\nourselves to give you a University education, if it is not to be used\nfor the honour and glory of God?” his father repeated.\n\n“Why, that it may be used for the honour and glory of man, father.”\n\nPerhaps if Angel had persevered he might have gone to Cambridge like\nhis brothers. But the Vicar’s view of that seat of learning as a\nstepping-stone to Orders alone was quite a family tradition; and so\nrooted was the idea in his mind that perseverance began to appear to\nthe sensitive son akin to an intent to misappropriate a trust, and\nwrong the pious heads of the household, who had been and were, as his\nfather had hinted, compelled to exercise much thrift to carry out this\nuniform plan of education for the three young men.\n\n“I will do without Cambridge,” said Angel at last. “I feel that I have\nno right to go there in the circumstances.”\n\nThe effects of this decisive debate were not long in showing\nthemselves. He spent years and years in desultory studies,\nundertakings, and meditations; he began to evince considerable\nindifference to social forms and observances. The material distinctions\nof rank and wealth he increasingly despised. Even the “good old family”\n(to use a favourite phrase of a late local worthy) had no aroma for him\nunless there were good new resolutions in its representatives. As a\nbalance to these austerities, when he went to live in London to see\nwhat the world was like, and with a view to practising a profession or\nbusiness there, he was carried off his head, and nearly entrapped by a\nwoman much older than himself, though luckily he escaped not greatly\nthe worse for the experience.\n\nEarly association with country solitudes had bred in him an\nunconquerable, and almost unreasonable, aversion to modern town life,\nand shut him out from such success as he might have aspired to by\nfollowing a mundane calling in the impracticability of the spiritual\none. But something had to be done; he had wasted many valuable years;\nand having an acquaintance who was starting on a thriving life as a\nColonial farmer, it occurred to Angel that this might be a lead in the\nright direction. Farming, either in the Colonies, America, or at\nhome—farming, at any rate, after becoming well qualified for the\nbusiness by a careful apprenticeship—that was a vocation which would\nprobably afford an independence without the sacrifice of what he valued\neven more than a competency—intellectual liberty.\n\nSo we find Angel Clare at six-and-twenty here at Talbothays as a\nstudent of kine, and, as there were no houses near at hand in which he\ncould get a comfortable lodging, a boarder at the dairyman’s.\n\nHis room was an immense attic which ran the whole length of the\ndairy-house. It could only be reached by a ladder from the cheese-loft,\nand had been closed up for a long time till he arrived and selected it\nas his retreat. Here Clare had plenty of space, and could often be\nheard by the dairy-folk pacing up and down when the household had gone\nto rest. A portion was divided off at one end by a curtain, behind\nwhich was his bed, the outer part being furnished as a homely\nsitting-room.\n\nAt first he lived up above entirely, reading a good deal, and strumming\nupon an old harp which he had bought at a sale, saying when in a bitter\nhumour that he might have to get his living by it in the streets some\nday. But he soon preferred to read human nature by taking his meals\ndownstairs in the general dining-kitchen, with the dairyman and his\nwife, and the maids and men, who all together formed a lively assembly;\nfor though but few milking hands slept in the house, several joined the\nfamily at meals. The longer Clare resided here the less objection had\nhe to his company, and the more did he like to share quarters with them\nin common.\n\nMuch to his surprise he took, indeed, a real delight in their\ncompanionship. The conventional farm-folk of his\nimagination—personified in the newspaper-press by the pitiable dummy\nknown as Hodge—were obliterated after a few days’ residence. At close\nquarters no Hodge was to be seen. At first, it is true, when Clare’s\nintelligence was fresh from a contrasting society, these friends with\nwhom he now hobnobbed seemed a little strange. Sitting down as a level\nmember of the dairyman’s household seemed at the outset an undignified\nproceeding. The ideas, the modes, the surroundings, appeared\nretrogressive and unmeaning. But with living on there, day after day,\nthe acute sojourner became conscious of a new aspect in the spectacle.\nWithout any objective change whatever, variety had taken the place of\nmonotonousness. His host and his host’s household, his men and his\nmaids, as they became intimately known to Clare, began to differentiate\nthemselves as in a chemical process. The thought of Pascal’s was\nbrought home to him: “_A mesure qu’on a plus d’esprit, on trouve qu’il\ny a plus d’hommes originaux. Les gens du commun ne trouvent pas de\ndifférence entre les hommes_.” The typical and unvarying Hodge ceased\nto exist. He had been disintegrated into a number of varied\nfellow-creatures—beings of many minds, beings infinite in difference;\nsome happy, many serene, a few depressed, one here and there bright\neven to genius, some stupid, others wanton, others austere; some mutely\nMiltonic, some potentially Cromwellian—into men who had private views\nof each other, as he had of his friends; who could applaud or condemn\neach other, amuse or sadden themselves by the contemplation of each\nother’s foibles or vices; men every one of whom walked in his own\nindividual way the road to dusty death.\n\nUnexpectedly he began to like the outdoor life for its own sake, and\nfor what it brought, apart from its bearing on his own proposed career.\nConsidering his position he became wonderfully free from the chronic\nmelancholy which is taking hold of the civilized races with the decline\nof belief in a beneficent Power. For the first time of late years he\ncould read as his musings inclined him, without any eye to cramming for\na profession, since the few farming handbooks which he deemed it\ndesirable to master occupied him but little time.\n\nHe grew away from old associations, and saw something new in life and\nhumanity. Secondarily, he made close acquaintance with phenomena which\nhe had before known but darkly—the seasons in their moods, morning and\nevening, night and noon, winds in their different tempers, trees,\nwaters and mists, shades and silences, and the voices of inanimate\nthings.\n\nThe early mornings were still sufficiently cool to render a fire\nacceptable in the large room wherein they breakfasted; and, by Mrs\nCrick’s orders, who held that he was too genteel to mess at their\ntable, it was Angel Clare’s custom to sit in the yawning chimney-corner\nduring the meal, his cup-and-saucer and plate being placed on a hinged\nflap at his elbow. The light from the long, wide, mullioned window\nopposite shone in upon his nook, and, assisted by a secondary light of\ncold blue quality which shone down the chimney, enabled him to read\nthere easily whenever disposed to do so. Between Clare and the window\nwas the table at which his companions sat, their munching profiles\nrising sharp against the panes; while to the side was the milk-house\ndoor, through which were visible the rectangular leads in rows, full to\nthe brim with the morning’s milk. At the further end the great churn\ncould be seen revolving, and its slip-slopping heard—the moving power\nbeing discernible through the window in the form of a spiritless horse\nwalking in a circle and driven by a boy.\n\nFor several days after Tess’s arrival Clare, sitting abstractedly\nreading from some book, periodical, or piece of music just come by\npost, hardly noticed that she was present at table. She talked so\nlittle, and the other maids talked so much, that the babble did not\nstrike him as possessing a new note, and he was ever in the habit of\nneglecting the particulars of an outward scene for the general\nimpression. One day, however, when he had been conning one of his\nmusic-scores, and by force of imagination was hearing the tune in his\nhead, he lapsed into listlessness, and the music-sheet rolled to the\nhearth. He looked at the fire of logs, with its one flame pirouetting\non the top in a dying dance after the breakfast-cooking and boiling,\nand it seemed to jig to his inward tune; also at the two chimney crooks\ndangling down from the cotterel, or cross-bar, plumed with soot, which\nquivered to the same melody; also at the half-empty kettle whining an\naccompaniment. The conversation at the table mixed in with his\nphantasmal orchestra till he thought: “What a fluty voice one of those\nmilkmaids has! I suppose it is the new one.”\n\nClare looked round upon her, seated with the others.\n\nShe was not looking towards him. Indeed, owing to his long silence, his\npresence in the room was almost forgotten.\n\n“I don’t know about ghosts,” she was saying; “but I do know that our\nsouls can be made to go outside our bodies when we are alive.”\n\nThe dairyman turned to her with his mouth full, his eyes charged with\nserious inquiry, and his great knife and fork (breakfasts were\nbreakfasts here) planted erect on the table, like the beginning of a\ngallows.\n\n“What—really now? And is it so, maidy?” he said.\n\n“A very easy way to feel ’em go,” continued Tess, “is to lie on the\ngrass at night and look straight up at some big bright star; and, by\nfixing your mind upon it, you will soon find that you are hundreds and\nhundreds o’ miles away from your body, which you don’t seem to want at\nall.”\n\nThe dairyman removed his hard gaze from Tess, and fixed it on his wife.\n\n“Now that’s a rum thing, Christianer—hey? To think o’ the miles I’ve\nvamped o’ starlight nights these last thirty year, courting, or\ntrading, or for doctor, or for nurse, and yet never had the least\nnotion o’ that till now, or feeled my soul rise so much as an inch\nabove my shirt-collar.”\n\nThe general attention being drawn to her, including that of the\ndairyman’s pupil, Tess flushed, and remarking evasively that it was\nonly a fancy, resumed her breakfast.\n\nClare continued to observe her. She soon finished her eating, and\nhaving a consciousness that Clare was regarding her, began to trace\nimaginary patterns on the tablecloth with her forefinger with the\nconstraint of a domestic animal that perceives itself to be watched.\n\n“What a fresh and virginal daughter of Nature that milkmaid is!” he\nsaid to himself.\n\nAnd then he seemed to discern in her something that was familiar,\nsomething which carried him back into a joyous and unforeseeing past,\nbefore the necessity of taking thought had made the heavens gray. He\nconcluded that he had beheld her before; where he could not tell. A\ncasual encounter during some country ramble it certainly had been, and\nhe was not greatly curious about it. But the circumstance was\nsufficient to lead him to select Tess in preference to the other pretty\nmilkmaids when he wished to contemplate contiguous womankind.\n\n\nXIX\n\nIn general the cows were milked as they presented themselves, without\nfancy or choice. But certain cows will show a fondness for a particular\npair of hands, sometimes carrying this predilection so far as to refuse\nto stand at all except to their favourite, the pail of a stranger being\nunceremoniously kicked over.\n\nIt was Dairyman Crick’s rule to insist on breaking down these\npartialities and aversions by constant interchange, since otherwise, in\nthe event of a milkman or maid going away from the dairy, he was placed\nin a difficulty. The maids’ private aims, however, were the reverse of\nthe dairyman’s rule, the daily selection by each damsel of the eight or\nten cows to which she had grown accustomed rendering the operation on\ntheir willing udders surprisingly easy and effortless.\n\nTess, like her compeers, soon discovered which of the cows had a\npreference for her style of manipulation, and her fingers having become\ndelicate from the long domiciliary imprisonments to which she had\nsubjected herself at intervals during the last two or three years, she\nwould have been glad to meet the milchers’ views in this respect. Out\nof the whole ninety-five there were eight in particular—Dumpling,\nFancy, Lofty, Mist, Old Pretty, Young Pretty, Tidy, and Loud—who,\nthough the teats of one or two were as hard as carrots, gave down to\nher with a readiness that made her work on them a mere touch of the\nfingers. Knowing, however, the dairyman’s wish, she endeavoured\nconscientiously to take the animals just as they came, excepting the\nvery hard yielders which she could not yet manage.\n\nBut she soon found a curious correspondence between the ostensibly\nchance position of the cows and her wishes in this matter, till she\nfelt that their order could not be the result of accident. The\ndairyman’s pupil had lent a hand in getting the cows together of late,\nand at the fifth or sixth time she turned her eyes, as she rested\nagainst the cow, full of sly inquiry upon him.\n\n“Mr Clare, you have ranged the cows!” she said, blushing; and in making\nthe accusation, symptoms of a smile gently lifted her upper lip in\nspite of her, so as to show the tips of her teeth, the lower lip\nremaining severely still.\n\n“Well, it makes no difference,” said he. “You will always be here to\nmilk them.”\n\n“Do you think so? I _hope_ I shall! But I don’t _know_.”\n\nShe was angry with herself afterwards, thinking that he, unaware of her\ngrave reasons for liking this seclusion, might have mistaken her\nmeaning. She had spoken so earnestly to him, as if his presence were\nsomehow a factor in her wish. Her misgiving was such that at dusk, when\nthe milking was over, she walked in the garden alone, to continue her\nregrets that she had disclosed to him her discovery of his\nconsiderateness.\n\nIt was a typical summer evening in June, the atmosphere being in such\ndelicate equilibrium and so transmissive that inanimate objects seemed\nendowed with two or three senses, if not five. There was no distinction\nbetween the near and the far, and an auditor felt close to everything\nwithin the horizon. The soundlessness impressed her as a positive\nentity rather than as the mere negation of noise. It was broken by the\nstrumming of strings.\n\nTess had heard those notes in the attic above her head. Dim, flattened,\nconstrained by their confinement, they had never appealed to her as\nnow, when they wandered in the still air with a stark quality like that\nof nudity. To speak absolutely, both instrument and execution were\npoor; but the relative is all, and as she listened Tess, like a\nfascinated bird, could not leave the spot. Far from leaving she drew up\ntowards the performer, keeping behind the hedge that he might not guess\nher presence.\n\nThe outskirt of the garden in which Tess found herself had been left\nuncultivated for some years, and was now damp and rank with juicy grass\nwhich sent up mists of pollen at a touch; and with tall blooming weeds\nemitting offensive smells—weeds whose red and yellow and purple hues\nformed a polychrome as dazzling as that of cultivated flowers. She went\nstealthily as a cat through this profusion of growth, gathering\ncuckoo-spittle on her skirts, cracking snails that were underfoot,\nstaining her hands with thistle-milk and slug-slime, and rubbing off\nupon her naked arms sticky blights which, though snow-white on the\napple-tree trunks, made madder stains on her skin; thus she drew quite\nnear to Clare, still unobserved of him.\n\nTess was conscious of neither time nor space. The exaltation which she\nhad described as being producible at will by gazing at a star came now\nwithout any determination of hers; she undulated upon the thin notes of\nthe second-hand harp, and their harmonies passed like breezes through\nher, bringing tears into her eyes. The floating pollen seemed to be his\nnotes made visible, and the dampness of the garden the weeping of the\ngarden’s sensibility. Though near nightfall, the rank-smelling\nweed-flowers glowed as if they would not close for intentness, and the\nwaves of colour mixed with the waves of sound.\n\nThe light which still shone was derived mainly from a large hole in the\nwestern bank of cloud; it was like a piece of day left behind by\naccident, dusk having closed in elsewhere. He concluded his plaintive\nmelody, a very simple performance, demanding no great skill; and she\nwaited, thinking another might be begun. But, tired of playing, he had\ndesultorily come round the fence, and was rambling up behind her. Tess,\nher cheeks on fire, moved away furtively, as if hardly moving at all.\n\nAngel, however, saw her light summer gown, and he spoke; his low tones\nreaching her, though he was some distance off.\n\n“What makes you draw off in that way, Tess?” said he. “Are you afraid?”\n\n“Oh no, sir—not of outdoor things; especially just now when the\napple-blooth is falling, and everything is so green.”\n\n“But you have your indoor fears—eh?”\n\n“Well—yes, sir.”\n\n“What of?”\n\n“I couldn’t quite say.”\n\n“The milk turning sour?”\n\n“No.”\n\n“Life in general?”\n\n“Yes, sir.”\n\n“Ah—so have I, very often. This hobble of being alive is rather\nserious, don’t you think so?”\n\n“It is—now you put it that way.”\n\n“All the same, I shouldn’t have expected a young girl like you to see\nit so just yet. How is it you do?”\n\nShe maintained a hesitating silence.\n\n“Come, Tess, tell me in confidence.”\n\nShe thought that he meant what were the aspects of things to her, and\nreplied shyly—\n\n“The trees have inquisitive eyes, haven’t they?—that is, seem as if\nthey had. And the river says,—‘Why do ye trouble me with your looks?’\nAnd you seem to see numbers of to-morrows just all in a line, the first\nof them the biggest and clearest, the others getting smaller and\nsmaller as they stand farther away; but they all seem very fierce and\ncruel and as if they said, ‘I’m coming! Beware of me! Beware of me!’\n... But _you_, sir, can raise up dreams with your music, and drive all\nsuch horrid fancies away!”\n\nHe was surprised to find this young woman—who though but a milkmaid had\njust that touch of rarity about her which might make her the envied of\nher housemates—shaping such sad imaginings. She was expressing in her\nown native phrases—assisted a little by her Sixth Standard\ntraining—feelings which might almost have been called those of the\nage—the ache of modernism. The perception arrested him less when he\nreflected that what are called advanced ideas are really in great part\nbut the latest fashion in definition—a more accurate expression, by\nwords in _logy_ and _ism_, of sensations which men and women have\nvaguely grasped for centuries.\n\nStill, it was strange that they should have come to her while yet so\nyoung; more than strange; it was impressive, interesting, pathetic. Not\nguessing the cause, there was nothing to remind him that experience is\nas to intensity, and not as to duration. Tess’s passing corporeal\nblight had been her mental harvest.\n\nTess, on her part, could not understand why a man of clerical family\nand good education, and above physical want, should look upon it as a\nmishap to be alive. For the unhappy pilgrim herself there was very good\nreason. But how could this admirable and poetic man ever have descended\ninto the Valley of Humiliation, have felt with the man of Uz—as she\nherself had felt two or three years ago—“My soul chooseth strangling\nand death rather than my life. I loathe it; I would not live alway.”\n\nIt was true that he was at present out of his class. But she knew that\nwas only because, like Peter the Great in a shipwright’s yard, he was\nstudying what he wanted to know. He did not milk cows because he was\nobliged to milk cows, but because he was learning to be a rich and\nprosperous dairyman, landowner, agriculturist, and breeder of cattle.\nHe would become an American or Australian Abraham, commanding like a\nmonarch his flocks and his herds, his spotted and his ring-straked, his\nmen-servants and his maids. At times, nevertheless, it did seem\nunaccountable to her that a decidedly bookish, musical, thinking young\nman should have chosen deliberately to be a farmer, and not a\nclergyman, like his father and brothers.\n\nThus, neither having the clue to the other’s secret, they were\nrespectively puzzled at what each revealed, and awaited new knowledge\nof each other’s character and mood without attempting to pry into each\nother’s history.\n\nEvery day, every hour, brought to him one more little stroke of her\nnature, and to her one more of his. Tess was trying to lead a repressed\nlife, but she little divined the strength of her own vitality.\n\nAt first Tess seemed to regard Angel Clare as an intelligence rather\nthan as a man. As such she compared him with herself; and at every\ndiscovery of the abundance of his illuminations, of the distance\nbetween her own modest mental standpoint and the unmeasurable, Andean\naltitude of his, she became quite dejected, disheartened from all\nfurther effort on her own part whatever.\n\nHe observed her dejection one day, when he had casually mentioned\nsomething to her about pastoral life in ancient Greece. She was\ngathering the buds called “lords and ladies” from the bank while he\nspoke.\n\n“Why do you look so woebegone all of a sudden?” he asked.\n\n“Oh, ’tis only—about my own self,” she said, with a frail laugh of\nsadness, fitfully beginning to peel “a lady” meanwhile. “Just a sense\nof what might have been with me! My life looks as if it had been wasted\nfor want of chances! When I see what you know, what you have read, and\nseen, and thought, I feel what a nothing I am! I’m like the poor Queen\nof Sheba who lived in the Bible. There is no more spirit in me.”\n\n“Bless my soul, don’t go troubling about that! Why,” he said with some\nenthusiasm, “I should be only too glad, my dear Tess, to help you to\nanything in the way of history, or any line of reading you would like\nto take up—”\n\n“It is a lady again,” interrupted she, holding out the bud she had\npeeled.\n\n“What?”\n\n“I meant that there are always more ladies than lords when you come to\npeel them.”\n\n“Never mind about the lords and ladies. Would you like to take up any\ncourse of study—history, for example?”\n\n“Sometimes I feel I don’t want to know anything more about it than I\nknow already.”\n\n“Why not?”\n\n“Because what’s the use of learning that I am one of a long row\nonly—finding out that there is set down in some old book somebody just\nlike me, and to know that I shall only act her part; making me sad,\nthat’s all. The best is not to remember that your nature and your past\ndoings have been just like thousands’ and thousands’, and that your\ncoming life and doings ’ll be like thousands’ and thousands’.”\n\n“What, really, then, you don’t want to learn anything?”\n\n“I shouldn’t mind learning why—why the sun do shine on the just and the\nunjust alike,” she answered, with a slight quaver in her voice. “But\nthat’s what books will not tell me.”\n\n“Tess, fie for such bitterness!” Of course he spoke with a conventional\nsense of duty only, for that sort of wondering had not been unknown to\nhimself in bygone days. And as he looked at the unpracticed mouth and\nlips, he thought that such a daughter of the soil could only have\ncaught up the sentiment by rote. She went on peeling the lords and\nladies till Clare, regarding for a moment the wave-like curl of her\nlashes as they dropped with her bent gaze on her soft cheek,\nlingeringly went away. When he was gone she stood awhile, thoughtfully\npeeling the last bud; and then, awakening from her reverie, flung it\nand all the crowd of floral nobility impatiently on the ground, in an\nebullition of displeasure with herself for her _niaiseries_, and with a\nquickening warmth in her heart of hearts.\n\nHow stupid he must think her! In an access of hunger for his good\nopinion she bethought herself of what she had latterly endeavoured to\nforget, so unpleasant had been its issues—the identity of her family\nwith that of the knightly d’Urbervilles. Barren attribute as it was,\ndisastrous as its discovery had been in many ways to her, perhaps Mr\nClare, as a gentleman and a student of history, would respect her\nsufficiently to forget her childish conduct with the lords and ladies\nif he knew that those Purbeck-marble and alabaster people in Kingsbere\nChurch really represented her own lineal forefathers; that she was no\nspurious d’Urberville, compounded of money and ambition like those at\nTrantridge, but true d’Urberville to the bone.\n\nBut, before venturing to make the revelation, dubious Tess indirectly\nsounded the dairyman as to its possible effect upon Mr Clare, by asking\nthe former if Mr Clare had any great respect for old county families\nwhen they had lost all their money and land.\n\n“Mr Clare,” said the dairyman emphatically, “is one of the most\nrebellest rozums you ever knowed—not a bit like the rest of his family;\nand if there’s one thing that he do hate more than another ’tis the\nnotion of what’s called a’ old family. He says that it stands to reason\nthat old families have done their spurt of work in past days, and can’t\nhave anything left in ’em now. There’s the Billets and the Drenkhards\nand the Greys and the St Quintins and the Hardys and the Goulds, who\nused to own the lands for miles down this valley; you could buy ’em all\nup now for an old song a’most. Why, our little Retty Priddle here, you\nknow, is one of the Paridelles—the old family that used to own lots o’\nthe lands out by King’s Hintock, now owned by the Earl o’ Wessex, afore\neven he or his was heard of. Well, Mr Clare found this out, and spoke\nquite scornful to the poor girl for days. ‘Ah!’ he says to her, ‘you’ll\nnever make a good dairymaid! All your skill was used up ages ago in\nPalestine, and you must lie fallow for a thousand years to git strength\nfor more deeds!’ A boy came here t’other day asking for a job, and said\nhis name was Matt, and when we asked him his surname he said he’d never\nheard that ’a had any surname, and when we asked why, he said he\nsupposed his folks hadn’t been ’stablished long enough. ‘Ah! you’re the\nvery boy I want!’ says Mr Clare, jumping up and shaking hands wi’en;\n‘I’ve great hopes of you;’ and gave him half-a-crown. O no! he can’t\nstomach old families!”\n\nAfter hearing this caricature of Clare’s opinion poor Tess was glad\nthat she had not said a word in a weak moment about her family—even\nthough it was so unusually old almost to have gone round the circle and\nbecome a new one. Besides, another diary-girl was as good as she, it\nseemed, in that respect. She held her tongue about the d’Urberville\nvault and the Knight of the Conqueror whose name she bore. The insight\nafforded into Clare’s character suggested to her that it was largely\nowing to her supposed untraditional newness that she had won interest\nin his eyes.\n\n\nXX\n\nThe season developed and matured. Another year’s instalment of flowers,\nleaves, nightingales, thrushes, finches, and such ephemeral creatures,\ntook up their positions where only a year ago others had stood in their\nplace when these were nothing more than germs and inorganic particles.\nRays from the sunrise drew forth the buds and stretched them into long\nstalks, lifted up sap in noiseless streams, opened petals, and sucked\nout scents in invisible jets and breathings.\n\nDairyman Crick’s household of maids and men lived on comfortably,\nplacidly, even merrily. Their position was perhaps the happiest of all\npositions in the social scale, being above the line at which neediness\nends, and below the line at which the _convenances_ begin to cramp\nnatural feelings, and the stress of threadbare modishness makes too\nlittle of enough.\n\nThus passed the leafy time when arborescence seems to be the one thing\naimed at out of doors. Tess and Clare unconsciously studied each other,\never balanced on the edge of a passion, yet apparently keeping out of\nit. All the while they were converging, under an irresistible law, as\nsurely as two streams in one vale.\n\nTess had never in her recent life been so happy as she was now,\npossibly never would be so happy again. She was, for one thing,\nphysically and mentally suited among these new surroundings. The\nsapling which had rooted down to a poisonous stratum on the spot of its\nsowing had been transplanted to a deeper soil. Moreover she, and Clare\nalso, stood as yet on the debatable land between predilection and love;\nwhere no profundities have been reached; no reflections have set in,\nawkwardly inquiring, “Whither does this new current tend to carry me?\nWhat does it mean to my future? How does it stand towards my past?”\n\nTess was the merest stray phenomenon to Angel Clare as yet—a rosy,\nwarming apparition which had only just acquired the attribute of\npersistence in his consciousness. So he allowed his mind to be occupied\nwith her, deeming his preoccupation to be no more than a philosopher’s\nregard of an exceedingly novel, fresh, and interesting specimen of\nwomankind.\n\nThey met continually; they could not help it. They met daily in that\nstrange and solemn interval, the twilight of the morning, in the violet\nor pink dawn; for it was necessary to rise early, so very early, here.\nMilking was done betimes; and before the milking came the skimming,\nwhich began at a little past three. It usually fell to the lot of some\none or other of them to wake the rest, the first being aroused by an\nalarm-clock; and, as Tess was the latest arrival, and they soon\ndiscovered that she could be depended upon not to sleep through the\nalarm as others did, this task was thrust most frequently upon her. No\nsooner had the hour of three struck and whizzed, than she left her room\nand ran to the dairyman’s door; then up the ladder to Angel’s, calling\nhim in a loud whisper; then woke her fellow-milkmaids. By the time that\nTess was dressed Clare was downstairs and out in the humid air. The\nremaining maids and the dairyman usually gave themselves another turn\non the pillow, and did not appear till a quarter of an hour later.\n\nThe gray half-tones of daybreak are not the gray half-tones of the\nday’s close, though the degree of their shade may be the same. In the\ntwilight of the morning, light seems active, darkness passive; in the\ntwilight of evening it is the darkness which is active and crescent,\nand the light which is the drowsy reverse.\n\nBeing so often—possibly not always by chance—the first two persons to\nget up at the dairy-house, they seemed to themselves the first persons\nup of all the world. In these early days of her residence here Tess did\nnot skim, but went out of doors at once after rising, where he was\ngenerally awaiting her. The spectral, half-compounded, aqueous light\nwhich pervaded the open mead impressed them with a feeling of\nisolation, as if they were Adam and Eve. At this dim inceptive stage of\nthe day Tess seemed to Clare to exhibit a dignified largeness both of\ndisposition and physique, an almost regnant power, possibly because he\nknew that at that preternatural time hardly any woman so well endowed\nin person as she was likely to be walking in the open air within the\nboundaries of his horizon; very few in all England. Fair women are\nusually asleep at mid-summer dawns. She was close at hand, and the rest\nwere nowhere.\n\nThe mixed, singular, luminous gloom in which they walked along together\nto the spot where the cows lay often made him think of the Resurrection\nhour. He little thought that the Magdalen might be at his side. Whilst\nall the landscape was in neutral shade his companion’s face, which was\nthe focus of his eyes, rising above the mist stratum, seemed to have a\nsort of phosphorescence upon it. She looked ghostly, as if she were\nmerely a soul at large. In reality her face, without appearing to do\nso, had caught the cold gleam of day from the north-east; his own face,\nthough he did not think of it, wore the same aspect to her.\n\nIt was then, as has been said, that she impressed him most deeply. She\nwas no longer the milkmaid, but a visionary essence of woman—a whole\nsex condensed into one typical form. He called her Artemis, Demeter,\nand other fanciful names half teasingly, which she did not like because\nshe did not understand them.\n\n“Call me Tess,” she would say askance; and he did.\n\nThen it would grow lighter, and her features would become simply\nfeminine; they had changed from those of a divinity who could confer\nbliss to those of a being who craved it.\n\nAt these non-human hours they could get quite close to the waterfowl.\nHerons came, with a great bold noise as of opening doors and shutters,\nout of the boughs of a plantation which they frequented at the side of\nthe mead; or, if already on the spot, hardily maintained their standing\nin the water as the pair walked by, watching them by moving their heads\nround in a slow, horizontal, passionless wheel, like the turn of\npuppets by clockwork.\n\nThey could then see the faint summer fogs in layers, woolly, level, and\napparently no thicker than counterpanes, spread about the meadows in\ndetached remnants of small extent. On the gray moisture of the grass\nwere marks where the cows had lain through the night—dark-green islands\nof dry herbage the size of their carcasses, in the general sea of dew.\nFrom each island proceeded a serpentine trail, by which the cow had\nrambled away to feed after getting up, at the end of which trail they\nfound her; the snoring puff from her nostrils, when she recognized\nthem, making an intenser little fog of her own amid the prevailing one.\nThen they drove the animals back to the barton, or sat down to milk\nthem on the spot, as the case might require.\n\nOr perhaps the summer fog was more general, and the meadows lay like a\nwhite sea, out of which the scattered trees rose like dangerous rocks.\nBirds would soar through it into the upper radiance, and hang on the\nwing sunning themselves, or alight on the wet rails subdividing the\nmead, which now shone like glass rods. Minute diamonds of moisture from\nthe mist hung, too, upon Tess’s eyelashes, and drops upon her hair,\nlike seed pearls. When the day grew quite strong and commonplace these\ndried off her; moreover, Tess then lost her strange and ethereal\nbeauty; her teeth, lips, and eyes scintillated in the sunbeams and she\nwas again the dazzlingly fair dairymaid only, who had to hold her own\nagainst the other women of the world.\n\nAbout this time they would hear Dairyman Crick’s voice, lecturing the\nnon-resident milkers for arriving late, and speaking sharply to old\nDeborah Fyander for not washing her hands.\n\n“For Heaven’s sake, pop thy hands under the pump, Deb! Upon my soul, if\nthe London folk only knowed of thee and thy slovenly ways, they’d\nswaller their milk and butter more mincing than they do a’ready; and\nthat’s saying a good deal.”\n\nThe milking progressed, till towards the end Tess and Clare, in common\nwith the rest, could hear the heavy breakfast table dragged out from\nthe wall in the kitchen by Mrs Crick, this being the invariable\npreliminary to each meal; the same horrible scrape accompanying its\nreturn journey when the table had been cleared.\n\n\nXXI\n\nThere was a great stir in the milk-house just after breakfast. The\nchurn revolved as usual, but the butter would not come. Whenever this\nhappened the dairy was paralyzed. Squish, squash echoed the milk in the\ngreat cylinder, but never arose the sound they waited for.\n\nDairyman Crick and his wife, the milkmaids Tess, Marian, Retty Priddle,\nIzz Huett, and the married ones from the cottages; also Mr Clare,\nJonathan Kail, old Deborah, and the rest, stood gazing hopelessly at\nthe churn; and the boy who kept the horse going outside put on\nmoon-like eyes to show his sense of the situation. Even the melancholy\nhorse himself seemed to look in at the window in inquiring despair at\neach walk round.\n\n“’Tis years since I went to Conjuror Trendle’s son in Egdon—years!”\nsaid the dairyman bitterly. “And he was nothing to what his father had\nbeen. I have said fifty times, if I have said once, that I _don’t_\nbelieve in en; though ’a do cast folks’ waters very true. But I shall\nhave to go to ’n if he’s alive. O yes, I shall have to go to ’n, if\nthis sort of thing continnys!”\n\nEven Mr Clare began to feel tragical at the dairyman’s desperation.\n\n“Conjuror Fall, t’other side of Casterbridge, that they used to call\n‘Wide-O’, was a very good man when I was a boy,” said Jonathan Kail.\n“But he’s rotten as touchwood by now.”\n\n“My grandfather used to go to Conjuror Mynterne, out at Owlscombe, and\na clever man a’ were, so I’ve heard grandf’er say,” continued Mr Crick.\n“But there’s no such genuine folk about nowadays!”\n\nMrs Crick’s mind kept nearer to the matter in hand.\n\n“Perhaps somebody in the house is in love,” she said tentatively. “I’ve\nheard tell in my younger days that that will cause it. Why, Crick—that\nmaid we had years ago, do ye mind, and how the butter didn’t come\nthen—”\n\n“Ah yes, yes!—but that isn’t the rights o’t. It had nothing to do with\nthe love-making. I can mind all about it—’twas the damage to the\nchurn.”\n\nHe turned to Clare.\n\n“Jack Dollop, a ’hore’s-bird of a fellow we had here as milker at one\ntime, sir, courted a young woman over at Mellstock, and deceived her as\nhe had deceived many afore. But he had another sort o’ woman to reckon\nwi’ this time, and it was not the girl herself. One Holy Thursday of\nall days in the almanack, we was here as we mid be now, only there was\nno churning in hand, when we zid the girl’s mother coming up to the\ndoor, wi’ a great brass-mounted umbrella in her hand that would ha’\nfelled an ox, and saying ‘Do Jack Dollop work here?—because I want him!\nI have a big bone to pick with he, I can assure ’n!’ And some way\nbehind her mother walked Jack’s young woman, crying bitterly into her\nhandkercher. ‘O Lard, here’s a time!’ said Jack, looking out o’ winder\nat ’em. ‘She’ll murder me! Where shall I get—where shall I—? Don’t tell\nher where I be!’ And with that he scrambled into the churn through the\ntrap-door, and shut himself inside, just as the young woman’s mother\nbusted into the milk-house. ‘The villain—where is he?’ says she. ‘I’ll\nclaw his face for’n, let me only catch him!’ Well, she hunted about\neverywhere, ballyragging Jack by side and by seam, Jack lying a’most\nstifled inside the churn, and the poor maid—or young woman\nrather—standing at the door crying her eyes out. I shall never forget\nit, never! ’Twould have melted a marble stone! But she couldn’t find\nhim nowhere at all.”\n\nThe dairyman paused, and one or two words of comment came from the\nlisteners.\n\nDairyman Crick’s stories often seemed to be ended when they were not\nreally so, and strangers were betrayed into premature interjections of\nfinality; though old friends knew better. The narrator went on—\n\n“Well, how the old woman should have had the wit to guess it I could\nnever tell, but she found out that he was inside that there churn.\nWithout saying a word she took hold of the winch (it was turned by\nhandpower then), and round she swung him, and Jack began to flop about\ninside. ‘O Lard! stop the churn! let me out!’ says he, popping out his\nhead. ‘I shall be churned into a pummy!’ (He was a cowardly chap in his\nheart, as such men mostly be). ‘Not till ye make amends for ravaging\nher virgin innocence!’ says the old woman. ‘Stop the churn you old\nwitch!’ screams he. ‘You call me old witch, do ye, you deceiver!’ says\nshe, ‘when ye ought to ha’ been calling me mother-law these last five\nmonths!’ And on went the churn, and Jack’s bones rattled round again.\nWell, none of us ventured to interfere; and at last ’a promised to make\nit right wi’ her. ‘Yes—I’ll be as good as my word!’ he said. And so it\nended that day.”\n\nWhile the listeners were smiling their comments there was a quick\nmovement behind their backs, and they looked round. Tess, pale-faced,\nhad gone to the door.\n\n“How warm ’tis to-day!” she said, almost inaudibly.\n\nIt was warm, and none of them connected her withdrawal with the\nreminiscences of the dairyman. He went forward and opened the door for\nher, saying with tender raillery—\n\n“Why, maidy” (he frequently, with unconscious irony, gave her this pet\nname), “the prettiest milker I’ve got in my dairy; you mustn’t get so\nfagged as this at the first breath of summer weather, or we shall be\nfinely put to for want of ’ee by dog-days, shan’t we, Mr Clare?”\n\n“I was faint—and—I think I am better out o’ doors,” she said\nmechanically; and disappeared outside.\n\nFortunately for her the milk in the revolving churn at that moment\nchanged its squashing for a decided flick-flack.\n\n“’Tis coming!” cried Mrs Crick, and the attention of all was called off\nfrom Tess.\n\nThat fair sufferer soon recovered herself externally; but she remained\nmuch depressed all the afternoon. When the evening milking was done she\ndid not care to be with the rest of them, and went out of doors,\nwandering along she knew not whither. She was wretched—O so wretched—at\nthe perception that to her companions the dairyman’s story had been\nrather a humorous narration than otherwise; none of them but herself\nseemed to see the sorrow of it; to a certainty, not one knew how\ncruelly it touched the tender place in her experience. The evening sun\nwas now ugly to her, like a great inflamed wound in the sky. Only a\nsolitary cracked-voice reed-sparrow greeted her from the bushes by the\nriver, in a sad, machine-made tone, resembling that of a past friend\nwhose friendship she had outworn.\n\nIn these long June days the milkmaids, and, indeed, most of the\nhousehold, went to bed at sunset or sooner, the morning work before\nmilking being so early and heavy at a time of full pails. Tess usually\naccompanied her fellows upstairs. To-night, however, she was the first\nto go to their common chamber; and she had dozed when the other girls\ncame in. She saw them undressing in the orange light of the vanished\nsun, which flushed their forms with its colour; she dozed again, but\nshe was reawakened by their voices, and quietly turned her eyes towards\nthem.\n\nNeither of her three chamber-companions had got into bed. They were\nstanding in a group, in their nightgowns, barefooted, at the window,\nthe last red rays of the west still warming their faces and necks and\nthe walls around them. All were watching somebody in the garden with\ndeep interest, their three faces close together: a jovial and round\none, a pale one with dark hair, and a fair one whose tresses were\nauburn.\n\n“Don’t push! You can see as well as I,” said Retty, the auburn-haired\nand youngest girl, without removing her eyes from the window.\n\n“’Tis no use for you to be in love with him any more than me, Retty\nPriddle,” said jolly-faced Marian, the eldest, slily. “His thoughts be\nof other cheeks than thine!”\n\nRetty Priddle still looked, and the others looked again.\n\n“There he is again!” cried Izz Huett, the pale girl with dark damp hair\nand keenly cut lips.\n\n“You needn’t say anything, Izz,” answered Retty. “For I zid you kissing\nhis shade.”\n\n_”What_ did you see her doing?” asked Marian.\n\n“Why—he was standing over the whey-tub to let off the whey, and the\nshade of his face came upon the wall behind, close to Izz, who was\nstanding there filling a vat. She put her mouth against the wall and\nkissed the shade of his mouth; I zid her, though he didn’t.”\n\n“O Izz Huett!” said Marian.\n\nA rosy spot came into the middle of Izz Huett’s cheek.\n\n“Well, there was no harm in it,” she declared, with attempted coolness.\n“And if I be in love wi’en, so is Retty, too; and so be you, Marian,\ncome to that.”\n\nMarian’s full face could not blush past its chronic pinkness.\n\n“I!” she said. “What a tale! Ah, there he is again! Dear eyes—dear\nface—dear Mr Clare!”\n\n“There—you’ve owned it!”\n\n“So have you—so have we all,” said Marian, with the dry frankness of\ncomplete indifference to opinion. “It is silly to pretend otherwise\namongst ourselves, though we need not own it to other folks. I would\njust marry ’n to-morrow!”\n\n“So would I—and more,” murmured Izz Huett.\n\n“And I too,” whispered the more timid Retty.\n\nThe listener grew warm.\n\n“We can’t all marry him,” said Izz.\n\n“We shan’t, either of us; which is worse still,” said the eldest.\n“There he is again!”\n\nThey all three blew him a silent kiss.\n\n“Why?” asked Retty quickly.\n\n“Because he likes Tess Durbeyfield best,” said Marian, lowering her\nvoice. “I have watched him every day, and have found it out.”\n\nThere was a reflective silence.\n\n“But she don’t care anything for ’n?” at length breathed Retty.\n\n“Well—I sometimes think that too.”\n\n“But how silly all this is!” said Izz Huett impatiently. “Of course he\nwon’t marry any one of us, or Tess either—a gentleman’s son, who’s\ngoing to be a great landowner and farmer abroad! More likely to ask us\nto come wi’en as farm-hands at so much a year!”\n\nOne sighed, and another sighed, and Marian’s plump figure sighed\nbiggest of all. Somebody in bed hard by sighed too. Tears came into the\neyes of Retty Priddle, the pretty red-haired youngest—the last bud of\nthe Paridelles, so important in the county annals. They watched\nsilently a little longer, their three faces still close together as\nbefore, and the triple hues of their hair mingling. But the unconscious\nMr Clare had gone indoors, and they saw him no more; and, the shades\nbeginning to deepen, they crept into their beds. In a few minutes they\nheard him ascend the ladder to his own room. Marian was soon snoring,\nbut Izz did not drop into forgetfulness for a long time. Retty Priddle\ncried herself to sleep.\n\nThe deeper-passioned Tess was very far from sleeping even then. This\nconversation was another of the bitter pills she had been obliged to\nswallow that day. Scarce the least feeling of jealousy arose in her\nbreast. For that matter she knew herself to have the preference. Being\nmore finely formed, better educated, and, though the youngest except\nRetty, more woman than either, she perceived that only the slightest\nordinary care was necessary for holding her own in Angel Clare’s heart\nagainst these her candid friends. But the grave question was, ought she\nto do this? There was, to be sure, hardly a ghost of a chance for\neither of them, in a serious sense; but there was, or had been, a\nchance of one or the other inspiring him with a passing fancy for her,\nand enjoying the pleasure of his attentions while he stayed here. Such\nunequal attachments had led to marriage; and she had heard from Mrs\nCrick that Mr Clare had one day asked, in a laughing way, what would be\nthe use of his marrying a fine lady, and all the while ten thousand\nacres of Colonial pasture to feed, and cattle to rear, and corn to\nreap. A farm-woman would be the only sensible kind of wife for him. But\nwhether Mr Clare had spoken seriously or not, why should she, who could\nnever conscientiously allow any man to marry her now, and who had\nreligiously determined that she never would be tempted to do so, draw\noff Mr Clare’s attention from other women, for the brief happiness of\nsunning herself in his eyes while he remained at Talbothays?\n\n\nXXII\n\nThey came downstairs yawning next morning; but skimming and milking\nwere proceeded with as usual, and they went indoors to breakfast.\nDairyman Crick was discovered stamping about the house. He had received\na letter, in which a customer had complained that the butter had a\ntwang.\n\n“And begad, so ’t have!” said the dairyman, who held in his left hand a\nwooden slice on which a lump of butter was stuck. “Yes—taste for\nyourself!”\n\nSeveral of them gathered round him; and Mr Clare tasted, Tess tasted,\nalso the other indoor milkmaids, one or two of the milking-men, and\nlast of all Mrs Crick, who came out from the waiting breakfast-table.\nThere certainly was a twang.\n\nThe dairyman, who had thrown himself into abstraction to better realize\nthe taste, and so divine the particular species of noxious weed to\nwhich it appertained, suddenly exclaimed—\n\n“’Tis garlic! and I thought there wasn’t a blade left in that mead!”\n\nThen all the old hands remembered that a certain dry mead, into which a\nfew of the cows had been admitted of late, had, in years gone by,\nspoilt the butter in the same way. The dairyman had not recognized the\ntaste at that time, and thought the butter bewitched.\n\n“We must overhaul that mead,” he resumed; “this mustn’t continny!”\n\nAll having armed themselves with old pointed knives, they went out\ntogether. As the inimical plant could only be present in very\nmicroscopic dimensions to have escaped ordinary observation, to find it\nseemed rather a hopeless attempt in the stretch of rich grass before\nthem. However, they formed themselves into line, all assisting, owing\nto the importance of the search; the dairyman at the upper end with Mr\nClare, who had volunteered to help; then Tess, Marian, Izz Huett, and\nRetty; then Bill Lewell, Jonathan, and the married dairywomen—Beck\nKnibbs, with her wooly black hair and rolling eyes; and flaxen Frances,\nconsumptive from the winter damps of the water-meads—who lived in their\nrespective cottages.\n\nWith eyes fixed upon the ground they crept slowly across a strip of the\nfield, returning a little further down in such a manner that, when they\nshould have finished, not a single inch of the pasture but would have\nfallen under the eye of some one of them. It was a most tedious\nbusiness, not more than half a dozen shoots of garlic being\ndiscoverable in the whole field; yet such was the herb’s pungency that\nprobably one bite of it by one cow had been sufficient to season the\nwhole dairy’s produce for the day.\n\nDiffering one from another in natures and moods so greatly as they did,\nthey yet formed, bending, a curiously uniform row—automatic, noiseless;\nand an alien observer passing down the neighbouring lane might well\nhave been excused for massing them as “Hodge”. As they crept along,\nstooping low to discern the plant, a soft yellow gleam was reflected\nfrom the buttercups into their shaded faces, giving them an elfish,\nmoonlit aspect, though the sun was pouring upon their backs in all the\nstrength of noon.\n\nAngel Clare, who communistically stuck to his rule of taking part with\nthe rest in everything, glanced up now and then. It was not, of course,\nby accident that he walked next to Tess.\n\n“Well, how are you?” he murmured.\n\n“Very well, thank you, sir,” she replied demurely.\n\nAs they had been discussing a score of personal matters only\nhalf-an-hour before, the introductory style seemed a little\nsuperfluous. But they got no further in speech just then. They crept\nand crept, the hem of her petticoat just touching his gaiter, and his\nelbow sometimes brushing hers. At last the dairyman, who came next,\ncould stand it no longer.\n\n“Upon my soul and body, this here stooping do fairly make my back open\nand shut!” he exclaimed, straightening himself slowly with an\nexcruciated look till quite upright. “And you, maidy Tess, you wasn’t\nwell a day or two ago—this will make your head ache finely! Don’t do\nany more, if you feel fainty; leave the rest to finish it.”\n\nDairyman Crick withdrew, and Tess dropped behind. Mr Clare also stepped\nout of line, and began privateering about for the weed. When she found\nhim near her, her very tension at what she had heard the night before\nmade her the first to speak.\n\n“Don’t they look pretty?” she said.\n\n“Who?”\n\n“Izzy Huett and Retty.”\n\nTess had moodily decided that either of these maidens would make a good\nfarmer’s wife, and that she ought to recommend them, and obscure her\nown wretched charms.\n\n“Pretty? Well, yes—they are pretty girls—fresh looking. I have often\nthought so.”\n\n“Though, poor dears, prettiness won’t last long!”\n\n“O no, unfortunately.”\n\n“They are excellent dairywomen.”\n\n“Yes: though not better than you.”\n\n“They skim better than I.”\n\n“Do they?”\n\nClare remained observing them—not without their observing him.\n\n“She is colouring up,” continued Tess heroically.\n\n“Who?”\n\n“Retty Priddle.”\n\n“Oh! Why it that?”\n\n“Because you are looking at her.”\n\nSelf-sacrificing as her mood might be, Tess could not well go further\nand cry, “Marry one of them, if you really do want a dairywoman and not\na lady; and don’t think of marrying me!” She followed Dairyman Crick,\nand had the mournful satisfaction of seeing that Clare remained behind.\n\nFrom this day she forced herself to take pains to avoid him—never\nallowing herself, as formerly, to remain long in his company, even if\ntheir juxtaposition were purely accidental. She gave the other three\nevery chance.\n\nTess was woman enough to realize from their avowals to herself that\nAngel Clare had the honour of all the dairymaids in his keeping, and\nher perception of his care to avoid compromising the happiness of\neither in the least degree bred a tender respect in Tess for what she\ndeemed, rightly or wrongly, the self-controlling sense of duty shown by\nhim, a quality which she had never expected to find in one of the\nopposite sex, and in the absence of which more than one of the simple\nhearts who were his house-mates might have gone weeping on her\npilgrimage.\n\n\nXXIII\n\nThe hot weather of July had crept upon them unawares, and the\natmosphere of the flat vale hung heavy as an opiate over the\ndairy-folk, the cows, and the trees. Hot steaming rains fell\nfrequently, making the grass where the cows fed yet more rank, and\nhindering the late hay-making in the other meads.\n\nIt was Sunday morning; the milking was done; the outdoor milkers had\ngone home. Tess and the other three were dressing themselves rapidly,\nthe whole bevy having agreed to go together to Mellstock Church, which\nlay some three or four miles distant from the dairy-house. She had now\nbeen two months at Talbothays, and this was her first excursion.\n\nAll the preceding afternoon and night heavy thunderstorms had hissed\ndown upon the meads, and washed some of the hay into the river; but\nthis morning the sun shone out all the more brilliantly for the deluge,\nand the air was balmy and clear.\n\nThe crooked lane leading from their own parish to Mellstock ran along\nthe lowest levels in a portion of its length, and when the girls\nreached the most depressed spot they found that the result of the rain\nhad been to flood the lane over-shoe to a distance of some fifty yards.\nThis would have been no serious hindrance on a week-day; they would\nhave clicked through it in their high pattens and boots quite\nunconcerned; but on this day of vanity, this Sun’s-day, when flesh went\nforth to coquet with flesh while hypocritically affecting business with\nspiritual things; on this occasion for wearing their white stockings\nand thin shoes, and their pink, white, and lilac gowns, on which every\nmud spot would be visible, the pool was an awkward impediment. They\ncould hear the church-bell calling—as yet nearly a mile off.\n\n“Who would have expected such a rise in the river in summer-time!” said\nMarian, from the top of the roadside bank on which they had climbed,\nand were maintaining a precarious footing in the hope of creeping along\nits slope till they were past the pool.\n\n“We can’t get there anyhow, without walking right through it, or else\ngoing round the Turnpike way; and that would make us so very late!”\nsaid Retty, pausing hopelessly.\n\n“And I do colour up so hot, walking into church late, and all the\npeople staring round,” said Marian, “that I hardly cool down again till\nwe get into the That-it-may-please-Thees.”\n\nWhile they stood clinging to the bank they heard a splashing round the\nbend of the road, and presently appeared Angel Clare, advancing along\nthe lane towards them through the water.\n\nFour hearts gave a big throb simultaneously.\n\nHis aspect was probably as un-Sabbatarian a one as a dogmatic parson’s\nson often presented; his attire being his dairy clothes, long wading\nboots, a cabbage-leaf inside his hat to keep his head cool, with a\nthistle-spud to finish him off. “He’s not going to church,” said\nMarian.\n\n“No—I wish he was!” murmured Tess.\n\nAngel, in fact, rightly or wrongly (to adopt the safe phrase of evasive\ncontroversialists), preferred sermons in stones to sermons in churches\nand chapels on fine summer days. This morning, moreover, he had gone\nout to see if the damage to the hay by the flood was considerable or\nnot. On his walk he observed the girls from a long distance, though\nthey had been so occupied with their difficulties of passage as not to\nnotice him. He knew that the water had risen at that spot, and that it\nwould quite check their progress. So he had hastened on, with a dim\nidea of how he could help them—one of them in particular.\n\nThe rosy-cheeked, bright-eyed quartet looked so charming in their light\nsummer attire, clinging to the roadside bank like pigeons on a\nroof-slope, that he stopped a moment to regard them before coming\nclose. Their gauzy skirts had brushed up from the grass innumerable\nflies and butterflies which, unable to escape, remained caged in the\ntransparent tissue as in an aviary. Angel’s eye at last fell upon Tess,\nthe hindmost of the four; she, being full of suppressed laughter at\ntheir dilemma, could not help meeting his glance radiantly.\n\nHe came beneath them in the water, which did not rise over his long\nboots; and stood looking at the entrapped flies and butterflies.\n\n“Are you trying to get to church?” he said to Marian, who was in front,\nincluding the next two in his remark, but avoiding Tess.\n\n“Yes, sir; and ’tis getting late; and my colour do come up so—”\n\n“I’ll carry you through the pool—every Jill of you.”\n\nThe whole four flushed as if one heart beat through them.\n\n“I think you can’t, sir,” said Marian.\n\n“It is the only way for you to get past. Stand still. Nonsense—you are\nnot too heavy! I’d carry you all four together. Now, Marian, attend,”\nhe continued, “and put your arms round my shoulders, so. Now! Hold on.\nThat’s well done.”\n\nMarian had lowered herself upon his arm and shoulder as directed, and\nAngel strode off with her, his slim figure, as viewed from behind,\nlooking like the mere stem to the great nosegay suggested by hers. They\ndisappeared round the curve of the road, and only his sousing footsteps\nand the top ribbon of Marian’s bonnet told where they were. In a few\nminutes he reappeared. Izz Huett was the next in order upon the bank.\n\n“Here he comes,” she murmured, and they could hear that her lips were\ndry with emotion. “And I have to put my arms round his neck and look\ninto his face as Marian did.”\n\n“There’s nothing in that,” said Tess quickly.\n\n“There’s a time for everything,” continued Izz, unheeding. “A time to\nembrace, and a time to refrain from embracing; the first is now going\nto be mine.”\n\n“Fie—it is Scripture, Izz!”\n\n“Yes,” said Izz, “I’ve always a’ ear at church for pretty verses.”\n\nAngel Clare, to whom three-quarters of this performance was a\ncommonplace act of kindness, now approached Izz. She quietly and\ndreamily lowered herself into his arms, and Angel methodically marched\noff with her. When he was heard returning for the third time Retty’s\nthrobbing heart could be almost seen to shake her. He went up to the\nred-haired girl, and while he was seizing her he glanced at Tess. His\nlips could not have pronounced more plainly, “It will soon be you and\nI.” Her comprehension appeared in her face; she could not help it.\nThere was an understanding between them.\n\nPoor little Retty, though by far the lightest weight, was the most\ntroublesome of Clare’s burdens. Marian had been like a sack of meal, a\ndead weight of plumpness under which he has literally staggered. Izz\nhad ridden sensibly and calmly. Retty was a bunch of hysterics.\n\nHowever, he got through with the disquieted creature, deposited her,\nand returned. Tess could see over the hedge the distant three in a\ngroup, standing as he had placed them on the next rising ground. It was\nnow her turn. She was embarrassed to discover that excitement at the\nproximity of Mr Clare’s breath and eyes, which she had contemned in her\ncompanions, was intensified in herself; and as if fearful of betraying\nher secret, she paltered with him at the last moment.\n\n“I may be able to clim’ along the bank perhaps—I can clim’ better than\nthey. You must be so tired, Mr Clare!”\n\n“No, no, Tess,” said he quickly. And almost before she was aware, she\nwas seated in his arms and resting against his shoulder.\n\n“Three Leahs to get one Rachel,” he whispered.\n\n“They are better women than I,” she replied, magnanimously sticking to\nher resolve.\n\n“Not to me,” said Angel.\n\nHe saw her grow warm at this; and they went some steps in silence.\n\n“I hope I am not too heavy?” she said timidly.\n\n“O no. You should lift Marian! Such a lump. You are like an undulating\nbillow warmed by the sun. And all this fluff of muslin about you is the\nfroth.”\n\n“It is very pretty—if I seem like that to you.”\n\n“Do you know that I have undergone three-quarters of this labour\nentirely for the sake of the fourth quarter?”\n\n“No.”\n\n“I did not expect such an event to-day.”\n\n“Nor I... The water came up so sudden.”\n\nThat the rise in the water was what she understood him to refer to, the\nstate of breathing belied. Clare stood still and inclinced his face\ntowards hers.\n\n“O Tessy!” he exclaimed.\n\nThe girl’s cheeks burned to the breeze, and she could not look into his\neyes for her emotion. It reminded Angel that he was somewhat unfairly\ntaking advantage of an accidental position; and he went no further with\nit. No definite words of love had crossed their lips as yet, and\nsuspension at this point was desirable now. However, he walked slowly,\nto make the remainder of the distance as long as possible; but at last\nthey came to the bend, and the rest of their progress was in full view\nof the other three. The dry land was reached, and he set her down.\n\nHer friends were looking with round thoughtful eyes at her and him, and\nshe could see that they had been talking of her. He hastily bade them\nfarewell, and splashed back along the stretch of submerged road.\n\nThe four moved on together as before, till Marian broke the silence by\nsaying—\n\n“No—in all truth; we have no chance against her!” She looked joylessly\nat Tess.\n\n“What do you mean?” asked the latter.\n\n“He likes ’ee best—the very best! We could see it as he brought ’ee. He\nwould have kissed ’ee, if you had encouraged him to do it, ever so\nlittle.”\n\n“No, no,” said she.\n\nThe gaiety with which they had set out had somehow vanished; and yet\nthere was no enmity or malice between them. They were generous young\nsouls; they had been reared in the lonely country nooks where fatalism\nis a strong sentiment, and they did not blame her. Such supplanting was\nto be.\n\nTess’s heart ached. There was no concealing from herself the fact that\nshe loved Angel Clare, perhaps all the more passionately from knowing\nthat the others had also lost their hearts to him. There is contagion\nin this sentiment, especially among women. And yet that same hungry\nnature had fought against this, but too feebly, and the natural result\nhad followed.\n\n“I will never stand in your way, nor in the way of either of you!” she\ndeclared to Retty that night in the bedroom (her tears running down).\n“I can’t help this, my dear! I don’t think marrying is in his mind at\nall; but if he were ever to ask me I should refuse him, as I should\nrefuse any man.”\n\n“Oh! would you? Why?” said wondering Retty.\n\n“It cannot be! But I will be plain. Putting myself quite on one side, I\ndon’t think he will choose either of you.”\n\n“I have never expected it—thought of it!” moaned Retty. “But O! I wish\nI was dead!”\n\nThe poor child, torn by a feeling which she hardly understood, turned\nto the other two girls who came upstairs just then.\n\n“We be friends with her again,” she said to them. “She thinks no more\nof his choosing her than we do.”\n\nSo the reserve went off, and they were confiding and warm.\n\n“I don’t seem to care what I do now,” said Marian, whose mood was\nturned to its lowest bass. “I was going to marry a dairyman at\nStickleford, who’s asked me twice; but—my soul—I would put an end to\nmyself rather’n be his wife now! Why don’t ye speak, Izz?”\n\n“To confess, then,” murmured Izz, “I made sure to-day that he was going\nto kiss me as he held me; and I lay still against his breast, hoping\nand hoping, and never moved at all. But he did not. I don’t like biding\nhere at Talbothays any longer! I shall go hwome.”\n\nThe air of the sleeping-chamber seemed to palpitate with the hopeless\npassion of the girls. They writhed feverishly under the oppressiveness\nof an emotion thrust on them by cruel Nature’s law—an emotion which\nthey had neither expected nor desired. The incident of the day had\nfanned the flame that was burning the inside of their hearts out, and\nthe torture was almost more than they could endure. The differences\nwhich distinguished them as individuals were abstracted by this\npassion, and each was but portion of one organism called sex. There was\nso much frankness and so little jealousy because there was no hope.\nEach one was a girl of fair common sense, and she did not delude\nherself with any vain conceits, or deny her love, or give herself airs,\nin the idea of outshining the others. The full recognition of the\nfutility of their infatuation, from a social point of view; its\npurposeless beginning; its self-bounded outlook; its lack of everything\nto justify its existence in the eye of civilization (while lacking\nnothing in the eye of Nature); the one fact that it did exist,\necstasizing them to a killing joy—all this imparted to them a\nresignation, a dignity, which a practical and sordid expectation of\nwinning him as a husband would have destroyed.\n\nThey tossed and turned on their little beds, and the cheese-wring\ndripped monotonously downstairs.\n\n“B’ you awake, Tess?” whispered one, half-an-hour later.\n\nIt was Izz Huett’s voice.\n\nTess replied in the affirmative, whereupon also Retty and Marian\nsuddenly flung the bedclothes off them, and sighed—\n\n“So be we!”\n\n“I wonder what she is like—the lady they say his family have looked out\nfor him!”\n\n“I wonder,” said Izz.\n\n“Some lady looked out for him?” gasped Tess, starting. “I have never\nheard o’ that!”\n\n“O yes—’tis whispered; a young lady of his own rank, chosen by his\nfamily; a Doctor of Divinity’s daughter near his father’s parish of\nEmminster; he don’t much care for her, they say. But he is sure to\nmarry her.”\n\nThey had heard so very little of this; yet it was enough to build up\nwretched dolorous dreams upon, there in the shade of the night. They\npictured all the details of his being won round to consent, of the\nwedding preparations, of the bride’s happiness, of her dress and veil,\nof her blissful home with him, when oblivion would have fallen upon\nthemselves as far as he and their love were concerned. Thus they\ntalked, and ached, and wept till sleep charmed their sorrow away.\n\nAfter this disclosure Tess nourished no further foolish thought that\nthere lurked any grave and deliberate import in Clare’s attentions to\nher. It was a passing summer love of her face, for love’s own temporary\nsake—nothing more. And the thorny crown of this sad conception was that\nshe whom he really did prefer in a cursory way to the rest, she who\nknew herself to be more impassioned in nature, cleverer, more beautiful\nthan they, was in the eyes of propriety far less worthy of him than the\nhomelier ones whom he ignored.\n\n\nXXIV\n\nAmid the oozing fatness and warm ferments of the Froom Vale, at a\nseason when the rush of juices could almost be heard below the hiss of\nfertilization, it was impossible that the most fanciful love should not\ngrow passionate. The ready bosoms existing there were impregnated by\ntheir surroundings.\n\nJuly passed over their heads, and the Thermidorean weather which came\nin its wake seemed an effort on the part of Nature to match the state\nof hearts at Talbothays Dairy. The air of the place, so fresh in the\nspring and early summer, was stagnant and enervating now. Its heavy\nscents weighed upon them, and at mid-day the landscape seemed lying in\na swoon. Ethiopic scorchings browned the upper slopes of the pastures,\nbut there was still bright green herbage here where the watercourses\npurled. And as Clare was oppressed by the outward heats, so was he\nburdened inwardly by waxing fervour of passion for the soft and silent\nTess.\n\nThe rains having passed, the uplands were dry. The wheels of the\ndairyman’s spring-cart, as he sped home from market, licked up the\npulverized surface of the highway, and were followed by white ribands\nof dust, as if they had set a thin powder-train on fire. The cows\njumped wildly over the five-barred barton-gate, maddened by the\ngad-fly; Dairyman Crick kept his shirt-sleeves permanently rolled up\nfrom Monday to Saturday; open windows had no effect in ventilation\nwithout open doors, and in the dairy-garden the blackbirds and thrushes\ncrept about under the currant-bushes, rather in the manner of\nquadrupeds than of winged creatures. The flies in the kitchen were\nlazy, teasing, and familiar, crawling about in the unwonted places, on\nthe floors, into drawers, and over the backs of the milkmaids’ hands.\nConversations were concerning sunstroke; while butter-making, and still\nmore butter-keeping, was a despair.\n\nThey milked entirely in the meads for coolness and convenience, without\ndriving in the cows. During the day the animals obsequiously followed\nthe shadow of the smallest tree as it moved round the stem with the\ndiurnal roll; and when the milkers came they could hardly stand still\nfor the flies.\n\nOn one of these afternoons four or five unmilked cows chanced to stand\napart from the general herd, behind the corner of a hedge, among them\nbeing Dumpling and Old Pretty, who loved Tess’s hands above those of\nany other maid. When she rose from her stool under a finished cow,\nAngel Clare, who had been observing her for some time, asked her if she\nwould take the aforesaid creatures next. She silently assented, and\nwith her stool at arm’s length, and the pail against her knee, went\nround to where they stood. Soon the sound of Old Pretty’s milk fizzing\ninto the pail came through the hedge, and then Angel felt inclined to\ngo round the corner also, to finish off a hard-yielding milcher who had\nstrayed there, he being now as capable of this as the dairyman himself.\n\nAll the men, and some of the women, when milking, dug their foreheads\ninto the cows and gazed into the pail. But a few—mainly the younger\nones—rested their heads sideways. This was Tess Durbeyfield’s habit,\nher temple pressing the milcher’s flank, her eyes fixed on the far end\nof the meadow with the quiet of one lost in meditation. She was milking\nOld Pretty thus, and the sun chancing to be on the milking-side, it\nshone flat upon her pink-gowned form and her white curtain-bonnet, and\nupon her profile, rendering it keen as a cameo cut from the dun\nbackground of the cow.\n\nShe did not know that Clare had followed her round, and that he sat\nunder his cow watching her. The stillness of her head and features was\nremarkable: she might have been in a trance, her eyes open, yet\nunseeing. Nothing in the picture moved but Old Pretty’s tail and Tess’s\npink hands, the latter so gently as to be a rhythmic pulsation only, as\nif they were obeying a reflex stimulus, like a beating heart.\n\nHow very lovable her face was to him. Yet there was nothing ethereal\nabout it; all was real vitality, real warmth, real incarnation. And it\nwas in her mouth that this culminated. Eyes almost as deep and speaking\nhe had seen before, and cheeks perhaps as fair; brows as arched, a chin\nand throat almost as shapely; her mouth he had seen nothing to equal on\nthe face of the earth. To a young man with the least fire in him that\nlittle upward lift in the middle of her red top lip was distracting,\ninfatuating, maddening. He had never before seen a woman’s lips and\nteeth which forced upon his mind with such persistent iteration the old\nElizabethan simile of roses filled with snow. Perfect, he, as a lover,\nmight have called them off-hand. But no—they were not perfect. And it\nwas the touch of the imperfect upon the would-be perfect that gave the\nsweetness, because it was that which gave the humanity.\n\nClare had studied the curves of those lips so many times that he could\nreproduce them mentally with ease: and now, as they again confronted\nhim, clothed with colour and life, they sent an _aura_ over his flesh,\na breeze through his nerves, which well nigh produced a qualm; and\nactually produced, by some mysterious physiological process, a prosaic\nsneeze.\n\nShe then became conscious that he was observing her; but she would not\nshow it by any change of position, though the curious dream-like fixity\ndisappeared, and a close eye might easily have discerned that the\nrosiness of her face deepened, and then faded till only a tinge of it\nwas left.\n\nThe influence that had passed into Clare like an excitation from the\nsky did not die down. Resolutions, reticences, prudences, fears, fell\nback like a defeated battalion. He jumped up from his seat, and,\nleaving his pail to be kicked over if the milcher had such a mind, went\nquickly towards the desire of his eyes, and, kneeling down beside her,\nclasped her in his arms.\n\nTess was taken completely by surprise, and she yielded to his embrace\nwith unreflecting inevitableness. Having seen that it was really her\nlover who had advanced, and no one else, her lips parted, and she sank\nupon him in her momentary joy, with something very like an ecstatic\ncry.\n\nHe had been on the point of kissing that too tempting mouth, but he\nchecked himself, for tender conscience’ sake.\n\n“Forgive me, Tess dear!” he whispered. “I ought to have asked. I—did\nnot know what I was doing. I do not mean it as a liberty. I am devoted\nto you, Tessy, dearest, in all sincerity!”\n\nOld Pretty by this time had looked round, puzzled; and seeing two\npeople crouching under her where, by immemorial custom, there should\nhave been only one, lifted her hind leg crossly.\n\n“She is angry—she doesn’t know what we mean—she’ll kick over the milk!”\nexclaimed Tess, gently striving to free herself, her eyes concerned\nwith the quadruped’s actions, her heart more deeply concerned with\nherself and Clare.\n\nShe slipped up from her seat, and they stood together, his arm still\nencircling her. Tess’s eyes, fixed on distance, began to fill.\n\n“Why do you cry, my darling?” he said.\n\n“O—I don’t know!” she murmured.\n\nAs she saw and felt more clearly the position she was in she became\nagitated and tried to withdraw.\n\n“Well, I have betrayed my feeling, Tess, at last,” said he, with a\ncurious sigh of desperation, signifying unconsciously that his heart\nhad outrun his judgement. “That I—love you dearly and truly I need not\nsay. But I—it shall go no further now—it distresses you—I am as\nsurprised as you are. You will not think I have presumed upon your\ndefencelessness—been too quick and unreflecting, will you?”\n\n“N’—I can’t tell.”\n\nHe had allowed her to free herself; and in a minute or two the milking\nof each was resumed. Nobody had beheld the gravitation of the two into\none; and when the dairyman came round by that screened nook a few\nminutes later, there was not a sign to reveal that the markedly\nsundered pair were more to each other than mere acquaintance. Yet in\nthe interval since Crick’s last view of them something had occurred\nwhich changed the pivot of the universe for their two natures;\nsomething which, had he known its quality, the dairyman would have\ndespised, as a practical man; yet which was based upon a more stubborn\nand resistless tendency than a whole heap of so-called practicalities.\nA veil had been whisked aside; the tract of each one’s outlook was to\nhave a new horizon thenceforward—for a short time or for a long.\n\n\nEnd of Phase the Third\n\n\nPhase the Fourth:\n\nThe Consequence\n\n\nXXV\n\nClare, restless, went out into the dusk when evening drew on, she who\nhad won him having retired to her chamber.\n\nThe night was as sultry as the day. There was no coolness after dark\nunless on the grass. Roads, garden-paths, the house-fronts, the\nbarton-walls were warm as hearths, and reflected the noontime\ntemperature into the noctambulist’s face.\n\nHe sat on the east gate of the dairy-yard, and knew not what to think\nof himself. Feeling had indeed smothered judgement that day.\n\nSince the sudden embrace, three hours before, the twain had kept apart.\nShe seemed stilled, almost alarmed, at what had occurred, while the\nnovelty, unpremeditation, mastery of circumstance disquieted\nhim—palpitating, contemplative being that he was. He could hardly\nrealize their true relations to each other as yet, and what their\nmutual bearing should be before third parties thenceforward.\n\nAngel had come as pupil to this dairy in the idea that his temporary\nexistence here was to be the merest episode in his life, soon passed\nthrough and early forgotten; he had come as to a place from which as\nfrom a screened alcove he could calmly view the absorbing world\nwithout, and, apostrophizing it with Walt Whitman—\n\n    Crowds of men and women attired in the usual costumes,\n    How curious you are to me!—\n\nresolve upon a plan for plunging into that world anew. But behold, the\nabsorbing scene had been imported hither. What had been the engrossing\nworld had dissolved into an uninteresting outer dumb-show; while here,\nin this apparently dim and unimpassioned place, novelty had\nvolcanically started up, as it had never, for him, started up\nelsewhere.\n\nEvery window of the house being open, Clare could hear across the yard\neach trivial sound of the retiring household. The dairy-house, so\nhumble, so insignificant, so purely to him a place of constrained\nsojourn that he had never hitherto deemed it of sufficient importance\nto be reconnoitred as an object of any quality whatever in the\nlandscape; what was it now? The aged and lichened brick gables breathed\nforth “Stay!” The windows smiled, the door coaxed and beckoned, the\ncreeper blushed confederacy. A personality within it was so\nfar-reaching in her influence as to spread into and make the bricks,\nmortar, and whole overhanging sky throb with a burning sensibility.\nWhose was this mighty personality? A milkmaid’s.\n\nIt was amazing, indeed, to find how great a matter the life of the\nobscure dairy had become to him. And though new love was to be held\npartly responsible for this, it was not solely so. Many besides Angel\nhave learnt that the magnitude of lives is not as to their external\ndisplacements, but as to their subjective experiences. The\nimpressionable peasant leads a larger, fuller, more dramatic life than\nthe pachydermatous king. Looking at it thus, he found that life was to\nbe seen of the same magnitude here as elsewhere.\n\nDespite his heterodoxy, faults, and weaknesses, Clare was a man with a\nconscience. Tess was no insignificant creature to toy with and dismiss;\nbut a woman living her precious life—a life which, to herself who\nendured or enjoyed it, possessed as great a dimension as the life of\nthe mightiest to himself. Upon her sensations the whole world depended\nto Tess; through her existence all her fellow-creatures existed, to\nher. The universe itself only came into being for Tess on the\nparticular day in the particular year in which she was born.\n\nThis consciousness upon which he had intruded was the single\nopportunity of existence ever vouchsafed to Tess by an unsympathetic\nFirst Cause—her all; her every and only chance. How then should he look\nupon her as of less consequence than himself; as a pretty trifle to\ncaress and grow weary of; and not deal in the greatest seriousness with\nthe affection which he knew that he had awakened in her—so fervid and\nso impressionable as she was under her reserve—in order that it might\nnot agonize and wreck her?\n\nTo encounter her daily in the accustomed manner would be to develop\nwhat had begun. Living in such close relations, to meet meant to fall\ninto endearment; flesh and blood could not resist it; and, having\narrived at no conclusion as to the issue of such a tendency, he decided\nto hold aloof for the present from occupations in which they would be\nmutually engaged. As yet the harm done was small.\n\nBut it was not easy to carry out the resolution never to approach her.\nHe was driven towards her by every heave of his pulse.\n\nHe thought he would go and see his friends. It might be possible to\nsound them upon this. In less than five months his term here would have\nended, and after a few additional months spent upon other farms he\nwould be fully equipped in agricultural knowledge and in a position to\nstart on his own account. Would not a farmer want a wife, and should a\nfarmer’s wife be a drawing-room wax-figure, or a woman who understood\nfarming? Notwithstanding the pleasing answer returned to him by the\nsilence, he resolved to go his journey.\n\nOne morning when they sat down to breakfast at Talbothays Dairy some\nmaid observed that she had not seen anything of Mr Clare that day.\n\n“O no,” said Dairyman Crick. “Mr Clare has gone hwome to Emminster to\nspend a few days wi’ his kinsfolk.”\n\nFor four impassioned ones around that table the sunshine of the morning\nwent out at a stroke, and the birds muffled their song. But neither\ngirl by word or gesture revealed her blankness. “He’s getting on\ntowards the end of his time wi’ me,” added the dairyman, with a phlegm\nwhich unconsciously was brutal; “and so I suppose he is beginning to\nsee about his plans elsewhere.”\n\n“How much longer is he to bide here?” asked Izz Huett, the only one of\nthe gloom-stricken bevy who could trust her voice with the question.\n\nThe others waited for the dairyman’s answer as if their lives hung upon\nit; Retty, with parted lips, gazing on the tablecloth, Marian with heat\nadded to her redness, Tess throbbing and looking out at the meads.\n\n“Well, I can’t mind the exact day without looking at my\nmemorandum-book,” replied Crick, with the same intolerable unconcern.\n“And even that may be altered a bit. He’ll bide to get a little\npractice in the calving out at the straw-yard, for certain. He’ll hang\non till the end of the year I should say.”\n\nFour months or so of torturing ecstasy in his society—of “pleasure\ngirdled about with pain”. After that the blackness of unutterable\nnight.\n\nAt this moment of the morning Angel Clare was riding along a narrow\nlane ten miles distant from the breakfasters, in the direction of his\nfather’s Vicarage at Emminster, carrying, as well as he could, a little\nbasket which contained some black-puddings and a bottle of mead, sent\nby Mrs Crick, with her kind respects, to his parents. The white lane\nstretched before him, and his eyes were upon it; but they were staring\ninto next year, and not at the lane. He loved her; ought he to marry\nher? Dared he to marry her? What would his mother and his brothers say?\nWhat would he himself say a couple of years after the event? That would\ndepend upon whether the germs of staunch comradeship underlay the\ntemporary emotion, or whether it were a sensuous joy in her form only,\nwith no substratum of everlastingness.\n\nHis father’s hill-surrounded little town, the Tudor church-tower of red\nstone, the clump of trees near the Vicarage, came at last into view\nbeneath him, and he rode down towards the well-known gate. Casting a\nglance in the direction of the church before entering his home, he\nbeheld standing by the vestry-door a group of girls, of ages between\ntwelve and sixteen, apparently awaiting the arrival of some other one,\nwho in a moment became visible; a figure somewhat older than the\nschool-girls, wearing a broad-brimmed hat and highly-starched cambric\nmorning-gown, with a couple of books in her hand.\n\nClare knew her well. He could not be sure that she observed him; he\nhoped she did not, so as to render it unnecessary that he should go and\nspeak to her, blameless creature that she was. An overpowering\nreluctance to greet her made him decide that she had not seen him. The\nyoung lady was Miss Mercy Chant, the only daughter of his father’s\nneighbour and friend, whom it was his parents’ quiet hope that he might\nwed some day. She was great at Antinomianism and Bible-classes, and was\nplainly going to hold a class now. Clare’s mind flew to the\nimpassioned, summer-steeped heathens in the Var Vale, their rosy faces\ncourt-patched with cow-droppings; and to one the most impassioned of\nthem all.\n\nIt was on the impulse of the moment that he had resolved to trot over\nto Emminster, and hence had not written to apprise his mother and\nfather, aiming, however, to arrive about the breakfast hour, before\nthey should have gone out to their parish duties. He was a little late,\nand they had already sat down to the morning meal. The group at the\ntable jumped up to welcome him as soon as he entered. They were his\nfather and mother, his brother the Reverend Felix—curate at a town in\nthe adjoining county, home for the inside of a fortnight—and his other\nbrother, the Reverend Cuthbert, the classical scholar, and Fellow and\nDean of his College, down from Cambridge for the long vacation. His\nmother appeared in a cap and silver spectacles, and his father looked\nwhat in fact he was—an earnest, God-fearing man, somewhat gaunt, in\nyears about sixty-five, his pale face lined with thought and purpose.\nOver their heads hung the picture of Angel’s sister, the eldest of the\nfamily, sixteen years his senior, who had married a missionary and gone\nout to Africa.\n\nOld Mr Clare was a clergyman of a type which, within the last twenty\nyears, has well nigh dropped out of contemporary life. A spiritual\ndescendant in the direct line from Wycliff, Huss, Luther, Calvin; an\nEvangelical of the Evangelicals, a Conversionist, a man of Apostolic\nsimplicity in life and thought, he had in his raw youth made up his\nmind once for all in the deeper questions of existence, and admitted no\nfurther reasoning on them thenceforward. He was regarded even by those\nof his own date and school of thinking as extreme; while, on the other\nhand, those totally opposed to him were unwillingly won to admiration\nfor his thoroughness, and for the remarkable power he showed in\ndismissing all question as to principles in his energy for applying\nthem. He loved Paul of Tarsus, liked St John, hated St James as much as\nhe dared, and regarded with mixed feelings Timothy, Titus, and\nPhilemon. The New Testament was less a Christiad then a Pauliad to his\nintelligence—less an argument than an intoxication. His creed of\ndeterminism was such that it almost amounted to a vice, and quite\namounted, on its negative side, to a renunciative philosophy which had\ncousinship with that of Schopenhauer and Leopardi. He despised the\nCanons and Rubric, swore by the Articles, and deemed himself consistent\nthrough the whole category—which in a way he might have been. One thing\nhe certainly was—sincere.\n\nTo the aesthetic, sensuous, pagan pleasure in natural life and lush\nwomanhood which his son Angel had lately been experiencing in Var Vale,\nhis temper would have been antipathetic in a high degree, had he either\nby inquiry or imagination been able to apprehend it. Once upon a time\nAngel had been so unlucky as to say to his father, in a moment of\nirritation, that it might have resulted far better for mankind if\nGreece had been the source of the religion of modern civilization, and\nnot Palestine; and his father’s grief was of that blank description\nwhich could not realize that there might lurk a thousandth part of a\ntruth, much less a half truth or a whole truth, in such a proposition.\nHe had simply preached austerely at Angel for some time after. But the\nkindness of his heart was such that he never resented anything for\nlong, and welcomed his son to-day with a smile which was as candidly\nsweet as a child’s.\n\nAngel sat down, and the place felt like home; yet he did not so much as\nformerly feel himself one of the family gathered there. Every time that\nhe returned hither he was conscious of this divergence, and since he\nhad last shared in the Vicarage life it had grown even more distinctly\nforeign to his own than usual. Its transcendental aspirations—still\nunconsciously based on the geocentric view of things, a zenithal\nparadise, a nadiral hell—were as foreign to his own as if they had been\nthe dreams of people on another planet. Latterly he had seen only Life,\nfelt only the great passionate pulse of existence, unwarped,\nuncontorted, untrammelled by those creeds which futilely attempt to\ncheck what wisdom would be content to regulate.\n\nOn their part they saw a great difference in him, a growing divergence\nfrom the Angel Clare of former times. It was chiefly a difference in\nhis manner that they noticed just now, particularly his brothers. He\nwas getting to behave like a farmer; he flung his legs about; the\nmuscles of his face had grown more expressive; his eyes looked as much\ninformation as his tongue spoke, and more. The manner of the scholar\nhad nearly disappeared; still more the manner of the drawing-room young\nman. A prig would have said that he had lost culture, and a prude that\nhe had become coarse. Such was the contagion of domiciliary fellowship\nwith the Talbothays nymphs and swains.\n\nAfter breakfast he walked with his two brothers, non-evangelical,\nwell-educated, hall-marked young men, correct to their remotest fibre,\nsuch unimpeachable models as are turned out yearly by the lathe of a\nsystematic tuition. They were both somewhat short-sighted, and when it\nwas the custom to wear a single eyeglass and string they wore a single\neyeglass and string; when it was the custom to wear a double glass they\nwore a double glass; when it was the custom to wear spectacles they\nwore spectacles straightway, all without reference to the particular\nvariety of defect in their own vision. When Wordsworth was enthroned\nthey carried pocket copies; and when Shelley was belittled they allowed\nhim to grow dusty on their shelves. When Correggio’s Holy Families were\nadmired, they admired Correggio’s Holy Families; when he was decried in\nfavour of Velasquez, they sedulously followed suit without any personal\nobjection.\n\nIf these two noticed Angel’s growing social ineptness, he noticed their\ngrowing mental limitations. Felix seemed to him all Church; Cuthbert\nall College. His Diocesan Synod and Visitations were the mainsprings of\nthe world to the one; Cambridge to the other. Each brother candidly\nrecognized that there were a few unimportant score of millions of\noutsiders in civilized society, persons who were neither University men\nnor churchmen; but they were to be tolerated rather than reckoned with\nand respected.\n\nThey were both dutiful and attentive sons, and were regular in their\nvisits to their parents. Felix, though an offshoot from a far more\nrecent point in the devolution of theology than his father, was less\nself-sacrificing and disinterested. More tolerant than his father of a\ncontradictory opinion, in its aspect as a danger to its holder, he was\nless ready than his father to pardon it as a slight to his own\nteaching. Cuthbert was, upon the whole, the more liberal-minded,\nthough, with greater subtlety, he had not so much heart.\n\nAs they walked along the hillside Angel’s former feeling revived in\nhim—that whatever their advantages by comparison with himself, neither\nsaw or set forth life as it really was lived. Perhaps, as with many\nmen, their opportunities of observation were not so good as their\nopportunities of expression. Neither had an adequate conception of the\ncomplicated forces at work outside the smooth and gentle current in\nwhich they and their associates floated. Neither saw the difference\nbetween local truth and universal truth; that what the inner world said\nin their clerical and academic hearing was quite a different thing from\nwhat the outer world was thinking.\n\n“I suppose it is farming or nothing for you now, my dear fellow,” Felix\nwas saying, among other things, to his youngest brother, as he looked\nthrough his spectacles at the distant fields with sad austerity. “And,\ntherefore, we must make the best of it. But I do entreat you to\nendeavour to keep as much as possible in touch with moral ideals.\nFarming, of course, means roughing it externally; but high thinking may\ngo with plain living, nevertheless.”\n\n“Of course it may,” said Angel. “Was it not proved nineteen hundred\nyears ago—if I may trespass upon your domain a little? Why should you\nthink, Felix, that I am likely to drop my high thinking and my moral\nideals?”\n\n“Well, I fancied, from the tone of your letters and our conversation—it\nmay be fancy only—that you were somehow losing intellectual grasp.\nHasn’t it struck you, Cuthbert?”\n\n“Now, Felix,” said Angel drily, “we are very good friends, you know;\neach of us treading our allotted circles; but if it comes to\nintellectual grasp, I think you, as a contented dogmatist, had better\nleave mine alone, and inquire what has become of yours.”\n\nThey returned down the hill to dinner, which was fixed at any time at\nwhich their father’s and mother’s morning work in the parish usually\nconcluded. Convenience as regarded afternoon callers was the last thing\nto enter into the consideration of unselfish Mr and Mrs Clare; though\nthe three sons were sufficiently in unison on this matter to wish that\ntheir parents would conform a little to modern notions.\n\nThe walk had made them hungry, Angel in particular, who was now an\noutdoor man, accustomed to the profuse _dapes inemptae_ of the\ndairyman’s somewhat coarsely-laden table. But neither of the old people\nhad arrived, and it was not till the sons were almost tired of waiting\nthat their parents entered. The self-denying pair had been occupied in\ncoaxing the appetites of some of their sick parishioners, whom they,\nsomewhat inconsistently, tried to keep imprisoned in the flesh, their\nown appetites being quite forgotten.\n\nThe family sat down to table, and a frugal meal of cold viands was\ndeposited before them. Angel looked round for Mrs Crick’s\nblack-puddings, which he had directed to be nicely grilled as they did\nthem at the dairy, and of which he wished his father and mother to\nappreciate the marvellous herbal savours as highly as he did himself.\n\n“Ah! you are looking for the black-puddings, my dear boy,” observed\nClare’s mother. “But I am sure you will not mind doing without them as\nI am sure your father and I shall not, when you know the reason. I\nsuggested to him that we should take Mrs Crick’s kind present to the\nchildren of the man who can earn nothing just now because of his\nattacks of delirium tremens; and he agreed that it would be a great\npleasure to them; so we did.”\n\n“Of course,” said Angel cheerfully, looking round for the mead.\n\n“I found the mead so extremely alcoholic,” continued his mother, “that\nit was quite unfit for use as a beverage, but as valuable as rum or\nbrandy in an emergency; so I have put it in my medicine-closet.”\n\n“We never drink spirits at this table, on principle,” added his father.\n\n“But what shall I tell the dairyman’s wife?” said Angel.\n\n“The truth, of course,” said his father.\n\n“I rather wanted to say we enjoyed the mead and the black-puddings very\nmuch. She is a kind, jolly sort of body, and is sure to ask me directly\nI return.”\n\n“You cannot, if we did not,” Mr Clare answered lucidly.\n\n“Ah—no; though that mead was a drop of pretty tipple.”\n\n“A what?” said Cuthbert and Felix both.\n\n“Oh—’tis an expression they use down at Talbothays,” replied Angel,\nblushing. He felt that his parents were right in their practice if\nwrong in their want of sentiment, and said no more.\n\n\nXXVI\n\nIt was not till the evening, after family prayers, that Angel found\nopportunity of broaching to his father one or two subjects near his\nheart. He had strung himself up to the purpose while kneeling behind\nhis brothers on the carpet, studying the little nails in the heels of\ntheir walking boots. When the service was over they went out of the\nroom with their mother, and Mr Clare and himself were left alone.\n\nThe young man first discussed with the elder his plans for the\nattainment of his position as a farmer on an extensive scale—either in\nEngland or in the Colonies. His father then told him that, as he had\nnot been put to the expense of sending Angel up to Cambridge, he had\nfelt it his duty to set by a sum of money every year towards the\npurchase or lease of land for him some day, that he might not feel\nhimself unduly slighted.\n\n“As far as worldly wealth goes,” continued his father, “you will no\ndoubt stand far superior to your brothers in a few years.”\n\nThis considerateness on old Mr Clare’s part led Angel onward to the\nother and dearer subject. He observed to his father that he was then\nsix-and-twenty, and that when he should start in the farming business\nhe would require eyes in the back of his head to see to all\nmatters—some one would be necessary to superintend the domestic labours\nof his establishment whilst he was afield. Would it not be well,\ntherefore, for him to marry?\n\nHis father seemed to think this idea not unreasonable; and then Angel\nput the question—\n\n“What kind of wife do you think would be best for me as a thrifty\nhard-working farmer?”\n\n“A truly Christian woman, who will be a help and a comfort to you in\nyour goings-out and your comings-in. Beyond that, it really matters\nlittle. Such an one can be found; indeed, my earnest-minded friend and\nneighbour, Dr Chant—”\n\n“But ought she not primarily to be able to milk cows, churn good\nbutter, make immense cheeses; know how to sit hens and turkeys and rear\nchickens, to direct a field of labourers in an emergency, and estimate\nthe value of sheep and calves?”\n\n“Yes; a farmer’s wife; yes, certainly. It would be desirable.” Mr\nClare, the elder, had plainly never thought of these points before. “I\nwas going to add,” he said, “that for a pure and saintly woman you will\nnot find one more to your true advantage, and certainly not more to\nyour mother’s mind and my own, than your friend Mercy, whom you used to\nshow a certain interest in. It is true that my neighbour Chant’s\ndaughter had lately caught up the fashion of the younger clergy round\nabout us for decorating the Communion-table—alter, as I was shocked to\nhear her call it one day—with flowers and other stuff on festival\noccasions. But her father, who is quite as opposed to such flummery as\nI, says that can be cured. It is a mere girlish outbreak which, I am\nsure, will not be permanent.”\n\n“Yes, yes; Mercy is good and devout, I know. But, father, don’t you\nthink that a young woman equally pure and virtuous as Miss Chant, but\none who, in place of that lady’s ecclesiastical accomplishments,\nunderstands the duties of farm life as well as a farmer himself, would\nsuit me infinitely better?”\n\nHis father persisted in his conviction that a knowledge of a farmer’s\nwife’s duties came second to a Pauline view of humanity; and the\nimpulsive Angel, wishing to honour his father’s feelings and to advance\nthe cause of his heart at the same time, grew specious. He said that\nfate or Providence had thrown in his way a woman who possessed every\nqualification to be the helpmate of an agriculturist, and was decidedly\nof a serious turn of mind. He would not say whether or not she had\nattached herself to the sound Low Church School of his father; but she\nwould probably be open to conviction on that point; she was a regular\nchurch-goer of simple faith; honest-hearted, receptive, intelligent,\ngraceful to a degree, chaste as a vestal, and, in personal appearance,\nexceptionally beautiful.\n\n“Is she of a family such as you would care to marry into—a lady, in\nshort?” asked his startled mother, who had come softly into the study\nduring the conversation.\n\n“She is not what in common parlance is called a lady,” said Angel,\nunflinchingly, “for she is a cottager’s daughter, as I am proud to say.\nBut she _is_ a lady, nevertheless—in feeling and nature.”\n\n“Mercy Chant is of a very good family.”\n\n“Pooh!—what’s the advantage of that, mother?” said Angel quickly. “How\nis family to avail the wife of a man who has to rough it as I have, and\nshall have to do?”\n\n“Mercy is accomplished. And accomplishments have their charm,” returned\nhis mother, looking at him through her silver spectacles.\n\n“As to external accomplishments, what will be the use of them in the\nlife I am going to lead?—while as to her reading, I can take that in\nhand. She’ll be apt pupil enough, as you would say if you knew her.\nShe’s brim full of poetry—actualized poetry, if I may use the\nexpression. She _lives_ what paper-poets only write... And she is an\nunimpeachable Christian, I am sure; perhaps of the very tribe, genus,\nand species you desire to propagate.”\n\n“O Angel, you are mocking!”\n\n“Mother, I beg pardon. But as she really does attend Church almost\nevery Sunday morning, and is a good Christian girl, I am sure you will\ntolerate any social shortcomings for the sake of that quality, and feel\nthat I may do worse than choose her.” Angel waxed quite earnest on that\nrather automatic orthodoxy in his beloved Tess which (never dreaming\nthat it might stand him in such good stead) he had been prone to slight\nwhen observing it practised by her and the other milkmaids, because of\nits obvious unreality amid beliefs essentially naturalistic.\n\nIn their sad doubts as to whether their son had himself any right\nwhatever to the title he claimed for the unknown young woman, Mr and\nMrs Clare began to feel it as an advantage not to be overlooked that\nshe at least was sound in her views; especially as the conjunction of\nthe pair must have arisen by an act of Providence; for Angel never\nwould have made orthodoxy a condition of his choice. They said finally\nthat it was better not to act in a hurry, but that they would not\nobject to see her.\n\nAngel therefore refrained from declaring more particulars now. He felt\nthat, single-minded and self-sacrificing as his parents were, there yet\nexisted certain latent prejudices of theirs, as middle-class people,\nwhich it would require some tact to overcome. For though legally at\nliberty to do as he chose, and though their daughter-in-law’s\nqualifications could make no practical difference to their lives, in\nthe probability of her living far away from them, he wished for\naffection’s sake not to wound their sentiment in the most important\ndecision of his life.\n\nHe observed his own inconsistencies in dwelling upon accidents in\nTess’s life as if they were vital features. It was for herself that he\nloved Tess; her soul, her heart, her substance—not for her skill in the\ndairy, her aptness as his scholar, and certainly not for her simple\nformal faith-professions. Her unsophisticated open-air existence\nrequired no varnish of conventionality to make it palatable to him. He\nheld that education had as yet but little affected the beats of emotion\nand impulse on which domestic happiness depends. It was probable that,\nin the lapse of ages, improved systems of moral and intellectual\ntraining would appreciably, perhaps considerably, elevate the\ninvoluntary and even the unconscious instincts of human nature; but up\nto the present day, culture, as far as he could see, might be said to\nhave affected only the mental epiderm of those lives which had been\nbrought under its influence. This belief was confirmed by his\nexperience of women, which, having latterly been extended from the\ncultivated middle-class into the rural community, had taught him how\nmuch less was the intrinsic difference between the good and wise woman\nof one social stratum and the good and wise woman of another social\nstratum, than between the good and bad, the wise and the foolish, of\nthe same stratum or class.\n\nIt was the morning of his departure. His brothers had already left the\nVicarage to proceed on a walking tour in the north, whence one was to\nreturn to his college, and the other to his curacy. Angel might have\naccompanied them, but preferred to rejoin his sweetheart at Talbothays.\nHe would have been an awkward member of the party; for, though the most\nappreciative humanist, the most ideal religionist, even the best-versed\nChristologist of the three, there was alienation in the standing\nconsciousness that his squareness would not fit the round hole that had\nbeen prepared for him. To neither Felix nor Cuthbert had he ventured to\nmention Tess.\n\nHis mother made him sandwiches, and his father accompanied him, on his\nown mare, a little way along the road. Having fairly well advanced his\nown affairs, Angel listened in a willing silence, as they jogged on\ntogether through the shady lanes, to his father’s account of his parish\ndifficulties, and the coldness of brother clergymen whom he loved,\nbecause of his strict interpretations of the New Testament by the light\nof what they deemed a pernicious Calvinistic doctrine.\n\n“Pernicious!” said Mr Clare, with genial scorn; and he proceeded to\nrecount experiences which would show the absurdity of that idea. He\ntold of wondrous conversions of evil livers of which he had been the\ninstrument, not only amongst the poor, but amongst the rich and\nwell-to-do; and he also candidly admitted many failures.\n\nAs an instance of the latter, he mentioned the case of a young upstart\nsquire named d’Urberville, living some forty miles off, in the\nneighbourhood of Trantridge.\n\n“Not one of the ancient d’Urbervilles of Kingsbere and other places?”\nasked his son. “That curiously historic worn-out family with its\nghostly legend of the coach-and-four?”\n\n“O no. The original d’Urbervilles decayed and disappeared sixty or\neighty years ago—at least, I believe so. This seems to be a new family\nwhich had taken the name; for the credit of the former knightly line I\nhope they are spurious, I’m sure. But it is odd to hear you express\ninterest in old families. I thought you set less store by them even\nthan I.”\n\n“You misapprehend me, father; you often do,” said Angel with a little\nimpatience. “Politically I am sceptical as to the virtue of their being\nold. Some of the wise even among themselves ‘exclaim against their own\nsuccession,’ as Hamlet puts it; but lyrically, dramatically, and even\nhistorically, I am tenderly attached to them.”\n\nThis distinction, though by no means a subtle one, was yet too subtle\nfor Mr Clare the elder, and he went on with the story he had been about\nto relate; which was that after the death of the senior so-called\nd’Urberville, the young man developed the most culpable passions,\nthough he had a blind mother, whose condition should have made him know\nbetter. A knowledge of his career having come to the ears of Mr Clare,\nwhen he was in that part of the country preaching missionary sermons,\nhe boldly took occasion to speak to the delinquent on his spiritual\nstate. Though he was a stranger, occupying another’s pulpit, he had\nfelt this to be his duty, and took for his text the words from St Luke:\n“Thou fool, this night thy soul shall be required of thee!” The young\nman much resented this directness of attack, and in the war of words\nwhich followed when they met he did not scruple publicly to insult Mr\nClare, without respect for his gray hairs.\n\nAngel flushed with distress.\n\n“Dear father,” he said sadly, “I wish you would not expose yourself to\nsuch gratuitous pain from scoundrels!”\n\n“Pain?” said his father, his rugged face shining in the ardour of\nself-abnegation. “The only pain to me was pain on his account, poor,\nfoolish young man. Do you suppose his incensed words could give me any\npain, or even his blows? ‘Being reviled we bless; being persecuted we\nsuffer it; being defamed we entreat; we are made as the filth of the\nworld, and as the offscouring of all things unto this day.’ Those\nancient and noble words to the Corinthians are strictly true at this\npresent hour.”\n\n“Not blows, father? He did not proceed to blows?”\n\n“No, he did not. Though I have borne blows from men in a mad state of\nintoxication.”\n\n“No!”\n\n“A dozen times, my boy. What then? I have saved them from the guilt of\nmurdering their own flesh and blood thereby; and they have lived to\nthank me, and praise God.”\n\n“May this young man do the same!” said Angel fervently. “But I fear\notherwise, from what you say.”\n\n“We’ll hope, nevertheless,” said Mr Clare. “And I continue to pray for\nhim, though on this side of the grave we shall probably never meet\nagain. But, after all, one of those poor words of mine may spring up in\nhis heart as a good seed some day.”\n\nNow, as always, Clare’s father was sanguine as a child; and though the\nyounger could not accept his parent’s narrow dogma, he revered his\npractice and recognized the hero under the pietist. Perhaps he revered\nhis father’s practice even more now than ever, seeing that, in the\nquestion of making Tessy his wife, his father had not once thought of\ninquiring whether she were well provided or penniless. The same\nunworldliness was what had necessitated Angel’s getting a living as a\nfarmer, and would probably keep his brothers in the position of poor\nparsons for the term of their activities; yet Angel admired it none the\nless. Indeed, despite his own heterodoxy, Angel often felt that he was\nnearer to his father on the human side than was either of his brethren.\n\n\nXXVII\n\nAn up-hill and down-hill ride of twenty-odd miles through a garish\nmid-day atmosphere brought him in the afternoon to a detached knoll a\nmile or two west of Talbothays, whence he again looked into that green\ntrough of sappiness and humidity, the valley of the Var or Froom.\nImmediately he began to descend from the upland to the fat alluvial\nsoil below, the atmosphere grew heavier; the languid perfume of the\nsummer fruits, the mists, the hay, the flowers, formed therein a vast\npool of odour which at this hour seemed to make the animals, the very\nbees and butterflies drowsy. Clare was now so familiar with the spot\nthat he knew the individual cows by their names when, a long distance\noff, he saw them dotted about the meads. It was with a sense of luxury\nthat he recognized his power of viewing life here from its inner side,\nin a way that had been quite foreign to him in his student-days; and,\nmuch as he loved his parents, he could not help being aware that to\ncome here, as now, after an experience of home-life, affected him like\nthrowing off splints and bandages; even the one customary curb on the\nhumours of English rural societies being absent in this place,\nTalbothays having no resident landlord.\n\nNot a human being was out of doors at the dairy. The denizens were all\nenjoying the usual afternoon nap of an hour or so which the exceedingly\nearly hours kept in summer-time rendered a necessity. At the door the\nwood-hooped pails, sodden and bleached by infinite scrubbings, hung\nlike hats on a stand upon the forked and peeled limb of an oak fixed\nthere for that purpose; all of them ready and dry for the evening\nmilking. Angel entered, and went through the silent passages of the\nhouse to the back quarters, where he listened for a moment. Sustained\nsnores came from the cart-house, where some of the men were lying down;\nthe grunt and squeal of sweltering pigs arose from the still further\ndistance. The large-leaved rhubarb and cabbage plants slept too, their\nbroad limp surfaces hanging in the sun like half-closed umbrellas.\n\nHe unbridled and fed his horse, and as he re-entered the house the\nclock struck three. Three was the afternoon skimming-hour; and, with\nthe stroke, Clare heard the creaking of the floor-boards above, and\nthen the touch of a descending foot on the stairs. It was Tess’s, who\nin another moment came down before his eyes.\n\nShe had not heard him enter, and hardly realized his presence there.\nShe was yawning, and he saw the red interior of her mouth as if it had\nbeen a snake’s. She had stretched one arm so high above her coiled-up\ncable of hair that he could see its satin delicacy above the sunburn;\nher face was flushed with sleep, and her eyelids hung heavy over their\npupils. The brim-fulness of her nature breathed from her. It was a\nmoment when a woman’s soul is more incarnate than at any other time;\nwhen the most spiritual beauty bespeaks itself flesh; and sex takes the\noutside place in the presentation.\n\nThen those eyes flashed brightly through their filmy heaviness, before\nthe remainder of her face was well awake. With an oddly compounded look\nof gladness, shyness, and surprise, she exclaimed—“O Mr Clare! How you\nfrightened me—I—”\n\nThere had not at first been time for her to think of the changed\nrelations which his declaration had introduced; but the full sense of\nthe matter rose up in her face when she encountered Clare’s tender look\nas he stepped forward to the bottom stair.\n\n“Dear, darling Tessy!” he whispered, putting his arm round her, and his\nface to her flushed cheek. “Don’t, for Heaven’s sake, Mister me any\nmore. I have hastened back so soon because of you!”\n\nTess’s excitable heart beat against his by way of reply; and there they\nstood upon the red-brick floor of the entry, the sun slanting in by the\nwindow upon his back, as he held her tightly to his breast; upon her\ninclining face, upon the blue veins of her temple, upon her naked arm,\nand her neck, and into the depths of her hair. Having been lying down\nin her clothes she was warm as a sunned cat. At first she would not\nlook straight up at him, but her eyes soon lifted, and his plumbed the\ndeepness of the ever-varying pupils, with their radiating fibrils of\nblue, and black, and gray, and violet, while she regarded him as Eve at\nher second waking might have regarded Adam.\n\n“I’ve got to go a-skimming,” she pleaded, “and I have on’y old Deb to\nhelp me to-day. Mrs Crick is gone to market with Mr Crick, and Retty is\nnot well, and the others are gone out somewhere, and won’t be home till\nmilking.”\n\nAs they retreated to the milk-house Deborah Fyander appeared on the\nstairs.\n\n“I have come back, Deborah,” said Mr Clare, upwards. “So I can help\nTess with the skimming; and, as you are very tired, I am sure, you\nneedn’t come down till milking-time.”\n\nPossibly the Talbothays milk was not very thoroughly skimmed that\nafternoon. Tess was in a dream wherein familiar objects appeared as\nhaving light and shade and position, but no particular outline. Every\ntime she held the skimmer under the pump to cool it for the work her\nhand trembled, the ardour of his affection being so palpable that she\nseemed to flinch under it like a plant in too burning a sun.\n\nThen he pressed her again to his side, and when she had done running\nher forefinger round the leads to cut off the cream-edge, he cleaned it\nin nature’s way; for the unconstrained manners of Talbothays dairy came\nconvenient now.\n\n“I may as well say it now as later, dearest,” he resumed gently. “I\nwish to ask you something of a very practical nature, which I have been\nthinking of ever since that day last week in the meads. I shall soon\nwant to marry, and, being a farmer, you see I shall require for my wife\na woman who knows all about the management of farms. Will you be that\nwoman, Tessy?”\n\nHe put it that way that she might not think he had yielded to an\nimpulse of which his head would disapprove.\n\nShe turned quite careworn. She had bowed to the inevitable result of\nproximity, the necessity of loving him; but she had not calculated upon\nthis sudden corollary, which, indeed, Clare had put before her without\nquite meaning himself to do it so soon. With pain that was like the\nbitterness of dissolution she murmured the words of her indispensable\nand sworn answer as an honourable woman.\n\n“O Mr Clare—I cannot be your wife—I cannot be!”\n\nThe sound of her own decision seemed to break Tess’s very heart, and\nshe bowed her face in her grief.\n\n“But, Tess!” he said, amazed at her reply, and holding her still more\ngreedily close. “Do you say no? Surely you love me?”\n\n“O yes, yes! And I would rather be yours than anybody’s in the world,”\nreturned the sweet and honest voice of the distressed girl. “But I\n_cannot_ marry you!”\n\n“Tess,” he said, holding her at arm’s length, “you are engaged to marry\nsome one else!”\n\n“No, no!”\n\n“Then why do you refuse me?”\n\n“I don’t want to marry! I have not thought of doing it. I cannot! I\nonly want to love you.”\n\n“But why?”\n\nDriven to subterfuge, she stammered—\n\n“Your father is a parson, and your mother wouldn’ like you to marry\nsuch as me. She will want you to marry a lady.”\n\n“Nonsense—I have spoken to them both. That was partly why I went home.”\n\n“I feel I cannot—never, never!” she echoed.\n\n“Is it too sudden to be asked thus, my Pretty?”\n\n“Yes—I did not expect it.”\n\n“If you will let it pass, please, Tessy, I will give you time,” he\nsaid. “It was very abrupt to come home and speak to you all at once.\nI’ll not allude to it again for a while.”\n\nShe again took up the shining skimmer, held it beneath the pump, and\nbegan anew. But she could not, as at other times, hit the exact\nunder-surface of the cream with the delicate dexterity required, try as\nshe might; sometimes she was cutting down into the milk, sometimes in\nthe air. She could hardly see, her eyes having filled with two blurring\ntears drawn forth by a grief which, to this her best friend and dear\nadvocate, she could never explain.\n\n“I can’t skim—I can’t!” she said, turning away from him.\n\nNot to agitate and hinder her longer, the considerate Clare began\ntalking in a more general way:\n\n“You quite misapprehend my parents. They are the most simple-mannered\npeople alive, and quite unambitious. They are two of the few remaining\nEvangelical school. Tessy, are you an Evangelical?”\n\n“I don’t know.”\n\n“You go to church very regularly, and our parson here is not very High,\nthey tell me.”\n\nTess’s ideas on the views of the parish clergyman, whom she heard every\nweek, seemed to be rather more vague than Clare’s, who had never heard\nhim at all.\n\n“I wish I could fix my mind on what I hear there more firmly than I\ndo,” she remarked as a safe generality. “It is often a great sorrow to\nme.”\n\nShe spoke so unaffectedly that Angel was sure in his heart that his\nfather could not object to her on religious grounds, even though she\ndid not know whether her principles were High, Low or Broad. He himself\nknew that, in reality, the confused beliefs which she held, apparently\nimbibed in childhood, were, if anything, Tractarian as to phraseology,\nand Pantheistic as to essence. Confused or otherwise, to disturb them\nwas his last desire:\n\n    Leave thou thy sister, when she prays,\n    Her early Heaven, her happy views;\n    Nor thou with shadow’d hint confuse\n    A life that leads melodious days.\n\nHe had occasionally thought the counsel less honest than musical; but\nhe gladly conformed to it now.\n\nHe spoke further of the incidents of his visit, of his father’s mode of\nlife, of his zeal for his principles; she grew serener, and the\nundulations disappeared from her skimming; as she finished one lead\nafter another he followed her, and drew the plugs for letting down the\nmilk.\n\n“I fancied you looked a little downcast when you came in,” she ventured\nto observe, anxious to keep away from the subject of herself.\n\n“Yes—well, my father had been talking a good deal to me of his troubles\nand difficulties, and the subject always tends to depress me. He is so\nzealous that he gets many snubs and buffetings from people of a\ndifferent way of thinking from himself, and I don’t like to hear of\nsuch humiliations to a man of his age, the more particularly as I don’t\nthink earnestness does any good when carried so far. He has been\ntelling me of a very unpleasant scene in which he took part quite\nrecently. He went as the deputy of some missionary society to preach in\nthe neighbourhood of Trantridge, a place forty miles from here, and\nmade it his business to expostulate with a lax young cynic he met with\nsomewhere about there—son of some landowner up that way—and who has a\nmother afflicted with blindness. My father addressed himself to the\ngentleman point-blank, and there was quite a disturbance. It was very\nfoolish of my father, I must say, to intrude his conversation upon a\nstranger when the probabilities were so obvious that it would be\nuseless. But whatever he thinks to be his duty, that he’ll do, in\nseason or out of season; and, of course, he makes many enemies, not\nonly among the absolutely vicious, but among the easy-going, who hate\nbeing bothered. He says he glories in what happened, and that good may\nbe done indirectly; but I wish he would not wear himself out now he is\ngetting old, and would leave such pigs to their wallowing.”\n\nTess’s look had grown hard and worn, and her ripe mouth tragical; but\nshe no longer showed any tremulousness. Clare’s revived thoughts of his\nfather prevented his noticing her particularly; and so they went on\ndown the white row of liquid rectangles till they had finished and\ndrained them off, when the other maids returned, and took their pails,\nand Deb came to scald out the leads for the new milk. As Tess withdrew\nto go afield to the cows he said to her softly—\n\n“And my question, Tessy?”\n\n“O no—no!” replied she with grave hopelessness, as one who had heard\nanew the turmoil of her own past in the allusion to Alec d’Urberville.\n“It _can’t_ be!”\n\nShe went out towards the mead, joining the other milkmaids with a\nbound, as if trying to make the open air drive away her sad constraint.\nAll the girls drew onward to the spot where the cows were grazing in\nthe farther mead, the bevy advancing with the bold grace of wild\nanimals—the reckless, unchastened motion of women accustomed to\nunlimited space—in which they abandoned themselves to the air as a\nswimmer to the wave. It seemed natural enough to him now that Tess was\nagain in sight to choose a mate from unconstrained Nature, and not from\nthe abodes of Art.\n\n\nXXVIII\n\nHer refusal, though unexpected, did not permanently daunt Clare. His\nexperience of women was great enough for him to be aware that the\nnegative often meant nothing more than the preface to the affirmative;\nand it was little enough for him not to know that in the manner of the\npresent negative there lay a great exception to the dallyings of\ncoyness. That she had already permitted him to make love to her he read\nas an additional assurance, not fully trowing that in the fields and\npastures to “sigh gratis” is by no means deemed waste; love-making\nbeing here more often accepted inconsiderately and for its own sweet\nsake than in the carking, anxious homes of the ambitious, where a\ngirl’s craving for an establishment paralyzes her healthy thought of a\npassion as an end.\n\n“Tess, why did you say ‘no’ in such a positive way?” he asked her in\nthe course of a few days.\n\nShe started.\n\n“Don’t ask me. I told you why—partly. I am not good enough—not worthy\nenough.”\n\n“How? Not fine lady enough?”\n\n“Yes—something like that,” murmured she. “Your friends would scorn me.”\n\n“Indeed, you mistake them—my father and mother. As for my brothers, I\ndon’t care—” He clasped his fingers behind her back to keep her from\nslipping away. “Now—you did not mean it, sweet?—I am sure you did not!\nYou have made me so restless that I cannot read, or play, or do\nanything. I am in no hurry, Tess, but I want to know—to hear from your\nown warm lips—that you will some day be mine—any time you may choose;\nbut some day?”\n\nShe could only shake her head and look away from him.\n\nClare regarded her attentively, conned the characters of her face as if\nthey had been hieroglyphics. The denial seemed real.\n\n“Then I ought not to hold you in this way—ought I? I have no right to\nyou—no right to seek out where you are, or walk with you! Honestly,\nTess, do you love any other man?”\n\n“How can you ask?” she said, with continued self-suppression.\n\n“I almost know that you do not. But then, why do you repulse me?”\n\n“I don’t repulse you. I like you to—tell me you love me; and you may\nalways tell me so as you go about with me—and never offend me.”\n\n“But you will not accept me as a husband?”\n\n“Ah—that’s different—it is for your good, indeed, my dearest! O,\nbelieve me, it is only for your sake! I don’t like to give myself the\ngreat happiness o’ promising to be yours in that way—because—because I\nam _sure_ I ought not to do it.”\n\n“But you will make me happy!”\n\n“Ah—you think so, but you don’t know!”\n\nAt such times as this, apprehending the grounds of her refusal to be\nher modest sense of incompetence in matters social and polite, he would\nsay that she was wonderfully well-informed and versatile—which was\ncertainly true, her natural quickness and her admiration for him having\nled her to pick up his vocabulary, his accent, and fragments of his\nknowledge, to a surprising extent. After these tender contests and her\nvictory she would go away by herself under the remotest cow, if at\nmilking-time, or into the sedge or into her room, if at a leisure\ninterval, and mourn silently, not a minute after an apparently\nphlegmatic negative.\n\nThe struggle was so fearful; her own heart was so strongly on the side\nof his—two ardent hearts against one poor little conscience—that she\ntried to fortify her resolution by every means in her power. She had\ncome to Talbothays with a made-up mind. On no account could she agree\nto a step which might afterwards cause bitter rueing to her husband for\nhis blindness in wedding her. And she held that what her conscience had\ndecided for her when her mind was unbiassed ought not to be overruled\nnow.\n\n“Why don’t somebody tell him all about me?” she said. “It was only\nforty miles off—why hasn’t it reached here? Somebody must know!”\n\nYet nobody seemed to know; nobody told him.\n\nFor two or three days no more was said. She guessed from the sad\ncountenances of her chamber companions that they regarded her not only\nas the favourite, but as the chosen; but they could see for themselves\nthat she did not put herself in his way.\n\nTess had never before known a time in which the thread of her life was\nso distinctly twisted of two strands, positive pleasure and positive\npain. At the next cheese-making the pair were again left alone\ntogether. The dairyman himself had been lending a hand; but Mr Crick,\nas well as his wife, seemed latterly to have acquired a suspicion of\nmutual interest between these two; though they walked so circumspectly\nthat suspicion was but of the faintest. Anyhow, the dairyman left them\nto themselves.\n\nThey were breaking up the masses of curd before putting them into the\nvats. The operation resembled the act of crumbling bread on a large\nscale; and amid the immaculate whiteness of the curds Tess\nDurbeyfield’s hands showed themselves of the pinkness of the rose.\nAngel, who was filling the vats with his handful, suddenly ceased, and\nlaid his hands flat upon hers. Her sleeves were rolled far above the\nelbow, and bending lower he kissed the inside vein of her soft arm.\n\nAlthough the early September weather was sultry, her arm, from her\ndabbling in the curds, was as cold and damp to his mouth as a\nnew-gathered mushroom, and tasted of the whey. But she was such a sheaf\nof susceptibilities that her pulse was accelerated by the touch, her\nblood driven to her finger-ends, and the cool arms flushed hot. Then,\nas though her heart had said, “Is coyness longer necessary? Truth is\ntruth between man and woman, as between man and man,” she lifted her\neyes and they beamed devotedly into his, as her lip rose in a tender\nhalf-smile.\n\n“Do you know why I did that, Tess?” he said.\n\n“Because you love me very much!”\n\n“Yes, and as a preliminary to a new entreaty.”\n\n“Not _again_!”\n\nShe looked a sudden fear that her resistance might break down under her\nown desire.\n\n“O, Tessy!” he went on, “I _cannot_ think why you are so tantalizing.\nWhy do you disappoint me so? You seem almost like a coquette, upon my\nlife you do—a coquette of the first urban water! They blow hot and blow\ncold, just as you do, and it is the very last sort of thing to expect\nto find in a retreat like Talbothays.... And yet, dearest,” he quickly\nadded, observing how the remark had cut her, “I know you to be the most\nhonest, spotless creature that ever lived. So how can I suppose you a\nflirt? Tess, why don’t you like the idea of being my wife, if you love\nme as you seem to do?”\n\n“I have never said I don’t like the idea, and I never could say it;\nbecause—it isn’t true!”\n\nThe stress now getting beyond endurance, her lip quivered, and she was\nobliged to go away. Clare was so pained and perplexed that he ran after\nand caught her in the passage.\n\n“Tell me, tell me!” he said, passionately clasping her, in\nforgetfulness of his curdy hands: “do tell me that you won’t belong to\nanybody but me!”\n\n“I will, I will tell you!” she exclaimed. “And I will give you a\ncomplete answer, if you will let me go now. I will tell you my\nexperiences—all about myself—all!”\n\n“Your experiences, dear; yes, certainly; any number.” He expressed\nassent in loving satire, looking into her face. “My Tess, no doubt,\nalmost as many experiences as that wild convolvulus out there on the\ngarden hedge, that opened itself this morning for the first time. Tell\nme anything, but don’t use that wretched expression any more about not\nbeing worthy of me.”\n\n“I will try—not! And I’ll give you my reasons to-morrow—next week.”\n\n“Say on Sunday?”\n\n“Yes, on Sunday.”\n\nAt last she got away, and did not stop in her retreat till she was in\nthe thicket of pollard willows at the lower side of the barton, where\nshe could be quite unseen. Here Tess flung herself down upon the\nrustling undergrowth of spear-grass, as upon a bed, and remained\ncrouching in palpitating misery broken by momentary shoots of joy,\nwhich her fears about the ending could not altogether suppress.\n\nIn reality, she was drifting into acquiescence. Every see-saw of her\nbreath, every wave of her blood, every pulse singing in her ears, was a\nvoice that joined with nature in revolt against her scrupulousness.\nReckless, inconsiderate acceptance of him; to close with him at the\naltar, revealing nothing, and chancing discovery; to snatch ripe\npleasure before the iron teeth of pain could have time to shut upon\nher: that was what love counselled; and in almost a terror of ecstasy\nTess divined that, despite her many months of lonely self-chastisement,\nwrestlings, communings, schemes to lead a future of austere isolation,\nlove’s counsel would prevail.\n\nThe afternoon advanced, and still she remained among the willows. She\nheard the rattle of taking down the pails from the forked stands; the\n“waow-waow!” which accompanied the getting together of the cows. But\nshe did not go to the milking. They would see her agitation; and the\ndairyman, thinking the cause to be love alone, would good-naturedly\ntease her; and that harassment could not be borne.\n\nHer lover must have guessed her overwrought state, and invented some\nexcuse for her non-appearance, for no inquiries were made or calls\ngiven. At half-past six the sun settled down upon the levels with the\naspect of a great forge in the heavens; and presently a monstrous\npumpkin-like moon arose on the other hand. The pollard willows,\ntortured out of their natural shape by incessant choppings, became\nspiny-haired monsters as they stood up against it. She went in and\nupstairs without a light.\n\nIt was now Wednesday. Thursday came, and Angel looked thoughtfully at\nher from a distance, but intruded in no way upon her. The indoor\nmilkmaids, Marian and the rest, seemed to guess that something definite\nwas afoot, for they did not force any remarks upon her in the\nbedchamber. Friday passed; Saturday. To-morrow was the day.\n\n“I shall give way—I shall say yes—I shall let myself marry him—I cannot\nhelp it!” she jealously panted, with her hot face to the pillow that\nnight, on hearing one of the other girls sigh his name in her sleep. “I\ncan’t bear to let anybody have him but me! Yet it is a wrong to him,\nand may kill him when he knows! O my heart—O—O—O!”\n\n\nXXIX\n\n“Now, who mid ye think I’ve heard news o’ this morning?” said Dairyman\nCrick, as he sat down to breakfast next day, with a riddling gaze round\nupon the munching men and maids. “Now, just who mid ye think?”\n\nOne guessed, and another guessed. Mrs Crick did not guess, because she\nknew already.\n\n“Well,” said the dairyman, “’tis that slack-twisted ’hore’s-bird of a\nfeller, Jack Dollop. He’s lately got married to a widow-woman.”\n\n“Not Jack Dollop? A villain—to think o’ that!” said a milker.\n\nThe name entered quickly into Tess Durbeyfield’s consciousness, for it\nwas the name of the lover who had wronged his sweetheart, and had\nafterwards been so roughly used by the young woman’s mother in the\nbutter-churn.\n\n“And had he married the valiant matron’s daughter, as he promised?”\nasked Angel Clare absently, as he turned over the newspaper he was\nreading at the little table to which he was always banished by Mrs\nCrick, in her sense of his gentility.\n\n“Not he, sir. Never meant to,” replied the dairyman. “As I say, ’tis a\nwidow-woman, and she had money, it seems—fifty poun’ a year or so; and\nthat was all he was after. They were married in a great hurry; and then\nshe told him that by marrying she had lost her fifty poun’ a year. Just\nfancy the state o’ my gentleman’s mind at that news! Never such a\ncat-and-dog life as they’ve been leading ever since! Serves him well\nberight. But onluckily the poor woman gets the worst o’t.”\n\n“Well, the silly body should have told en sooner that the ghost of her\nfirst man would trouble him,” said Mrs Crick.\n\n“Ay, ay,” responded the dairyman indecisively. “Still, you can see\nexactly how ’twas. She wanted a home, and didn’t like to run the risk\nof losing him. Don’t ye think that was something like it, maidens?”\n\nHe glanced towards the row of girls.\n\n“She ought to ha’ told him just before they went to church, when he\ncould hardly have backed out,” exclaimed Marian.\n\n“Yes, she ought,” agreed Izz.\n\n“She must have seen what he was after, and should ha’ refused him,”\ncried Retty spasmodically.\n\n“And what do you say, my dear?” asked the dairyman of Tess.\n\n“I think she ought—to have told him the true state of things—or else\nrefused him—I don’t know,” replied Tess, the bread-and-butter choking\nher.\n\n“Be cust if I’d have done either o’t,” said Beck Knibbs, a married\nhelper from one of the cottages. “All’s fair in love and war. I’d ha’\nmarried en just as she did, and if he’d said two words to me about not\ntelling him beforehand anything whatsomdever about my first chap that I\nhadn’t chose to tell, I’d ha’ knocked him down wi’ the rolling-pin—a\nscram little feller like he! Any woman could do it.”\n\nThe laughter which followed this sally was supplemented only by a sorry\nsmile, for form’s sake, from Tess. What was comedy to them was tragedy\nto her; and she could hardly bear their mirth. She soon rose from\ntable, and, with an impression that Clare would soon follow her, went\nalong a little wriggling path, now stepping to one side of the\nirrigating channels, and now to the other, till she stood by the main\nstream of the Var. Men had been cutting the water-weeds higher up the\nriver, and masses of them were floating past her—moving islands of\ngreen crow-foot, whereon she might almost have ridden; long locks of\nwhich weed had lodged against the piles driven to keep the cows from\ncrossing.\n\nYes, there was the pain of it. This question of a woman telling her\nstory—the heaviest of crosses to herself—seemed but amusement to\nothers. It was as if people should laugh at martyrdom.\n\n“Tessy!” came from behind her, and Clare sprang across the gully,\nalighting beside her feet. “My wife—soon!”\n\n“No, no; I cannot. For your sake, O Mr Clare; for your sake, I say no!”\n\n“Tess!”\n\n“Still I say no!” she repeated.\n\nNot expecting this, he had put his arm lightly round her waist the\nmoment after speaking, beneath her hanging tail of hair. (The younger\ndairymaids, including Tess, breakfasted with their hair loose on Sunday\nmornings before building it up extra high for attending church, a style\nthey could not adopt when milking with their heads against the cows.)\nIf she had said “Yes” instead of “No” he would have kissed her; it had\nevidently been his intention; but her determined negative deterred his\nscrupulous heart. Their condition of domiciliary comradeship put her,\nas the woman, to such disadvantage by its enforced intercourse, that he\nfelt it unfair to her to exercise any pressure of blandishment which he\nmight have honestly employed had she been better able to avoid him. He\nreleased her momentarily-imprisoned waist, and withheld the kiss.\n\nIt all turned on that release. What had given her strength to refuse\nhim this time was solely the tale of the widow told by the dairyman;\nand that would have been overcome in another moment. But Angel said no\nmore; his face was perplexed; he went away.\n\nDay after day they met—somewhat less constantly than before; and thus\ntwo or three weeks went by. The end of September drew near, and she\ncould see in his eye that he might ask her again.\n\nHis plan of procedure was different now—as though he had made up his\nmind that her negatives were, after all, only coyness and youth\nstartled by the novelty of the proposal. The fitful evasiveness of her\nmanner when the subject was under discussion countenanced the idea. So\nhe played a more coaxing game; and while never going beyond words, or\nattempting the renewal of caresses, he did his utmost orally.\n\nIn this way Clare persistently wooed her in undertones like that of the\npurling milk—at the cow’s side, at skimmings, at butter-makings, at\ncheese-makings, among broody poultry, and among farrowing pigs—as no\nmilkmaid was ever wooed before by such a man.\n\nTess knew that she must break down. Neither a religious sense of a\ncertain moral validity in the previous union nor a conscientious wish\nfor candour could hold out against it much longer. She loved him so\npassionately, and he was so godlike in her eyes; and being, though\nuntrained, instinctively refined, her nature cried for his tutelary\nguidance. And thus, though Tess kept repeating to herself, “I can never\nbe his wife,” the words were vain. A proof of her weakness lay in the\nvery utterance of what calm strength would not have taken the trouble\nto formulate. Every sound of his voice beginning on the old subject\nstirred her with a terrifying bliss, and she coveted the recantation\nshe feared.\n\nHis manner was—what man’s is not?—so much that of one who would love\nand cherish and defend her under any conditions, changes, charges, or\nrevelations, that her gloom lessened as she basked in it. The season\nmeanwhile was drawing onward to the equinox, and though it was still\nfine, the days were much shorter. The dairy had again worked by morning\ncandlelight for a long time; and a fresh renewal of Clare’s pleading\noccurred one morning between three and four.\n\nShe had run up in her bedgown to his door to call him as usual; then\nhad gone back to dress and call the others; and in ten minutes was\nwalking to the head of the stairs with the candle in her hand. At the\nsame moment he came down his steps from above in his shirt-sleeves and\nput his arm across the stairway.\n\n“Now, Miss Flirt, before you go down,” he said peremptorily. “It is a\nfortnight since I spoke, and this won’t do any longer. You _must_ tell\nme what you mean, or I shall have to leave this house. My door was ajar\njust now, and I saw you. For your own safety I must go. You don’t know.\nWell? Is it to be yes at last?”\n\n“I am only just up, Mr Clare, and it is too early to take me to task!”\nshe pouted. “You need not call me Flirt. ’Tis cruel and untrue. Wait\ntill by and by. Please wait till by and by! I will really think\nseriously about it between now and then. Let me go downstairs!”\n\nShe looked a little like what he said she was as, holding the candle\nsideways, she tried to smile away the seriousness of her words.\n\n“Call me Angel, then, and not Mr Clare.”\n\n“Angel.”\n\n“Angel dearest—why not?”\n\n“’Twould mean that I agree, wouldn’t it?”\n\n“It would only mean that you love me, even if you cannot marry me; and\nyou were so good as to own that long ago.”\n\n“Very well, then, ‘Angel dearest’, if I _must_,” she murmured, looking\nat her candle, a roguish curl coming upon her mouth, notwithstanding\nher suspense.\n\nClare had resolved never to kiss her until he had obtained her promise;\nbut somehow, as Tess stood there in her prettily tucked-up milking\ngown, her hair carelessly heaped upon her head till there should be\nleisure to arrange it when skimming and milking were done, he broke his\nresolve, and brought his lips to her cheek for one moment. She passed\ndownstairs very quickly, never looking back at him or saying another\nword. The other maids were already down, and the subject was not\npursued. Except Marian, they all looked wistfully and suspiciously at\nthe pair, in the sad yellow rays which the morning candles emitted in\ncontrast with the first cold signals of the dawn without.\n\nWhen skimming was done—which, as the milk diminished with the approach\nof autumn, was a lessening process day by day—Retty and the rest went\nout. The lovers followed them.\n\n“Our tremulous lives are so different from theirs, are they not?” he\nmusingly observed to her, as he regarded the three figures tripping\nbefore him through the frigid pallor of opening day.\n\n“Not so very different, I think,” she said.\n\n“Why do you think that?”\n\n“There are very few women’s lives that are not—tremulous,” Tess\nreplied, pausing over the new word as if it impressed her. “There’s\nmore in those three than you think.”\n\n“What is in them?”\n\n“Almost either of ’em,” she began, “would make—perhaps would make—a\nproperer wife than I. And perhaps they love you as well as I—almost.”\n\n“O, Tessy!”\n\nThere were signs that it was an exquisite relief to her to hear the\nimpatient exclamation, though she had resolved so intrepidly to let\ngenerosity make one bid against herself. That was now done, and she had\nnot the power to attempt self-immolation a second time then. They were\njoined by a milker from one of the cottages, and no more was said on\nthat which concerned them so deeply. But Tess knew that this day would\ndecide it.\n\nIn the afternoon several of the dairyman’s household and assistants\nwent down to the meads as usual, a long way from the dairy, where many\nof the cows were milked without being driven home. The supply was\ngetting less as the animals advanced in calf, and the supernumerary\nmilkers of the lush green season had been dismissed.\n\nThe work progressed leisurely. Each pailful was poured into tall cans\nthat stood in a large spring-waggon which had been brought upon the\nscene; and when they were milked, the cows trailed away. Dairyman\nCrick, who was there with the rest, his wrapper gleaming miraculously\nwhite against a leaden evening sky, suddenly looked at his heavy watch.\n\n“Why, ’tis later than I thought,” he said. “Begad! We shan’t be soon\nenough with this milk at the station, if we don’t mind. There’s no time\nto-day to take it home and mix it with the bulk afore sending off. It\nmust go to station straight from here. Who’ll drive it across?”\n\nMr Clare volunteered to do so, though it was none of his business,\nasking Tess to accompany him. The evening, though sunless, had been\nwarm and muggy for the season, and Tess had come out with her\nmilking-hood only, naked-armed and jacketless; certainly not dressed\nfor a drive. She therefore replied by glancing over her scant\nhabiliments; but Clare gently urged her. She assented by relinquishing\nher pail and stool to the dairyman to take home, and mounted the\nspring-waggon beside Clare.\n\n\nXXX\n\nIn the diminishing daylight they went along the level roadway through\nthe meads, which stretched away into gray miles, and were backed in the\nextreme edge of distance by the swarthy and abrupt slopes of Egdon\nHeath. On its summit stood clumps and stretches of fir-trees, whose\nnotched tips appeared like battlemented towers crowning black-fronted\ncastles of enchantment.\n\nThey were so absorbed in the sense of being close to each other that\nthey did not begin talking for a long while, the silence being broken\nonly by the clucking of the milk in the tall cans behind them. The lane\nthey followed was so solitary that the hazel nuts had remained on the\nboughs till they slipped from their shells, and the blackberries hung\nin heavy clusters. Every now and then Angel would fling the lash of his\nwhip round one of these, pluck it off, and give it to his companion.\n\nThe dull sky soon began to tell its meaning by sending down\nherald-drops of rain, and the stagnant air of the day changed into a\nfitful breeze which played about their faces. The quick-silvery glaze\non the rivers and pools vanished; from broad mirrors of light they\nchanged to lustreless sheets of lead, with a surface like a rasp. But\nthat spectacle did not affect her preoccupation. Her countenance, a\nnatural carnation slightly embrowned by the season, had deepened its\ntinge with the beating of the rain-drops; and her hair, which the\npressure of the cows’ flanks had, as usual, caused to tumble down from\nits fastenings and stray beyond the curtain of her calico bonnet, was\nmade clammy by the moisture till it hardly was better than seaweed.\n\n“I ought not to have come, I suppose,” she murmured, looking at the\nsky.\n\n“I am sorry for the rain,” said he. “But how glad I am to have you\nhere!”\n\nRemote Egdon disappeared by degree behind the liquid gauze. The evening\ngrew darker, and the roads being crossed by gates, it was not safe to\ndrive faster than at a walking pace. The air was rather chill.\n\n“I am so afraid you will get cold, with nothing upon your arms and\nshoulders,” he said. “Creep close to me, and perhaps the drizzle won’t\nhurt you much. I should be sorrier still if I did not think that the\nrain might be helping me.”\n\nShe imperceptibly crept closer, and he wrapped round them both a large\npiece of sail-cloth, which was sometimes used to keep the sun off the\nmilk-cans. Tess held it from slipping off him as well as herself,\nClare’s hands being occupied.\n\n“Now we are all right again. Ah—no we are not! It runs down into my\nneck a little, and it must still more into yours. That’s better. Your\narms are like wet marble, Tess. Wipe them in the cloth. Now, if you\nstay quiet, you will not get another drop. Well, dear—about that\nquestion of mine—that long-standing question?”\n\nThe only reply that he could hear for a little while was the smack of\nthe horse’s hoofs on the moistening road, and the cluck of the milk in\nthe cans behind them.\n\n“Do you remember what you said?”\n\n“I do,” she replied.\n\n“Before we get home, mind.”\n\n“I’ll try.”\n\nHe said no more then. As they drove on, the fragment of an old manor\nhouse of Caroline date rose against the sky, and was in due course\npassed and left behind.\n\n“That,” he observed, to entertain her, “is an interesting old place—one\nof the several seats which belonged to an ancient Norman family\nformerly of great influence in this county, the d’Urbervilles. I never\npass one of their residences without thinking of them. There is\nsomething very sad in the extinction of a family of renown, even if it\nwas fierce, domineering, feudal renown.”\n\n“Yes,” said Tess.\n\nThey crept along towards a point in the expanse of shade just at hand\nat which a feeble light was beginning to assert its presence, a spot\nwhere, by day, a fitful white streak of steam at intervals upon the\ndark green background denoted intermittent moments of contact between\ntheir secluded world and modern life. Modern life stretched out its\nsteam feeler to this point three or four times a day, touched the\nnative existences, and quickly withdrew its feeler again, as if what it\ntouched had been uncongenial.\n\nThey reached the feeble light, which came from the smoky lamp of a\nlittle railway station; a poor enough terrestrial star, yet in one\nsense of more importance to Talbothays Dairy and mankind than the\ncelestial ones to which it stood in such humiliating contrast. The cans\nof new milk were unladen in the rain, Tess getting a little shelter\nfrom a neighbouring holly tree.\n\nThen there was the hissing of a train, which drew up almost silently\nupon the wet rails, and the milk was rapidly swung can by can into the\ntruck. The light of the engine flashed for a second upon Tess\nDurbeyfield’s figure, motionless under the great holly tree. No object\ncould have looked more foreign to the gleaming cranks and wheels than\nthis unsophisticated girl, with the round bare arms, the rainy face and\nhair, the suspended attitude of a friendly leopard at pause, the print\ngown of no date or fashion, and the cotton bonnet drooping on her brow.\n\nShe mounted again beside her lover, with a mute obedience\ncharacteristic of impassioned natures at times, and when they had\nwrapped themselves up over head and ears in the sailcloth again, they\nplunged back into the now thick night. Tess was so receptive that the\nfew minutes of contact with the whirl of material progress lingered in\nher thought.\n\n“Londoners will drink it at their breakfasts to-morrow, won’t they?”\nshe asked. “Strange people that we have never seen.”\n\n“Yes—I suppose they will. Though not as we send it. When its strength\nhas been lowered, so that it may not get up into their heads.”\n\n“Noble men and noble women, ambassadors and centurions, ladies and\ntradeswomen, and babies who have never seen a cow.”\n\n“Well, yes; perhaps; particularly centurions.”\n\n“Who don’t know anything of us, and where it comes from; or think how\nwe two drove miles across the moor to-night in the rain that it might\nreach ’em in time?”\n\n“We did not drive entirely on account of these precious Londoners; we\ndrove a little on our own—on account of that anxious matter which you\nwill, I am sure, set at rest, dear Tess. Now, permit me to put it in\nthis way. You belong to me already, you know; your heart, I mean. Does\nit not?”\n\n“You know as well as I. O yes—yes!”\n\n“Then, if your heart does, why not your hand?”\n\n“My only reason was on account of you—on account of a question. I have\nsomething to tell you—”\n\n“But suppose it to be entirely for my happiness, and my worldly\nconvenience also?”\n\n“O yes; if it is for your happiness and worldly convenience. But my\nlife before I came here—I want—”\n\n“Well, it is for my convenience as well as my happiness. If I have a\nvery large farm, either English or colonial, you will be invaluable as\na wife to me; better than a woman out of the largest mansion in the\ncountry. So please—please, dear Tessy, disabuse your mind of the\nfeeling that you will stand in my way.”\n\n“But my history. I want you to know it—you must let me tell you—you\nwill not like me so well!”\n\n“Tell it if you wish to, dearest. This precious history then. Yes, I\nwas born at so and so, Anno Domini—”\n\n“I was born at Marlott,” she said, catching at his words as a help,\nlightly as they were spoken. “And I grew up there. And I was in the\nSixth Standard when I left school, and they said I had great aptness,\nand should make a good teacher, so it was settled that I should be one.\nBut there was trouble in my family; father was not very industrious,\nand he drank a little.”\n\n“Yes, yes. Poor child! Nothing new.” He pressed her more closely to his\nside.\n\n“And then—there is something very unusual about it—about me. I—I was—”\n\nTess’s breath quickened.\n\n“Yes, dearest. Never mind.”\n\n“I—I—am not a Durbeyfield, but a d’Urberville—a descendant of the same\nfamily as those that owned the old house we passed. And—we are all gone\nto nothing!”\n\n“A d’Urberville!—Indeed! And is that all the trouble, dear Tess?”\n\n“Yes,” she answered faintly.\n\n“Well—why should I love you less after knowing this?”\n\n“I was told by the dairyman that you hated old families.”\n\nHe laughed.\n\n“Well, it is true, in one sense. I do hate the aristocratic principle\nof blood before everything, and do think that as reasoners the only\npedigrees we ought to respect are those spiritual ones of the wise and\nvirtuous, without regard to corporal paternity. But I am extremely\ninterested in this news—you can have no idea how interested I am! Are\nyou not interested yourself in being one of that well-known line?”\n\n“No. I have thought it sad—especially since coming here, and knowing\nthat many of the hills and fields I see once belonged to my father’s\npeople. But other hills and fields belonged to Retty’s people, and\nperhaps others to Marian’s, so that I don’t value it particularly.”\n\n“Yes—it is surprising how many of the present tillers of the soil were\nonce owners of it, and I sometimes wonder that a certain school of\npoliticians don’t make capital of the circumstance; but they don’t seem\nto know it... I wonder that I did not see the resemblance of your name\nto d’Urberville, and trace the manifest corruption. And this was the\ncarking secret!”\n\nShe had not told. At the last moment her courage had failed her; she\nfeared his blame for not telling him sooner; and her instinct of\nself-preservation was stronger than her candour.\n\n“Of course,” continued the unwitting Clare, “I should have been glad to\nknow you to be descended exclusively from the long-suffering, dumb,\nunrecorded rank and file of the English nation, and not from the\nself-seeking few who made themselves powerful at the expense of the\nrest. But I am corrupted away from that by my affection for you, Tess\n(he laughed as he spoke), and made selfish likewise. For your own sake\nI rejoice in your descent. Society is hopelessly snobbish, and this\nfact of your extraction may make an appreciable difference to its\nacceptance of you as my wife, after I have made you the well-read woman\nthat I mean to make you. My mother too, poor soul, will think so much\nbetter of you on account of it. Tess, you must spell your name\ncorrectly—d’Urberville—from this very day.”\n\n“I like the other way rather best.”\n\n“But you _must_, dearest! Good heavens, why dozens of mushroom\nmillionaires would jump at such a possession! By the bye, there’s one\nof that kidney who has taken the name—where have I heard of him?—Up in\nthe neighbourhood of The Chase, I think. Why, he is the very man who\nhad that rumpus with my father I told you of. What an odd coincidence!”\n\n“Angel, I think I would rather not take the name! It is unlucky,\nperhaps!”\n\nShe was agitated.\n\n“Now then, Mistress Teresa d’Urberville, I have you. Take my name, and\nso you will escape yours! The secret is out, so why should you any\nlonger refuse me?”\n\n“If it is _sure_ to make you happy to have me as your wife, and you\nfeel that you do wish to marry me, _very, very_ much—”\n\n“I do, dearest, of course!”\n\n“I mean, that it is only your wanting me very much, and being hardly\nable to keep alive without me, whatever my offences, that would make me\nfeel I ought to say I will.”\n\n“You will—you do say it, I know! You will be mine for ever and ever.”\n\nHe clasped her close and kissed her.\n\n“Yes!”\n\nShe had no sooner said it than she burst into a dry hard sobbing, so\nviolent that it seemed to rend her. Tess was not a hysterical girl by\nany means, and he was surprised.\n\n“Why do you cry, dearest?”\n\n“I can’t tell—quite!—I am so glad to think—of being yours, and making\nyou happy!”\n\n“But this does not seem very much like gladness, my Tessy!”\n\n“I mean—I cry because I have broken down in my vow! I said I would die\nunmarried!”\n\n“But, if you love me you would like me to be your husband?”\n\n“Yes, yes, yes! But O, I sometimes wish I had never been born!”\n\n“Now, my dear Tess, if I did not know that you are very much excited,\nand very inexperienced, I should say that remark was not very\ncomplimentary. How came you to wish that if you care for me? Do you\ncare for me? I wish you would prove it in some way.”\n\n“How can I prove it more than I have done?” she cried, in a distraction\nof tenderness. “Will this prove it more?”\n\nShe clasped his neck, and for the first time Clare learnt what an\nimpassioned woman’s kisses were like upon the lips of one whom she\nloved with all her heart and soul, as Tess loved him.\n\n“There—now do you believe?” she asked, flushed, and wiping her eyes.\n\n“Yes. I never really doubted—never, never!”\n\nSo they drove on through the gloom, forming one bundle inside the\nsail-cloth, the horse going as he would, and the rain driving against\nthem. She had consented. She might as well have agreed at first. The\n“appetite for joy” which pervades all creation, that tremendous force\nwhich sways humanity to its purpose, as the tide sways the helpless\nweed, was not to be controlled by vague lucubrations over the social\nrubric.\n\n“I must write to my mother,” she said. “You don’t mind my doing that?”\n\n“Of course not, dear child. You are a child to me, Tess, not to know\nhow very proper it is to write to your mother at such a time, and how\nwrong it would be in me to object. Where does she live?”\n\n“At the same place—Marlott. On the further side of Blackmoor Vale.”\n\n“Ah, then I _have_ seen you before this summer—”\n\n“Yes; at that dance on the green; but you would not dance with me. O, I\nhope that is of no ill-omen for us now!”\n\n\nXXXI\n\nTess wrote a most touching and urgent letter to her mother the very\nnext day, and by the end of the week a response to her communication\narrived in Joan Durbeyfield’s wandering last-century hand.\n\n    Dear Tess,\n\n    J write these few lines Hoping they will find you well, as they\n    leave me at Present, thank God for it. Dear Tess, we are all glad\n    to Hear that you are going really to be married soon. But with\n    respect to your question, Tess, J say between ourselves, quite\n    private but very strong, that on no account do you say a word of\n    your Bygone Trouble to him. J did not tell everything to your\n    Father, he being so Proud on account of his Respectability, which,\n    perhaps, your Intended is the same. Many a woman—some of the\n    Highest in the Land—have had a Trouble in their time; and why\n    should you Trumpet yours when others don’t Trumpet theirs? No girl\n    would be such a Fool, specially as it is so long ago, and not your\n    Fault at all. J shall answer the same if you ask me fifty times.\n    Besides, you must bear in mind that, knowing it to be your Childish\n    Nature to tell all that’s in your heart—so simple!—J made you\n    promise me never to let it out by Word or Deed, having your Welfare\n    in my Mind; and you most solemnly did promise it going from this\n    Door. J have not named either that Question or your coming marriage\n    to your Father, as he would blab it everywhere, poor Simple Man.\n\n    Dear Tess, keep up your Spirits, and we mean to send you a Hogshead\n    of Cyder for you Wedding, knowing there is not much in your parts,\n    and thin Sour Stuff what there is. So no more at present, and with\n    kind love to your Young Man.—From your affectte. Mother,\n\n    J. Durbeyfield\n\n\n“O mother, mother!” murmured Tess.\n\nShe was recognizing how light was the touch of events the most\noppressive upon Mrs Durbeyfield’s elastic spirit. Her mother did not\nsee life as Tess saw it. That haunting episode of bygone days was to\nher mother but a passing accident. But perhaps her mother was right as\nto the course to be followed, whatever she might be in her reasons.\nSilence seemed, on the face of it, best for her adored one’s happiness:\nsilence it should be.\n\nThus steadied by a command from the only person in the world who had\nany shadow of right to control her action, Tess grew calmer. The\nresponsibility was shifted, and her heart was lighter than it had been\nfor weeks. The days of declining autumn which followed her assent,\nbeginning with the month of October, formed a season through which she\nlived in spiritual altitudes more nearly approaching ecstasy than any\nother period of her life.\n\nThere was hardly a touch of earth in her love for Clare. To her sublime\ntrustfulness he was all that goodness could be—knew all that a guide,\nphilosopher, and friend should know. She thought every line in the\ncontour of his person the perfection of masculine beauty, his soul the\nsoul of a saint, his intellect that of a seer. The wisdom of her love\nfor him, as love, sustained her dignity; she seemed to be wearing a\ncrown. The compassion of his love for her, as she saw it, made her lift\nup her heart to him in devotion. He would sometimes catch her large,\nworshipful eyes, that had no bottom to them looking at him from their\ndepths, as if she saw something immortal before her.\n\nShe dismissed the past—trod upon it and put it out, as one treads on a\ncoal that is smouldering and dangerous.\n\nShe had not known that men could be so disinterested, chivalrous,\nprotective, in their love for women as he. Angel Clare was far from all\nthat she thought him in this respect; absurdly far, indeed; but he was,\nin truth, more spiritual than animal; he had himself well in hand, and\nwas singularly free from grossness. Though not cold-natured, he was\nrather bright than hot—less Byronic than Shelleyan; could love\ndesperately, but with a love more especially inclined to the\nimaginative and ethereal; it was a fastidious emotion which could\njealously guard the loved one against his very self. This amazed and\nenraptured Tess, whose slight experiences had been so infelicitous till\nnow; and in her reaction from indignation against the male sex she\nswerved to excess of honour for Clare.\n\nThey unaffectedly sought each other’s company; in her honest faith she\ndid not disguise her desire to be with him. The sum of her instincts on\nthis matter, if clearly stated, would have been that the elusive\nquality of her sex which attracts men in general might be distasteful\nto so perfect a man after an avowal of love, since it must in its very\nnature carry with it a suspicion of art.\n\nThe country custom of unreserved comradeship out of doors during\nbetrothal was the only custom she knew, and to her it had no\nstrangeness; though it seemed oddly anticipative to Clare till he saw\nhow normal a thing she, in common with all the other dairy-folk,\nregarded it. Thus, during this October month of wonderful afternoons\nthey roved along the meads by creeping paths which followed the brinks\nof trickling tributary brooks, hopping across by little wooden bridges\nto the other side, and back again. They were never out of the sound of\nsome purling weir, whose buzz accompanied their own murmuring, while\nthe beams of the sun, almost as horizontal as the mead itself, formed a\npollen of radiance over the landscape. They saw tiny blue fogs in the\nshadows of trees and hedges, all the time that there was bright\nsunshine elsewhere. The sun was so near the ground, and the sward so\nflat, that the shadows of Clare and Tess would stretch a quarter of a\nmile ahead of them, like two long fingers pointing afar to where the\ngreen alluvial reaches abutted against the sloping sides of the vale.\n\nMen were at work here and there—for it was the season for “taking up”\nthe meadows, or digging the little waterways clear for the winter\nirrigation, and mending their banks where trodden down by the cows. The\nshovelfuls of loam, black as jet, brought there by the river when it\nwas as wide as the whole valley, were an essence of soils, pounded\nchampaigns of the past, steeped, refined, and subtilized to\nextraordinary richness, out of which came all the fertility of the\nmead, and of the cattle grazing there.\n\nClare hardily kept his arm round her waist in sight of these watermen,\nwith the air of a man who was accustomed to public dalliance, though\nactually as shy as she who, with lips parted and eyes askance on the\nlabourers, wore the look of a wary animal the while.\n\n“You are not ashamed of owning me as yours before them!” she said\ngladly.\n\n“O no!”\n\n“But if it should reach the ears of your friends at Emminster that you\nare walking about like this with me, a milkmaid—”\n\n“The most bewitching milkmaid ever seen.”\n\n“They might feel it a hurt to their dignity.”\n\n“My dear girl—a d’Urberville hurt the dignity of a Clare! It is a grand\ncard to play—that of your belonging to such a family, and I am\nreserving it for a grand effect when we are married, and have the\nproofs of your descent from Parson Tringham. Apart from that, my future\nis to be totally foreign to my family—it will not affect even the\nsurface of their lives. We shall leave this part of England—perhaps\nEngland itself—and what does it matter how people regard us here? You\nwill like going, will you not?”\n\nShe could answer no more than a bare affirmative, so great was the\nemotion aroused in her at the thought of going through the world with\nhim as his own familiar friend. Her feelings almost filled her ears\nlike a babble of waves, and surged up to her eyes. She put her hand in\nhis, and thus they went on, to a place where the reflected sun glared\nup from the river, under a bridge, with a molten-metallic glow that\ndazzled their eyes, though the sun itself was hidden by the bridge.\nThey stood still, whereupon little furred and feathered heads popped up\nfrom the smooth surface of the water; but, finding that the disturbing\npresences had paused, and not passed by, they disappeared again. Upon\nthis river-brink they lingered till the fog began to close round\nthem—which was very early in the evening at this time of the\nyear—settling on the lashes of her eyes, where it rested like crystals,\nand on his brows and hair.\n\nThey walked later on Sundays, when it was quite dark. Some of the\ndairy-people, who were also out of doors on the first Sunday evening\nafter their engagement, heard her impulsive speeches, ecstasized to\nfragments, though they were too far off to hear the words discoursed;\nnoted the spasmodic catch in her remarks, broken into syllables by the\nleapings of her heart, as she walked leaning on his arm; her contented\npauses, the occasional little laugh upon which her soul seemed to\nride—the laugh of a woman in company with the man she loves and has won\nfrom all other women—unlike anything else in nature. They marked the\nbuoyancy of her tread, like the skim of a bird which has not quite\nalighted.\n\nHer affection for him was now the breath and life of Tess’s being; it\nenveloped her as a photosphere, irradiated her into forgetfulness of\nher past sorrows, keeping back the gloomy spectres that would persist\nin their attempts to touch her—doubt, fear, moodiness, care, shame. She\nknew that they were waiting like wolves just outside the circumscribing\nlight, but she had long spells of power to keep them in hungry\nsubjection there.\n\nA spiritual forgetfulness co-existed with an intellectual remembrance.\nShe walked in brightness, but she knew that in the background those\nshapes of darkness were always spread. They might be receding, or they\nmight be approaching, one or the other, a little every day.\n\nOne evening Tess and Clare were obliged to sit indoors keeping house,\nall the other occupants of the domicile being away. As they talked she\nlooked thoughtfully up at him, and met his two appreciative eyes.\n\n“I am not worthy of you—no, I am not!” she burst out, jumping up from\nher low stool as though appalled at his homage, and the fulness of her\nown joy thereat.\n\nClare, deeming the whole basis of her excitement to be that which was\nonly the smaller part of it, said—\n\n“I won’t have you speak like it, dear Tess! Distinction does not\nconsist in the facile use of a contemptible set of conventions, but in\nbeing numbered among those who are true, and honest, and just, and\npure, and lovely, and of good report—as you are, my Tess.”\n\nShe struggled with the sob in her throat. How often had that string of\nexcellences made her young heart ache in church of late years, and how\nstrange that he should have cited them now.\n\n“Why didn’t you stay and love me when I—was sixteen; living with my\nlittle sisters and brothers, and you danced on the green? O, why didn’t\nyou, why didn’t you!” she said, impetuously clasping her hands.\n\nAngel began to comfort and reassure her, thinking to himself, truly\nenough, what a creature of moods she was, and how careful he would have\nto be of her when she depended for her happiness entirely on him.\n\n“Ah—why didn’t I stay!” he said. “That is just what I feel. If I had\nonly known! But you must not be so bitter in your regret—why should you\nbe?”\n\nWith the woman’s instinct to hide she diverged hastily—\n\n“I should have had four years more of your heart than I can ever have\nnow. Then I should not have wasted my time as I have done—I should have\nhad so much longer happiness!”\n\nIt was no mature woman with a long dark vista of intrigue behind her\nwho was tormented thus, but a girl of simple life, not yet one-and\ntwenty, who had been caught during her days of immaturity like a bird\nin a springe. To calm herself the more completely, she rose from her\nlittle stool and left the room, overturning the stool with her skirts\nas she went.\n\nHe sat on by the cheerful firelight thrown from a bundle of green\nash-sticks laid across the dogs; the sticks snapped pleasantly, and\nhissed out bubbles of sap from their ends. When she came back she was\nherself again.\n\n“Do you not think you are just a wee bit capricious, fitful, Tess?” he\nsaid, good-humouredly, as he spread a cushion for her on the stool, and\nseated himself in the settle beside her. “I wanted to ask you\nsomething, and just then you ran away.”\n\n“Yes, perhaps I am capricious,” she murmured. She suddenly approached\nhim, and put a hand upon each of his arms. “No, Angel, I am not really\nso—by nature, I mean!” The more particularly to assure him that she was\nnot, she placed herself close to him in the settle, and allowed her\nhead to find a resting-place against Clare’s shoulder. “What did you\nwant to ask me—I am sure I will answer it,” she continued humbly.\n\n“Well, you love me, and have agreed to marry me, and hence there\nfollows a thirdly, ‘When shall the day be?’”\n\n“I like living like this.”\n\n“But I must think of starting in business on my own hook with the new\nyear, or a little later. And before I get involved in the multifarious\ndetails of my new position, I should like to have secured my partner.”\n\n“But,” she timidly answered, “to talk quite practically, wouldn’t it be\nbest not to marry till after all that?—Though I can’t bear the thought\no’ your going away and leaving me here!”\n\n“Of course you cannot—and it is not best in this case. I want you to\nhelp me in many ways in making my start. When shall it be? Why not a\nfortnight from now?”\n\n“No,” she said, becoming grave: “I have so many things to think of\nfirst.”\n\n“But—”\n\nHe drew her gently nearer to him.\n\nThe reality of marriage was startling when it loomed so near. Before\ndiscussion of the question had proceeded further there walked round the\ncorner of the settle into the full firelight of the apartment Mr\nDairyman Crick, Mrs Crick, and two of the milkmaids.\n\nTess sprang like an elastic ball from his side to her feet, while her\nface flushed and her eyes shone in the firelight.\n\n“I knew how it would be if I sat so close to him!” she cried, with\nvexation. “I said to myself, they are sure to come and catch us! But I\nwasn’t really sitting on his knee, though it might ha’ seemed as if I\nwas almost!”\n\n“Well—if so be you hadn’t told us, I am sure we shouldn’t ha’ noticed\nthat ye had been sitting anywhere at all in this light,” replied the\ndairyman. He continued to his wife, with the stolid mien of a man who\nunderstood nothing of the emotions relating to matrimony—“Now,\nChristianer, that shows that folks should never fancy other folks be\nsupposing things when they bain’t. O no, I should never ha’ thought a\nword of where she was a sitting to, if she hadn’t told me—not I.”\n\n“We are going to be married soon,” said Clare, with improvised phlegm.\n\n“Ah—and be ye! Well, I am truly glad to hear it, sir. I’ve thought you\nmid do such a thing for some time. She’s too good for a dairymaid—I\nsaid so the very first day I zid her—and a prize for any man; and\nwhat’s more, a wonderful woman for a gentleman-farmer’s wife; he won’t\nbe at the mercy of his baily wi’ her at his side.”\n\nSomehow Tess disappeared. She had been even more struck with the look\nof the girls who followed Crick than abashed by Crick’s blunt praise.\n\nAfter supper, when she reached her bedroom, they were all present. A\nlight was burning, and each damsel was sitting up whitely in her bed,\nawaiting Tess, the whole like a row of avenging ghosts.\n\nBut she saw in a few moments that there was no malice in their mood.\nThey could scarcely feel as a loss what they had never expected to\nhave. Their condition was objective, contemplative.\n\n“He’s going to marry her!” murmured Retty, never taking eyes off Tess.\n“How her face do show it!”\n\n“You _be_ going to marry him?” asked Marian.\n\n“Yes,” said Tess.\n\n“When?”\n\n“Some day.”\n\nThey thought that this was evasiveness only.\n\n“_Yes_—going to _marry_ him—a gentleman!” repeated Izz Huett.\n\nAnd by a sort of fascination the three girls, one after another, crept\nout of their beds, and came and stood barefooted round Tess. Retty put\nher hands upon Tess’s shoulders, as if to realize her friend’s\ncorporeality after such a miracle, and the other two laid their arms\nround her waist, all looking into her face.\n\n“How it do seem! Almost more than I can think of!” said Izz Huett.\n\nMarian kissed Tess. “Yes,” she murmured as she withdrew her lips.\n\n“Was that because of love for her, or because other lips have touched\nthere by now?” continued Izz drily to Marian.\n\n“I wasn’t thinking o’ that,” said Marian simply. “I was on’y feeling\nall the strangeness o’t—that she is to be his wife, and nobody else. I\ndon’t say nay to it, nor either of us, because we did not think of\nit—only loved him. Still, nobody else is to marry’n in the world—no\nfine lady, nobody in silks and satins; but she who do live like we.”\n\n“Are you sure you don’t dislike me for it?” said Tess in a low voice.\n\nThey hung about her in their white nightgowns before replying, as if\nthey considered their answer might lie in her look.\n\n“I don’t know—I don’t know,” murmured Retty Priddle. “I want to hate\n’ee; but I cannot!”\n\n“That’s how I feel,” echoed Izz and Marian. “I can’t hate her. Somehow\nshe hinders me!”\n\n“He ought to marry one of you,” murmured Tess.\n\n“Why?”\n\n“You are all better than I.”\n\n“We better than you?” said the girls in a low, slow whisper. “No, no,\ndear Tess!”\n\n“You are!” she contradicted impetuously. And suddenly tearing away from\ntheir clinging arms she burst into a hysterical fit of tears, bowing\nherself on the chest of drawers and repeating incessantly, “O yes, yes,\nyes!”\n\nHaving once given way she could not stop her weeping.\n\n“He ought to have had one of you!” she cried. “I think I ought to make\nhim even now! You would be better for him than—I don’t know what I’m\nsaying! O! O!”\n\nThey went up to her and clasped her round, but still her sobs tore her.\n\n“Get some water,” said Marian, “She’s upset by us, poor thing, poor\nthing!”\n\nThey gently led her back to the side of her bed, where they kissed her\nwarmly.\n\n“You are best for’n,” said Marian. “More ladylike, and a better scholar\nthan we, especially since he had taught ’ee so much. But even you ought\nto be proud. You _be_ proud, I’m sure!”\n\n“Yes, I am,” she said; “and I am ashamed at so breaking down.”\n\nWhen they were all in bed, and the light was out, Marian whispered\nacross to her—\n\n“You will think of us when you be his wife, Tess, and of how we told\n’ee that we loved him, and how we tried not to hate you, and did not\nhate you, and could not hate you, because you were his choice, and we\nnever hoped to be chose by him.”\n\nThey were not aware that, at these words, salt, stinging tears trickled\ndown upon Tess’s pillow anew, and how she resolved, with a bursting\nheart, to tell all her history to Angel Clare, despite her mother’s\ncommand—to let him for whom she lived and breathed despise her if he\nwould, and her mother regard her as a fool, rather then preserve a\nsilence which might be deemed a treachery to him, and which somehow\nseemed a wrong to these.\n\n\nXXXII\n\nThis penitential mood kept her from naming the wedding-day. The\nbeginning of November found its date still in abeyance, though he asked\nher at the most tempting times. But Tess’s desire seemed to be for a\nperpetual betrothal in which everything should remain as it was then.\n\nThe meads were changing now; but it was still warm enough in early\nafternoons before milking to idle there awhile, and the state of\ndairy-work at this time of year allowed a spare hour for idling.\nLooking over the damp sod in the direction of the sun, a glistening\nripple of gossamer webs was visible to their eyes under the luminary,\nlike the track of moonlight on the sea. Gnats, knowing nothing of their\nbrief glorification, wandered across the shimmer of this pathway,\nirradiated as if they bore fire within them, then passed out of its\nline, and were quite extinct. In the presence of these things he would\nremind her that the date was still the question.\n\nOr he would ask her at night, when he accompanied her on some mission\ninvented by Mrs Crick to give him the opportunity. This was mostly a\njourney to the farmhouse on the slopes above the vale, to inquire how\nthe advanced cows were getting on in the straw-barton to which they\nwere relegated. For it was a time of the year that brought great\nchanges to the world of kine. Batches of the animals were sent away\ndaily to this lying-in hospital, where they lived on straw till their\ncalves were born, after which event, and as soon as the calf could\nwalk, mother and offspring were driven back to the dairy. In the\ninterval which elapsed before the calves were sold there was, of\ncourse, little milking to be done, but as soon as the calf had been\ntaken away the milkmaids would have to set to work as usual.\n\nReturning from one of these dark walks they reached a great\ngravel-cliff immediately over the levels, where they stood still and\nlistened. The water was now high in the streams, squirting through the\nweirs, and tinkling under culverts; the smallest gullies were all full;\nthere was no taking short cuts anywhere, and foot-passengers were\ncompelled to follow the permanent ways. From the whole extent of the\ninvisible vale came a multitudinous intonation; it forced upon their\nfancy that a great city lay below them, and that the murmur was the\nvociferation of its populace.\n\n“It seems like tens of thousands of them,” said Tess; “holding\npublic-meetings in their market-places, arguing, preaching,\nquarrelling, sobbing, groaning, praying, and cursing.”\n\nClare was not particularly heeding.\n\n“Did Crick speak to you to-day, dear, about his not wanting much\nassistance during the winter months?”\n\n“No.”\n\n“The cows are going dry rapidly.”\n\n“Yes. Six or seven went to the straw-barton yesterday, and three the\nday before, making nearly twenty in the straw already. Ah—is it that\nthe farmer don’t want my help for the calving? O, I am not wanted here\nany more! And I have tried so hard to—”\n\n“Crick didn’t exactly say that he would no longer require you. But,\nknowing what our relations were, he said in the most good-natured and\nrespectful manner possible that he supposed on my leaving at Christmas\nI should take you with me, and on my asking what he would do without\nyou he merely observed that, as a matter of fact, it was a time of year\nwhen he could do with a very little female help. I am afraid I was\nsinner enough to feel rather glad that he was in this way forcing your\nhand.”\n\n“I don’t think you ought to have felt glad, Angel. Because ’tis always\nmournful not to be wanted, even if at the same time ’tis convenient.”\n\n“Well, it is convenient—you have admitted that.” He put his finger upon\nher cheek. “Ah!” he said.\n\n“What?”\n\n“I feel the red rising up at her having been caught! But why should I\ntrifle so! We will not trifle—life is too serious.”\n\n“It is. Perhaps I saw that before you did.”\n\nShe was seeing it then. To decline to marry him after all—in obedience\nto her emotion of last night—and leave the dairy, meant to go to some\nstrange place, not a dairy; for milkmaids were not in request now\ncalving-time was coming on; to go to some arable farm where no divine\nbeing like Angel Clare was. She hated the thought, and she hated more\nthe thought of going home.\n\n“So that, seriously, dearest Tess,” he continued, “since you will\nprobably have to leave at Christmas, it is in every way desirable and\nconvenient that I should carry you off then as my property. Besides, if\nyou were not the most uncalculating girl in the world you would know\nthat we could not go on like this for ever.”\n\n“I wish we could. That it would always be summer and autumn, and you\nalways courting me, and always thinking as much of me as you have done\nthrough the past summer-time!”\n\n“I always shall.”\n\n“O, I know you will!” she cried, with a sudden fervour of faith in him.\n“Angel, I will fix the day when I will become yours for always!”\n\nThus at last it was arranged between them, during that dark walk home,\namid the myriads of liquid voices on the right and left.\n\nWhen they reached the dairy Mr and Mrs Crick were promptly told—with\ninjunctions of secrecy; for each of the lovers was desirous that the\nmarriage should be kept as private as possible. The dairyman, though he\nhad thought of dismissing her soon, now made a great concern about\nlosing her. What should he do about his skimming? Who would make the\nornamental butter-pats for the Anglebury and Sandbourne ladies? Mrs\nCrick congratulated Tess on the shilly-shallying having at last come to\nan end, and said that directly she set eyes on Tess she divined that\nshe was to be the chosen one of somebody who was no common outdoor man;\nTess had looked so superior as she walked across the barton on that\nafternoon of her arrival; that she was of a good family she could have\nsworn. In point of fact Mrs Crick did remember thinking that Tess was\ngraceful and good-looking as she approached; but the superiority might\nhave been a growth of the imagination aided by subsequent knowledge.\n\nTess was now carried along upon the wings of the hours, without the\nsense of a will. The word had been given; the number of the day written\ndown. Her naturally bright intelligence had begun to admit the\nfatalistic convictions common to field-folk and those who associate\nmore extensively with natural phenomena than with their\nfellow-creatures; and she accordingly drifted into that passive\nresponsiveness to all things her lover suggested, characteristic of the\nframe of mind.\n\nBut she wrote anew to her mother, ostensibly to notify the wedding-day;\nreally to again implore her advice. It was a gentleman who had chosen\nher, which perhaps her mother had not sufficiently considered. A\npost-nuptial explanation, which might be accepted with a light heart by\na rougher man, might not be received with the same feeling by him. But\nthis communication brought no reply from Mrs Durbeyfield.\n\nDespite Angel Clare’s plausible representation to himself and to Tess\nof the practical need for their immediate marriage, there was in truth\nan element of precipitancy in the step, as became apparent at a later\ndate. He loved her dearly, though perhaps rather ideally and fancifully\nthan with the impassioned thoroughness of her feeling for him. He had\nentertained no notion, when doomed as he had thought to an\nunintellectual bucolic life, that such charms as he beheld in this\nidyllic creature would be found behind the scenes. Unsophistication was\na thing to talk of; but he had not known how it really struck one until\nhe came here. Yet he was very far from seeing his future track clearly,\nand it might be a year or two before he would be able to consider\nhimself fairly started in life. The secret lay in the tinge of\nrecklessness imparted to his career and character by the sense that he\nhad been made to miss his true destiny through the prejudices of his\nfamily.\n\n“Don’t you think ’twould have been better for us to wait till you were\nquite settled in your midland farm?” she once asked timidly. (A midland\nfarm was the idea just then.)\n\n“To tell the truth, my Tess, I don’t like you to be left anywhere away\nfrom my protection and sympathy.”\n\nThe reason was a good one, so far as it went. His influence over her\nhad been so marked that she had caught his manner and habits, his\nspeech and phrases, his likings and his aversions. And to leave her in\nfarmland would be to let her slip back again out of accord with him. He\nwished to have her under his charge for another reason. His parents had\nnaturally desired to see her once at least before he carried her off to\na distant settlement, English or colonial; and as no opinion of theirs\nwas to be allowed to change his intention, he judged that a couple of\nmonths’ life with him in lodgings whilst seeking for an advantageous\nopening would be of some social assistance to her at what she might\nfeel to be a trying ordeal—her presentation to his mother at the\nVicarage.\n\nNext, he wished to see a little of the working of a flour-mill, having\nan idea that he might combine the use of one with corn-growing. The\nproprietor of a large old water-mill at Wellbridge—once the mill of an\nAbbey—had offered him the inspection of his time-honoured mode of\nprocedure, and a hand in the operations for a few days, whenever he\nshould choose to come. Clare paid a visit to the place, some few miles\ndistant, one day at this time, to inquire particulars, and returned to\nTalbothays in the evening. She found him determined to spend a short\ntime at the Wellbridge flour-mills. And what had determined him? Less\nthe opportunity of an insight into grinding and bolting than the casual\nfact that lodgings were to be obtained in that very farmhouse which,\nbefore its mutilation, had been the mansion of a branch of the\nd’Urberville family. This was always how Clare settled practical\nquestions; by a sentiment which had nothing to do with them. They\ndecided to go immediately after the wedding, and remain for a\nfortnight, instead of journeying to towns and inns.\n\n“Then we will start off to examine some farms on the other side of\nLondon that I have heard of,” he said, “and by March or April we will\npay a visit to my father and mother.”\n\nQuestions of procedure such as these arose and passed, and the day, the\nincredible day, on which she was to become his, loomed large in the\nnear future. The thirty-first of December, New Year’s Eve, was the\ndate. His wife, she said to herself. Could it ever be? Their two selves\ntogether, nothing to divide them, every incident shared by them; why\nnot? And yet why?\n\nOne Sunday morning Izz Huett returned from church, and spoke privately\nto Tess.\n\n“You was not called home this morning.”\n\n“What?”\n\n“It should ha’ been the first time of asking to-day,” she answered,\nlooking quietly at Tess. “You meant to be married New Year’s Eve,\ndeary?”\n\nThe other returned a quick affirmative.\n\n“And there must be three times of asking. And now there be only two\nSundays left between.”\n\nTess felt her cheek paling; Izz was right; of course there must be\nthree. Perhaps he had forgotten! If so, there must be a week’s\npostponement, and that was unlucky. How could she remind her lover? She\nwho had been so backward was suddenly fired with impatience and alarm\nlest she should lose her dear prize.\n\nA natural incident relieved her anxiety. Izz mentioned the omission of\nthe banns to Mrs Crick, and Mrs Crick assumed a matron’s privilege of\nspeaking to Angel on the point.\n\n“Have ye forgot ’em, Mr Clare? The banns, I mean.”\n\n“No, I have not forgot ’em,” says Clare.\n\nAs soon as he caught Tess alone he assured her:\n\n“Don’t let them tease you about the banns. A licence will be quieter\nfor us, and I have decided on a licence without consulting you. So if\nyou go to church on Sunday morning you will not hear your own name, if\nyou wished to.”\n\n“I didn’t wish to hear it, dearest,” she said proudly.\n\nBut to know that things were in train was an immense relief to Tess\nnotwithstanding, who had well-nigh feared that somebody would stand up\nand forbid the banns on the ground of her history. How events were\nfavouring her!\n\n“I don’t quite feel easy,” she said to herself. “All this good fortune\nmay be scourged out of me afterwards by a lot of ill. That’s how Heaven\nmostly does. I wish I could have had common banns!”\n\nBut everything went smoothly. She wondered whether he would like her to\nbe married in her present best white frock, or if she ought to buy a\nnew one. The question was set at rest by his forethought, disclosed by\nthe arrival of some large packages addressed to her. Inside them she\nfound a whole stock of clothing, from bonnet to shoes, including a\nperfect morning costume, such as would well suit the simple wedding\nthey planned. He entered the house shortly after the arrival of the\npackages, and heard her upstairs undoing them.\n\nA minute later she came down with a flush on her face and tears in her\neyes.\n\n“How thoughtful you’ve been!” she murmured, her cheek upon his\nshoulder. “Even to the gloves and handkerchief! My own love—how good,\nhow kind!”\n\n“No, no, Tess; just an order to a tradeswoman in London—nothing more.”\n\nAnd to divert her from thinking too highly of him, he told her to go\nupstairs, and take her time, and see if it all fitted; and, if not, to\nget the village sempstress to make a few alterations.\n\nShe did return upstairs, and put on the gown. Alone, she stood for a\nmoment before the glass looking at the effect of her silk attire; and\nthen there came into her head her mother’s ballad of the mystic robe—\n\n    That never would become that wife\n    That had once done amiss,\n\nwhich Mrs Durbeyfield had used to sing to her as a child, so blithely\nand so archly, her foot on the cradle, which she rocked to the tune.\nSuppose this robe should betray her by changing colour, as her robe had\nbetrayed Queen Guinevere. Since she had been at the dairy she had not\nonce thought of the lines till now.\n\n\nXXXIII\n\nAngel felt that he would like to spend a day with her before the\nwedding, somewhere away from the dairy, as a last jaunt in her company\nwhile there were yet mere lover and mistress; a romantic day, in\ncircumstances that would never be repeated; with that other and greater\nday beaming close ahead of them. During the preceding week, therefore,\nhe suggested making a few purchases in the nearest town, and they\nstarted together.\n\nClare’s life at the dairy had been that of a recluse in respect the\nworld of his own class. For months he had never gone near a town, and,\nrequiring no vehicle, had never kept one, hiring the dairyman’s cob or\ngig if he rode or drove. They went in the gig that day.\n\nAnd then for the first time in their lives they shopped as partners in\none concern. It was Christmas Eve, with its loads a holly and\nmistletoe, and the town was very full of strangers who had come in from\nall parts of the country on account of the day. Tess paid the penalty\nof walking about with happiness superadded to beauty on her countenance\nby being much stared at as she moved amid them on his arm.\n\nIn the evening they returned to the inn at which they had put up, and\nTess waited in the entry while Angel went to see the horse and gig\nbrought to the door. The general sitting-room was full of guests, who\nwere continually going in and out. As the door opened and shut each\ntime for the passage of these, the light within the parlour fell full\nupon Tess’s face. Two men came out and passed by her among the rest.\nOne of them had stared her up and down in surprise, and she fancied he\nwas a Trantridge man, though that village lay so many miles off that\nTrantridge folk were rarities here.\n\n“A comely maid that,” said the other.\n\n“True, comely enough. But unless I make a great mistake—” And he\nnegatived the remainder of the definition forthwith.\n\nClare had just returned from the stable-yard, and, confronting the man\non the threshold, heard the words, and saw the shrinking of Tess. The\ninsult to her stung him to the quick, and before he had considered\nanything at all he struck the man on the chin with the full force of\nhis fist, sending him staggering backwards into the passage.\n\nThe man recovered himself, and seemed inclined to come on, and Clare,\nstepping outside the door, put himself in a posture of defence. But his\nopponent began to think better of the matter. He looked anew at Tess as\nhe passed her, and said to Clare—\n\n“I beg pardon, sir; ’twas a complete mistake. I thought she was another\nwoman, forty miles from here.”\n\nClare, feeling then that he had been too hasty, and that he was,\nmoreover, to blame for leaving her standing in an inn-passage, did what\nhe usually did in such cases, gave the man five shillings to plaster\nthe blow; and thus they parted, bidding each other a pacific good\nnight. As soon as Clare had taken the reins from the ostler, and the\nyoung couple had driven off, the two men went in the other direction.\n\n“And was it a mistake?” said the second one.\n\n“Not a bit of it. But I didn’t want to hurt the gentleman’s\nfeelings—not I.”\n\nIn the meantime the lovers were driving onward.\n\n“Could we put off our wedding till a little later?” Tess asked in a dry\ndull voice. “I mean if we wished?”\n\n“No, my love. Calm yourself. Do you mean that the fellow may have time\nto summon me for assault?” he asked good-humouredly.\n\n“No—I only meant—if it should have to be put off.”\n\nWhat she meant was not very clear, and he directed her to dismiss such\nfancies from her mind, which she obediently did as well as she could.\nBut she was grave, very grave, all the way home; till she thought, “We\nshall go away, a very long distance, hundreds of miles from these\nparts, and such as this can never happen again, and no ghost of the\npast reach there.”\n\nThey parted tenderly that night on the landing, and Clare ascended to\nhis attic. Tess sat up getting on with some little requisites, lest the\nfew remaining days should not afford sufficient time. While she sat she\nheard a noise in Angel’s room overhead, a sound of thumping and\nstruggling. Everybody else in the house was asleep, and in her anxiety\nlest Clare should be ill she ran up and knocked at his door, and asked\nhim what was the matter.\n\n“Oh, nothing, dear,” he said from within. “I am so sorry I disturbed\nyou! But the reason is rather an amusing one: I fell asleep and dreamt\nthat I was fighting that fellow again who insulted you, and the noise\nyou heard was my pummelling away with my fists at my portmanteau, which\nI pulled out to-day for packing. I am occasionally liable to these\nfreaks in my sleep. Go to bed and think of it no more.”\n\nThis was the last drachm required to turn the scale of her indecision.\nDeclare the past to him by word of mouth she could not; but there was\nanother way. She sat down and wrote on the four pages of a note-sheet a\nsuccinct narrative of those events of three or four years ago, put it\ninto an envelope, and directed it to Clare. Then, lest the flesh should\nagain be weak, she crept upstairs without any shoes and slipped the\nnote under his door.\n\nHer night was a broken one, as it well might be, and she listened for\nthe first faint noise overhead. It came, as usual; he descended, as\nusual. She descended. He met her at the bottom of the stairs and kissed\nher. Surely it was as warmly as ever!\n\nHe looked a little disturbed and worn, she thought. But he said not a\nword to her about her revelation, even when they were alone. Could he\nhave had it? Unless he began the subject she felt that she could say\nnothing. So the day passed, and it was evident that whatever he thought\nhe meant to keep to himself. Yet he was frank and affectionate as\nbefore. Could it be that her doubts were childish? that he forgave her;\nthat he loved her for what she was, just as she was, and smiled at her\ndisquiet as at a foolish nightmare? Had he really received her note?\nShe glanced into his room, and could see nothing of it. It might be\nthat he forgave her. But even if he had not received it she had a\nsudden enthusiastic trust that he surely would forgive her.\n\nEvery morning and night he was the same, and thus New Year’s Eve\nbroke—the wedding day.\n\nThe lovers did not rise at milking-time, having through the whole of\nthis last week of their sojourn at the dairy been accorded something of\nthe position of guests, Tess being honoured with a room of her own.\nWhen they arrived downstairs at breakfast-time they were surprised to\nsee what effects had been produced in the large kitchen for their glory\nsince they had last beheld it. At some unnatural hour of the morning\nthe dairyman had caused the yawning chimney-corner to be whitened, and\nthe brick hearth reddened, and a blazing yellow damask blower to be\nhung across the arch in place of the old grimy blue cotton one with a\nblack sprig pattern which had formerly done duty there. This renovated\naspect of what was the focus indeed of the room on a full winter\nmorning threw a smiling demeanour over the whole apartment.\n\n“I was determined to do summat in honour o’t”, said the dairyman. “And\nas you wouldn’t hear of my gieing a rattling good randy wi’ fiddles and\nbass-viols complete, as we should ha’ done in old times, this was all I\ncould think o’ as a noiseless thing.”\n\nTess’s friends lived so far off that none could conveniently have been\npresent at the ceremony, even had any been asked; but as a fact nobody\nwas invited from Marlott. As for Angel’s family, he had written and\nduly informed them of the time, and assured them that he would be glad\nto see one at least of them there for the day if he would like to come.\nHis brothers had not replied at all, seeming to be indignant with him;\nwhile his father and mother had written a rather sad letter, deploring\nhis precipitancy in rushing into marriage, but making the best of the\nmatter by saying that, though a dairywoman was the last daughter-in-law\nthey could have expected, their son had arrived at an age which he\nmight be supposed to be the best judge.\n\nThis coolness in his relations distressed Clare less than it would have\ndone had he been without the grand card with which he meant to surprise\nthem ere long. To produce Tess, fresh from the dairy, as a d’Urberville\nand a lady, he had felt to be temerarious and risky; hence he had\nconcealed her lineage till such time as, familiarized with worldly ways\nby a few months’ travel and reading with him, he could take her on a\nvisit to his parents and impart the knowledge while triumphantly\nproducing her as worthy of such an ancient line. It was a pretty\nlover’s dream, if no more. Perhaps Tess’s lineage had more value for\nhimself than for anybody in the world beside.\n\nHer perception that Angel’s bearing towards her still remained in no\nwhit altered by her own communication rendered Tess guiltily doubtful\nif he could have received it. She rose from breakfast before he had\nfinished, and hastened upstairs. It had occurred to her to look once\nmore into the queer gaunt room which had been Clare’s den, or rather\neyrie, for so long, and climbing the ladder she stood at the open door\nof the apartment, regarding and pondering. She stooped to the threshold\nof the doorway, where she had pushed in the note two or three days\nearlier in such excitement. The carpet reached close to the sill, and\nunder the edge of the carpet she discerned the faint white margin of\nthe envelope containing her letter to him, which he obviously had never\nseen, owing to her having in her haste thrust it beneath the carpet as\nwell as beneath the door.\n\nWith a feeling of faintness she withdrew the letter. There it\nwas—sealed up, just as it had left her hands. The mountain had not yet\nbeen removed. She could not let him read it now, the house being in\nfull bustle of preparation; and descending to her own room she\ndestroyed the letter there.\n\nShe was so pale when he saw her again that he felt quite anxious. The\nincident of the misplaced letter she had jumped at as if it prevented a\nconfession; but she knew in her conscience that it need not; there was\nstill time. Yet everything was in a stir; there was coming and going;\nall had to dress, the dairyman and Mrs Crick having been asked to\naccompany them as witnesses; and reflection or deliberate talk was\nwell-nigh impossible. The only minute Tess could get to be alone with\nClare was when they met upon the landing.\n\n“I am so anxious to talk to you—I want to confess all my faults and\nblunders!” she said with attempted lightness.\n\n“No, no—we can’t have faults talked of—you must be deemed perfect\nto-day at least, my Sweet!” he cried. “We shall have plenty of time,\nhereafter, I hope, to talk over our failings. I will confess mine at\nthe same time.”\n\n“But it would be better for me to do it now, I think, so that you could\nnot say—”\n\n“Well, my quixotic one, you shall tell me anything—say, as soon as we\nare settled in our lodging; not now. I, too, will tell you my faults\nthen. But do not let us spoil the day with them; they will be excellent\nmatter for a dull time.”\n\n“Then you don’t wish me to, dearest?”\n\n“I do not, Tessy, really.”\n\nThe hurry of dressing and starting left no time for more than this.\nThose words of his seemed to reassure her on further reflection. She\nwas whirled onward through the next couple of critical hours by the\nmastering tide of her devotion to him, which closed up further\nmeditation. Her one desire, so long resisted, to make herself his, to\ncall him her lord, her own—then, if necessary, to die—had at last\nlifted her up from her plodding reflective pathway. In dressing, she\nmoved about in a mental cloud of many-coloured idealities, which\neclipsed all sinister contingencies by its brightness.\n\nThe church was a long way off, and they were obliged to drive,\nparticularly as it was winter. A closed carriage was ordered from a\nroadside inn, a vehicle which had been kept there ever since the old\ndays of post-chaise travelling. It had stout wheel-spokes and heavy\nfelloes, a great curved bed, immense straps and springs, and a pole\nlike a battering-ram. The postilion was a venerable “boy” of sixty—a\nmartyr to rheumatic gout, the result of excessive exposure in youth,\ncounter-acted by strong liquors—who had stood at inn-doors doing\nnothing for the whole five-and-twenty years that had elapsed since he\nhad no longer been required to ride professionally, as if expecting the\nold times to come back again. He had a permanent running wound on the\noutside of his right leg, originated by the constant bruisings of\naristocratic carriage-poles during the many years that he had been in\nregular employ at the King’s Arms, Casterbridge.\n\nInside this cumbrous and creaking structure, and behind this decayed\nconductor, the _partie carrée_ took their seats—the bride and\nbridegroom and Mr and Mrs Crick. Angel would have liked one at least of\nhis brothers to be present as groomsman, but their silence after his\ngentle hint to that effect by letter had signified that they did not\ncare to come. They disapproved of the marriage, and could not be\nexpected to countenance it. Perhaps it was as well that they could not\nbe present. They were not worldly young fellows, but fraternizing with\ndairy-folk would have struck unpleasantly upon their biased niceness,\napart from their views of the match.\n\nUpheld by the momentum of the time, Tess knew nothing of this, did not\nsee anything, did not know the road they were taking to the church. She\nknew that Angel was close to her; all the rest was a luminous mist. She\nwas a sort of celestial person, who owed her being to poetry—one of\nthose classical divinities Clare was accustomed to talk to her about\nwhen they took their walks together.\n\nThe marriage being by licence there were only a dozen or so of people\nin the church; had there been a thousand they would have produced no\nmore effect upon her. They were at stellar distances from her present\nworld. In the ecstatic solemnity with which she swore her faith to him\nthe ordinary sensibilities of sex seemed a flippancy. At a pause in the\nservice, while they were kneeling together, she unconsciously inclined\nherself towards him, so that her shoulder touched his arm; she had been\nfrightened by a passing thought, and the movement had been automatic,\nto assure herself that he was really there, and to fortify her belief\nthat his fidelity would be proof against all things.\n\nClare knew that she loved him—every curve of her form showed that—but\nhe did not know at that time the full depth of her devotion, its\nsingle-mindedness, its meekness; what long-suffering it guaranteed,\nwhat honesty, what endurance, what good faith.\n\nAs they came out of church the ringers swung the bells off their rests,\nand a modest peal of three notes broke forth—that limited amount of\nexpression having been deemed sufficient by the church builders for the\njoys of such a small parish. Passing by the tower with her husband on\nthe path to the gate she could feel the vibrant air humming round them\nfrom the louvred belfry in the circle of sound, and it matched the\nhighly-charged mental atmosphere in which she was living.\n\nThis condition of mind, wherein she felt glorified by an irradiation\nnot her own, like the angel whom St John saw in the sun, lasted till\nthe sound of the church bells had died away, and the emotions of the\nwedding-service had calmed down. Her eyes could dwell upon details more\nclearly now, and Mr and Mrs Crick having directed their own gig to be\nsent for them, to leave the carriage to the young couple, she observed\nthe build and character of that conveyance for the first time. Sitting\nin silence she regarded it long.\n\n“I fancy you seem oppressed, Tessy,” said Clare.\n\n“Yes,” she answered, putting her hand to her brow. “I tremble at many\nthings. It is all so serious, Angel. Among other things I seem to have\nseen this carriage before, to be very well acquainted with it. It is\nvery odd—I must have seen it in a dream.”\n\n“Oh—you have heard the legend of the d’Urberville Coach—that well-known\nsuperstition of this county about your family when they were very\npopular here; and this lumbering old thing reminds you of it.”\n\n“I have never heard of it to my knowledge,” said she. “What is the\nlegend—may I know it?”\n\n“Well—I would rather not tell it in detail just now. A certain\nd’Urberville of the sixteenth or seventeenth century committed a\ndreadful crime in his family coach; and since that time members of the\nfamily see or hear the old coach whenever—— But I’ll tell you another\nday—it is rather gloomy. Evidently some dim knowledge of it has been\nbrought back to your mind by the sight of this venerable caravan.”\n\n“I don’t remember hearing it before,” she murmured. “Is it when we are\ngoing to die, Angel, that members of my family see it, or is it when we\nhave committed a crime?”\n\n“Now, Tess!”\n\nHe silenced her by a kiss.\n\nBy the time they reached home she was contrite and spiritless. She was\nMrs Angel Clare, indeed, but had she any moral right to the name? Was\nshe not more truly Mrs Alexander d’Urberville? Could intensity of love\njustify what might be considered in upright souls as culpable\nreticence? She knew not what was expected of women in such cases; and\nshe had no counsellor.\n\nHowever, when she found herself alone in her room for a few minutes—the\nlast day this on which she was ever to enter it—she knelt down and\nprayed. She tried to pray to God, but it was her husband who really had\nher supplication. Her idolatry of this man was such that she herself\nalmost feared it to be ill-omened. She was conscious of the notion\nexpressed by Friar Laurence: “These violent delights have violent\nends.” It might be too desperate for human conditions—too rank, to\nwild, too deadly.\n\n“O my love, why do I love you so!” she whispered there alone; “for she\nyou love is not my real self, but one in my image; the one I might have\nbeen!”\n\nAfternoon came, and with it the hour for departure. They had decided to\nfulfil the plan of going for a few days to the lodgings in the old\nfarmhouse near Wellbridge Mill, at which he meant to reside during his\ninvestigation of flour processes. At two o’clock there was nothing left\nto do but to start. All the servantry of the dairy were standing in the\nred-brick entry to see them go out, the dairyman and his wife following\nto the door. Tess saw her three chamber-mates in a row against the\nwall, pensively inclining their heads. She had much questioned if they\nwould appear at the parting moment; but there they were, stoical and\nstaunch to the last. She knew why the delicate Retty looked so fragile,\nand Izz so tragically sorrowful, and Marian so blank; and she forgot\nher own dogging shadow for a moment in contemplating theirs.\n\nShe impulsively whispered to him—\n\n“Will you kiss ’em all, once, poor things, for the first and last\ntime?”\n\nClare had not the least objection to such a farewell formality—which\nwas all that it was to him—and as he passed them he kissed them in\nsuccession where they stood, saying “Goodbye” to each as he did so.\nWhen they reached the door Tess femininely glanced back to discern the\neffect of that kiss of charity; there was no triumph in her glance, as\nthere might have been. If there had it would have disappeared when she\nsaw how moved the girls all were. The kiss had obviously done harm by\nawakening feelings they were trying to subdue.\n\nOf all this Clare was unconscious. Passing on to the wicket-gate he\nshook hands with the dairyman and his wife, and expressed his last\nthanks to them for their attentions; after which there was a moment of\nsilence before they had moved off. It was interrupted by the crowing of\na cock. The white one with the rose comb had come and settled on the\npalings in front of the house, within a few yards of them, and his\nnotes thrilled their ears through, dwindling away like echoes down a\nvalley of rocks.\n\n“Oh?” said Mrs Crick. “An afternoon crow!”\n\nTwo men were standing by the yard gate, holding it open.\n\n“That’s bad,” one murmured to the other, not thinking that the words\ncould be heard by the group at the door-wicket.\n\nThe cock crew again—straight towards Clare.\n\n“Well!” said the dairyman.\n\n“I don’t like to hear him!” said Tess to her husband. “Tell the man to\ndrive on. Goodbye, goodbye!”\n\nThe cock crew again.\n\n“Hoosh! Just you be off, sir, or I’ll twist your neck!” said the\ndairyman with some irritation, turning to the bird and driving him\naway. And to his wife as they went indoors: “Now, to think o’ that just\nto-day! I’ve not heard his crow of an afternoon all the year afore.”\n\n“It only means a change in the weather,” said she; “not what you think:\n’tis impossible!”\n\n\nXXXIV\n\nThey drove by the level road along the valley to a distance of a few\nmiles, and, reaching Wellbridge, turned away from the village to the\nleft, and over the great Elizabethan bridge which gives the place half\nits name. Immediately behind it stood the house wherein they had\nengaged lodgings, whose exterior features are so well known to all\ntravellers through the Froom Valley; once portion of a fine manorial\nresidence, and the property and seat of a d’Urberville, but since its\npartial demolition a farmhouse.\n\n“Welcome to one of your ancestral mansions!” said Clare as he handed\nher down. But he regretted the pleasantry; it was too near a satire.\n\nOn entering they found that, though they had only engaged a couple of\nrooms, the farmer had taken advantage of their proposed presence during\nthe coming days to pay a New Year’s visit to some friends, leaving a\nwoman from a neighbouring cottage to minister to their few wants. The\nabsoluteness of possession pleased them, and they realized it as the\nfirst moment of their experience under their own exclusive roof-tree.\n\nBut he found that the mouldy old habitation somewhat depressed his\nbride. When the carriage was gone they ascended the stairs to wash\ntheir hands, the charwoman showing the way. On the landing Tess stopped\nand started.\n\n“What’s the matter?” said he.\n\n“Those horrid women!” she answered with a smile. “How they frightened\nme.”\n\nHe looked up, and perceived two life-size portraits on panels built\ninto the masonry. As all visitors to the mansion are aware, these\npaintings represent women of middle age, of a date some two hundred\nyears ago, whose lineaments once seen can never be forgotten. The long\npointed features, narrow eye, and smirk of the one, so suggestive of\nmerciless treachery; the bill-hook nose, large teeth, and bold eye of\nthe other suggesting arrogance to the point of ferocity, haunt the\nbeholder afterwards in his dreams.\n\n“Whose portraits are those?” asked Clare of the charwoman.\n\n“I have been told by old folk that they were ladies of the d’Urberville\nfamily, the ancient lords of this manor,” she said, “Owing to their\nbeing builded into the wall they can’t be moved away.”\n\nThe unpleasantness of the matter was that, in addition to their effect\nupon Tess, her fine features were unquestionably traceable in these\nexaggerated forms. He said nothing of this, however, and, regretting\nthat he had gone out of his way to choose the house for their bridal\ntime, went on into the adjoining room. The place having been rather\nhastily prepared for them, they washed their hands in one basin. Clare\ntouched hers under the water.\n\n“Which are my fingers and which are yours?” he said, looking up. “They\nare very much mixed.”\n\n“They are all yours,” said she, very prettily, and endeavoured to be\ngayer than she was. He had not been displeased with her thoughtfulness\non such an occasion; it was what every sensible woman would show: but\nTess knew that she had been thoughtful to excess, and struggled against\nit.\n\nThe sun was so low on that short last afternoon of the year that it\nshone in through a small opening and formed a golden staff which\nstretched across to her skirt, where it made a spot like a paint-mark\nset upon her. They went into the ancient parlour to tea, and here they\nshared their first common meal alone. Such was their childishness, or\nrather his, that he found it interesting to use the same\nbread-and-butter plate as herself, and to brush crumbs from her lips\nwith his own. He wondered a little that she did not enter into these\nfrivolities with his own zest.\n\nLooking at her silently for a long time; “She is a dear dear Tess,” he\nthought to himself, as one deciding on the true construction of a\ndifficult passage. “Do I realize solemnly enough how utterly and\nirretrievably this little womanly thing is the creature of my good or\nbad faith and fortune? I think not. I think I could not, unless I were\na woman myself. What I am in worldly estate, she is. What I become, she\nmust become. What I cannot be, she cannot be. And shall I ever neglect\nher, or hurt her, or even forget to consider her? God forbid such a\ncrime!”\n\nThey sat on over the tea-table waiting for their luggage, which the\ndairyman had promised to send before it grew dark. But evening began to\nclose in, and the luggage did not arrive, and they had brought nothing\nmore than they stood in. With the departure of the sun the calm mood of\nthe winter day changed. Out of doors there began noises as of silk\nsmartly rubbed; the restful dead leaves of the preceding autumn were\nstirred to irritated resurrection, and whirled about unwillingly, and\ntapped against the shutters. It soon began to rain.\n\n“That cock knew the weather was going to change,” said Clare.\n\nThe woman who had attended upon them had gone home for the night, but\nshe had placed candles upon the table, and now they lit them. Each\ncandle-flame drew towards the fireplace.\n\n“These old houses are so draughty,” continued Angel, looking at the\nflames, and at the grease guttering down the sides. “I wonder where\nthat luggage is. We haven’t even a brush and comb.”\n\n“I don’t know,” she answered, absent-minded.\n\n“Tess, you are not a bit cheerful this evening—not at all as you used\nto be. Those harridans on the panels upstairs have unsettled you. I am\nsorry I brought you here. I wonder if you really love me, after all?”\n\nHe knew that she did, and the words had no serious intent; but she was\nsurcharged with emotion, and winced like a wounded animal. Though she\ntried not to shed tears, she could not help showing one or two.\n\n“I did not mean it!” said he, sorry. “You are worried at not having\nyour things, I know. I cannot think why old Jonathan has not come with\nthem. Why, it is seven o’clock? Ah, there he is!”\n\nA knock had come to the door, and, there being nobody else to answer\nit, Clare went out. He returned to the room with a small package in his\nhand.\n\n“It is not Jonathan, after all,” he said.\n\n“How vexing!” said Tess.\n\nThe packet had been brought by a special messenger, who had arrived at\nTalbothays from Emminster Vicarage immediately after the departure of\nthe married couple, and had followed them hither, being under\ninjunction to deliver it into nobody’s hands but theirs. Clare brought\nit to the light. It was less than a foot long, sewed up in canvas,\nsealed in red wax with his father’s seal, and directed in his father’s\nhand to “Mrs Angel Clare.”\n\n“It is a little wedding-present for you, Tess,” said he, handing it to\nher. “How thoughtful they are!”\n\nTess looked a little flustered as she took it.\n\n“I think I would rather have you open it, dearest,” said she, turning\nover the parcel. “I don’t like to break those great seals; they look so\nserious. Please open it for me!”\n\nHe undid the parcel. Inside was a case of morocco leather, on the top\nof which lay a note and a key.\n\nThe note was for Clare, in the following words:\n\n    My dear son,—\n\n    Possibly you have forgotten that on the death of your godmother,\n    Mrs Pitney, when you were a lad, she—vain, kind woman that she\n    was—left to me a portion of the contents of her jewel-case in trust\n    for your wife, if you should ever have one, as a mark of her\n    affection for you and whomsoever you should choose. This trust I\n    have fulfilled, and the diamonds have been locked up at my banker’s\n    ever since. Though I feel it to be a somewhat incongruous act in\n    the circumstances, I am, as you will see, bound to hand over the\n    articles to the woman to whom the use of them for her lifetime will\n    now rightly belong, and they are therefore promptly sent. They\n    become, I believe, heirlooms, strictly speaking, according to the\n    terms of your godmother’s will. The precise words of the clause\n    that refers to this matter are enclosed.\n\n\n“I do remember,” said Clare; “but I had quite forgotten.”\n\nUnlocking the case, they found it to contain a necklace, with pendant,\nbracelets, and ear-rings; and also some other small ornaments.\n\nTess seemed afraid to touch them at first, but her eyes sparkled for a\nmoment as much as the stones when Clare spread out the set.\n\n“Are they mine?” she asked incredulously.\n\n“They are, certainly,” said he.\n\nHe looked into the fire. He remembered how, when he was a lad of\nfifteen, his godmother, the Squire’s wife—the only rich person with\nwhom he had ever come in contact—had pinned her faith to his success;\nhad prophesied a wondrous career for him. There had seemed nothing at\nall out of keeping with such a conjectured career in the storing up of\nthese showy ornaments for his wife and the wives of her descendants.\nThey gleamed somewhat ironically now. “Yet why?” he asked himself. It\nwas but a question of vanity throughout; and if that were admitted into\none side of the equation it should be admitted into the other. His wife\nwas a d’Urberville: whom could they become better than her?\n\nSuddenly he said with enthusiasm—\n\n“Tess, put them on—put them on!” And he turned from the fire to help\nher.\n\nBut as if by magic she had already donned them—necklace, ear-rings,\nbracelets, and all.\n\n“But the gown isn’t right, Tess,” said Clare. “It ought to be a low one\nfor a set of brilliants like that.”\n\n“Ought it?” said Tess.\n\n“Yes,” said he.\n\nHe suggested to her how to tuck in the upper edge of her bodice, so as\nto make it roughly approximate to the cut for evening wear; and when\nshe had done this, and the pendant to the necklace hung isolated amid\nthe whiteness of her throat, as it was designed to do, he stepped back\nto survey her.\n\n“My heavens,” said Clare, “how beautiful you are!”\n\nAs everybody knows, fine feathers make fine birds; a peasant girl but\nvery moderately prepossessing to the casual observer in her simple\ncondition and attire will bloom as an amazing beauty if clothed as a\nwoman of fashion with the aids that Art can render; while the beauty of\nthe midnight crush would often cut but a sorry figure if placed inside\nthe field-woman’s wrapper upon a monotonous acreage of turnips on a\ndull day. He had never till now estimated the artistic excellence of\nTess’s limbs and features.\n\n“If you were only to appear in a ball-room!” he said. “But no—no,\ndearest; I think I love you best in the wing-bonnet and\ncotton-frock—yes, better than in this, well as you support these\ndignities.”\n\nTess’s sense of her striking appearance had given her a flush of\nexcitement, which was yet not happiness.\n\n“I’ll take them off,” she said, “in case Jonathan should see me. They\nare not fit for me, are they? They must be sold, I suppose?”\n\n“Let them stay a few minutes longer. Sell them? Never. It would be a\nbreach of faith.”\n\nInfluenced by a second thought she readily obeyed. She had something to\ntell, and there might be help in these. She sat down with the jewels\nupon her; and they again indulged in conjectures as to where Jonathan\ncould possibly be with their baggage. The ale they had poured out for\nhis consumption when he came had gone flat with long standing.\n\nShortly after this they began supper, which was already laid on a\nside-table. Ere they had finished there was a jerk in the fire-smoke,\nthe rising skein of which bulged out into the room, as if some giant\nhad laid his hand on the chimney-top for a moment. It had been caused\nby the opening of the outer door. A heavy step was now heard in the\npassage, and Angel went out.\n\n“I couldn’ make nobody hear at all by knocking,” apologized Jonathan\nKail, for it was he at last; “and as’t was raining out I opened the\ndoor. I’ve brought the things, sir.”\n\n“I am very glad to see them. But you are very late.”\n\n“Well, yes, sir.”\n\nThere was something subdued in Jonathan Kail’s tone which had not been\nthere in the day, and lines of concern were ploughed upon his forehead\nin addition to the lines of years. He continued—\n\n“We’ve all been gallied at the dairy at what might ha’ been a most\nterrible affliction since you and your Mis’ess—so to name her now—left\nus this a’ternoon. Perhaps you ha’nt forgot the cock’s afternoon crow?”\n\n“Dear me;—what—”\n\n“Well, some says it do mane one thing, and some another; but what’s\nhappened is that poor little Retty Priddle hev tried to drown herself.”\n\n“No! Really! Why, she bade us goodbye with the rest—”\n\n“Yes. Well, sir, when you and your Mis’ess—so to name what she lawful\nis—when you two drove away, as I say, Retty and Marian put on their\nbonnets and went out; and as there is not much doing now, being New\nYear’s Eve, and folks mops and brooms from what’s inside ’em, nobody\ntook much notice. They went on to Lew-Everard, where they had summut to\ndrink, and then on they vamped to Dree-armed Cross, and there they\nseemed to have parted, Retty striking across the water-meads as if for\nhome, and Marian going on to the next village, where there’s another\npublic-house. Nothing more was zeed or heard o’ Retty till the\nwaterman, on his way home, noticed something by the Great Pool; ’twas\nher bonnet and shawl packed up. In the water he found her. He and\nanother man brought her home, thinking ’a was dead; but she fetched\nround by degrees.”\n\nAngel, suddenly recollecting that Tess was overhearing this gloomy\ntale, went to shut the door between the passage and the ante-room to\nthe inner parlour where she was; but his wife, flinging a shawl round\nher, had come to the outer room and was listening to the man’s\nnarrative, her eyes resting absently on the luggage and the drops of\nrain glistening upon it.\n\n“And, more than this, there’s Marian; she’s been found dead drunk by\nthe withy-bed—a girl who hev never been known to touch anything before\nexcept shilling ale; though, to be sure, ’a was always a good\ntrencher-woman, as her face showed. It seems as if the maids had all\ngone out o’ their minds!”\n\n“And Izz?” asked Tess.\n\n“Izz is about house as usual; but ’a do say ’a can guess how it\nhappened; and she seems to be very low in mind about it, poor maid, as\nwell she mid be. And so you see, sir, as all this happened just when we\nwas packing your few traps and your Mis’ess’s night-rail and dressing\nthings into the cart, why, it belated me.”\n\n“Yes. Well, Jonathan, will you get the trunks upstairs, and drink a cup\nof ale, and hasten back as soon as you can, in case you should be\nwanted?”\n\nTess had gone back to the inner parlour, and sat down by the fire,\nlooking wistfully into it. She heard Jonathan Kail’s heavy footsteps up\nand down the stairs till he had done placing the luggage, and heard him\nexpress his thanks for the ale her husband took out to him, and for the\ngratuity he received. Jonathan’s footsteps then died from the door, and\nhis cart creaked away.\n\nAngel slid forward the massive oak bar which secured the door, and\ncoming in to where she sat over the hearth, pressed her cheeks between\nhis hands from behind. He expected her to jump up gaily and unpack the\ntoilet-gear that she had been so anxious about, but as she did not rise\nhe sat down with her in the firelight, the candles on the supper-table\nbeing too thin and glimmering to interfere with its glow.\n\n“I am so sorry you should have heard this sad story about the girls,”\nhe said. “Still, don’t let it depress you. Retty was naturally morbid,\nyou know.”\n\n“Without the least cause,” said Tess. “While they who have cause to be,\nhide it, and pretend they are not.”\n\nThis incident had turned the scale for her. They were simple and\ninnocent girls on whom the unhappiness of unrequited love had fallen;\nthey had deserved better at the hands of Fate. She had deserved\nworse—yet she was the chosen one. It was wicked of her to take all\nwithout paying. She would pay to the uttermost farthing; she would\ntell, there and then. This final determination she came to when she\nlooked into the fire, he holding her hand.\n\nA steady glare from the now flameless embers painted the sides and back\nof the fireplace with its colour, and the well-polished andirons, and\nthe old brass tongs that would not meet. The underside of the\nmantel-shelf was flushed with the high-coloured light, and the legs of\nthe table nearest the fire. Tess’s face and neck reflected the same\nwarmth, which each gem turned into an Aldebaran or a Sirius—a\nconstellation of white, red, and green flashes, that interchanged their\nhues with her every pulsation.\n\n“Do you remember what we said to each other this morning about telling\nour faults?” he asked abruptly, finding that she still remained\nimmovable. “We spoke lightly perhaps, and you may well have done so.\nBut for me it was no light promise. I want to make a confession to you,\nLove.”\n\nThis, from him, so unexpectedly apposite, had the effect upon her of a\nProvidential interposition.\n\n“You have to confess something?” she said quickly, and even with\ngladness and relief.\n\n“You did not expect it? Ah—you thought too highly of me. Now listen.\nPut your head there, because I want you to forgive me, and not to be\nindignant with me for not telling you before, as perhaps I ought to\nhave done.”\n\nHow strange it was! He seemed to be her double. She did not speak, and\nClare went on—\n\n“I did not mention it because I was afraid of endangering my chance of\nyou, darling, the great prize of my life—my Fellowship I call you. My\nbrother’s Fellowship was won at his college, mine at Talbothays Dairy.\nWell, I would not risk it. I was going to tell you a month ago—at the\ntime you agreed to be mine, but I could not; I thought it might\nfrighten you away from me. I put it off; then I thought I would tell\nyou yesterday, to give you a chance at least of escaping me. But I did\nnot. And I did not this morning, when you proposed our confessing our\nfaults on the landing—the sinner that I was! But I must, now I see you\nsitting there so solemnly. I wonder if you will forgive me?”\n\n“O yes! I am sure that—”\n\n“Well, I hope so. But wait a minute. You don’t know. To begin at the\nbeginning. Though I imagine my poor father fears that I am one of the\neternally lost for my doctrines, I am of course, a believer in good\nmorals, Tess, as much as you. I used to wish to be a teacher of men,\nand it was a great disappointment to me when I found I could not enter\nthe Church. I admired spotlessness, even though I could lay no claim to\nit, and hated impurity, as I hope I do now. Whatever one may think of\nplenary inspiration, one must heartily subscribe to these words of\nPaul: ‘Be thou an example—in word, in conversation, in charity, in\nspirit, in faith, in purity.’ It is the only safeguard for us poor\nhuman beings. ‘_Integer vitae_,’ says a Roman poet, who is strange\ncompany for St Paul—\n\n    The man of upright life, from frailties free,\n    Stands not in need of Moorish spear or bow.\n\n“Well, a certain place is paved with good intentions, and having felt\nall that so strongly, you will see what a terrible remorse it bred in\nme when, in the midst of my fine aims for other people, I myself fell.”\n\nHe then told her of that time of his life to which allusion has been\nmade when, tossed about by doubts and difficulties in London, like a\ncork on the waves, he plunged into eight-and-forty hours’ dissipation\nwith a stranger.\n\n“Happily I awoke almost immediately to a sense of my folly,” he\ncontinued. “I would have no more to say to her, and I came home. I have\nnever repeated the offence. But I felt I should like to treat you with\nperfect frankness and honour, and I could not do so without telling\nthis. Do you forgive me?”\n\nShe pressed his hand tightly for an answer.\n\n“Then we will dismiss it at once and for ever!—too painful as it is for\nthe occasion—and talk of something lighter.”\n\n“O, Angel—I am almost glad—because now _you_ can forgive _me_! I have\nnot made my confession. I have a confession, too—remember, I said so.”\n\n“Ah, to be sure! Now then for it, wicked little one.”\n\n“Perhaps, although you smile, it is as serious as yours, or more so.”\n\n“It can hardly be more serious, dearest.”\n\n“It cannot—O no, it cannot!” She jumped up joyfully at the hope. “No,\nit cannot be more serious, certainly,” she cried, “because ’tis just\nthe same! I will tell you now.”\n\nShe sat down again.\n\nTheir hands were still joined. The ashes under the grate were lit by\nthe fire vertically, like a torrid waste. Imagination might have beheld\na Last Day luridness in this red-coaled glow, which fell on his face\nand hand, and on hers, peering into the loose hair about her brow, and\nfiring the delicate skin underneath. A large shadow of her shape rose\nupon the wall and ceiling. She bent forward, at which each diamond on\nher neck gave a sinister wink like a toad’s; and pressing her forehead\nagainst his temple she entered on her story of her acquaintance with\nAlec d’Urberville and its results, murmuring the words without\nflinching, and with her eyelids drooping down.\n\n\nEnd of Phase the Fourth\n\n\nPhase the Fifth:\n\nThe Woman Pays\n\n\nXXXV\n\nHer narrative ended; even its re-assertions and secondary explanations\nwere done. Tess’s voice throughout had hardly risen higher than its\nopening tone; there had been no exculpatory phrase of any kind, and she\nhad not wept.\n\nBut the complexion even of external things seemed to suffer\ntransmutation as her announcement progressed. The fire in the grate\nlooked impish—demoniacally funny, as if it did not care in the least\nabout her strait. The fender grinned idly, as if it too did not care.\nThe light from the water-bottle was merely engaged in a chromatic\nproblem. All material objects around announced their irresponsibility\nwith terrible iteration. And yet nothing had changed since the moments\nwhen he had been kissing her; or rather, nothing in the substance of\nthings. But the essence of things had changed.\n\nWhen she ceased, the auricular impressions from their previous\nendearments seemed to hustle away into the corner of their brains,\nrepeating themselves as echoes from a time of supremely purblind\nfoolishness.\n\nClare performed the irrelevant act of stirring the fire; the\nintelligence had not even yet got to the bottom of him. After stirring\nthe embers he rose to his feet; all the force of her disclosure had\nimparted itself now. His face had withered. In the strenuousness of his\nconcentration he treadled fitfully on the floor. He could not, by any\ncontrivance, think closely enough; that was the meaning of his vague\nmovement. When he spoke it was in the most inadequate, commonplace\nvoice of the many varied tones she had heard from him.\n\n“Tess!”\n\n“Yes, dearest.”\n\n“Am I to believe this? From your manner I am to take it as true. O you\ncannot be out of your mind! You ought to be! Yet you are not... My\nwife, my Tess—nothing in you warrants such a supposition as that?”\n\n“I am not out of my mind,” she said.\n\n“And yet—” He looked vacantly at her, to resume with dazed senses: “Why\ndidn’t you tell me before? Ah, yes, you would have told me, in a\nway—but I hindered you, I remember!”\n\nThese and other of his words were nothing but the perfunctory babble of\nthe surface while the depths remained paralyzed. He turned away, and\nbent over a chair. Tess followed him to the middle of the room, where\nhe was, and stood there staring at him with eyes that did not weep.\nPresently she slid down upon her knees beside his foot, and from this\nposition she crouched in a heap.\n\n“In the name of our love, forgive me!” she whispered with a dry mouth.\n“I have forgiven you for the same!”\n\nAnd, as he did not answer, she said again—\n\n“Forgive me as you are forgiven! _I_ forgive _you_, Angel.”\n\n“You—yes, you do.”\n\n“But you do not forgive me?”\n\n“O Tess, forgiveness does not apply to the case! You were one person;\nnow you are another. My God—how can forgiveness meet such a\ngrotesque—prestidigitation as that!”\n\nHe paused, contemplating this definition; then suddenly broke into\nhorrible laughter—as unnatural and ghastly as a laugh in hell.\n\n“Don’t—don’t! It kills me quite, that!” she shrieked. “O have mercy\nupon me—have mercy!”\n\nHe did not answer; and, sickly white, she jumped up.\n\n“Angel, Angel! what do you mean by that laugh?” she cried out. “Do you\nknow what this is to me?”\n\nHe shook his head.\n\n“I have been hoping, longing, praying, to make you happy! I have\nthought what joy it will be to do it, what an unworthy wife I shall be\nif I do not! That’s what I have felt, Angel!”\n\n“I know that.”\n\n“I thought, Angel, that you loved me—me, my very self! If it is I you\ndo love, O how can it be that you look and speak so? It frightens me!\nHaving begun to love you, I love you for ever—in all changes, in all\ndisgraces, because you are yourself. I ask no more. Then how can you, O\nmy own husband, stop loving me?”\n\n“I repeat, the woman I have been loving is not you.”\n\n“But who?”\n\n“Another woman in your shape.”\n\nShe perceived in his words the realization of her own apprehensive\nforeboding in former times. He looked upon her as a species of\nimposter; a guilty woman in the guise of an innocent one. Terror was\nupon her white face as she saw it; her cheek was flaccid, and her mouth\nhad almost the aspect of a round little hole. The horrible sense of his\nview of her so deadened her that she staggered, and he stepped forward,\nthinking she was going to fall.\n\n“Sit down, sit down,” he said gently. “You are ill; and it is natural\nthat you should be.”\n\nShe did sit down, without knowing where she was, that strained look\nstill upon her face, and her eyes such as to make his flesh creep.\n\n“I don’t belong to you any more, then; do I, Angel?” she asked\nhelplessly. “It is not me, but another woman like me that he loved, he\nsays.”\n\nThe image raised caused her to take pity upon herself as one who was\nill-used. Her eyes filled as she regarded her position further; she\nturned round and burst into a flood of self-sympathetic tears.\n\nClare was relieved at this change, for the effect on her of what had\nhappened was beginning to be a trouble to him only less than the woe of\nthe disclosure itself. He waited patiently, apathetically, till the\nviolence of her grief had worn itself out, and her rush of weeping had\nlessened to a catching gasp at intervals.\n\n“Angel,” she said suddenly, in her natural tones, the insane, dry voice\nof terror having left her now. “Angel, am I too wicked for you and me\nto live together?”\n\n“I have not been able to think what we can do.”\n\n“I shan’t ask you to let me live with you, Angel, because I have no\nright to! I shall not write to mother and sisters to say we be married,\nas I said I would do; and I shan’t finish the good hussif I cut out and\nmeant to make while we were in lodgings.”\n\n“Shan’t you?”\n\n“No, I shan’t do anything, unless you order me to; and if you go away\nfrom me I shall not follow ’ee; and if you never speak to me any more I\nshall not ask why, unless you tell me I may.”\n\n“And if I order you to do anything?”\n\n“I will obey you like your wretched slave, even if it is to lie down\nand die.”\n\n“You are very good. But it strikes me that there is a want of harmony\nbetween your present mood of self-sacrifice and your past mood of\nself-preservation.”\n\nThese were the first words of antagonism. To fling elaborate sarcasms\nat Tess, however, was much like flinging them at a dog or cat. The\ncharms of their subtlety passed by her unappreciated, and she only\nreceived them as inimical sounds which meant that anger ruled. She\nremained mute, not knowing that he was smothering his affection for\nher. She hardly observed that a tear descended slowly upon his cheek, a\ntear so large that it magnified the pores of the skin over which it\nrolled, like the object lens of a microscope. Meanwhile reillumination\nas to the terrible and total change that her confession had wrought in\nhis life, in his universe, returned to him, and he tried desperately to\nadvance among the new conditions in which he stood. Some consequent\naction was necessary; yet what?\n\n“Tess,” he said, as gently as he could speak, “I cannot stay—in this\nroom—just now. I will walk out a little way.”\n\nHe quietly left the room, and the two glasses of wine that he had\npoured out for their supper—one for her, one for him—remained on the\ntable untasted. This was what their _Agape_ had come to. At tea, two or\nthree hours earlier, they had, in the freakishness of affection, drunk\nfrom one cup.\n\nThe closing of the door behind him, gently as it had been pulled to,\nroused Tess from her stupor. He was gone; she could not stay. Hastily\nflinging her cloak around her she opened the door and followed, putting\nout the candles as if she were never coming back. The rain was over and\nthe night was now clear.\n\nShe was soon close at his heels, for Clare walked slowly and without\npurpose. His form beside her light gray figure looked black, sinister,\nand forbidding, and she felt as sarcasm the touch of the jewels of\nwhich she had been momentarily so proud. Clare turned at hearing her\nfootsteps, but his recognition of her presence seemed to make no\ndifference to him, and he went on over the five yawning arches of the\ngreat bridge in front of the house.\n\nThe cow and horse tracks in the road were full of water, the rain\nhaving been enough to charge them, but not enough to wash them away.\nAcross these minute pools the reflected stars flitted in a quick\ntransit as she passed; she would not have known they were shining\noverhead if she had not seen them there—the vastest things of the\nuniverse imaged in objects so mean.\n\nThe place to which they had travelled to-day was in the same valley as\nTalbothays, but some miles lower down the river; and the surroundings\nbeing open, she kept easily in sight of him. Away from the house the\nroad wound through the meads, and along these she followed Clare\nwithout any attempt to come up with him or to attract him, but with\ndumb and vacant fidelity.\n\nAt last, however, her listless walk brought her up alongside him, and\nstill he said nothing. The cruelty of fooled honesty is often great\nafter enlightenment, and it was mighty in Clare now. The outdoor air\nhad apparently taken away from him all tendency to act on impulse; she\nknew that he saw her without irradiation—in all her bareness; that Time\nwas chanting his satiric psalm at her then—\n\n    Behold, when thy face is made bare, he that loved thee shall hate;\n    Thy face shall be no more fair at the fall of thy fate. For thy\n    life shall fall as a leaf and be shed as the rain; And the veil of\n    thine head shall be grief, and the crown shall be pain.\n\nHe was still intently thinking, and her companionship had now\ninsufficient power to break or divert the strain of thought. What a\nweak thing her presence must have become to him! She could not help\naddressing Clare.\n\n“What have I done—what _have_ I done! I have not told of anything that\ninterferes with or belies my love for you. You don’t think I planned\nit, do you? It is in your own mind what you are angry at, Angel; it is\nnot in me. O, it is not in me, and I am not that deceitful woman you\nthink me!”\n\n“H’m—well. Not deceitful, my wife; but not the same. No, not the same.\nBut do not make me reproach you. I have sworn that I will not; and I\nwill do everything to avoid it.”\n\nBut she went on pleading in her distraction; and perhaps said things\nthat would have been better left to silence.\n\n“Angel!—Angel! I was a child—a child when it happened! I knew nothing\nof men.”\n\n“You were more sinned against than sinning, that I admit.”\n\n“Then will you not forgive me?”\n\n“I do forgive you, but forgiveness is not all.”\n\n“And love me?”\n\nTo this question he did not answer.\n\n“O Angel—my mother says that it sometimes happens so!—she knows several\ncases where they were worse than I, and the husband has not minded it\nmuch—has got over it at least. And yet the woman had not loved him as I\ndo you!”\n\n“Don’t, Tess; don’t argue. Different societies, different manners. You\nalmost make me say you are an unapprehending peasant woman, who have\nnever been initiated into the proportions of social things. You don’t\nknow what you say.”\n\n“I am only a peasant by position, not by nature!”\n\nShe spoke with an impulse to anger, but it went as it came.\n\n“So much the worse for you. I think that parson who unearthed your\npedigree would have done better if he had held his tongue. I cannot\nhelp associating your decline as a family with this other fact—of your\nwant of firmness. Decrepit families imply decrepit wills, decrepit\nconduct. Heaven, why did you give me a handle for despising you more by\ninforming me of your descent! Here was I thinking you a new-sprung\nchild of nature; there were you, the belated seedling of an effete\naristocracy!”\n\n“Lots of families are as bad as mine in that! Retty’s family were once\nlarge landowners, and so were Dairyman Billett’s. And the Debbyhouses,\nwho now are carters, were once the De Bayeux family. You find such as I\neverywhere; ’tis a feature of our county, and I can’t help it.”\n\n“So much the worse for the county.”\n\nShe took these reproaches in their bulk simply, not in their\nparticulars; he did not love her as he had loved her hitherto, and to\nall else she was indifferent.\n\nThey wandered on again in silence. It was said afterwards that a\ncottager of Wellbridge, who went out late that night for a doctor, met\ntwo lovers in the pastures, walking very slowly, without converse, one\nbehind the other, as in a funeral procession, and the glimpse that he\nobtained of their faces seemed to denote that they were anxious and\nsad. Returning later, he passed them again in the same field,\nprogressing just as slowly, and as regardless of the hour and of the\ncheerless night as before. It was only on account of his preoccupation\nwith his own affairs, and the illness in his house, that he did not\nbear in mind the curious incident, which, however, he recalled a long\nwhile after.\n\nDuring the interval of the cottager’s going and coming, she had said to\nher husband—\n\n“I don’t see how I can help being the cause of much misery to you all\nyour life. The river is down there. I can put an end to myself in it. I\nam not afraid.”\n\n“I don’t wish to add murder to my other follies,” he said.\n\n“I will leave something to show that I did it myself—on account of my\nshame. They will not blame you then.”\n\n“Don’t speak so absurdly—I wish not to hear it. It is nonsense to have\nsuch thoughts in this kind of case, which is rather one for satirical\nlaughter than for tragedy. You don’t in the least understand the\nquality of the mishap. It would be viewed in the light of a joke by\nnine-tenths of the world if it were known. Please oblige me by\nreturning to the house, and going to bed.”\n\n“I will,” said she dutifully.\n\nThey had rambled round by a road which led to the well-known ruins of\nthe Cistercian abbey behind the mill, the latter having, in centuries\npast, been attached to the monastic establishment. The mill still\nworked on, food being a perennial necessity; the abbey had perished,\ncreeds being transient. One continually sees the ministration of the\ntemporary outlasting the ministration of the eternal. Their walk having\nbeen circuitous, they were still not far from the house, and in obeying\nhis direction she only had to reach the large stone bridge across the\nmain river and follow the road for a few yards. When she got back,\neverything remained as she had left it, the fire being still burning.\nShe did not stay downstairs for more than a minute, but proceeded to\nher chamber, whither the luggage had been taken. Here she sat down on\nthe edge of the bed, looking blankly around, and presently began to\nundress. In removing the light towards the bedstead its rays fell upon\nthe tester of white dimity; something was hanging beneath it, and she\nlifted the candle to see what it was. A bough of mistletoe. Angel had\nput it there; she knew that in an instant. This was the explanation of\nthat mysterious parcel which it had been so difficult to pack and\nbring; whose contents he would not explain to her, saying that time\nwould soon show her the purpose thereof. In his zest and his gaiety he\nhad hung it there. How foolish and inopportune that mistletoe looked\nnow.\n\nHaving nothing more to fear, having scarce anything to hope, for that\nhe would relent there seemed no promise whatever, she lay down dully.\nWhen sorrow ceases to be speculative, sleep sees her opportunity. Among\nso many happier moods which forbid repose this was a mood which\nwelcomed it, and in a few minutes the lonely Tess forgot existence,\nsurrounded by the aromatic stillness of the chamber that had once,\npossibly, been the bride-chamber of her own ancestry.\n\nLater on that night Clare also retraced his steps to the house.\nEntering softly to the sitting-room he obtained a light, and with the\nmanner of one who had considered his course he spread his rugs upon the\nold horse-hair sofa which stood there, and roughly shaped it to a\nsleeping-couch. Before lying down he crept shoeless upstairs, and\nlistened at the door of her apartment. Her measured breathing told that\nshe was sleeping profoundly.\n\n“Thank God!” murmured Clare; and yet he was conscious of a pang of\nbitterness at the thought—approximately true, though not wholly so—that\nhaving shifted the burden of her life to his shoulders, she was now\nreposing without care.\n\nHe turned away to descend; then, irresolute, faced round to her door\nagain. In the act he caught sight of one of the d’Urberville dames,\nwhose portrait was immediately over the entrance to Tess’s bedchamber.\nIn the candlelight the painting was more than unpleasant. Sinister\ndesign lurked in the woman’s features, a concentrated purpose of\nrevenge on the other sex—so it seemed to him then. The Caroline bodice\nof the portrait was low—precisely as Tess’s had been when he tucked it\nin to show the necklace; and again he experienced the distressing\nsensation of a resemblance between them.\n\nThe check was sufficient. He resumed his retreat and descended.\n\nHis air remained calm and cold, his small compressed mouth indexing his\npowers of self-control; his face wearing still that terrible sterile\nexpression which had spread thereon since her disclosure. It was the\nface of a man who was no longer passion’s slave, yet who found no\nadvantage in his enfranchisement. He was simply regarding the harrowing\ncontingencies of human experience, the unexpectedness of things.\nNothing so pure, so sweet, so virginal as Tess had seemed possible all\nthe long while that he had adored her, up to an hour ago; but\n\n    The little less, and what worlds away!\n\nHe argued erroneously when he said to himself that her heart was not\nindexed in the honest freshness of her face; but Tess had no advocate\nto set him right. Could it be possible, he continued, that eyes which\nas they gazed never expressed any divergence from what the tongue was\ntelling, were yet ever seeing another world behind her ostensible one,\ndiscordant and contrasting?\n\nHe reclined on his couch in the sitting-room, and extinguished the\nlight. The night came in, and took up its place there, unconcerned and\nindifferent; the night which had already swallowed up his happiness,\nand was now digesting it listlessly; and was ready to swallow up the\nhappiness of a thousand other people with as little disturbance or\nchange of mien.\n\n\nXXXVI\n\nClare arose in the light of a dawn that was ashy and furtive, as though\nassociated with crime. The fireplace confronted him with its extinct\nembers; the spread supper-table, whereon stood the two full glasses of\nuntasted wine, now flat and filmy; her vacated seat and his own; the\nother articles of furniture, with their eternal look of not being able\nto help it, their intolerable inquiry what was to be done? From above\nthere was no sound; but in a few minutes there came a knock at the\ndoor. He remembered that it would be the neighbouring cottager’s wife,\nwho was to minister to their wants while they remained here.\n\nThe presence of a third person in the house would be extremely awkward\njust now, and, being already dressed, he opened the window and informed\nher that they could manage to shift for themselves that morning. She\nhad a milk-can in her hand, which he told her to leave at the door.\nWhen the dame had gone away he searched in the back quarters of the\nhouse for fuel, and speedily lit a fire. There was plenty of eggs,\nbutter, bread, and so on in the larder, and Clare soon had breakfast\nlaid, his experiences at the dairy having rendered him facile in\ndomestic preparations. The smoke of the kindled wood rose from the\nchimney without like a lotus-headed column; local people who were\npassing by saw it, and thought of the newly-married couple, and envied\ntheir happiness.\n\nAngel cast a final glance round, and then going to the foot of the\nstairs, called in a conventional voice—\n\n“Breakfast is ready!”\n\nHe opened the front door, and took a few steps in the morning air.\nWhen, after a short space, he came back she was already in the\nsitting-room mechanically readjusting the breakfast things. As she was\nfully attired, and the interval since his calling her had been but two\nor three minutes, she must have been dressed or nearly so before he\nwent to summon her. Her hair was twisted up in a large round mass at\nthe back of her head, and she had put on one of the new frocks—a pale\nblue woollen garment with neck-frillings of white. Her hands and face\nappeared to be cold, and she had possibly been sitting dressed in the\nbedroom a long time without any fire. The marked civility of Clare’s\ntone in calling her seemed to have inspired her, for the moment, with a\nnew glimmer of hope. But it soon died when she looked at him.\n\nThe pair were, in truth, but the ashes of their former fires. To the\nhot sorrow of the previous night had succeeded heaviness; it seemed as\nif nothing could kindle either of them to fervour of sensation any\nmore.\n\nHe spoke gently to her, and she replied with a like\nundemonstrativeness. At last she came up to him, looking in his\nsharply-defined face as one who had no consciousness that her own\nformed a visible object also.\n\n“Angel!” she said, and paused, touching him with her fingers lightly as\na breeze, as though she could hardly believe to be there in the flesh\nthe man who was once her lover. Her eyes were bright, her pale cheek\nstill showed its wonted roundness, though half-dried tears had left\nglistening traces thereon; and the usually ripe red mouth was almost as\npale as her cheek. Throbbingly alive as she was still, under the stress\nof her mental grief the life beat so brokenly that a little further\npull upon it would cause real illness, dull her characteristic eyes,\nand make her mouth thin.\n\nShe looked absolutely pure. Nature, in her fantastic trickery, had set\nsuch a seal of maidenhood upon Tess’s countenance that he gazed at her\nwith a stupefied air.\n\n“Tess! Say it is not true! No, it is not true!”\n\n“It is true.”\n\n“Every word?”\n\n“Every word.”\n\nHe looked at her imploringly, as if he would willingly have taken a lie\nfrom her lips, knowing it to be one, and have made of it, by some sort\nof sophistry, a valid denial. However, she only repeated—\n\n“It is true.”\n\n“Is he living?” Angel then asked.\n\n“The baby died.”\n\n“But the man?”\n\n“He is alive.”\n\nA last despair passed over Clare’s face.\n\n“Is he in England?”\n\n“Yes.”\n\nHe took a few vague steps.\n\n“My position—is this,” he said abruptly. “I thought—any man would have\nthought—that by giving up all ambition to win a wife with social\nstanding, with fortune, with knowledge of the world, I should secure\nrustic innocence as surely as I should secure pink cheeks; but—However,\nI am no man to reproach you, and I will not.”\n\nTess felt his position so entirely that the remainder had not been\nneeded. Therein lay just the distress of it; she saw that he had lost\nall round.\n\n“Angel—I should not have let it go on to marriage with you if I had not\nknown that, after all, there was a last way out of it for you; though I\nhoped you would never—”\n\nHer voice grew husky.\n\n“A last way?”\n\n“I mean, to get rid of me. You _can_ get rid of me.”\n\n“How?”\n\n“By divorcing me.”\n\n“Good heavens—how can you be so simple! How can I divorce you?”\n\n“Can’t you—now I have told you? I thought my confession would give you\ngrounds for that.”\n\n“O Tess—you are too, too—childish—unformed—crude, I suppose! I don’t\nknow what you are. You don’t understand the law—you don’t understand!”\n\n“What—you cannot?”\n\n“Indeed I cannot.”\n\nA quick shame mixed with the misery upon his listener’s face.\n\n“I thought—I thought,” she whispered. “O, now I see how wicked I seem\nto you! Believe me—believe me, on my soul, I never thought but that you\ncould! I hoped you would not; yet I believed, without a doubt, that you\ncould cast me off if you were determined, and didn’t love me\nat—at—all!”\n\n“You were mistaken,” he said.\n\n“O, then I ought to have done it, to have done it last night! But I\nhadn’t the courage. That’s just like me!”\n\n“The courage to do what?”\n\nAs she did not answer he took her by the hand.\n\n“What were you thinking of doing?” he inquired.\n\n“Of putting an end to myself.”\n\n“When?”\n\nShe writhed under this inquisitorial manner of his. “Last night,” she\nanswered.\n\n“Where?”\n\n“Under your mistletoe.”\n\n“My good—! How?” he asked sternly.\n\n“I’ll tell you, if you won’t be angry with me!” she said, shrinking.\n“It was with the cord of my box. But I could not—do the last thing! I\nwas afraid that it might cause a scandal to your name.”\n\nThe unexpected quality of this confession, wrung from her, and not\nvolunteered, shook him perceptibly. But he still held her, and, letting\nhis glance fall from her face downwards, he said, “Now, listen to this.\nYou must not dare to think of such a horrible thing! How could you! You\nwill promise me as your husband to attempt that no more.”\n\n“I am ready to promise. I saw how wicked it was.”\n\n“Wicked! The idea was unworthy of you beyond description.”\n\n“But, Angel,” she pleaded, enlarging her eyes in calm unconcern upon\nhim, “it was thought of entirely on your account—to set you free\nwithout the scandal of the divorce that I thought you would have to\nget. I should never have dreamt of doing it on mine. However, to do it\nwith my own hand is too good for me, after all. It is you, my ruined\nhusband, who ought to strike the blow. I think I should love you more,\nif that were possible, if you could bring yourself to do it, since\nthere’s no other way of escape for ’ee. I feel I am so utterly\nworthless! So very greatly in the way!”\n\n“Ssh!”\n\n“Well, since you say no, I won’t. I have no wish opposed to yours.”\n\nHe knew this to be true enough. Since the desperation of the night her\nactivities had dropped to zero, and there was no further rashness to be\nfeared.\n\nTess tried to busy herself again over the breakfast-table with more or\nless success, and they sat down both on the same side, so that their\nglances did not meet. There was at first something awkward in hearing\neach other eat and drink, but this could not be escaped; moreover, the\namount of eating done was small on both sides. Breakfast over, he rose,\nand telling her the hour at which he might be expected to dinner, went\noff to the miller’s in a mechanical pursuance of the plan of studying\nthat business, which had been his only practical reason for coming\nhere.\n\nWhen he was gone Tess stood at the window, and presently saw his form\ncrossing the great stone bridge which conducted to the mill premises.\nHe sank behind it, crossed the railway beyond, and disappeared. Then,\nwithout a sigh, she turned her attention to the room, and began\nclearing the table and setting it in order.\n\nThe charwoman soon came. Her presence was at first a strain upon Tess,\nbut afterwards an alleviation. At half-past twelve she left her\nassistant alone in the kitchen, and, returning to the sitting-room,\nwaited for the reappearance of Angel’s form behind the bridge.\n\nAbout one he showed himself. Her face flushed, although he was a\nquarter of a mile off. She ran to the kitchen to get the dinner served\nby the time he should enter. He went first to the room where they had\nwashed their hands together the day before, and as he entered the\nsitting-room the dish-covers rose from the dishes as if by his own\nmotion.\n\n“How punctual!” he said.\n\n“Yes. I saw you coming over the bridge,” said she.\n\nThe meal was passed in commonplace talk of what he had been doing\nduring the morning at the Abbey Mill, of the methods of bolting and the\nold-fashioned machinery, which he feared would not enlighten him\ngreatly on modern improved methods, some of it seeming to have been in\nuse ever since the days it ground for the monks in the adjoining\nconventual buildings—now a heap of ruins. He left the house again in\nthe course of an hour, coming home at dusk, and occupying himself\nthrough the evening with his papers. She feared she was in the way and,\nwhen the old woman was gone, retired to the kitchen, where she made\nherself busy as well as she could for more than an hour.\n\nClare’s shape appeared at the door. “You must not work like this,” he\nsaid. “You are not my servant; you are my wife.”\n\nShe raised her eyes, and brightened somewhat. “I may think myself\nthat—indeed?” she murmured, in piteous raillery. “You mean in name!\nWell, I don’t want to be anything more.”\n\n“You _may_ think so, Tess! You are. What do you mean?”\n\n“I don’t know,” she said hastily, with tears in her accents. “I thought\nI—because I am not respectable, I mean. I told you I thought I was not\nrespectable enough long ago—and on that account I didn’t want to marry\nyou, only—only you urged me!”\n\nShe broke into sobs, and turned her back to him. It would almost have\nwon round any man but Angel Clare. Within the remote depths of his\nconstitution, so gentle and affectionate as he was in general, there\nlay hidden a hard logical deposit, like a vein of metal in a soft loam,\nwhich turned the edge of everything that attempted to traverse it. It\nhad blocked his acceptance of the Church; it blocked his acceptance of\nTess. Moreover, his affection itself was less fire than radiance, and,\nwith regard to the other sex, when he ceased to believe he ceased to\nfollow: contrasting in this with many impressionable natures, who\nremain sensuously infatuated with what they intellectually despise. He\nwaited till her sobbing ceased.\n\n“I wish half the women in England were as respectable as you,” he said,\nin an ebullition of bitterness against womankind in general. “It isn’t\na question of respectability, but one of principle!”\n\nHe spoke such things as these and more of a kindred sort to her, being\nstill swayed by the antipathetic wave which warps direct souls with\nsuch persistence when once their vision finds itself mocked by\nappearances. There was, it is true, underneath, a back current of\nsympathy through which a woman of the world might have conquered him.\nBut Tess did not think of this; she took everything as her deserts, and\nhardly opened her mouth. The firmness of her devotion to him was indeed\nalmost pitiful; quick-tempered as she naturally was, nothing that he\ncould say made her unseemly; she sought not her own; was not provoked;\nthought no evil of his treatment of her. She might just now have been\nApostolic Charity herself returned to a self-seeking modern world.\n\nThis evening, night, and morning were passed precisely as the preceding\nones had been passed. On one, and only one, occasion did she—the\nformerly free and independent Tess—venture to make any advances. It was\non the third occasion of his starting after a meal to go out to the\nflour-mill. As he was leaving the table he said “Goodbye,” and she\nreplied in the same words, at the same time inclining her mouth in the\nway of his. He did not avail himself of the invitation, saying, as he\nturned hastily aside—\n\n“I shall be home punctually.”\n\nTess shrank into herself as if she had been struck. Often enough had he\ntried to reach those lips against her consent—often had he said gaily\nthat her mouth and breath tasted of the butter and eggs and milk and\nhoney on which she mainly lived, that he drew sustenance from them, and\nother follies of that sort. But he did not care for them now. He\nobserved her sudden shrinking, and said gently—\n\n“You know, I have to think of a course. It was imperative that we\nshould stay together a little while, to avoid the scandal to you that\nwould have resulted from our immediate parting. But you must see it is\nonly for form’s sake.”\n\n“Yes,” said Tess absently.\n\nHe went out, and on his way to the mill stood still, and wished for a\nmoment that he had responded yet more kindly, and kissed her once at\nleast.\n\nThus they lived through this despairing day or two; in the same house,\ntruly; but more widely apart than before they were lovers. It was\nevident to her that he was, as he had said, living with paralyzed\nactivities in his endeavour to think of a plan of procedure. She was\nawe-stricken to discover such determination under such apparent\nflexibility. His consistency was, indeed, too cruel. She no longer\nexpected forgiveness now. More than once she thought of going away from\nhim during his absence at the mill; but she feared that this, instead\nof benefiting him, might be the means of hampering and humiliating him\nyet more if it should become known.\n\nMeanwhile Clare was meditating, verily. His thought had been\nunsuspended; he was becoming ill with thinking; eaten out with\nthinking, withered by thinking; scourged out of all his former\npulsating, flexuous domesticity. He walked about saying to himself,\n“What’s to be done—what’s to be done?” and by chance she overheard him.\nIt caused her to break the reserve about their future which had\nhitherto prevailed.\n\n“I suppose—you are not going to live with me—long, are you, Angel?” she\nasked, the sunk corners of her mouth betraying how purely mechanical\nwere the means by which she retained that expression of chastened calm\nupon her face.\n\n“I cannot” he said, “without despising myself, and what is worse,\nperhaps, despising you. I mean, of course, cannot live with you in the\nordinary sense. At present, whatever I feel, I do not despise you. And,\nlet me speak plainly, or you may not see all my difficulties. How can\nwe live together while that man lives?—he being your husband in nature,\nand not I. If he were dead it might be different... Besides, that’s not\nall the difficulty; it lies in another consideration—one bearing upon\nthe future of other people than ourselves. Think of years to come, and\nchildren being born to us, and this past matter getting known—for it\nmust get known. There is not an uttermost part of the earth but\nsomebody comes from it or goes to it from elsewhere. Well, think of\nwretches of our flesh and blood growing up under a taunt which they\nwill gradually get to feel the full force of with their expanding\nyears. What an awakening for them! What a prospect! Can you honestly\nsay ‘Remain’ after contemplating this contingency? Don’t you think we\nhad better endure the ills we have than fly to others?”\n\nHer eyelids, weighted with trouble, continued drooping as before.\n\n“I cannot say ‘Remain,’” she answered, “I cannot; I had not thought so\nfar.”\n\nTess’s feminine hope—shall we confess it?—had been so obstinately\nrecuperative as to revive in her surreptitious visions of a domiciliary\nintimacy continued long enough to break down his coldness even against\nhis judgement. Though unsophisticated in the usual sense, she was not\nincomplete; and it would have denoted deficiency of womanhood if she\nhad not instinctively known what an argument lies in propinquity.\nNothing else would serve her, she knew, if this failed. It was wrong to\nhope in what was of the nature of strategy, she said to herself: yet\nthat sort of hope she could not extinguish. His last representation had\nnow been made, and it was, as she said, a new view. She had truly never\nthought so far as that, and his lucid picture of possible offspring who\nwould scorn her was one that brought deadly convictions to an honest\nheart which was humanitarian to its centre. Sheer experience had\nalready taught her that in some circumstances there was one thing\nbetter than to lead a good life, and that was to be saved from leading\nany life whatever. Like all who have been previsioned by suffering, she\ncould, in the words of M. Sully-Prudhomme, hear a penal sentence in the\nfiat, “You shall be born,” particularly if addressed to potential issue\nof hers.\n\nYet such is the vulpine slyness of Dame Nature, that, till now, Tess\nhad been hoodwinked by her love for Clare into forgetting it might\nresult in vitalizations that would inflict upon others what she had\nbewailed as misfortune to herself.\n\nShe therefore could not withstand his argument. But with the\nself-combating proclivity of the supersensitive, an answer thereto\narose in Clare’s own mind, and he almost feared it. It was based on her\nexceptional physical nature; and she might have used it promisingly.\nShe might have added besides: “On an Australian upland or Texan plain,\nwho is to know or care about my misfortunes, or to reproach me or you?”\nYet, like the majority of women, she accepted the momentary presentment\nas if it were the inevitable. And she may have been right. The\nintuitive heart of woman knoweth not only its own bitterness, but its\nhusband’s, and even if these assumed reproaches were not likely to be\naddressed to him or to his by strangers, they might have reached his\nears from his own fastidious brain.\n\nIt was the third day of the estrangement. Some might risk the odd\nparadox that with more animalism he would have been the nobler man. We\ndo not say it. Yet Clare’s love was doubtless ethereal to a fault,\nimaginative to impracticability. With these natures, corporal presence\nis something less appealing than corporal absence; the latter creating\nan ideal presence that conveniently drops the defects of the real. She\nfound that her personality did not plead her cause so forcibly as she\nhad anticipated. The figurative phrase was true: she was another woman\nthan the one who had excited his desire.\n\n“I have thought over what you say,” she remarked to him, moving her\nforefinger over the tablecloth, her other hand, which bore the ring\nthat mocked them both, supporting her forehead. “It is quite true, all\nof it; it must be. You must go away from me.”\n\n“But what can you do?”\n\n“I can go home.”\n\nClare had not thought of that.\n\n“Are you sure?” he inquired.\n\n“Quite sure. We ought to part, and we may as well get it past and done.\nYou once said that I was apt to win men against their better judgement;\nand if I am constantly before your eyes I may cause you to change your\nplans in opposition to your reason and wish; and afterwards your\nrepentance and my sorrow will be terrible.”\n\n“And you would like to go home?” he asked.\n\n“I want to leave you, and go home.”\n\n“Then it shall be so.”\n\nThough she did not look up at him, she started. There was a difference\nbetween the proposition and the covenant, which she had felt only too\nquickly.\n\n“I feared it would come to this,” she murmured, her countenance meekly\nfixed. “I don’t complain, Angel, I—I think it best. What you said has\nquite convinced me. Yes, though nobody else should reproach me if we\nshould stay together, yet somewhen, years hence, you might get angry\nwith me for any ordinary matter, and knowing what you do of my bygones,\nyou yourself might be tempted to say words, and they might be\noverheard, perhaps by my own children. O, what only hurts me now would\ntorture and kill me then! I will go—to-morrow.”\n\n“And I shall not stay here. Though I didn’t like to initiate it, I have\nseen that it was advisable we should part—at least for a while, till I\ncan better see the shape that things have taken, and can write to you.”\n\nTess stole a glance at her husband. He was pale, even tremulous; but,\nas before, she was appalled by the determination revealed in the depths\nof this gentle being she had married—the will to subdue the grosser to\nthe subtler emotion, the substance to the conception, the flesh to the\nspirit. Propensities, tendencies, habits, were as dead leaves upon the\ntyrannous wind of his imaginative ascendency.\n\nHe may have observed her look, for he explained—\n\n“I think of people more kindly when I am away from them”; adding\ncynically, “God knows; perhaps we will shake down together some day,\nfor weariness; thousands have done it!”\n\nThat day he began to pack up, and she went upstairs and began to pack\nalso. Both knew that it was in their two minds that they might part the\nnext morning for ever, despite the gloss of assuaging conjectures\nthrown over their proceeding because they were of the sort to whom any\nparting which has an air of finality is a torture. He knew, and she\nknew, that, though the fascination which each had exercised over the\nother—on her part independently of accomplishments—would probably in\nthe first days of their separation be even more potent than ever, time\nmust attenuate that effect; the practical arguments against accepting\nher as a housemate might pronounce themselves more strongly in the\nboreal light of a remoter view. Moreover, when two people are once\nparted—have abandoned a common domicile and a common environment—new\ngrowths insensibly bud upward to fill each vacated place; unforeseen\naccidents hinder intentions, and old plans are forgotten.\n\n\nXXXVII\n\nMidnight came and passed silently, for there was nothing to announce it\nin the Valley of the Froom.\n\nNot long after one o’clock there was a slight creak in the darkened\nfarmhouse once the mansion of the d’Urbervilles. Tess, who used the\nupper chamber, heard it and awoke. It had come from the corner step of\nthe staircase, which, as usual, was loosely nailed. She saw the door of\nher bedroom open, and the figure of her husband crossed the stream of\nmoonlight with a curiously careful tread. He was in his shirt and\ntrousers only, and her first flush of joy died when she perceived that\nhis eyes were fixed in an unnatural stare on vacancy. When he reached\nthe middle of the room he stood still and murmured in tones of\nindescribable sadness—\n\n“Dead! dead! dead!”\n\nUnder the influence of any strongly-disturbing force, Clare would\noccasionally walk in his sleep, and even perform strange feats, such as\nhe had done on the night of their return from market just before their\nmarriage, when he re-enacted in his bedroom his combat with the man who\nhad insulted her. Tess saw that continued mental distress had wrought\nhim into that somnambulistic state now.\n\nHer loyal confidence in him lay so deep down in her heart, that, awake\nor asleep, he inspired her with no sort of personal fear. If he had\nentered with a pistol in his hand he would scarcely have disturbed her\ntrust in his protectiveness.\n\nClare came close, and bent over her. “Dead, dead, dead!” he murmured.\n\nAfter fixedly regarding her for some moments with the same gaze of\nunmeasurable woe, he bent lower, enclosed her in his arms, and rolled\nher in the sheet as in a shroud. Then lifting her from the bed with as\nmuch respect as one would show to a dead body, he carried her across\nthe room, murmuring—\n\n“My poor, poor Tess—my dearest, darling Tess! So sweet, so good, so\ntrue!”\n\nThe words of endearment, withheld so severely in his waking hours, were\ninexpressibly sweet to her forlorn and hungry heart. If it had been to\nsave her weary life she would not, by moving or struggling, have put an\nend to the position she found herself in. Thus she lay in absolute\nstillness, scarcely venturing to breathe, and, wondering what he was\ngoing to do with her, suffered herself to be borne out upon the\nlanding.\n\n“My wife—dead, dead!” he said.\n\nHe paused in his labours for a moment to lean with her against the\nbanister. Was he going to throw her down? Self-solicitude was near\nextinction in her, and in the knowledge that he had planned to depart\non the morrow, possibly for always, she lay in his arms in this\nprecarious position with a sense rather of luxury than of terror. If\nthey could only fall together, and both be dashed to pieces, how fit,\nhow desirable.\n\nHowever, he did not let her fall, but took advantage of the support of\nthe handrail to imprint a kiss upon her lips—lips in the day-time\nscorned. Then he clasped her with a renewed firmness of hold, and\ndescended the staircase. The creak of the loose stair did not awaken\nhim, and they reached the ground-floor safely. Freeing one of his hands\nfrom his grasp of her for a moment, he slid back the door-bar and\npassed out, slightly striking his stockinged toe against the edge of\nthe door. But this he seemed not to mind, and, having room for\nextension in the open air, he lifted her against his shoulder, so that\nhe could carry her with ease, the absence of clothes taking much from\nhis burden. Thus he bore her off the premises in the direction of the\nriver a few yards distant.\n\nHis ultimate intention, if he had any, she had not yet divined; and she\nfound herself conjecturing on the matter as a third person might have\ndone. So easefully had she delivered her whole being up to him that it\npleased her to think he was regarding her as his absolute possession,\nto dispose of as he should choose. It was consoling, under the hovering\nterror of to-morrow’s separation, to feel that he really recognized her\nnow as his wife Tess, and did not cast her off, even if in that\nrecognition he went so far as to arrogate to himself the right of\nharming her.\n\nAh! now she knew what he was dreaming of—that Sunday morning when he\nhad borne her along through the water with the other dairymaids, who\nhad loved him nearly as much as she, if that were possible, which Tess\ncould hardly admit. Clare did not cross the bridge with her, but\nproceeding several paces on the same side towards the adjoining mill,\nat length stood still on the brink of the river.\n\nIts waters, in creeping down these miles of meadowland, frequently\ndivided, serpentining in purposeless curves, looping themselves around\nlittle islands that had no name, returning and re-embodying themselves\nas a broad main stream further on. Opposite the spot to which he had\nbrought her was such a general confluence, and the river was\nproportionately voluminous and deep. Across it was a narrow\nfoot-bridge; but now the autumn flood had washed the handrail away,\nleaving the bare plank only, which, lying a few inches above the\nspeeding current, formed a giddy pathway for even steady heads; and\nTess had noticed from the window of the house in the day-time young men\nwalking across upon it as a feat in balancing. Her husband had possibly\nobserved the same performance; anyhow, he now mounted the plank, and,\nsliding one foot forward, advanced along it.\n\nWas he going to drown her? Probably he was. The spot was lonely, the\nriver deep and wide enough to make such a purpose easy of\naccomplishment. He might drown her if he would; it would be better than\nparting to-morrow to lead severed lives.\n\nThe swift stream raced and gyrated under them, tossing, distorting, and\nsplitting the moon’s reflected face. Spots of froth travelled past, and\nintercepted weeds waved behind the piles. If they could both fall\ntogether into the current now, their arms would be so tightly clasped\ntogether that they could not be saved; they would go out of the world\nalmost painlessly, and there would be no more reproach to her, or to\nhim for marrying her. His last half-hour with her would have been a\nloving one, while if they lived till he awoke, his day-time aversion\nwould return, and this hour would remain to be contemplated only as a\ntransient dream.\n\nThe impulse stirred in her, yet she dared not indulge it, to make a\nmovement that would have precipitated them both into the gulf. How she\nvalued her own life had been proved; but his—she had no right to tamper\nwith it. He reached the other side with her in safety.\n\nHere they were within a plantation which formed the Abbey grounds, and\ntaking a new hold of her he went onward a few steps till they reached\nthe ruined choir of the Abbey-church. Against the north wall was the\nempty stone coffin of an abbot, in which every tourist with a turn for\ngrim humour was accustomed to stretch himself. In this Clare carefully\nlaid Tess. Having kissed her lips a second time he breathed deeply, as\nif a greatly desired end were attained. Clare then lay down on the\nground alongside, when he immediately fell into the deep dead slumber\nof exhaustion, and remained motionless as a log. The spurt of mental\nexcitement which had produced the effort was now over.\n\nTess sat up in the coffin. The night, though dry and mild for the\nseason, was more than sufficiently cold to make it dangerous for him to\nremain here long, in his half-clothed state. If he were left to himself\nhe would in all probability stay there till the morning, and be chilled\nto certain death. She had heard of such deaths after sleep-walking. But\nhow could she dare to awaken him, and let him know what he had been\ndoing, when it would mortify him to discover his folly in respect of\nher? Tess, however, stepping out of her stone confine, shook him\nslightly, but was unable to arouse him without being violent. It was\nindispensable to do something, for she was beginning to shiver, the\nsheet being but a poor protection. Her excitement had in a measure kept\nher warm during the few minutes’ adventure; but that beatific interval\nwas over.\n\nIt suddenly occurred to her to try persuasion; and accordingly she\nwhispered in his ear, with as much firmness and decision as she could\nsummon—\n\n“Let us walk on, darling,” at the same time taking him suggestively by\nthe arm. To her relief, he unresistingly acquiesced; her words had\napparently thrown him back into his dream, which thenceforward seemed\nto enter on a new phase, wherein he fancied she had risen as a spirit,\nand was leading him to Heaven. Thus she conducted him by the arm to the\nstone bridge in front of their residence, crossing which they stood at\nthe manor-house door. Tess’s feet were quite bare, and the stones hurt\nher, and chilled her to the bone; but Clare was in his woollen\nstockings and appeared to feel no discomfort.\n\nThere was no further difficulty. She induced him to lie down on his own\nsofa bed, and covered him up warmly, lighting a temporary fire of wood,\nto dry any dampness out of him. The noise of these attentions she\nthought might awaken him, and secretly wished that they might. But the\nexhaustion of his mind and body was such that he remained undisturbed.\n\nAs soon as they met the next morning Tess divined that Angel knew\nlittle or nothing of how far she had been concerned in the night’s\nexcursion, though, as regarded himself, he may have been aware that he\nhad not lain still. In truth, he had awakened that morning from a sleep\ndeep as annihilation; and during those first few moments in which the\nbrain, like a Samson shaking himself, is trying its strength, he had\nsome dim notion of an unusual nocturnal proceeding. But the realities\nof his situation soon displaced conjecture on the other subject.\n\nHe waited in expectancy to discern some mental pointing; he knew that\nif any intention of his, concluded over-night, did not vanish in the\nlight of morning, it stood on a basis approximating to one of pure\nreason, even if initiated by impulse of feeling; that it was so far,\ntherefore, to be trusted. He thus beheld in the pale morning light the\nresolve to separate from her; not as a hot and indignant instinct, but\ndenuded of the passionateness which had made it scorch and burn;\nstanding in its bones; nothing but a skeleton, but none the less there.\nClare no longer hesitated.\n\nAt breakfast, and while they were packing the few remaining articles,\nhe showed his weariness from the night’s effort so unmistakeably that\nTess was on the point of revealing all that had happened; but the\nreflection that it would anger him, grieve him, stultify him, to know\nthat he had instinctively manifested a fondness for her of which his\ncommon-sense did not approve, that his inclination had compromised his\ndignity when reason slept, again deterred her. It was too much like\nlaughing at a man when sober for his erratic deeds during intoxication.\n\nIt just crossed her mind, too, that he might have a faint recollection\nof his tender vagary, and was disinclined to allude to it from a\nconviction that she would take amatory advantage of the opportunity it\ngave her of appealing to him anew not to go.\n\nHe had ordered by letter a vehicle from the nearest town, and soon\nafter breakfast it arrived. She saw in it the beginning of the end—the\ntemporary end, at least, for the revelation of his tenderness by the\nincident of the night raised dreams of a possible future with him. The\nluggage was put on the top, and the man drove them off, the miller and\nthe old waiting-woman expressing some surprise at their precipitate\ndeparture, which Clare attributed to his discovery that the mill-work\nwas not of the modern kind which he wished to investigate, a statement\nthat was true so far as it went. Beyond this there was nothing in the\nmanner of their leaving to suggest a _fiasco_, or that they were not\ngoing together to visit friends.\n\nTheir route lay near the dairy from which they had started with such\nsolemn joy in each other a few days back, and as Clare wished to wind\nup his business with Mr Crick, Tess could hardly avoid paying Mrs Crick\na call at the same time, unless she would excite suspicion of their\nunhappy state.\n\nTo make the call as unobtrusive as possible, they left the carriage by\nthe wicket leading down from the high road to the dairy-house, and\ndescended the track on foot, side by side. The withy-bed had been cut,\nand they could see over the stumps the spot to which Clare had followed\nher when he pressed her to be his wife; to the left the enclosure in\nwhich she had been fascinated by his harp; and far away behind the\ncow-stalls the mead which had been the scene of their first embrace.\nThe gold of the summer picture was now gray, the colours mean, the rich\nsoil mud, and the river cold.\n\nOver the barton-gate the dairyman saw them, and came forward, throwing\ninto his face the kind of jocularity deemed appropriate in Talbothays\nand its vicinity on the re-appearance of the newly-married. Then Mrs\nCrick emerged from the house, and several others of their old\nacquaintance, though Marian and Retty did not seem to be there.\n\nTess valiantly bore their sly attacks and friendly humours, which\naffected her far otherwise than they supposed. In the tacit agreement\nof husband and wife to keep their estrangement a secret they behaved as\nwould have been ordinary. And then, although she would rather there had\nbeen no word spoken on the subject, Tess had to hear in detail the\nstory of Marian and Retty. The later had gone home to her father’s, and\nMarian had left to look for employment elsewhere. They feared she would\ncome to no good.\n\nTo dissipate the sadness of this recital Tess went and bade all her\nfavourite cows goodbye, touching each of them with her hand, and as she\nand Clare stood side by side at leaving, as if united body and soul,\nthere would have been something peculiarly sorry in their aspect to one\nwho should have seen it truly; two limbs of one life, as they outwardly\nwere, his arm touching hers, her skirts touching him, facing one way,\nas against all the dairy facing the other, speaking in their adieux as\n“we”, and yet sundered like the poles. Perhaps something unusually\nstiff and embarrassed in their attitude, some awkwardness in acting up\nto their profession of unity, different from the natural shyness of\nyoung couples, may have been apparent, for when they were gone Mrs\nCrick said to her husband—\n\n“How onnatural the brightness of her eyes did seem, and how they stood\nlike waxen images and talked as if they were in a dream! Didn’t it\nstrike ’ee that ’twas so? Tess had always sommat strange in her, and\nshe’s not now quite like the proud young bride of a well-be-doing man.”\n\nThey re-entered the vehicle, and were driven along the roads towards\nWeatherbury and Stagfoot Lane, till they reached the Lane inn, where\nClare dismissed the fly and man. They rested here a while, and entering\nthe Vale were next driven onward towards her home by a stranger who did\nnot know their relations. At a midway point, when Nuttlebury had been\npassed, and where there were cross-roads, Clare stopped the conveyance\nand said to Tess that if she meant to return to her mother’s house it\nwas here that he would leave her. As they could not talk with freedom\nin the driver’s presence he asked her to accompany him for a few steps\non foot along one of the branch roads; she assented, and directing the\nman to wait a few minutes they strolled away.\n\n“Now, let us understand each other,” he said gently. “There is no anger\nbetween us, though there is that which I cannot endure at present. I\nwill try to bring myself to endure it. I will let you know where I go\nto as soon as I know myself. And if I can bring myself to bear it—if it\nis desirable, possible—I will come to you. But until I come to you it\nwill be better that you should not try to come to me.”\n\nThe severity of the decree seemed deadly to Tess; she saw his view of\nher clearly enough; he could regard her in no other light than that of\none who had practised gross deceit upon him. Yet could a woman who had\ndone even what she had done deserve all this? But she could contest the\npoint with him no further. She simply repeated after him his own words.\n\n“Until you come to me I must not try to come to you?”\n\n“Just so.”\n\n“May I write to you?”\n\n“O yes—if you are ill, or want anything at all. I hope that will not be\nthe case; so that it may happen that I write first to you.”\n\n“I agree to the conditions, Angel; because you know best what my\npunishment ought to be; only—only—don’t make it more than I can bear!”\n\nThat was all she said on the matter. If Tess had been artful, had she\nmade a scene, fainted, wept hysterically, in that lonely lane,\nnotwithstanding the fury of fastidiousness with which he was possessed,\nhe would probably not have withstood her. But her mood of\nlong-suffering made his way easy for him, and she herself was his best\nadvocate. Pride, too, entered into her submission—which perhaps was a\nsymptom of that reckless acquiescence in chance too apparent in the\nwhole d’Urberville family—and the many effective chords which she could\nhave stirred by an appeal were left untouched.\n\nThe remainder of their discourse was on practical matters only. He now\nhanded her a packet containing a fairly good sum of money, which he had\nobtained from his bankers for the purpose. The brilliants, the interest\nin which seemed to be Tess’s for her life only (if he understood the\nwording of the will), he advised her to let him send to a bank for\nsafety; and to this she readily agreed.\n\nThese things arranged, he walked with Tess back to the carriage, and\nhanded her in. The coachman was paid and told where to drive her.\nTaking next his own bag and umbrella—the sole articles he had brought\nwith him hitherwards—he bade her goodbye; and they parted there and\nthen.\n\nThe fly moved creepingly up a hill, and Clare watched it go with an\nunpremeditated hope that Tess would look out of the window for one\nmoment. But that she never thought of doing, would not have ventured to\ndo, lying in a half-dead faint inside. Thus he beheld her recede, and\nin the anguish of his heart quoted a line from a poet, with peculiar\nemendations of his own—\n\n    God’s _not_ in his heaven: All’s _wrong_ with the world!\n\nWhen Tess had passed over the crest of the hill he turned to go his own\nway, and hardly knew that he loved her still.\n\n\nXXXVIII\n\nAs she drove on through Blackmoor Vale, and the landscape of her youth\nbegan to open around her, Tess aroused herself from her stupor. Her\nfirst thought was how would she be able to face her parents?\n\nShe reached a turnpike-gate which stood upon the highway to the\nvillage. It was thrown open by a stranger, not by the old man who had\nkept it for many years, and to whom she had been known; he had probably\nleft on New Year’s Day, the date when such changes were made. Having\nreceived no intelligence lately from her home, she asked the\nturnpike-keeper for news.\n\n“Oh—nothing, miss,” he answered. “Marlott is Marlott still. Folks have\ndied and that. John Durbeyfield, too, hev had a daughter married this\nweek to a gentleman-farmer; not from John’s own house, you know; they\nwas married elsewhere; the gentleman being of that high standing that\nJohn’s own folk was not considered well-be-doing enough to have any\npart in it, the bridegroom seeming not to know how’t have been\ndiscovered that John is a old and ancient nobleman himself by blood,\nwith family skillentons in their own vaults to this day, but done out\nof his property in the time o’ the Romans. However, Sir John, as we\ncall ’n now, kept up the wedding-day as well as he could, and stood\ntreat to everybody in the parish; and John’s wife sung songs at The\nPure Drop till past eleven o’clock.”\n\nHearing this, Tess felt so sick at heart that she could not decide to\ngo home publicly in the fly with her luggage and belongings. She asked\nthe turnpike-keeper if she might deposit her things at his house for a\nwhile, and, on his offering no objection, she dismissed her carriage,\nand went on to the village alone by a back lane.\n\nAt sight of her father’s chimney she asked herself how she could\npossibly enter the house? Inside that cottage her relations were calmly\nsupposing her far away on a wedding-tour with a comparatively rich man,\nwho was to conduct her to bouncing prosperity; while here she was,\nfriendless, creeping up to the old door quite by herself, with no\nbetter place to go to in the world.\n\nShe did not reach the house unobserved. Just by the garden-hedge she\nwas met by a girl who knew her—one of the two or three with whom she\nhad been intimate at school. After making a few inquiries as to how\nTess came there, her friend, unheeding her tragic look, interrupted\nwith—\n\n“But where’s thy gentleman, Tess?”\n\nTess hastily explained that he had been called away on business, and,\nleaving her interlocutor, clambered over the garden-hedge, and thus\nmade her way to the house.\n\nAs she went up the garden-path she heard her mother singing by the back\ndoor, coming in sight of which she perceived Mrs Durbeyfield on the\ndoorstep in the act of wringing a sheet. Having performed this without\nobserving Tess, she went indoors, and her daughter followed her.\n\nThe washing-tub stood in the same old place on the same old\nquarter-hogshead, and her mother, having thrown the sheet aside, was\nabout to plunge her arms in anew.\n\n“Why—Tess!—my chil’—I thought you was married!—married really and truly\nthis time—we sent the cider—”\n\n“Yes, mother; so I am.”\n\n“Going to be?”\n\n“No—I am married.”\n\n“Married! Then where’s thy husband?”\n\n“Oh, he’s gone away for a time.”\n\n“Gone away! When was you married, then? The day you said?”\n\n“Yes, Tuesday, mother.”\n\n“And now ’tis on’y Saturday, and he gone away?”\n\n“Yes, he’s gone.”\n\n“What’s the meaning o’ that? ’Nation seize such husbands as you seem to\nget, say I!”\n\n“Mother!” Tess went across to Joan Durbeyfield, laid her face upon the\nmatron’s bosom, and burst into sobs. “I don’t know how to tell ’ee,\nmother! You said to me, and wrote to me, that I was not to tell him.\nBut I did tell him—I couldn’t help it—and he went away!”\n\n“O you little fool—you little fool!” burst out Mrs Durbeyfield,\nsplashing Tess and herself in her agitation. “My good God! that ever I\nshould ha’ lived to say it, but I say it again, you little fool!”\n\nTess was convulsed with weeping, the tension of so many days having\nrelaxed at last.\n\n“I know it—I know—I know!” she gasped through her sobs. “But, O my\nmother, I could not help it! He was so good—and I felt the wickedness\nof trying to blind him as to what had happened! If—if—it were to be\ndone again—I should do the same. I could not—I dared not—so sin—against\nhim!”\n\n“But you sinned enough to marry him first!”\n\n“Yes, yes; that’s where my misery do lie! But I thought he could get\nrid o’ me by law if he were determined not to overlook it. And O, if\nyou knew—if you could only half know how I loved him—how anxious I was\nto have him—and how wrung I was between caring so much for him and my\nwish to be fair to him!”\n\nTess was so shaken that she could get no further, and sank, a helpless\nthing, into a chair.\n\n“Well, well; what’s done can’t be undone! I’m sure I don’t know why\nchildren o’ my bringing forth should all be bigger simpletons than\nother people’s—not to know better than to blab such a thing as that,\nwhen he couldn’t ha’ found it out till too late!” Here Mrs Durbeyfield\nbegan shedding tears on her own account as a mother to be pitied. “What\nyour father will say I don’t know,” she continued; “for he’s been\ntalking about the wedding up at Rolliver’s and The Pure Drop every day\nsince, and about his family getting back to their rightful position\nthrough you—poor silly man!—and now you’ve made this mess of it! The\nLord-a-Lord!”\n\nAs if to bring matters to a focus, Tess’s father was heard approaching\nat that moment. He did not, however, enter immediately, and Mrs\nDurbeyfield said that she would break the bad news to him herself, Tess\nkeeping out of sight for the present. After her first burst of\ndisappointment Joan began to take the mishap as she had taken Tess’s\noriginal trouble, as she would have taken a wet holiday or failure in\nthe potato-crop; as a thing which had come upon them irrespective of\ndesert or folly; a chance external impingement to be borne with; not a\nlesson.\n\nTess retreated upstairs and beheld casually that the beds had been\nshifted, and new arrangements made. Her old bed had been adapted for\ntwo younger children. There was no place here for her now.\n\nThe room below being unceiled she could hear most of what went on\nthere. Presently her father entered, apparently carrying in a live hen.\nHe was a foot-haggler now, having been obliged to sell his second\nhorse, and he travelled with his basket on his arm. The hen had been\ncarried about this morning as it was often carried, to show people that\nhe was in his work, though it had lain, with its legs tied, under the\ntable at Rolliver’s for more than an hour.\n\n“We’ve just had up a story about—” Durbeyfield began, and thereupon\nrelated in detail to his wife a discussion which had arisen at the inn\nabout the clergy, originated by the fact of his daughter having married\ninto a clerical family. “They was formerly styled ‘sir’, like my own\nancestry,” he said, “though nowadays their true style, strictly\nspeaking, is ‘clerk’ only.” As Tess had wished that no great publicity\nshould be given to the event, he had mentioned no particulars. He hoped\nshe would remove that prohibition soon. He proposed that the couple\nshould take Tess’s own name, d’Urberville, as uncorrupted. It was\nbetter than her husbands’s. He asked if any letter had come from her\nthat day.\n\nThen Mrs Durbeyfield informed him that no letter had come, but Tess\nunfortunately had come herself.\n\nWhen at length the collapse was explained to him, a sullen\nmortification, not usual with Durbeyfield, overpowered the influence of\nthe cheering glass. Yet the intrinsic quality of the event moved his\ntouchy sensitiveness less than its conjectured effect upon the minds of\nothers.\n\n“To think, now, that this was to be the end o’t!” said Sir John. “And I\nwith a family vault under that there church of Kingsbere as big as\nSquire Jollard’s ale-cellar, and my folk lying there in sixes and\nsevens, as genuine county bones and marrow as any recorded in history.\nAnd now to be sure what they fellers at Rolliver’s and The Pure Drop\nwill say to me! How they’ll squint and glane, and say, ‘This is yer\nmighty match is it; this is yer getting back to the true level of yer\nforefathers in King Norman’s time!’ I feel this is too much, Joan; I\nshall put an end to myself, title and all—I can bear it no longer!...\nBut she can make him keep her if he’s married her?”\n\n“Why, yes. But she won’t think o’ doing that.”\n\n“D’ye think he really have married her?—or is it like the first—”\n\nPoor Tess, who had heard as far as this, could not bear to hear more.\nThe perception that her word could be doubted even here, in her own\nparental house, set her mind against the spot as nothing else could\nhave done. How unexpected were the attacks of destiny! And if her\nfather doubted her a little, would not neighbours and acquaintance\ndoubt her much? O, she could not live long at home!\n\nA few days, accordingly, were all that she allowed herself here, at the\nend of which time she received a short note from Clare, informing her\nthat he had gone to the North of England to look at a farm. In her\ncraving for the lustre of her true position as his wife, and to hide\nfrom her parents the vast extent of the division between them, she made\nuse of this letter as her reason for again departing, leaving them\nunder the impression that she was setting out to join him. Still\nfurther to screen her husband from any imputation of unkindness to her,\nshe took twenty-five of the fifty pounds Clare had given her, and\nhanded the sum over to her mother, as if the wife of a man like Angel\nClare could well afford it, saying that it was a slight return for the\ntrouble and humiliation she had brought upon them in years past. With\nthis assertion of her dignity she bade them farewell; and after that\nthere were lively doings in the Durbeyfield household for some time on\nthe strength of Tess’s bounty, her mother saying, and, indeed,\nbelieving, that the rupture which had arisen between the young husband\nand wife had adjusted itself under their strong feeling that they could\nnot live apart from each other.\n\n\nXXXIX\n\nIt was three weeks after the marriage that Clare found himself\ndescending the hill which led to the well-known parsonage of his\nfather. With his downward course the tower of the church rose into the\nevening sky in a manner of inquiry as to why he had come; and no living\nperson in the twilighted town seemed to notice him, still less to\nexpect him. He was arriving like a ghost, and the sound of his own\nfootsteps was almost an encumbrance to be got rid of.\n\nThe picture of life had changed for him. Before this time he had known\nit but speculatively; now he thought he knew it as a practical man;\nthough perhaps he did not, even yet. Nevertheless humanity stood before\nhim no longer in the pensive sweetness of Italian art, but in the\nstaring and ghastly attitudes of a Wiertz Museum, and with the leer of\na study by Van Beers.\n\nHis conduct during these first weeks had been desultory beyond\ndescription. After mechanically attempting to pursue his agricultural\nplans as though nothing unusual had happened, in the manner recommended\nby the great and wise men of all ages, he concluded that very few of\nthose great and wise men had ever gone so far outside themselves as to\ntest the feasibility of their counsel. “This is the chief thing: be not\nperturbed,” said the Pagan moralist. That was just Clare’s own opinion.\nBut he was perturbed. “Let not your heart be troubled, neither let it\nbe afraid,” said the Nazarene. Clare chimed in cordially; but his heart\nwas troubled all the same. How he would have liked to confront those\ntwo great thinkers, and earnestly appeal to them as fellow-man to\nfellow-men, and ask them to tell him their method!\n\nHis mood transmuted itself into a dogged indifference till at length he\nfancied he was looking on his own existence with the passive interest\nof an outsider.\n\nHe was embittered by the conviction that all this desolation had been\nbrought about by the accident of her being a d’Urberville. When he\nfound that Tess came of that exhausted ancient line, and was not of the\nnew tribes from below, as he had fondly dreamed, why had he not\nstoically abandoned her in fidelity to his principles? This was what he\nhad got by apostasy, and his punishment was deserved.\n\nThen he became weary and anxious, and his anxiety increased. He\nwondered if he had treated her unfairly. He ate without knowing that he\nate, and drank without tasting. As the hours dropped past, as the\nmotive of each act in the long series of bygone days presented itself\nto his view, he perceived how intimately the notion of having Tess as a\ndear possession was mixed up with all his schemes and words and ways.\n\nIn going hither and thither he observed in the outskirts of a small\ntown a red-and-blue placard setting forth the great advantages of the\nEmpire of Brazil as a field for the emigrating agriculturist. Land was\noffered there on exceptionally advantageous terms. Brazil somewhat\nattracted him as a new idea. Tess could eventually join him there, and\nperhaps in that country of contrasting scenes and notions and habits\nthe conventions would not be so operative which made life with her seem\nimpracticable to him here. In brief he was strongly inclined to try\nBrazil, especially as the season for going thither was just at hand.\n\nWith this view he was returning to Emminster to disclose his plan to\nhis parents, and to make the best explanation he could make of arriving\nwithout Tess, short of revealing what had actually separated them. As\nhe reached the door the new moon shone upon his face, just as the old\none had done in the small hours of that morning when he had carried his\nwife in his arms across the river to the graveyard of the monks; but\nhis face was thinner now.\n\nClare had given his parents no warning of his visit, and his arrival\nstirred the atmosphere of the Vicarage as the dive of the kingfisher\nstirs a quiet pool. His father and mother were both in the\ndrawing-room, but neither of his brothers was now at home. Angel\nentered, and closed the door quietly behind him.\n\n“But—where’s your wife, dear Angel?” cried his mother. “How you\nsurprise us!”\n\n“She is at her mother’s—temporarily. I have come home rather in a hurry\nbecause I’ve decided to go to Brazil.”\n\n“Brazil! Why they are all Roman Catholics there surely!”\n\n“Are they? I hadn’t thought of that.”\n\nBut even the novelty and painfulness of his going to a Papistical land\ncould not displace for long Mr and Mrs Clare’s natural interest in\ntheir son’s marriage.\n\n“We had your brief note three weeks ago announcing that it had taken\nplace,” said Mrs Clare, “and your father sent your godmother’s gift to\nher, as you know. Of course it was best that none of us should be\npresent, especially as you preferred to marry her from the dairy, and\nnot at her home, wherever that may be. It would have embarrassed you,\nand given us no pleasure. Your bothers felt that very strongly. Now it\nis done we do not complain, particularly if she suits you for the\nbusiness you have chosen to follow instead of the ministry of the\nGospel.... Yet I wish I could have seen her first, Angel, or have known\na little more about her. We sent her no present of our own, not knowing\nwhat would best give her pleasure, but you must suppose it only\ndelayed. Angel, there is no irritation in my mind or your father’s\nagainst you for this marriage; but we have thought it much better to\nreserve our liking for your wife till we could see her. And now you\nhave not brought her. It seems strange. What has happened?”\n\nHe replied that it had been thought best by them that she should go to\nher parents’ home for the present, whilst he came there.\n\n“I don’t mind telling you, dear mother,” he said, “that I always meant\nto keep her away from this house till I should feel she could come with\ncredit to you. But this idea of Brazil is quite a recent one. If I do\ngo it will be unadvisable for me to take her on this my first journey.\nShe will remain at her mother’s till I come back.”\n\n“And I shall not see her before you start?”\n\nHe was afraid they would not. His original plan had been, as he had\nsaid, to refrain from bringing her there for some little while—not to\nwound their prejudices—feelings—in any way; and for other reasons he\nhad adhered to it. He would have to visit home in the course of a year,\nif he went out at once; and it would be possible for them to see her\nbefore he started a second time—with her.\n\nA hastily prepared supper was brought in, and Clare made further\nexposition of his plans. His mother’s disappointment at not seeing the\nbride still remained with her. Clare’s late enthusiasm for Tess had\ninfected her through her maternal sympathies, till she had almost\nfancied that a good thing could come out of Nazareth—a charming woman\nout of Talbothays Dairy. She watched her son as he ate.\n\n“Cannot you describe her? I am sure she is very pretty, Angel.”\n\n“Of that there can be no question!” he said, with a zest which covered\nits bitterness.\n\n“And that she is pure and virtuous goes without question?”\n\n“Pure and virtuous, of course, she is.”\n\n“I can see her quite distinctly. You said the other day that she was\nfine in figure; roundly built; had deep red lips like Cupid’s bow; dark\neyelashes and brows, an immense rope of hair like a ship’s cable; and\nlarge eyes violety-bluey-blackish.”\n\n“I did, mother.”\n\n“I quite see her. And living in such seclusion she naturally had scarce\never seen any young man from the world without till she saw you.”\n\n“Scarcely.”\n\n“You were her first love?”\n\n“Of course.”\n\n“There are worse wives than these simple, rosy-mouthed, robust girls of\nthe farm. Certainly I could have wished—well, since my son is to be an\nagriculturist, it is perhaps but proper that his wife should have been\naccustomed to an outdoor life.”\n\nHis father was less inquisitive; but when the time came for the chapter\nfrom the Bible which was always read before evening prayers, the Vicar\nobserved to Mrs Clare—\n\n“I think, since Angel has come, that it will be more appropriate to\nread the thirty-first of Proverbs than the chapter which we should have\nhad in the usual course of our reading?”\n\n“Yes, certainly,” said Mrs Clare. “The words of King Lemuel” (she could\ncite chapter and verse as well as her husband). “My dear son, your\nfather has decided to read us the chapter in Proverbs in praise of a\nvirtuous wife. We shall not need to be reminded to apply the words to\nthe absent one. May Heaven shield her in all her ways!”\n\nA lump rose in Clare’s throat. The portable lectern was taken out from\nthe corner and set in the middle of the fireplace, the two old servants\ncame in, and Angel’s father began to read at the tenth verse of the\naforesaid chapter—\n\n“Who can find a virtuous woman? for her price is far above rubies. She\nriseth while it is yet night, and giveth meat to her household. She\ngirdeth her loins with strength and strengtheneth her arms. She\nperceiveth that her merchandise is good; her candle goeth not out by\nnight. She looketh well to the ways of her household, and eateth not\nthe bread of idleness. Her children arise up and call her blessed; her\nhusband also, and he praiseth her. Many daughters have done virtuously,\nbut thou excellest them all.”\n\nWhen prayers were over, his mother said—\n\n“I could not help thinking how very aptly that chapter your dear father\nread applied, in some of its particulars, to the woman you have chosen.\nThe perfect woman, you see, was a working woman; not an idler; not a\nfine lady; but one who used her hands and her head and her heart for\nthe good of others. ‘Her children arise up and call her blessed; her\nhusband also, and he praiseth her. Many daughters have done virtuously,\nbut she excelleth them all.’ Well, I wish I could have seen her, Angel.\nSince she is pure and chaste, she would have been refined enough for\nme.”\n\nClare could bear this no longer. His eyes were full of tears, which\nseemed like drops of molten lead. He bade a quick good night to these\nsincere and simple souls whom he loved so well; who knew neither the\nworld, the flesh, nor the devil in their own hearts, only as something\nvague and external to themselves. He went to his own chamber.\n\nHis mother followed him, and tapped at his door. Clare opened it to\ndiscover her standing without, with anxious eyes.\n\n“Angel,” she asked, “is there something wrong that you go away so soon?\nI am quite sure you are not yourself.”\n\n“I am not, quite, mother,” said he.\n\n“About her? Now, my son, I know it is that—I know it is about her! Have\nyou quarrelled in these three weeks?”\n\n“We have not exactly quarrelled,” he said. “But we have had a\ndifference—”\n\n“Angel—is she a young woman whose history will bear investigation?”\n\nWith a mother’s instinct Mrs Clare had put her finger on the kind of\ntrouble that would cause such a disquiet as seemed to agitate her son.\n\n“She is spotless!” he replied; and felt that if it had sent him to\neternal hell there and then he would have told that lie.\n\n“Then never mind the rest. After all, there are few purer things in\nnature then an unsullied country maid. Any crudeness of manner which\nmay offend your more educated sense at first, will, I am sure,\ndisappear under the influence or your companionship and tuition.”\n\nSuch terrible sarcasm of blind magnanimity brought home to Clare the\nsecondary perception that he had utterly wrecked his career by this\nmarriage, which had not been among his early thoughts after the\ndisclosure. True, on his own account he cared very little about his\ncareer; but he had wished to make it at least a respectable one on\naccount of his parents and brothers. And now as he looked into the\ncandle its flame dumbly expressed to him that it was made to shine on\nsensible people, and that it abhorred lighting the face of a dupe and a\nfailure.\n\nWhen his agitation had cooled he would be at moments incensed with his\npoor wife for causing a situation in which he was obliged to practise\ndeception on his parents. He almost talked to her in his anger, as if\nshe had been in the room. And then her cooing voice, plaintive in\nexpostulation, disturbed the darkness, the velvet touch of her lips\npassed over his brow, and he could distinguish in the air the warmth of\nher breath.\n\nThis night the woman of his belittling deprecations was thinking how\ngreat and good her husband was. But over them both there hung a deeper\nshade than the shade which Angel Clare perceived, namely, the shade of\nhis own limitations. With all his attempted independence of judgement\nthis advanced and well-meaning young man, a sample product of the last\nfive-and-twenty years, was yet the slave to custom and conventionality\nwhen surprised back into his early teachings. No prophet had told him,\nand he was not prophet enough to tell himself, that essentially this\nyoung wife of his was as deserving of the praise of King Lemuel as any\nother woman endowed with the same dislike of evil, her moral value\nhaving to be reckoned not by achievement but by tendency. Moreover, the\nfigure near at hand suffers on such occasion, because it shows up its\nsorriness without shade; while vague figures afar off are honoured, in\nthat their distance makes artistic virtues of their stains. In\nconsidering what Tess was not, he overlooked what she was, and forgot\nthat the defective can be more than the entire.\n\n\nXL\n\nAt breakfast Brazil was the topic, and all endeavoured to take a\nhopeful view of Clare’s proposed experiment with that country’s soil,\nnotwithstanding the discouraging reports of some farm-labourers who had\nemigrated thither and returned home within the twelve months. After\nbreakfast Clare went into the little town to wind up such trifling\nmatters as he was concerned with there, and to get from the local bank\nall the money he possessed. On his way back he encountered Miss Mercy\nChant by the church, from whose walls she seemed to be a sort of\nemanation. She was carrying an armful of Bibles for her class, and such\nwas her view of life that events which produced heartache in others\nwrought beatific smiles upon her—an enviable result, although, in the\nopinion of Angel, it was obtained by a curiously unnatural sacrifice of\nhumanity to mysticism.\n\nShe had learnt that he was about to leave England, and observed what an\nexcellent and promising scheme it seemed to be.\n\n“Yes; it is a likely scheme enough in a commercial sense, no doubt,” he\nreplied. “But, my dear Mercy, it snaps the continuity of existence.\nPerhaps a cloister would be preferable.”\n\n“A cloister! O, Angel Clare!”\n\n“Well?”\n\n“Why, you wicked man, a cloister implies a monk, and a monk Roman\nCatholicism.”\n\n“And Roman Catholicism sin, and sin damnation. Thou art in a parlous\nstate, Angel Clare.”\n\n“_I_ glory in my Protestantism!” she said severely.\n\nThen Clare, thrown by sheer misery into one of the demoniacal moods in\nwhich a man does despite to his true principles, called her close to\nhim, and fiendishly whispered in her ear the most heterodox ideas he\ncould think of. His momentary laughter at the horror which appeared on\nher fair face ceased when it merged in pain and anxiety for his\nwelfare.\n\n“Dear Mercy,” he said, “you must forgive me. I think I am going crazy!”\n\nShe thought that he was; and thus the interview ended, and Clare\nre-entered the Vicarage. With the local banker he deposited the jewels\ntill happier days should arise. He also paid into the bank thirty\npounds—to be sent to Tess in a few months, as she might require; and\nwrote to her at her parents’ home in Blackmoor Vale to inform her of\nwhat he had done. This amount, with the sum he had already placed in\nher hands—about fifty pounds—he hoped would be amply sufficient for her\nwants just at present, particularly as in an emergency she had been\ndirected to apply to his father.\n\nHe deemed it best not to put his parents into communication with her by\ninforming them of her address; and, being unaware of what had really\nhappened to estrange the two, neither his father nor his mother\nsuggested that he should do so. During the day he left the parsonage,\nfor what he had to complete he wished to get done quickly.\n\nAs the last duty before leaving this part of England it was necessary\nfor him to call at the Wellbridge farmhouse, in which he had spent with\nTess the first three days of their marriage, the trifle of rent having\nto be paid, the key given up of the rooms they had occupied, and two or\nthree small articles fetched away that they had left behind. It was\nunder this roof that the deepest shadow ever thrown upon his life had\nstretched its gloom over him. Yet when he had unlocked the door of the\nsitting-room and looked into it, the memory which returned first upon\nhim was that of their happy arrival on a similar afternoon, the first\nfresh sense of sharing a habitation conjointly, the first meal\ntogether, the chatting by the fire with joined hands.\n\nThe farmer and his wife were in the field at the moment of his visit,\nand Clare was in the rooms alone for some time. Inwardly swollen with a\nrenewal of sentiment that he had not quite reckoned with, he went\nupstairs to her chamber, which had never been his. The bed was smooth\nas she had made it with her own hands on the morning of leaving. The\nmistletoe hung under the tester just as he had placed it. Having been\nthere three or four weeks it was turning colour, and the leaves and\nberries were wrinkled. Angel took it down and crushed it into the\ngrate. Standing there, he for the first time doubted whether his course\nin this conjecture had been a wise, much less a generous, one. But had\nhe not been cruelly blinded? In the incoherent multitude of his\nemotions he knelt down at the bedside wet-eyed. “O Tess! If you had\nonly told me sooner, I would have forgiven you!” he mourned.\n\nHearing a footstep below, he rose and went to the top of the stairs. At\nthe bottom of the flight he saw a woman standing, and on her turning up\nher face recognized the pale, dark-eyed Izz Huett.\n\n“Mr Clare,” she said, “I’ve called to see you and Mrs Clare, and to\ninquire if ye be well. I thought you might be back here again.”\n\nThis was a girl whose secret he had guessed, but who had not yet\nguessed his; an honest girl who loved him—one who would have made as\ngood, or nearly as good, a practical farmer’s wife as Tess.\n\n“I am here alone,” he said; “we are not living here now.” Explaining\nwhy he had come, he asked, “Which way are you going home, Izz?”\n\n“I have no home at Talbothays Dairy now, sir,” she said.\n\n“Why is that?”\n\nIzz looked down.\n\n“It was so dismal there that I left! I am staying out this way.” She\npointed in a contrary direction, the direction in which he was\njourneying.\n\n“Well—are you going there now? I can take you if you wish for a lift.”\n\nHer olive complexion grew richer in hue.\n\n“Thank ’ee, Mr Clare,” she said.\n\nHe soon found the farmer, and settled the account for his rent and the\nfew other items which had to be considered by reason of the sudden\nabandonment of the lodgings. On Clare’s return to his horse and gig,\nIzz jumped up beside him.\n\n“I am going to leave England, Izz,” he said, as they drove on. “Going\nto Brazil.”\n\n“And do Mrs Clare like the notion of such a journey?” she asked.\n\n“She is not going at present—say for a year or so. I am going out to\nreconnoitre—to see what life there is like.”\n\nThey sped along eastward for some considerable distance, Izz making no\nobservation.\n\n“How are the others?” he inquired. “How is Retty?”\n\n“She was in a sort of nervous state when I zid her last; and so thin\nand hollow-cheeked that ’a do seem in a decline. Nobody will ever fall\nin love wi’ her any more,” said Izz absently.\n\n“And Marian?”\n\nIzz lowered her voice.\n\n“Marian drinks.”\n\n“Indeed!”\n\n“Yes. The dairyman has got rid of her.”\n\n“And you!”\n\n“I don’t drink, and I bain’t in a decline. But—I am no great things at\nsinging afore breakfast now!”\n\n“How is that? Do you remember how neatly you used to turn ‘’Twas down\nin Cupid’s Gardens’ and ‘The Tailor’s Breeches’ at morning milking?”\n\n“Ah, yes! When you first came, sir, that was. Not when you had been\nthere a bit.”\n\n“Why was that falling-off?”\n\nHer black eyes flashed up to his face for one moment by way of answer.\n\n“Izz!—how weak of you—for such as I!” he said, and fell into reverie.\n“Then—suppose I had asked _you_ to marry me?”\n\n“If you had I should have said ‘Yes’, and you would have married a\nwoman who loved ’ee!”\n\n“Really!”\n\n“Down to the ground!” she whispered vehemently. “O my God! did you\nnever guess it till now!”\n\nBy-and-by they reached a branch road to a village.\n\n“I must get down. I live out there,” said Izz abruptly, never having\nspoken since her avowal.\n\nClare slowed the horse. He was incensed against his fate, bitterly\ndisposed towards social ordinances; for they had cooped him up in a\ncorner, out of which there was no legitimate pathway. Why not be\nrevenged on society by shaping his future domesticities loosely,\ninstead of kissing the pedagogic rod of convention in this ensnaring\nmanner?\n\n“I am going to Brazil alone, Izz,” said he. “I have separated from my\nwife for personal, not voyaging, reasons. I may never live with her\nagain. I may not be able to love you; but—will you go with me instead\nof her?”\n\n“You truly wish me to go?”\n\n“I do. I have been badly used enough to wish for relief. And you at\nleast love me disinterestedly.”\n\n“Yes—I will go,” said Izz, after a pause.\n\n“You will? You know what it means, Izz?”\n\n“It means that I shall live with you for the time you are over\nthere—that’s good enough for me.”\n\n“Remember, you are not to trust me in morals now. But I ought to remind\nyou that it will be wrong-doing in the eyes of civilization—Western\ncivilization, that is to say.”\n\n“I don’t mind that; no woman do when it comes to agony-point, and\nthere’s no other way!”\n\n“Then don’t get down, but sit where you are.”\n\nHe drove past the cross-roads, one mile, two miles, without showing any\nsigns of affection.\n\n“You love me very, very much, Izz?” he suddenly asked.\n\n“I do—I have said I do! I loved you all the time we was at the dairy\ntogether!”\n\n“More than Tess?”\n\nShe shook her head.\n\n“No,” she murmured, “not more than she.”\n\n“How’s that?”\n\n“Because nobody could love ’ee more than Tess did!... She would have\nlaid down her life for ’ee. I could do no more.”\n\nLike the prophet on the top of Peor, Izz Huett would fain have spoken\nperversely at such a moment, but the fascination exercised over her\nrougher nature by Tess’s character compelled her to grace.\n\nClare was silent; his heart had risen at these straightforward words\nfrom such an unexpected unimpeachable quarter. In his throat was\nsomething as if a sob had solidified there. His ears repeated, “_She\nwould have laid down her life for ’ee. I could do no more!_”\n\n“Forget our idle talk, Izz,” he said, turning the horse’s head\nsuddenly. “I don’t know what I’ve been saying! I will now drive you\nback to where your lane branches off.”\n\n“So much for honesty towards ’ee! O—how can I bear it—how can I—how can\nI!”\n\nIzz Huett burst into wild tears, and beat her forehead as she saw what\nshe had done.\n\n“Do you regret that poor little act of justice to an absent one? O,\nIzz, don’t spoil it by regret!”\n\nShe stilled herself by degrees.\n\n“Very well, sir. Perhaps I didn’t know what I was saying, either,\nwh—when I agreed to go! I wish—what cannot be!”\n\n“Because I have a loving wife already.”\n\n“Yes, yes! You have!”\n\nThey reached the corner of the lane which they had passed half an hour\nearlier, and she hopped down.\n\n“Izz—please, please forget my momentary levity!” he cried. “It was so\nill-considered, so ill-advised!”\n\n“Forget it? Never, never! O, it was no levity to me!”\n\nHe felt how richly he deserved the reproach that the wounded cry\nconveyed, and, in a sorrow that was inexpressible, leapt down and took\nher hand.\n\n“Well, but, Izz, we’ll part friends, anyhow? You don’t know what I’ve\nhad to bear!”\n\nShe was a really generous girl, and allowed no further bitterness to\nmar their adieux.\n\n“I forgive ’ee, sir!” she said.\n\n“Now, Izz,” he said, while she stood beside him there, forcing himself\nto the mentor’s part he was far from feeling; “I want you to tell\nMarian when you see her that she is to be a good woman, and not to give\nway to folly. Promise that, and tell Retty that there are more worthy\nmen than I in the world, that for my sake she is to act wisely and\nwell—remember the words—wisely and well—for my sake. I send this\nmessage to them as a dying man to the dying; for I shall never see them\nagain. And you, Izzy, you have saved me by your honest words about my\nwife from an incredible impulse towards folly and treachery. Women may\nbe bad, but they are not so bad as men in these things! On that one\naccount I can never forget you. Be always the good and sincere girl you\nhave hitherto been; and think of me as a worthless lover, but a\nfaithful friend. Promise.”\n\nShe gave the promise.\n\n“Heaven bless and keep you, sir. Goodbye!”\n\nHe drove on; but no sooner had Izz turned into the lane, and Clare was\nout of sight, than she flung herself down on the bank in a fit of\nracking anguish; and it was with a strained unnatural face that she\nentered her mother’s cottage late that night. Nobody ever was told how\nIzz spent the dark hours that intervened between Angel Clare’s parting\nfrom her and her arrival home.\n\nClare, too, after bidding the girl farewell, was wrought to aching\nthoughts and quivering lips. But his sorrow was not for Izz. That\nevening he was within a feather-weight’s turn of abandoning his road to\nthe nearest station, and driving across that elevated dorsal line of\nSouth Wessex which divided him from his Tess’s home. It was neither a\ncontempt for her nature, nor the probable state of her heart, which\ndeterred him.\n\nNo; it was a sense that, despite her love, as corroborated by Izz’s\nadmission, the facts had not changed. If he was right at first, he was\nright now. And the momentum of the course on which he had embarked\ntended to keep him going in it, unless diverted by a stronger, more\nsustained force than had played upon him this afternoon. He could soon\ncome back to her. He took the train that night for London, and five\ndays after shook hands in farewell of his brothers at the port of\nembarkation.\n\n\nXLI\n\nFrom the foregoing events of the winter-time let us press on to an\nOctober day, more than eight months subsequent to the parting of Clare\nand Tess. We discover the latter in changed conditions; instead of a\nbride with boxes and trunks which others bore, we see her a lonely\nwoman with a basket and a bundle in her own porterage, as at an earlier\ntime when she was no bride; instead of the ample means that were\nprojected by her husband for her comfort through this probationary\nperiod, she can produce only a flattened purse.\n\nAfter again leaving Marlott, her home, she had got through the spring\nand summer without any great stress upon her physical powers, the time\nbeing mainly spent in rendering light irregular service at dairy-work\nnear Port-Bredy to the west of the Blackmoor Valley, equally remote\nfrom her native place and from Talbothays. She preferred this to living\non his allowance. Mentally she remained in utter stagnation, a\ncondition which the mechanical occupation rather fostered than checked.\nHer consciousness was at that other dairy, at that other season, in the\npresence of the tender lover who had confronted her there—he who, the\nmoment she had grasped him to keep for her own, had disappeared like a\nshape in a vision.\n\nThe dairy-work lasted only till the milk began to lessen, for she had\nnot met with a second regular engagement as at Talbothays, but had done\nduty as a supernumerary only. However, as harvest was now beginning,\nshe had simply to remove from the pasture to the stubble to find plenty\nof further occupation, and this continued till harvest was done.\n\nOf the five-and-twenty pounds which had remained to her of Clare’s\nallowance, after deducting the other half of the fifty as a\ncontribution to her parents for the trouble and expense to which she\nhad put them, she had as yet spent but little. But there now followed\nan unfortunate interval of wet weather, during which she was obliged to\nfall back upon her sovereigns.\n\nShe could not bear to let them go. Angel had put them into her hand,\nhad obtained them bright and new from his bank for her; his touch had\nconsecrated them to souvenirs of himself—they appeared to have had as\nyet no other history than such as was created by his and her own\nexperiences—and to disperse them was like giving away relics. But she\nhad to do it, and one by one they left her hands.\n\nShe had been compelled to send her mother her address from time to\ntime, but she concealed her circumstances. When her money had almost\ngone a letter from her mother reached her. Joan stated that they were\nin dreadful difficulty; the autumn rains had gone through the thatch of\nthe house, which required entire renewal; but this could not be done\nbecause the previous thatching had never been paid for. New rafters and\na new ceiling upstairs also were required, which, with the previous\nbill, would amount to a sum of twenty pounds. As her husband was a man\nof means, and had doubtless returned by this time, could she not send\nthem the money?\n\nTess had thirty pounds coming to her almost immediately from Angel’s\nbankers, and, the case being so deplorable, as soon as the sum was\nreceived she sent the twenty as requested. Part of the remainder she\nwas obliged to expend in winter clothing, leaving only a nominal sum\nfor the whole inclement season at hand. When the last pound had gone, a\nremark of Angel’s that whenever she required further resources she was\nto apply to his father, remained to be considered.\n\nBut the more Tess thought of the step, the more reluctant was she to\ntake it. The same delicacy, pride, false shame, whatever it may be\ncalled, on Clare’s account, which had led her to hide from her own\nparents the prolongation of the estrangement, hindered her owning to\nhis that she was in want after the fair allowance he had left her. They\nprobably despised her already; how much more they would despise her in\nthe character of a mendicant! The consequence was that by no effort\ncould the parson’s daughter-in-law bring herself to let him know her\nstate.\n\nHer reluctance to communicate with her husband’s parents might, she\nthought, lessen with the lapse of time; but with her own the reverse\nobtained. On her leaving their house after the short visit subsequent\nto her marriage they were under the impression that she was ultimately\ngoing to join her husband; and from that time to the present she had\ndone nothing to disturb their belief that she was awaiting his return\nin comfort, hoping against hope that his journey to Brazil would result\nin a short stay only, after which he would come to fetch her, or that\nhe would write for her to join him; in any case that they would soon\npresent a united front to their families and the world. This hope she\nstill fostered. To let her parents know that she was a deserted wife,\ndependent, now that she had relieved their necessities, on her own\nhands for a living, after the _éclat_ of a marriage which was to\nnullify the collapse of the first attempt, would be too much indeed.\n\nThe set of brilliants returned to her mind. Where Clare had deposited\nthem she did not know, and it mattered little, if it were true that she\ncould only use and not sell them. Even were they absolutely hers it\nwould be passing mean to enrich herself by a legal title to them which\nwas not essentially hers at all.\n\nMeanwhile her husband’s days had been by no means free from trial. At\nthis moment he was lying ill of fever in the clay lands near Curitiba\nin Brazil, having been drenched with thunder-storms and persecuted by\nother hardships, in common with all the English farmers and\nfarm-labourers who, just at this time, were deluded into going thither\nby the promises of the Brazilian Government, and by the baseless\nassumption that those frames which, ploughing and sowing on English\nuplands, had resisted all the weathers to whose moods they had been\nborn, could resist equally well all the weathers by which they were\nsurprised on Brazilian plains.\n\nTo return. Thus it happened that when the last of Tess’s sovereigns had\nbeen spent she was unprovided with others to take their place, while on\naccount of the season she found it increasingly difficult to get\nemployment. Not being aware of the rarity of intelligence, energy,\nhealth, and willingness in any sphere of life, she refrained from\nseeking an indoor occupation; fearing towns, large houses, people of\nmeans and social sophistication, and of manners other than rural. From\nthat direction of gentility Black Care had come. Society might be\nbetter than she supposed from her slight experience of it. But she had\nno proof of this, and her instinct in the circumstances was to avoid\nits purlieus.\n\nThe small dairies to the west, beyond Port-Bredy, in which she had\nserved as supernumerary milkmaid during the spring and summer required\nno further aid. Room would probably have been made for her at\nTalbothays, if only out of sheer compassion; but comfortable as her\nlife had been there, she could not go back. The anti-climax would be\ntoo intolerable; and her return might bring reproach upon her idolized\nhusband. She could not have borne their pity, and their whispered\nremarks to one another upon her strange situation; though she would\nalmost have faced a knowledge of her circumstances by every individual\nthere, so long as her story had remained isolated in the mind of each.\nIt was the interchange of ideas about her that made her sensitiveness\nwince. Tess could not account for this distinction; she simply knew\nthat she felt it.\n\nShe was now on her way to an upland farm in the centre of the county,\nto which she had been recommended by a wandering letter which had\nreached her from Marian. Marian had somehow heard that Tess was\nseparated from her husband—probably through Izz Huett—and the\ngood-natured and now tippling girl, deeming Tess in trouble, had\nhastened to notify to her former friend that she herself had gone to\nthis upland spot after leaving the dairy, and would like to see her\nthere, where there was room for other hands, if it was really true that\nshe worked again as of old.\n\nWith the shortening of the days all hope of obtaining her husband’s\nforgiveness began to leave her; and there was something of the habitude\nof the wild animal in the unreflecting instinct with which she rambled\non—disconnecting herself by littles from her eventful past at every\nstep, obliterating her identity, giving no thought to accidents or\ncontingencies which might make a quick discovery of her whereabouts by\nothers of importance to her own happiness, if not to theirs.\n\nAmong the difficulties of her lonely position not the least was the\nattention she excited by her appearance, a certain bearing of\ndistinction, which she had caught from Clare, being superadded to her\nnatural attractiveness. Whilst the clothes lasted which had been\nprepared for her marriage, these casual glances of interest caused her\nno inconvenience, but as soon as she was compelled to don the wrapper\nof a fieldwoman, rude words were addressed to her more than once; but\nnothing occurred to cause her bodily fear till a particular November\nafternoon.\n\nShe had preferred the country west of the River Brit to the upland farm\nfor which she was now bound, because, for one thing, it was nearer to\nthe home of her husband’s father; and to hover about that region\nunrecognized, with the notion that she might decide to call at the\nVicarage some day, gave her pleasure. But having once decided to try\nthe higher and drier levels, she pressed back eastward, marching afoot\ntowards the village of Chalk-Newton, where she meant to pass the night.\n\nThe lane was long and unvaried, and, owing to the rapid shortening of\nthe days, dusk came upon her before she was aware. She had reached the\ntop of a hill down which the lane stretched its serpentine length in\nglimpses, when she heard footsteps behind her back, and in a few\nmoments she was overtaken by a man. He stepped up alongside Tess and\nsaid—\n\n“Good night, my pretty maid”: to which she civilly replied.\n\nThe light still remaining in the sky lit up her face, though the\nlandscape was nearly dark. The man turned and stared hard at her.\n\n“Why, surely, it is the young wench who was at Trantridge awhile—young\nSquire d’Urberville’s friend? I was there at that time, though I don’t\nlive there now.”\n\nShe recognized in him the well-to-do boor whom Angel had knocked down\nat the inn for addressing her coarsely. A spasm of anguish shot through\nher, and she returned him no answer.\n\n“Be honest enough to own it, and that what I said in the town was true,\nthough your fancy-man was so up about it—hey, my sly one? You ought to\nbeg my pardon for that blow of his, considering.”\n\nStill no answer came from Tess. There seemed only one escape for her\nhunted soul. She suddenly took to her heels with the speed of the wind,\nand, without looking behind her, ran along the road till she came to a\ngate which opened directly into a plantation. Into this she plunged,\nand did not pause till she was deep enough in its shade to be safe\nagainst any possibility of discovery.\n\nUnder foot the leaves were dry, and the foliage of some holly bushes\nwhich grew among the deciduous trees was dense enough to keep off\ndraughts. She scraped together the dead leaves till she had formed them\ninto a large heap, making a sort of nest in the middle. Into this Tess\ncrept.\n\nSuch sleep as she got was naturally fitful; she fancied she heard\nstrange noises, but persuaded herself that they were caused by the\nbreeze. She thought of her husband in some vague warm clime on the\nother side of the globe, while she was here in the cold. Was there\nanother such a wretched being as she in the world? Tess asked herself;\nand, thinking of her wasted life, said, “All is vanity.” She repeated\nthe words mechanically, till she reflected that this was a most\ninadequate thought for modern days. Solomon had thought as far as that\nmore than two thousand years ago; she herself, though not in the van of\nthinkers, had got much further. If all were only vanity, who would mind\nit? All was, alas, worse than vanity—injustice, punishment, exaction,\ndeath. The wife of Angel Clare put her hand to her brow, and felt its\ncurve, and the edges of her eye-sockets perceptible under the soft\nskin, and thought as she did so that a time would come when that bone\nwould be bare. “I wish it were now,” she said.\n\nIn the midst of these whimsical fancies she heard a new strange sound\namong the leaves. It might be the wind; yet there was scarcely any\nwind. Sometimes it was a palpitation, sometimes a flutter; sometimes it\nwas a sort of gasp or gurgle. Soon she was certain that the noises came\nfrom wild creatures of some kind, the more so when, originating in the\nboughs overhead, they were followed by the fall of a heavy body upon\nthe ground. Had she been ensconced here under other and more pleasant\nconditions she would have become alarmed; but, outside humanity, she\nhad at present no fear.\n\nDay at length broke in the sky. When it had been day aloft for some\nlittle while it became day in the wood.\n\nDirectly the assuring and prosaic light of the world’s active hours had\ngrown strong, she crept from under her hillock of leaves, and looked\naround boldly. Then she perceived what had been going on to disturb\nher. The plantation wherein she had taken shelter ran down at this spot\ninto a peak, which ended it hitherward, outside the hedge being arable\nground. Under the trees several pheasants lay about, their rich plumage\ndabbled with blood; some were dead, some feebly twitching a wing, some\nstaring up at the sky, some pulsating quickly, some contorted, some\nstretched out—all of them writhing in agony, except the fortunate ones\nwhose tortures had ended during the night by the inability of nature to\nbear more.\n\nTess guessed at once the meaning of this. The birds had been driven\ndown into this corner the day before by some shooting-party; and while\nthose that had dropped dead under the shot, or had died before\nnightfall, had been searched for and carried off, many badly wounded\nbirds had escaped and hidden themselves away, or risen among the thick\nboughs, where they had maintained their position till they grew weaker\nwith loss of blood in the night-time, when they had fallen one by one\nas she had heard them.\n\nShe had occasionally caught glimpses of these men in girlhood, looking\nover hedges, or peeping through bushes, and pointing their guns,\nstrangely accoutred, a bloodthirsty light in their eyes. She had been\ntold that, rough and brutal as they seemed just then, they were not\nlike this all the year round, but were, in fact, quite civil persons\nsave during certain weeks of autumn and winter, when, like the\ninhabitants of the Malay Peninsula, they ran amuck, and made it their\npurpose to destroy life—in this case harmless feathered creatures,\nbrought into being by artificial means solely to gratify these\npropensities—at once so unmannerly and so unchivalrous towards their\nweaker fellows in Nature’s teeming family.\n\nWith the impulse of a soul who could feel for kindred sufferers as much\nas for herself, Tess’s first thought was to put the still living birds\nout of their torture, and to this end with her own hands she broke the\nnecks of as many as she could find, leaving them to lie where she had\nfound them till the game-keepers should come—as they probably would\ncome—to look for them a second time.\n\n“Poor darlings—to suppose myself the most miserable being on earth in\nthe sight o’ such misery as yours!” she exclaimed, her tears running\ndown as she killed the birds tenderly. “And not a twinge of bodily pain\nabout me! I be not mangled, and I be not bleeding, and I have two hands\nto feed and clothe me.” She was ashamed of herself for her gloom of the\nnight, based on nothing more tangible than a sense of condemnation\nunder an arbitrary law of society which had no foundation in Nature.\n\n\nXLII\n\nIt was now broad day, and she started again, emerging cautiously upon\nthe highway. But there was no need for caution; not a soul was at hand,\nand Tess went onward with fortitude, her recollection of the birds’\nsilent endurance of their night of agony impressing upon her the\nrelativity of sorrows and the tolerable nature of her own, if she could\nonce rise high enough to despise opinion. But that she could not do so\nlong as it was held by Clare.\n\nShe reached Chalk-Newton, and breakfasted at an inn, where several\nyoung men were troublesomely complimentary to her good looks. Somehow\nshe felt hopeful, for was it not possible that her husband also might\nsay these same things to her even yet? She was bound to take care of\nherself on the chance of it, and keep off these casual lovers. To this\nend Tess resolved to run no further risks from her appearance. As soon\nas she got out of the village she entered a thicket and took from her\nbasket one of the oldest field-gowns, which she had never put on even\nat the dairy—never since she had worked among the stubble at Marlott.\nShe also, by a felicitous thought, took a handkerchief from her bundle\nand tied it round her face under her bonnet, covering her chin and half\nher cheeks and temples, as if she were suffering from toothache. Then\nwith her little scissors, by the aid of a pocket looking-glass, she\nmercilessly nipped her eyebrows off, and thus insured against\naggressive admiration, she went on her uneven way.\n\n“What a mommet of a maid!” said the next man who met her to a\ncompanion.\n\nTears came into her eyes for very pity of herself as she heard him.\n\n“But I don’t care!” she said. “O no—I don’t care! I’ll always be ugly\nnow, because Angel is not here, and I have nobody to take care of me.\nMy husband that was is gone away, and never will love me any more; but\nI love him just the same, and hate all other men, and like to make ’em\nthink scornfully of me!”\n\nThus Tess walks on; a figure which is part of the landscape; a\nfieldwoman pure and simple, in winter guise; a gray serge cape, a red\nwoollen cravat, a stuff skirt covered by a whitey-brown rough wrapper,\nand buff-leather gloves. Every thread of that old attire has become\nfaded and thin under the stroke of raindrops, the burn of sunbeams, and\nthe stress of winds. There is no sign of young passion in her now—\n\n    The maiden’s mouth is cold\n    . . . . .\n    Fold over simple fold\n    Binding her head.\n\nInside this exterior, over which the eye might have roved as over a\nthing scarcely percipient, almost inorganic, there was the record of a\npulsing life which had learnt too well, for its years, of the dust and\nashes of things, of the cruelty of lust and the fragility of love.\n\nNext day the weather was bad, but she trudged on, the honesty,\ndirectness, and impartiality of elemental enmity disconcerting her but\nlittle. Her object being a winter’s occupation and a winter’s home,\nthere was no time to lose. Her experience of short hirings had been\nsuch that she was determined to accept no more.\n\nThus she went forward from farm to farm in the direction of the place\nwhence Marian had written to her, which she determined to make use of\nas a last shift only, its rumoured stringencies being the reverse of\ntempting. First she inquired for the lighter kinds of employment, and,\nas acceptance in any variety of these grew hopeless, applied next for\nthe less light, till, beginning with the dairy and poultry tendance\nthat she liked best, she ended with the heavy and course pursuits which\nshe liked least—work on arable land: work of such roughness, indeed, as\nshe would never have deliberately voluteered for.\n\nTowards the second evening she reached the irregular chalk table-land\nor plateau, bosomed with semi-globular tumuli—as if Cybele the\nMany-breasted were supinely extended there—which stretched between the\nvalley of her birth and the valley of her love.\n\nHere the air was dry and cold, and the long cart-roads were blown white\nand dusty within a few hours after rain. There were few trees, or none,\nthose that would have grown in the hedges being mercilessly plashed\ndown with the quickset by the tenant-farmers, the natural enemies of\ntree, bush, and brake. In the middle distance ahead of her she could\nsee the summits of Bulbarrow and of Nettlecombe Tout, and they seemed\nfriendly. They had a low and unassuming aspect from this upland, though\nas approached on the other side from Blackmoor in her childhood they\nwere as lofty bastions against the sky. Southerly, at many miles’\ndistance, and over the hills and ridges coastward, she could discern a\nsurface like polished steel: it was the English Channel at a point far\nout towards France.\n\nBefore her, in a slight depression, were the remains of a village. She\nhad, in fact, reached Flintcomb-Ash, the place of Marian’s sojourn.\nThere seemed to be no help for it; hither she was doomed to come. The\nstubborn soil around her showed plainly enough that the kind of labour\nin demand here was of the roughest kind; but it was time to rest from\nsearching, and she resolved to stay, particularly as it began to rain.\nAt the entrance to the village was a cottage whose gable jutted into\nthe road, and before applying for a lodging she stood under its\nshelter, and watched the evening close in.\n\n“Who would think I was Mrs Angel Clare!” she said.\n\nThe wall felt warm to her back and shoulders, and she found that\nimmediately within the gable was the cottage fireplace, the heat of\nwhich came through the bricks. She warmed her hands upon them, and also\nput her cheek—red and moist with the drizzle—against their comforting\nsurface. The wall seemed to be the only friend she had. She had so\nlittle wish to leave it that she could have stayed there all night.\n\nTess could hear the occupants of the cottage—gathered together after\ntheir day’s labour—talking to each other within, and the rattle of\ntheir supper-plates was also audible. But in the village-street she had\nseen no soul as yet. The solitude was at last broken by the approach of\none feminine figure, who, though the evening was cold, wore the print\ngown and the tilt-bonnet of summer time. Tess instinctively thought it\nmight be Marian, and when she came near enough to be distinguishable in\nthe gloom, surely enough it was she. Marian was even stouter and redder\nin the face than formerly, and decidedly shabbier in attire. At any\nprevious period of her existence Tess would hardly have cared to renew\nthe acquaintance in such conditions; but her loneliness was excessive,\nand she responded readily to Marian’s greeting.\n\nMarian was quite respectful in her inquiries, but seemed much moved by\nthe fact that Tess should still continue in no better condition than at\nfirst; though she had dimly heard of the separation.\n\n“Tess—Mrs Clare—the dear wife of dear he! And is it really so bad as\nthis, my child? Why is your cwomely face tied up in such a way? Anybody\nbeen beating ’ee? Not _he_?”\n\n“No, no, no! I merely did it not to be clipsed or colled, Marian.”\n\nShe pulled off in disgust a bandage which could suggest such wild\nthoughts.\n\n“And you’ve got no collar on” (Tess had been accustomed to wear a\nlittle white collar at the dairy).\n\n“I know it, Marian.”\n\n“You’ve lost it travelling.”\n\n“I’ve not lost it. The truth is, I don’t care anything about my looks;\nand so I didn’t put it on.”\n\n“And you don’t wear your wedding-ring?”\n\n“Yes, I do; but not in public. I wear it round my neck on a ribbon. I\ndon’t wish people to think who I am by marriage, or that I am married\nat all; it would be so awkward while I lead my present life.”\n\nMarian paused.\n\n“But you _be_ a gentleman’s wife; and it seems hardly fair that you\nshould live like this!”\n\n“O yes it is, quite fair; though I am very unhappy.”\n\n“Well, well. _He_ married you—and you can be unhappy!”\n\n“Wives are unhappy sometimes; from no fault of their husbands—from\ntheir own.”\n\n“You’ve no faults, deary; that I’m sure of. And he’s none. So it must\nbe something outside ye both.”\n\n“Marian, dear Marian, will you do me a good turn without asking\nquestions? My husband has gone abroad, and somehow I have overrun my\nallowance, so that I have to fall back upon my old work for a time. Do\nnot call me Mrs Clare, but Tess, as before. Do they want a hand here?”\n\n“O yes; they’ll take one always, because few care to come. ’Tis a\nstarve-acre place. Corn and swedes are all they grow. Though I be here\nmyself, I feel ’tis a pity for such as you to come.”\n\n“But you used to be as good a dairywoman as I.”\n\n“Yes; but I’ve got out o’ that since I took to drink. Lord, that’s the\nonly comfort I’ve got now! If you engage, you’ll be set swede-hacking.\nThat’s what I be doing; but you won’t like it.”\n\n“O—anything! Will you speak for me?”\n\n“You will do better by speaking for yourself.”\n\n“Very well. Now, Marian, remember—nothing about _him_ if I get the\nplace. I don’t wish to bring his name down to the dirt.”\n\nMarian, who was really a trustworthy girl though of coarser grain than\nTess, promised anything she asked.\n\n“This is pay-night,” she said, “and if you were to come with me you\nwould know at once. I be real sorry that you are not happy; but ’tis\nbecause he’s away, I know. You couldn’t be unhappy if he were here,\neven if he gie’d ye no money—even if he used you like a drudge.”\n\n“That’s true; I could not!”\n\nThey walked on together and soon reached the farmhouse, which was\nalmost sublime in its dreariness. There was not a tree within sight;\nthere was not, at this season, a green pasture—nothing but fallow and\nturnips everywhere, in large fields divided by hedges plashed to\nunrelieved levels.\n\nTess waited outside the door of the farmhouse till the group of\nworkfolk had received their wages, and then Marian introduced her. The\nfarmer himself, it appeared, was not at home, but his wife, who\nrepresented him this evening, made no objection to hiring Tess, on her\nagreeing to remain till Old Lady-Day. Female field-labour was seldom\noffered now, and its cheapness made it profitable for tasks which women\ncould perform as readily as men.\n\nHaving signed the agreement, there was nothing more for Tess to do at\npresent than to get a lodging, and she found one in the house at whose\ngable-wall she had warmed herself. It was a poor subsistence that she\nhad ensured, but it would afford a shelter for the winter at any rate.\n\nThat night she wrote to inform her parents of her new address, in case\na letter should arrive at Marlott from her husband. But she did not\ntell them of the sorriness of her situation: it might have brought\nreproach upon him.\n\n\nXLIII\n\nThere was no exaggeration in Marian’s definition of Flintcomb-Ash farm\nas a starve-acre place. The single fat thing on the soil was Marian\nherself; and she was an importation. Of the three classes of village,\nthe village cared for by its lord, the village cared for by itself, and\nthe village uncared for either by itself or by its lord (in other\nwords, the village of a resident squire’s tenantry, the village of free\nor copy-holders, and the absentee-owner’s village, farmed with the\nland) this place, Flintcomb-Ash, was the third.\n\nBut Tess set to work. Patience, that blending of moral courage with\nphysical timidity, was now no longer a minor feature in Mrs Angel\nClare; and it sustained her.\n\nThe swede-field in which she and her companion were set hacking was a\nstretch of a hundred odd acres in one patch, on the highest ground of\nthe farm, rising above stony lanchets or lynchets—the outcrop of\nsiliceous veins in the chalk formation, composed of myriads of loose\nwhite flints in bulbous, cusped, and phallic shapes. The upper half of\neach turnip had been eaten off by the live-stock, and it was the\nbusiness of the two women to grub up the lower or earthy half of the\nroot with a hooked fork called a hacker, that it might be eaten also.\nEvery leaf of the vegetable having already been consumed, the whole\nfield was in colour a desolate drab; it was a complexion without\nfeatures, as if a face, from chin to brow, should be only an expanse of\nskin. The sky wore, in another colour, the same likeness; a white\nvacuity of countenance with the lineaments gone. So these two upper and\nnether visages confronted each other all day long, the white face\nlooking down on the brown face, and the brown face looking up at the\nwhite face, without anything standing between them but the two girls\ncrawling over the surface of the former like flies.\n\nNobody came near them, and their movements showed a mechanical\nregularity; their forms standing enshrouded in Hessian\n“wroppers”—sleeved brown pinafores, tied behind to the bottom, to keep\ntheir gowns from blowing about—scant skirts revealing boots that\nreached high up the ankles, and yellow sheepskin gloves with gauntlets.\nThe pensive character which the curtained hood lent to their bent heads\nwould have reminded the observer of some early Italian conception of\nthe two Marys.\n\nThey worked on hour after hour, unconscious of the forlorn aspect they\nbore in the landscape, not thinking of the justice or injustice of\ntheir lot. Even in such a position as theirs it was possible to exist\nin a dream. In the afternoon the rain came on again, and Marian said\nthat they need not work any more. But if they did not work they would\nnot be paid; so they worked on. It was so high a situation, this field,\nthat the rain had no occasion to fall, but raced along horizontally\nupon the yelling wind, sticking into them like glass splinters till\nthey were wet through. Tess had not known till now what was really\nmeant by that. There are degrees of dampness, and a very little is\ncalled being wet through in common talk. But to stand working slowly in\na field, and feel the creep of rain-water, first in legs and shoulders,\nthen on hips and head, then at back, front, and sides, and yet to work\non till the leaden light diminishes and marks that the sun is down,\ndemands a distinct modicum of stoicism, even of valour.\n\nYet they did not feel the wetness so much as might be supposed. They\nwere both young, and they were talking of the time when they lived and\nloved together at Talbothays Dairy, that happy green tract of land\nwhere summer had been liberal in her gifts; in substance to all,\nemotionally to these. Tess would fain not have conversed with Marian of\nthe man who was legally, if not actually, her husband; but the\nirresistible fascination of the subject betrayed her into reciprocating\nMarian’s remarks. And thus, as has been said, though the damp curtains\nof their bonnets flapped smartly into their faces, and their wrappers\nclung about them to wearisomeness, they lived all this afternoon in\nmemories of green, sunny, romantic Talbothays.\n\n“You can see a gleam of a hill within a few miles o’ Froom Valley from\nhere when ’tis fine,” said Marian.\n\n“Ah! Can you?” said Tess, awake to the new value of this locality.\n\nSo the two forces were at work here as everywhere, the inherent will to\nenjoy, and the circumstantial will against enjoyment. Marian’s will had\na method of assisting itself by taking from her pocket as the afternoon\nwore on a pint bottle corked with white rag, from which she invited\nTess to drink. Tess’s unassisted power of dreaming, however, being\nenough for her sublimation at present, she declined except the merest\nsip, and then Marian took a pull from the spirits.\n\n“I’ve got used to it,” she said, “and can’t leave it off now. ’Tis my\nonly comfort—You see I lost him: you didn’t; and you can do without it\nperhaps.”\n\nTess thought her loss as great as Marian’s, but upheld by the dignity\nof being Angel’s wife, in the letter at least, she accepted Marian’s\ndifferentiation.\n\nAmid this scene Tess slaved in the morning frosts and in the afternoon\nrains. When it was not swede-grubbing it was swede-trimming, in which\nprocess they sliced off the earth and the fibres with a bill-hook\nbefore storing the roots for future use. At this occupation they could\nshelter themselves by a thatched hurdle if it rained; but if it was\nfrosty even their thick leather gloves could not prevent the frozen\nmasses they handled from biting their fingers. Still Tess hoped. She\nhad a conviction that sooner or later the magnanimity which she\npersisted in reckoning as a chief ingredient of Clare’s character would\nlead him to rejoin her.\n\nMarian, primed to a humorous mood, would discover the queer-shaped\nflints aforesaid, and shriek with laughter, Tess remaining severely\nobtuse. They often looked across the country to where the Var or Froom\nwas known to stretch, even though they might not be able to see it;\nand, fixing their eyes on the cloaking gray mist, imagined the old\ntimes they had spent out there.\n\n“Ah,” said Marian, “how I should like another or two of our old set to\ncome here! Then we could bring up Talbothays every day here afield, and\ntalk of he, and of what nice times we had there, and o’ the old things\nwe used to know, and make it all come back a’most, in seeming!”\nMarian’s eyes softened, and her voice grew vague as the visions\nreturned. “I’ll write to Izz Huett,” she said. “She’s biding at home\ndoing nothing now, I know, and I’ll tell her we be here, and ask her to\ncome; and perhaps Retty is well enough now.”\n\nTess had nothing to say against the proposal, and the next she heard of\nthis plan for importing old Talbothays’ joys was two or three days\nlater, when Marian informed her that Izz had replied to her inquiry,\nand had promised to come if she could.\n\nThere had not been such a winter for years. It came on in stealthy and\nmeasured glides, like the moves of a chess-player. One morning the few\nlonely trees and the thorns of the hedgerows appeared as if they had\nput off a vegetable for an animal integument. Every twig was covered\nwith a white nap as of fur grown from the rind during the night, giving\nit four times its usual stoutness; the whole bush or tree forming a\nstaring sketch in white lines on the mournful gray of the sky and\nhorizon. Cobwebs revealed their presence on sheds and walls where none\nhad ever been observed till brought out into visibility by the\ncrystallizing atmosphere, hanging like loops of white worsted from\nsalient points of the out-houses, posts, and gates.\n\nAfter this season of congealed dampness came a spell of dry frost, when\nstrange birds from behind the North Pole began to arrive silently on\nthe upland of Flintcomb-Ash; gaunt spectral creatures with tragical\neyes—eyes which had witnessed scenes of cataclysmal horror in\ninaccessible polar regions of a magnitude such as no human being had\never conceived, in curdling temperatures that no man could endure;\nwhich had beheld the crash of icebergs and the slide of snow-hills by\nthe shooting light of the Aurora; been half blinded by the whirl of\ncolossal storms and terraqueous distortions; and retained the\nexpression of feature that such scenes had engendered. These nameless\nbirds came quite near to Tess and Marian, but of all they had seen\nwhich humanity would never see, they brought no account. The\ntraveller’s ambition to tell was not theirs, and, with dumb\nimpassivity, they dismissed experiences which they did not value for\nthe immediate incidents of this homely upland—the trivial movements of\nthe two girls in disturbing the clods with their hackers so as to\nuncover something or other that these visitants relished as food.\n\nThen one day a peculiar quality invaded the air of this open country.\nThere came a moisture which was not of rain, and a cold which was not\nof frost. It chilled the eyeballs of the twain, made their brows ache,\npenetrated to their skeletons, affecting the surface of the body less\nthan its core. They knew that it meant snow, and in the night the snow\ncame. Tess, who continued to live at the cottage with the warm gable\nthat cheered any lonely pedestrian who paused beside it, awoke in the\nnight, and heard above the thatch noises which seemed to signify that\nthe roof had turned itself into a gymnasium of all the winds. When she\nlit her lamp to get up in the morning she found that the snow had blown\nthrough a chink in the casement, forming a white cone of the finest\npowder against the inside, and had also come down the chimney, so that\nit lay sole-deep upon the floor, on which her shoes left tracks when\nshe moved about. Without, the storm drove so fast as to create a\nsnow-mist in the kitchen; but as yet it was too dark out-of-doors to\nsee anything.\n\nTess knew that it was impossible to go on with the swedes; and by the\ntime she had finished breakfast beside the solitary little lamp, Marian\narrived to tell her that they were to join the rest of the women at\nreed-drawing in the barn till the weather changed. As soon, therefore,\nas the uniform cloak of darkness without began to turn to a disordered\nmedley of grays, they blew out the lamp, wrapped themselves up in their\nthickest pinners, tied their woollen cravats round their necks and\nacross their chests, and started for the barn. The snow had followed\nthe birds from the polar basin as a white pillar of a cloud, and\nindividual flakes could not be seen. The blast smelt of icebergs,\narctic seas, whales, and white bears, carrying the snow so that it\nlicked the land but did not deepen on it. They trudged onwards with\nslanted bodies through the flossy fields, keeping as well as they could\nin the shelter of hedges, which, however, acted as strainers rather\nthan screens. The air, afflicted to pallor with the hoary multitudes\nthat infested it, twisted and spun them eccentrically, suggesting an\nachromatic chaos of things. But both the young women were fairly\ncheerful; such weather on a dry upland is not in itself dispiriting.\n\n“Ha-ha! the cunning northern birds knew this was coming,” said Marian.\n“Depend upon’t, they keep just in front o’t all the way from the North\nStar. Your husband, my dear, is, I make no doubt, having scorching\nweather all this time. Lord, if he could only see his pretty wife now!\nNot that this weather hurts your beauty at all—in fact, it rather does\nit good.”\n\n“You mustn’t talk about him to me, Marian,” said Tess severely.\n\n“Well, but—surely you care for ’n! Do you?”\n\nInstead of answering, Tess, with tears in her eyes, impulsively faced\nin the direction in which she imagined South America to lie, and,\nputting up her lips, blew out a passionate kiss upon the snowy wind.\n\n“Well, well, I know you do. But ’pon my body, it is a rum life for a\nmarried couple! There—I won’t say another word! Well, as for the\nweather, it won’t hurt us in the wheat-barn; but reed-drawing is\nfearful hard work—worse than swede-hacking. I can stand it because I’m\nstout; but you be slimmer than I. I can’t think why maister should have\nset ’ee at it.”\n\nThey reached the wheat-barn and entered it. One end of the long\nstructure was full of corn; the middle was where the reed-drawing was\ncarried on, and there had already been placed in the reed-press the\nevening before as many sheaves of wheat as would be sufficient for the\nwomen to draw from during the day.\n\n“Why, here’s Izz!” said Marian.\n\nIzz it was, and she came forward. She had walked all the way from her\nmother’s home on the previous afternoon, and, not deeming the distance\nso great, had been belated, arriving, however, just before the snow\nbegan, and sleeping at the alehouse. The farmer had agreed with her\nmother at market to take her on if she came to-day, and she had been\nafraid to disappoint him by delay.\n\nIn addition to Tess, Marian, and Izz, there were two women from a\nneighbouring village; two Amazonian sisters, whom Tess with a start\nremembered as Dark Car, the Queen of Spades, and her junior, the Queen\nof Diamonds—those who had tried to fight with her in the midnight\nquarrel at Trantridge. They showed no recognition of her, and possibly\nhad none, for they had been under the influence of liquor on that\noccasion, and were only temporary sojourners there as here. They did\nall kinds of men’s work by preference, including well-sinking, hedging,\nditching, and excavating, without any sense of fatigue. Noted\nreed-drawers were they too, and looked round upon the other three with\nsome superciliousness.\n\nPutting on their gloves, all set to work in a row in front of the\npress, an erection formed of two posts connected by a cross-beam, under\nwhich the sheaves to be drawn from were laid ears outward, the beam\nbeing pegged down by pins in the uprights, and lowered as the sheaves\ndiminished.\n\nThe day hardened in colour, the light coming in at the barndoors\nupwards from the snow instead of downwards from the sky. The girls\npulled handful after handful from the press; but by reason of the\npresence of the strange women, who were recounting scandals, Marian and\nIzz could not at first talk of old times as they wished to do.\nPresently they heard the muffled tread of a horse, and the farmer rode\nup to the barndoor. When he had dismounted he came close to Tess, and\nremained looking musingly at the side of her face. She had not turned\nat first, but his fixed attitude led her to look round, when she\nperceived that her employer was the native of Trantridge from whom she\nhad taken flight on the high-road because of his allusion to her\nhistory.\n\nHe waited till she had carried the drawn bundles to the pile outside,\nwhen he said, “So you be the young woman who took my civility in such\nill part? Be drowned if I didn’t think you might be as soon as I heard\nof your being hired! Well, you thought you had got the better of me the\nfirst time at the inn with your fancy-man, and the second time on the\nroad, when you bolted; but now I think I’ve got the better of you.” He\nconcluded with a hard laugh.\n\nTess, between the Amazons and the farmer, like a bird caught in a\nclap-net, returned no answer, continuing to pull the straw. She could\nread character sufficiently well to know by this time that she had\nnothing to fear from her employer’s gallantry; it was rather the\ntyranny induced by his mortification at Clare’s treatment of him. Upon\nthe whole she preferred that sentiment in man and felt brave enough to\nendure it.\n\n“You thought I was in love with ’ee I suppose? Some women are such\nfools, to take every look as serious earnest. But there’s nothing like\na winter afield for taking that nonsense out o’ young wenches’ heads;\nand you’ve signed and agreed till Lady-Day. Now, are you going to beg\nmy pardon?”\n\n“I think you ought to beg mine.”\n\n“Very well—as you like. But we’ll see which is master here. Be they all\nthe sheaves you’ve done to-day?”\n\n“Yes, sir.”\n\n“’Tis a very poor show. Just see what they’ve done over there”\n(pointing to the two stalwart women). “The rest, too, have done better\nthan you.”\n\n“They’ve all practised it before, and I have not. And I thought it made\nno difference to you as it is task work, and we are only paid for what\nwe do.”\n\n“Oh, but it does. I want the barn cleared.”\n\n“I am going to work all the afternoon instead of leaving at two as the\nothers will do.”\n\nHe looked sullenly at her and went away. Tess felt that she could not\nhave come to a much worse place; but anything was better than\ngallantry. When two o’clock arrived the professional reed-drawers\ntossed off the last half-pint in their flagon, put down their hooks,\ntied their last sheaves, and went away. Marian and Izz would have done\nlikewise, but on hearing that Tess meant to stay, to make up by longer\nhours for her lack of skill, they would not leave her. Looking out at\nthe snow, which still fell, Marian exclaimed, “Now, we’ve got it all to\nourselves.” And so at last the conversation turned to their old\nexperiences at the dairy; and, of course, the incidents of their\naffection for Angel Clare.\n\n“Izz and Marian,” said Mrs Angel Clare, with a dignity which was\nextremely touching, seeing how very little of a wife she was: “I can’t\njoin in talk with you now, as I used to do, about Mr Clare; you will\nsee that I cannot; because, although he is gone away from me for the\npresent, he is my husband.”\n\nIzz was by nature the sauciest and most caustic of all the four girls\nwho had loved Clare. “He was a very splendid lover, no doubt,” she\nsaid; “but I don’t think he is a too fond husband to go away from you\nso soon.”\n\n“He had to go—he was obliged to go, to see about the land over there!”\npleaded Tess.\n\n“He might have tided ’ee over the winter.”\n\n“Ah—that’s owing to an accident—a misunderstanding; and we won’t argue\nit,” Tess answered, with tearfulness in her words. “Perhaps there’s a\ngood deal to be said for him! He did not go away, like some husbands,\nwithout telling me; and I can always find out where he is.”\n\nAfter this they continued for some long time in a reverie, as they went\non seizing the ears of corn, drawing out the straw, gathering it under\ntheir arms, and cutting off the ears with their bill-hooks, nothing\nsounding in the barn but the swish of the straw and the crunch of the\nhook. Then Tess suddenly flagged, and sank down upon the heap of\nwheat-ears at her feet.\n\n“I knew you wouldn’t be able to stand it!” cried Marian. “It wants\nharder flesh than yours for this work.”\n\nJust then the farmer entered. “Oh, that’s how you get on when I am\naway,” he said to her.\n\n“But it is my own loss,” she pleaded. “Not yours.”\n\n“I want it finished,” he said doggedly, as he crossed the barn and went\nout at the other door.\n\n“Don’t ’ee mind him, there’s a dear,” said Marian. “I’ve worked here\nbefore. Now you go and lie down there, and Izz and I will make up your\nnumber.”\n\n“I don’t like to let you do that. I’m taller than you, too.”\n\nHowever, she was so overcome that she consented to lie down awhile, and\nreclined on a heap of pull-tails—the refuse after the straight straw\nhad been drawn—thrown up at the further side of the barn. Her\nsuccumbing had been as largely owning to agitation at the re-opening\nthe subject of her separation from her husband as to the hard work. She\nlay in a state of percipience without volition, and the rustle of the\nstraw and the cutting of the ears by the others had the weight of\nbodily touches.\n\nShe could hear from her corner, in addition to these noises, the murmur\nof their voices. She felt certain that they were continuing the subject\nalready broached, but their voices were so low that she could not catch\nthe words. At last Tess grew more and more anxious to know what they\nwere saying, and, persuading herself that she felt better, she got up\nand resumed work.\n\nThen Izz Huett broke down. She had walked more than a dozen miles the\nprevious evening, had gone to bed at midnight, and had risen again at\nfive o’clock. Marian alone, thanks to her bottle of liquor and her\nstoutness of build, stood the strain upon back and arms without\nsuffering. Tess urged Izz to leave off, agreeing, as she felt better,\nto finish the day without her, and make equal division of the number of\nsheaves.\n\nIzz accepted the offer gratefully, and disappeared through the great\ndoor into the snowy track to her lodging. Marian, as was the case every\nafternoon at this time on account of the bottle, began to feel in a\nromantic vein.\n\n“I should not have thought it of him—never!” she said in a dreamy tone.\n“And I loved him so! I didn’t mind his having _you_. But this about Izz\nis too bad!”\n\nTess, in her start at the words, narrowly missed cutting off a finger\nwith the bill-hook.\n\n“Is it about my husband?” she stammered.\n\n“Well, yes. Izz said, ‘Don’t ’ee tell her’; but I am sure I can’t help\nit! It was what he wanted Izz to do. He wanted her to go off to Brazil\nwith him.”\n\nTess’s face faded as white as the scene without, and its curves\nstraightened. “And did Izz refuse to go?” she asked.\n\n“I don’t know. Anyhow he changed his mind.”\n\n“Pooh—then he didn’t mean it! ’Twas just a man’s jest!”\n\n“Yes he did; for he drove her a good-ways towards the station.”\n\n“He didn’t take her!”\n\nThey pulled on in silence till Tess, without any premonitory symptoms,\nburst out crying.\n\n“There!” said Marian. “Now I wish I hadn’t told ’ee!”\n\n“No. It is a very good thing that you have done! I have been living on\nin a thirtover, lackaday way, and have not seen what it may lead to! I\nought to have sent him a letter oftener. He said I could not go to him,\nbut he didn’t say I was not to write as often as I liked. I won’t dally\nlike this any longer! I have been very wrong and neglectful in leaving\neverything to be done by him!”\n\nThe dim light in the barn grew dimmer, and they could see to work no\nlonger. When Tess had reached home that evening, and had entered into\nthe privacy of her little white-washed chamber, she began impetuously\nwriting a letter to Clare. But falling into doubt, she could not finish\nit. Afterwards she took the ring from the ribbon on which she wore it\nnext her heart, and retained it on her finger all night, as if to\nfortify herself in the sensation that she was really the wife of this\nelusive lover of hers, who could propose that Izz should go with him\nabroad, so shortly after he had left her. Knowing that, how could she\nwrite entreaties to him, or show that she cared for him any more?\n\n\nXLIV\n\nBy the disclosure in the barn her thoughts were led anew in the\ndirection which they had taken more than once of late—to the distant\nEmminster Vicarage. It was through her husband’s parents that she had\nbeen charged to send a letter to Clare if she desired; and to write to\nthem direct if in difficulty. But that sense of her having morally no\nclaim upon him had always led Tess to suspend her impulse to send these\nnotes; and to the family at the Vicarage, therefore, as to her own\nparents since her marriage, she was virtually non-existent. This\nself-effacement in both directions had been quite in consonance with\nher independent character of desiring nothing by way of favour or pity\nto which she was not entitled on a fair consideration of her deserts.\nShe had set herself to stand or fall by her qualities, and to waive\nsuch merely technical claims upon a strange family as had been\nestablished for her by the flimsy fact of a member of that family, in a\nseason of impulse, writing his name in a church-book beside hers.\n\nBut now that she was stung to a fever by Izz’s tale, there was a limit\nto her powers of renunciation. Why had her husband not written to her?\nHe had distinctly implied that he would at least let her know of the\nlocality to which he had journeyed; but he had not sent a line to\nnotify his address. Was he really indifferent? But was he ill? Was it\nfor her to make some advance? Surely she might summon the courage of\nsolicitude, call at the Vicarage for intelligence, and express her\ngrief at his silence. If Angel’s father were the good man she had heard\nhim represented to be, he would be able to enter into her heart-starved\nsituation. Her social hardships she could conceal.\n\nTo leave the farm on a week-day was not in her power; Sunday was the\nonly possible opportunity. Flintcomb-Ash being in the middle of the\ncretaceous tableland over which no railway had climbed as yet, it would\nbe necessary to walk. And the distance being fifteen miles each way she\nwould have to allow herself a long day for the undertaking by rising\nearly.\n\nA fortnight later, when the snow had gone, and had been followed by a\nhard black frost, she took advantage of the state of the roads to try\nthe experiment. At four o’clock that Sunday morning she came downstairs\nand stepped out into the starlight. The weather was still favourable,\nthe ground ringing under her feet like an anvil.\n\nMarian and Izz were much interested in her excursion, knowing that the\njourney concerned her husband. Their lodgings were in a cottage a\nlittle further along the lane, but they came and assisted Tess in her\ndeparture, and argued that she should dress up in her very prettiest\nguise to captivate the hearts of her parents-in-law; though she,\nknowing of the austere and Calvinistic tenets of old Mr Clare, was\nindifferent, and even doubtful. A year had now elapsed since her sad\nmarriage, but she had preserved sufficient draperies from the wreck of\nher then full wardrobe to clothe her very charmingly as a simple\ncountry girl with no pretensions to recent fashion; a soft gray woollen\ngown, with white crape quilling against the pink skin of her face and\nneck, and a black velvet jacket and hat.\n\n“’Tis a thousand pities your husband can’t see ’ee now—you do look a\nreal beauty!” said Izz Huett, regarding Tess as she stood on the\nthreshold between the steely starlight without and the yellow\ncandlelight within. Izz spoke with a magnanimous abandonment of herself\nto the situation; she could not be—no woman with a heart bigger than a\nhazel-nut could be—antagonistic to Tess in her presence, the influence\nwhich she exercised over those of her own sex being of a warmth and\nstrength quite unusual, curiously overpowering the less worthy feminine\nfeelings of spite and rivalry.\n\nWith a final tug and touch here, and a slight brush there, they let her\ngo; and she was absorbed into the pearly air of the fore-dawn. They\nheard her footsteps tap along the hard road as she stepped out to her\nfull pace. Even Izz hoped she would win, and, though without any\nparticular respect for her own virtue, felt glad that she had been\nprevented wronging her friend when momentarily tempted by Clare.\n\nIt was a year ago, all but a day, that Clare had married Tess, and only\na few days less than a year that he had been absent from her. Still, to\nstart on a brisk walk, and on such an errand as hers, on a dry clear\nwintry morning, through the rarefied air of these chalky hogs’-backs,\nwas not depressing; and there is no doubt that her dream at starting\nwas to win the heart of her mother-in-law, tell her whole history to\nthat lady, enlist her on her side, and so gain back the truant.\n\nIn time she reached the edge of the vast escarpment below which\nstretched the loamy Vale of Blackmoor, now lying misty and still in the\ndawn. Instead of the colourless air of the uplands, the atmosphere down\nthere was a deep blue. Instead of the great enclosures of a hundred\nacres in which she was now accustomed to toil, there were little fields\nbelow her of less than half-a-dozen acres, so numerous that they looked\nfrom this height like the meshes of a net. Here the landscape was\nwhitey-brown; down there, as in Froom Valley, it was always green. Yet\nit was in that vale that her sorrow had taken shape, and she did not\nlove it as formerly. Beauty to her, as to all who have felt, lay not in\nthe thing, but in what the thing symbolized.\n\nKeeping the Vale on her right, she steered steadily westward; passing\nabove the Hintocks, crossing at right-angles the high-road from\nSherton-Abbas to Casterbridge, and skirting Dogbury Hill and High-Stoy,\nwith the dell between them called “The Devil’s Kitchen”. Still\nfollowing the elevated way she reached Cross-in-Hand, where the stone\npillar stands desolate and silent, to mark the site of a miracle, or\nmurder, or both. Three miles further she cut across the straight and\ndeserted Roman road called Long-Ash Lane; leaving which as soon as she\nreached it she dipped down a hill by a transverse lane into the small\ntown or village of Evershead, being now about halfway over the\ndistance. She made a halt here, and breakfasted a second time, heartily\nenough—not at the Sow-and-Acorn, for she avoided inns, but at a cottage\nby the church.\n\nThe second half of her journey was through a more gentle country, by\nway of Benvill Lane. But as the mileage lessened between her and the\nspot of her pilgrimage, so did Tess’s confidence decrease, and her\nenterprise loom out more formidably. She saw her purpose in such\nstaring lines, and the landscape so faintly, that she was sometimes in\ndanger of losing her way. However, about noon she paused by a gate on\nthe edge of the basin in which Emminster and its Vicarage lay.\n\nThe square tower, beneath which she knew that at that moment the Vicar\nand his congregation were gathered, had a severe look in her eyes. She\nwished that she had somehow contrived to come on a week-day. Such a\ngood man might be prejudiced against a woman who had chosen Sunday,\nnever realizing the necessities of her case. But it was incumbent upon\nher to go on now. She took off the thick boots in which she had walked\nthus far, put on her pretty thin ones of patent leather, and, stuffing\nthe former into the hedge by the gatepost where she might readily find\nthem again, descended the hill; the freshness of colour she had derived\nfrom the keen air thinning away in spite of her as she drew near the\nparsonage.\n\nTess hoped for some accident that might favour her, but nothing\nfavoured her. The shrubs on the Vicarage lawn rustled uncomfortably in\nthe frosty breeze; she could not feel by any stretch of imagination,\ndressed to her highest as she was, that the house was the residence of\nnear relations; and yet nothing essential, in nature or emotion,\ndivided her from them: in pains, pleasures, thoughts, birth, death, and\nafter-death, they were the same.\n\nShe nerved herself by an effort, entered the swing-gate, and rang the\ndoor-bell. The thing was done; there could be no retreat. No; the thing\nwas not done. Nobody answered to her ringing. The effort had to be\nrisen to and made again. She rang a second time, and the agitation of\nthe act, coupled with her weariness after the fifteen miles’ walk, led\nher to support herself while she waited by resting her hand on her hip\nand her elbow against the wall of the porch. The wind was so nipping\nthat the ivy-leaves had become wizened and gray, each tapping\nincessantly upon its neighbour with a disquieting stir of her nerves. A\npiece of blood-stained paper, caught up from some meat-buyer’s\ndust-heap, beat up and down the road without the gate; too flimsy to\nrest, too heavy to fly away; and a few straws kept it company.\n\nThe second peal had been louder, and still nobody came. Then she walked\nout of the porch, opened the gate, and passed through. And though she\nlooked dubiously at the house-front as if inclined to return, it was\nwith a breath of relief that she closed the gate. A feeling haunted her\nthat she might have been recognized (though how she could not tell),\nand orders been given not to admit her.\n\nTess went as far as the corner. She had done all she could do; but\ndetermined not to escape present trepidation at the expense of future\ndistress, she walked back again quite past the house, looking up at all\nthe windows.\n\nAh—the explanation was that they were all at church, every one. She\nremembered her husband saying that his father always insisted upon the\nhousehold, servants included, going to morning-service, and, as a\nconsequence, eating cold food when they came home. It was, therefore,\nonly necessary to wait till the service was over. She would not make\nherself conspicuous by waiting on the spot, and she started to get past\nthe church into the lane. But as she reached the churchyard-gate the\npeople began pouring out, and Tess found herself in the midst of them.\n\nThe Emminster congregation looked at her as only a congregation of\nsmall country-townsfolk walking home at its leisure can look at a woman\nout of the common whom it perceives to be a stranger. She quickened her\npace, and ascended the road by which she had come, to find a retreat\nbetween its hedges till the Vicar’s family should have lunched, and it\nmight be convenient for them to receive her. She soon distanced the\nchurchgoers, except two youngish men, who, linked arm-in-arm, were\nbeating up behind her at a quick step.\n\nAs they drew nearer she could hear their voices engaged in earnest\ndiscourse, and, with the natural quickness of a woman in her situation,\ndid not fail to recognize in those noises the quality of her husband’s\ntones. The pedestrians were his two brothers. Forgetting all her plans,\nTess’s one dread was lest they should overtake her now, in her\ndisorganized condition, before she was prepared to confront them; for\nthough she felt that they could not identify her, she instinctively\ndreaded their scrutiny. The more briskly they walked, the more briskly\nwalked she. They were plainly bent upon taking a short quick stroll\nbefore going indoors to lunch or dinner, to restore warmth to limbs\nchilled with sitting through a long service.\n\nOnly one person had preceded Tess up the hill—a ladylike young woman,\nsomewhat interesting, though, perhaps, a trifle _guindée_ and prudish.\nTess had nearly overtaken her when the speed of her brothers-in-law\nbrought them so nearly behind her back that she could hear every word\nof their conversation. They said nothing, however, which particularly\ninterested her till, observing the young lady still further in front,\none of them remarked, “There is Mercy Chant. Let us overtake her.”\n\nTess knew the name. It was the woman who had been destined for Angel’s\nlife-companion by his and her parents, and whom he probably would have\nmarried but for her intrusive self. She would have known as much\nwithout previous information if she had waited a moment, for one of the\nbrothers proceeded to say: “Ah! poor Angel, poor Angel! I never see\nthat nice girl without more and more regretting his precipitancy in\nthrowing himself away upon a dairymaid, or whatever she may be. It is a\nqueer business, apparently. Whether she has joined him yet or not I\ndon’t know; but she had not done so some months ago when I heard from\nhim.”\n\n“I can’t say. He never tells me anything nowadays. His ill-considered\nmarriage seems to have completed that estrangement from me which was\nbegun by his extraordinary opinions.”\n\nTess beat up the long hill still faster; but she could not outwalk them\nwithout exciting notice. At last they outsped her altogether, and\npassed her by. The young lady still further ahead heard their footsteps\nand turned. Then there was a greeting and a shaking of hands, and the\nthree went on together.\n\nThey soon reached the summit of the hill, and, evidently intending this\npoint to be the limit of their promenade, slackened pace and turned all\nthree aside to the gate whereat Tess had paused an hour before that\ntime to reconnoitre the town before descending into it. During their\ndiscourse one of the clerical brothers probed the hedge carefully with\nhis umbrella, and dragged something to light.\n\n“Here’s a pair of old boots,” he said. “Thrown away, I suppose, by some\ntramp or other.”\n\n“Some imposter who wished to come into the town barefoot, perhaps, and\nso excite our sympathies,” said Miss Chant. “Yes, it must have been,\nfor they are excellent walking-boots—by no means worn out. What a\nwicked thing to do! I’ll carry them home for some poor person.”\n\nCuthbert Clare, who had been the one to find them, picked them up for\nher with the crook of his stick; and Tess’s boots were appropriated.\n\nShe, who had heard this, walked past under the screen of her woollen\nveil till, presently looking back, she perceived that the church party\nhad left the gate with her boots and retreated down the hill.\n\nThereupon our heroine resumed her walk. Tears, blinding tears, were\nrunning down her face. She knew that it was all sentiment, all baseless\nimpressibility, which had caused her to read the scene as her own\ncondemnation; nevertheless she could not get over it; she could not\ncontravene in her own defenceless person all those untoward omens. It\nwas impossible to think of returning to the Vicarage. Angel’s wife felt\nalmost as if she had been hounded up that hill like a scorned thing by\nthose—to her—superfine clerics. Innocently as the slight had been\ninflicted, it was somewhat unfortunate that she had encountered the\nsons and not the father, who, despite his narrowness, was far less\nstarched and ironed than they, and had to the full the gift of charity.\nAs she again thought of her dusty boots she almost pitied those\nhabiliments for the quizzing to which they had been subjected, and felt\nhow hopeless life was for their owner.\n\n“Ah!” she said, still sighing in pity of herself, “_they_ didn’t know\nthat I wore those over the roughest part of the road to save these\npretty ones _he_ bought for me—no—they did not know it! And they didn’t\nthink that _he_ chose the colour o’ my pretty frock—no—how could they?\nIf they had known perhaps they would not have cared, for they don’t\ncare much for him, poor thing!”\n\nThen she grieved for the beloved man whose conventional standard of\njudgement had caused her all these latter sorrows; and she went her way\nwithout knowing that the greatest misfortune of her life was this\nfeminine loss of courage at the last and critical moment through her\nestimating her father-in-law by his sons. Her present condition was\nprecisely one which would have enlisted the sympathies of old Mr and\nMrs Clare. Their hearts went out of them at a bound towards extreme\ncases, when the subtle mental troubles of the less desperate among\nmankind failed to win their interest or regard. In jumping at Publicans\nand Sinners they would forget that a word might be said for the worries\nof Scribes and Pharisees; and this defect or limitation might have\nrecommended their own daughter-in-law to them at this moment as a\nfairly choice sort of lost person for their love.\n\nThereupon she began to plod back along the road by which she had come\nnot altogether full of hope, but full of a conviction that a crisis in\nher life was approaching. No crisis, apparently, had supervened; and\nthere was nothing left for her to do but to continue upon that\nstarve-acre farm till she could again summon courage to face the\nVicarage. She did, indeed, take sufficient interest in herself to throw\nup her veil on this return journey, as if to let the world see that she\ncould at least exhibit a face such as Mercy Chant could not show. But\nit was done with a sorry shake of the head. “It is nothing—it is\nnothing!” she said. “Nobody loves it; nobody sees it. Who cares about\nthe looks of a castaway like me!”\n\nHer journey back was rather a meander than a march. It had no\nsprightliness, no purpose; only a tendency. Along the tedious length of\nBenvill Lane she began to grow tired, and she leant upon gates and\npaused by milestones.\n\nShe did not enter any house till, at the seventh or eighth mile, she\ndescended the steep long hill below which lay the village or townlet of\nEvershead, where in the morning she had breakfasted with such\ncontrasting expectations. The cottage by the church, in which she again\nsat down, was almost the first at that end of the village, and while\nthe woman fetched her some milk from the pantry, Tess, looking down the\nstreet, perceived that the place seemed quite deserted.\n\n“The people are gone to afternoon service, I suppose?” she said.\n\n“No, my dear,” said the old woman. “’Tis too soon for that; the bells\nhain’t strook out yet. They be all gone to hear the preaching in yonder\nbarn. A ranter preaches there between the services—an excellent, fiery,\nChristian man, they say. But, Lord, I don’t go to hear’n! What comes in\nthe regular way over the pulpit is hot enough for I.”\n\nTess soon went onward into the village, her footsteps echoing against\nthe houses as though it were a place of the dead. Nearing the central\npart, her echoes were intruded on by other sounds; and seeing the barn\nnot far off the road, she guessed these to be the utterances of the\npreacher.\n\nHis voice became so distinct in the still clear air that she could soon\ncatch his sentences, though she was on the closed side of the barn. The\nsermon, as might be expected, was of the extremest antinomian type; on\njustification by faith, as expounded in the theology of St Paul. This\nfixed idea of the rhapsodist was delivered with animated enthusiasm, in\na manner entirely declamatory, for he had plainly no skill as a\ndialectician. Although Tess had not heard the beginning of the address,\nshe learnt what the text had been from its constant iteration—\n\n    “O foolish Galatians, who hath bewitched you, that ye should not\n    obey the truth, before whose eyes Jesus Christ hath been evidently\n    set forth, crucified among you?”\n\nTess was all the more interested, as she stood listening behind, in\nfinding that the preacher’s doctrine was a vehement form of the view of\nAngel’s father, and her interest intensified when the speaker began to\ndetail his own spiritual experiences of how he had come by those views.\nHe had, he said, been the greatest of sinners. He had scoffed; he had\nwantonly associated with the reckless and the lewd. But a day of\nawakening had come, and, in a human sense, it had been brought about\nmainly by the influence of a certain clergyman, whom he had at first\ngrossly insulted; but whose parting words had sunk into his heart, and\nhad remained there, till by the grace of Heaven they had worked this\nchange in him, and made him what they saw him.\n\nBut more startling to Tess than the doctrine had been the voice, which,\nimpossible as it seemed, was precisely that of Alec d’Urberville. Her\nface fixed in painful suspense, she came round to the front of the\nbarn, and passed before it. The low winter sun beamed directly upon the\ngreat double-doored entrance on this side; one of the doors being open,\nso that the rays stretched far in over the threshing-floor to the\npreacher and his audience, all snugly sheltered from the northern\nbreeze. The listeners were entirely villagers, among them being the man\nwhom she had seen carrying the red paint-pot on a former memorable\noccasion. But her attention was given to the central figure, who stood\nupon some sacks of corn, facing the people and the door. The three\no’clock sun shone full upon him, and the strange enervating conviction\nthat her seducer confronted her, which had been gaining ground in Tess\never since she had heard his words distinctly, was at last established\nas a fact indeed.\n\n\nEnd of Phase the Fifth\n\n\nPhase the Sixth:\n\nThe Convert\n\n\nXLV\n\nTill this moment she had never seen or heard from d’Urberville since\nher departure from Trantridge.\n\nThe rencounter came at a heavy moment, one of all moments calculated to\npermit its impact with the least emotional shock. But such was\nunreasoning memory that, though he stood there openly and palpably a\nconverted man, who was sorrowing for his past irregularities, a fear\novercame her, paralyzing her movement so that she neither retreated nor\nadvanced.\n\nTo think of what emanated from that countenance when she saw it last,\nand to behold it now!... There was the same handsome unpleasantness of\nmien, but now he wore neatly trimmed, old-fashioned whiskers, the sable\nmoustache having disappeared; and his dress was half-clerical, a\nmodification which had changed his expression sufficiently to abstract\nthe dandyism from his features, and to hinder for a second her belief\nin his identity.\n\nTo Tess’s sense there was, just at first, a ghastly _bizarrerie_, a\ngrim incongruity, in the march of these solemn words of Scripture out\nof such a mouth. This too familiar intonation, less than four years\nearlier, had brought to her ears expressions of such divergent purpose\nthat her heart became quite sick at the irony of the contrast.\n\nIt was less a reform than a transfiguration. The former curves of\nsensuousness were now modulated to lines of devotional passion. The\nlip-shapes that had meant seductiveness were now made to express\nsupplication; the glow on the cheek that yesterday could be translated\nas riotousness was evangelized to-day into the splendour of pious\nrhetoric; animalism had become fanaticism; Paganism, Paulinism; the\nbold rolling eye that had flashed upon her form in the old time with\nsuch mastery now beamed with the rude energy of a theolatry that was\nalmost ferocious. Those black angularities which his face had used to\nput on when his wishes were thwarted now did duty in picturing the\nincorrigible backslider who would insist upon turning again to his\nwallowing in the mire.\n\nThe lineaments, as such, seemed to complain. They had been diverted\nfrom their hereditary connotation to signify impressions for which\nNature did not intend them. Strange that their very elevation was a\nmisapplication, that to raise seemed to falsify.\n\nYet could it be so? She would admit the ungenerous sentiment no longer.\nD’Urberville was not the first wicked man who had turned away from his\nwickedness to save his soul alive, and why should she deem it unnatural\nin him? It was but the usage of thought which had been jarred in her at\nhearing good new words in bad old notes. The greater the sinner, the\ngreater the saint; it was not necessary to dive far into Christian\nhistory to discover that.\n\nSuch impressions as these moved her vaguely, and without strict\ndefiniteness. As soon as the nerveless pause of her surprise would\nallow her to stir, her impulse was to pass on out of his sight. He had\nobviously not discerned her yet in her position against the sun.\n\nBut the moment that she moved again he recognized her. The effect upon\nher old lover was electric, far stronger than the effect of his\npresence upon her. His fire, the tumultuous ring of his eloquence,\nseemed to go out of him. His lip struggled and trembled under the words\nthat lay upon it; but deliver them it could not as long as she faced\nhim. His eyes, after their first glance upon her face, hung confusedly\nin every other direction but hers, but came back in a desperate leap\nevery few seconds. This paralysis lasted, however, but a short time;\nfor Tess’s energies returned with the atrophy of his, and she walked as\nfast as she was able past the barn and onward.\n\nAs soon as she could reflect, it appalled her, this change in their\nrelative platforms. He who had wrought her undoing was now on the side\nof the Spirit, while she remained unregenerate. And, as in the legend,\nit had resulted that her Cyprian image had suddenly appeared upon his\naltar, whereby the fire of the priest had been well nigh extinguished.\n\nShe went on without turning her head. Her back seemed to be endowed\nwith a sensitiveness to ocular beams—even her clothing—so alive was she\nto a fancied gaze which might be resting upon her from the outside of\nthat barn. All the way along to this point her heart had been heavy\nwith an inactive sorrow; now there was a change in the quality of its\ntrouble. That hunger for affection too long withheld was for the time\ndisplaced by an almost physical sense of an implacable past which still\nengirdled her. It intensified her consciousness of error to a practical\ndespair; the break of continuity between her earlier and present\nexistence, which she had hoped for, had not, after all, taken place.\nBygones would never be complete bygones till she was a bygone herself.\n\nThus absorbed, she recrossed the northern part of Long-Ash Lane at\nright angles, and presently saw before her the road ascending whitely\nto the upland along whose margin the remainder of her journey lay. Its\ndry pale surface stretched severely onward, unbroken by a single\nfigure, vehicle, or mark, save some occasional brown horse-droppings\nwhich dotted its cold aridity here and there. While slowly breasting\nthis ascent Tess became conscious of footsteps behind her, and turning\nshe saw approaching that well-known form—so strangely accoutred as the\nMethodist—the one personage in all the world she wished not to\nencounter alone on this side of the grave.\n\nThere was not much time, however, for thought or elusion, and she\nyielded as calmly as she could to the necessity of letting him overtake\nher. She saw that he was excited, less by the speed of his walk than by\nthe feelings within him.\n\n“Tess!” he said.\n\nShe slackened speed without looking round.\n\n“Tess!” he repeated. “It is I—Alec d’Urberville.”\n\nShe then looked back at him, and he came up.\n\n“I see it is,” she answered coldly.\n\n“Well—is that all? Yet I deserve no more! Of course,” he added, with a\nslight laugh, “there is something of the ridiculous to your eyes in\nseeing me like this. But—I must put up with that.... I heard you had\ngone away; nobody knew where. Tess, you wonder why I have followed\nyou?”\n\n“I do, rather; and I would that you had not, with all my heart!”\n\n“Yes—you may well say it,” he returned grimly, as they moved onward\ntogether, she with unwilling tread. “But don’t mistake me; I beg this\nbecause you may have been led to do so in noticing—if you did notice\nit—how your sudden appearance unnerved me down there. It was but a\nmomentary faltering; and considering what you have been to me, it was\nnatural enough. But will helped me through it—though perhaps you think\nme a humbug for saying it—and immediately afterwards I felt that of all\npersons in the world whom it was my duty and desire to save from the\nwrath to come—sneer if you like—the woman whom I had so grievously\nwronged was that person. I have come with that sole purpose in\nview—nothing more.”\n\nThere was the smallest vein of scorn in her words of rejoinder: “Have\nyou saved yourself? Charity begins at home, they say.”\n\n“_I_ have done nothing!” said he indifferently. “Heaven, as I have been\ntelling my hearers, has done all. No amount of contempt that you can\npour upon me, Tess, will equal what I have poured upon myself—the old\nAdam of my former years! Well, it is a strange story; believe it or\nnot; but I can tell you the means by which my conversion was brought\nabout, and I hope you will be interested enough at least to listen.\nHave you ever heard the name of the parson of Emminster—you must have\ndone do?—old Mr Clare; one of the most earnest of his school; one of\nthe few intense men left in the Church; not so intense as the extreme\nwing of Christian believers with which I have thrown in my lot, but\nquite an exception among the Established clergy, the younger of whom\nare gradually attenuating the true doctrines by their sophistries, till\nthey are but the shadow of what they were. I only differ from him on\nthe question of Church and State—the interpretation of the text, ‘Come\nout from among them and be ye separate, saith the Lord’—that’s all. He\nis one who, I firmly believe, has been the humble means of saving more\nsouls in this country than any other man you can name. You have heard\nof him?”\n\n“I have,” she said.\n\n“He came to Trantridge two or three years ago to preach on behalf of\nsome missionary society; and I, wretched fellow that I was, insulted\nhim when, in his disinterestedness, he tried to reason with me and show\nme the way. He did not resent my conduct, he simply said that some day\nI should receive the first-fruits of the Spirit—that those who came to\nscoff sometimes remained to pray. There was a strange magic in his\nwords. They sank into my mind. But the loss of my mother hit me most;\nand by degrees I was brought to see daylight. Since then my one desire\nhas been to hand on the true view to others, and that is what I was\ntrying to do to-day; though it is only lately that I have preached\nhereabout. The first months of my ministry have been spent in the North\nof England among strangers, where I preferred to make my earliest\nclumsy attempts, so as to acquire courage before undergoing that\nseverest of all tests of one’s sincerity, addressing those who have\nknown one, and have been one’s companions in the days of darkness. If\nyou could only know, Tess, the pleasure of having a good slap at\nyourself, I am sure—”\n\n“Don’t go on with it!” she cried passionately, as she turned away from\nhim to a stile by the wayside, on which she bent herself. “I can’t\nbelieve in such sudden things! I feel indignant with you for talking to\nme like this, when you know—when you know what harm you’ve done me!\nYou, and those like you, take your fill of pleasure on earth by making\nthe life of such as me bitter and black with sorrow; and then it is a\nfine thing, when you have had enough of that, to think of securing your\npleasure in heaven by becoming converted! Out upon such—I don’t believe\nin you—I hate it!”\n\n“Tess,” he insisted; “don’t speak so! It came to me like a jolly new\nidea! And you don’t believe me? What don’t you believe?”\n\n“Your conversion. Your scheme of religion.”\n\n“Why?”\n\nShe dropped her voice. “Because a better man than you does not believe\nin such.”\n\n“What a woman’s reason! Who is this better man?”\n\n“I cannot tell you.”\n\n“Well,” he declared, a resentment beneath his words seeming ready to\nspring out at a moment’s notice, “God forbid that I should say I am a\ngood man—and you know I don’t say any such thing. I am new to goodness,\ntruly; but newcomers see furthest sometimes.”\n\n“Yes,” she replied sadly. “But I cannot believe in your conversion to a\nnew spirit. Such flashes as you feel, Alec, I fear don’t last!”\n\nThus speaking she turned from the stile over which she had been\nleaning, and faced him; whereupon his eyes, falling casually upon the\nfamiliar countenance and form, remained contemplating her. The inferior\nman was quiet in him now; but it was surely not extracted, nor even\nentirely subdued.\n\n“Don’t look at me like that!” he said abruptly.\n\nTess, who had been quite unconscious of her action and mien, instantly\nwithdrew the large dark gaze of her eyes, stammering with a flush, “I\nbeg your pardon!” And there was revived in her the wretched sentiment\nwhich had often come to her before, that in inhabiting the fleshly\ntabernacle with which Nature had endowed her she was somehow doing\nwrong.\n\n“No, no! Don’t beg my pardon. But since you wear a veil to hide your\ngood looks, why don’t you keep it down?”\n\nShe pulled down the veil, saying hastily, “It was mostly to keep off\nthe wind.”\n\n“It may seem harsh of me to dictate like this,” he went on; “but it is\nbetter that I should not look too often on you. It might be dangerous.”\n\n“Ssh!” said Tess.\n\n“Well, women’s faces have had too much power over me already for me not\nto fear them! An evangelist has nothing to do with such as they; and it\nreminds me of the old times that I would forget!”\n\nAfter this their conversation dwindled to a casual remark now and then\nas they rambled onward, Tess inwardly wondering how far he was going\nwith her, and not liking to send him back by positive mandate.\nFrequently when they came to a gate or stile they found painted thereon\nin red or blue letters some text of Scripture, and she asked him if he\nknew who had been at the pains to blazon these announcements. He told\nher that the man was employed by himself and others who were working\nwith him in that district, to paint these reminders that no means might\nbe left untried which might move the hearts of a wicked generation.\n\nAt length the road touched the spot called “Cross-in-Hand.” Of all\nspots on the bleached and desolate upland this was the most forlorn. It\nwas so far removed from the charm which is sought in landscape by\nartists and view-lovers as to reach a new kind of beauty, a negative\nbeauty of tragic tone. The place took its name from a stone pillar\nwhich stood there, a strange rude monolith, from a stratum unknown in\nany local quarry, on which was roughly carved a human hand. Differing\naccounts were given of its history and purport. Some authorities stated\nthat a devotional cross had once formed the complete erection thereon,\nof which the present relic was but the stump; others that the stone as\nit stood was entire, and that it had been fixed there to mark a\nboundary or place of meeting. Anyhow, whatever the origin of the relic,\nthere was and is something sinister, or solemn, according to mood, in\nthe scene amid which it stands; something tending to impress the most\nphlegmatic passer-by.\n\n“I think I must leave you now,” he remarked, as they drew near to this\nspot. “I have to preach at Abbot’s-Cernel at six this evening, and my\nway lies across to the right from here. And you upset me somewhat too,\nTessy—I cannot, will not, say why. I must go away and get strength....\nHow is it that you speak so fluently now? Who has taught you such good\nEnglish?”\n\n“I have learnt things in my troubles,” she said evasively.\n\n“What troubles have you had?”\n\nShe told him of the first one—the only one that related to him.\n\nD’Urberville was struck mute. “I knew nothing of this till now!” he\nnext murmured. “Why didn’t you write to me when you felt your trouble\ncoming on?”\n\nShe did not reply; and he broke the silence by adding: “Well—you will\nsee me again.”\n\n“No,” she answered. “Do not again come near me!”\n\n“I will think. But before we part come here.” He stepped up to the\npillar. “This was once a Holy Cross. Relics are not in my creed; but I\nfear you at moments—far more than you need fear me at present; and to\nlessen my fear, put your hand upon that stone hand, and swear that you\nwill never tempt me—by your charms or ways.”\n\n“Good God—how can you ask what is so unnecessary! All that is furthest\nfrom my thought!”\n\n“Yes—but swear it.”\n\nTess, half frightened, gave way to his importunity; placed her hand\nupon the stone and swore.\n\n“I am sorry you are not a believer,” he continued; “that some\nunbeliever should have got hold of you and unsettled your mind. But no\nmore now. At home at least I can pray for you; and I will; and who\nknows what may not happen? I’m off. Goodbye!”\n\nHe turned to a hunting-gate in the hedge and, without letting his eyes\nagain rest upon her, leapt over and struck out across the down in the\ndirection of Abbot’s-Cernel. As he walked his pace showed perturbation,\nand by-and-by, as if instigated by a former thought, he drew from his\npocket a small book, between the leaves of which was folded a letter,\nworn and soiled, as from much re-reading. D’Urberville opened the\nletter. It was dated several months before this time, and was signed by\nParson Clare.\n\nThe letter began by expressing the writer’s unfeigned joy at\nd’Urberville’s conversion, and thanked him for his kindness in\ncommunicating with the parson on the subject. It expressed Mr Clare’s\nwarm assurance of forgiveness for d’Urberville’s former conduct and his\ninterest in the young man’s plans for the future. He, Mr Clare, would\nmuch have liked to see d’Urberville in the Church to whose ministry he\nhad devoted so many years of his own life, and would have helped him to\nenter a theological college to that end; but since his correspondent\nhad possibly not cared to do this on account of the delay it would have\nentailed, he was not the man to insist upon its paramount importance.\nEvery man must work as he could best work, and in the method towards\nwhich he felt impelled by the Spirit.\n\nD’Urberville read and re-read this letter, and seemed to quiz himself\ncynically. He also read some passages from memoranda as he walked till\nhis face assumed a calm, and apparently the image of Tess no longer\ntroubled his mind.\n\nShe meanwhile had kept along the edge of the hill by which lay her\nnearest way home. Within the distance of a mile she met a solitary\nshepherd.\n\n“What is the meaning of that old stone I have passed?” she asked of\nhim. “Was it ever a Holy Cross?”\n\n“Cross—no; ’twer not a cross! ’Tis a thing of ill-omen, Miss. It was\nput up in wuld times by the relations of a malefactor who was tortured\nthere by nailing his hand to a post and afterwards hung. The bones lie\nunderneath. They say he sold his soul to the devil, and that he walks\nat times.”\n\nShe felt the _petite mort_ at this unexpectedly gruesome information,\nand left the solitary man behind her. It was dusk when she drew near to\nFlintcomb-Ash, and in the lane at the entrance to the hamlet she\napproached a girl and her lover without their observing her. They were\ntalking no secrets, and the clear unconcerned voice of the young woman,\nin response to the warmer accents of the man, spread into the chilly\nair as the one soothing thing within the dusky horizon, full of a\nstagnant obscurity upon which nothing else intruded. For a moment the\nvoices cheered the heart of Tess, till she reasoned that this interview\nhad its origin, on one side or the other, in the same attraction which\nhad been the prelude to her own tribulation. When she came close, the\ngirl turned serenely and recognized her, the young man walking off in\nembarrassment. The woman was Izz Huett, whose interest in Tess’s\nexcursion immediately superseded her own proceedings. Tess did not\nexplain very clearly its results, and Izz, who was a girl of tact,\nbegan to speak of her own little affair, a phase of which Tess had just\nwitnessed.\n\n“He is Amby Seedling, the chap who used to sometimes come and help at\nTalbothays,” she explained indifferently. “He actually inquired and\nfound out that I had come here, and has followed me. He says he’s been\nin love wi’ me these two years. But I’ve hardly answered him.”\n\n\nXLVI\n\nSeveral days had passed since her futile journey, and Tess was afield.\nThe dry winter wind still blew, but a screen of thatched hurdles\nerected in the eye of the blast kept its force away from her. On the\nsheltered side was a turnip-slicing machine, whose bright blue hue of\nnew paint seemed almost vocal in the otherwise subdued scene. Opposite\nits front was a long mound or “grave”, in which the roots had been\npreserved since early winter. Tess was standing at the uncovered end,\nchopping off with a bill-hook the fibres and earth from each root, and\nthrowing it after the operation into the slicer. A man was turning the\nhandle of the machine, and from its trough came the newly-cut swedes,\nthe fresh smell of whose yellow chips was accompanied by the sounds of\nthe snuffling wind, the smart swish of the slicing-blades, and the\nchoppings of the hook in Tess’s leather-gloved hand.\n\nThe wide acreage of blank agricultural brownness, apparent where the\nswedes had been pulled, was beginning to be striped in wales of darker\nbrown, gradually broadening to ribands. Along the edge of each of these\nsomething crept upon ten legs, moving without haste and without rest up\nand down the whole length of the field; it was two horses and a man,\nthe plough going between them, turning up the cleared ground for a\nspring sowing.\n\nFor hours nothing relieved the joyless monotony of things. Then, far\nbeyond the ploughing-teams, a black speck was seen. It had come from\nthe corner of a fence, where there was a gap, and its tendency was up\nthe incline, towards the swede-cutters. From the proportions of a mere\npoint it advanced to the shape of a ninepin, and was soon perceived to\nbe a man in black, arriving from the direction of Flintcomb-Ash. The\nman at the slicer, having nothing else to do with his eyes, continually\nobserved the comer, but Tess, who was occupied, did not perceive him\ntill her companion directed her attention to his approach.\n\nIt was not her hard taskmaster, Farmer Groby; it was one in a\nsemi-clerical costume, who now represented what had once been the\nfree-and-easy Alec d’Urberville. Not being hot at his preaching there\nwas less enthusiasm about him now, and the presence of the grinder\nseemed to embarrass him. A pale distress was already on Tess’s face,\nand she pulled her curtained hood further over it.\n\nD’Urberville came up and said quietly—\n\n“I want to speak to you, Tess.”\n\n“You have refused my last request, not to come near me!” said she.\n\n“Yes, but I have a good reason.”\n\n“Well, tell it.”\n\n“It is more serious than you may think.”\n\nHe glanced round to see if he were overheard. They were at some\ndistance from the man who turned the slicer, and the movement of the\nmachine, too, sufficiently prevented Alec’s words reaching other ears.\nD’Urberville placed himself so as to screen Tess from the labourer,\nturning his back to the latter.\n\n“It is this,” he continued, with capricious compunction. “In thinking\nof your soul and mine when we last met, I neglected to inquire as to\nyour worldly condition. You were well dressed, and I did not think of\nit. But I see now that it is hard—harder than it used to be when I—knew\nyou—harder than you deserve. Perhaps a good deal of it is owning to\nme!”\n\nShe did not answer, and he watched her inquiringly, as, with bent head,\nher face completely screened by the hood, she resumed her trimming of\nthe swedes. By going on with her work she felt better able to keep him\noutside her emotions.\n\n“Tess,” he added, with a sigh of discontent,—“yours was the very worst\ncase I ever was concerned in! I had no idea of what had resulted till\nyou told me. Scamp that I was to foul that innocent life! The whole\nblame was mine—the whole unconventional business of our time at\nTrantridge. You, too, the real blood of which I am but the base\nimitation, what a blind young thing you were as to possibilities! I say\nin all earnestness that it is a shame for parents to bring up their\ngirls in such dangerous ignorance of the gins and nets that the wicked\nmay set for them, whether their motive be a good one or the result of\nsimple indifference.”\n\nTess still did no more than listen, throwing down one globular root and\ntaking up another with automatic regularity, the pensive contour of the\nmere fieldwoman alone marking her.\n\n“But it is not that I came to say,” d’Urberville went on. “My\ncircumstances are these. I have lost my mother since you were at\nTrantridge, and the place is my own. But I intend to sell it, and\ndevote myself to missionary work in Africa. A devil of a poor hand I\nshall make at the trade, no doubt. However, what I want to ask you is,\nwill you put it in my power to do my duty—to make the only reparation I\ncan make for the trick played you: that is, will you be my wife, and go\nwith me?... I have already obtained this precious document. It was my\nold mother’s dying wish.”\n\nHe drew a piece of parchment from his pocket, with a slight fumbling of\nembarrassment.\n\n“What is it?” said she.\n\n“A marriage licence.”\n\n“O no, sir—no!” she said quickly, starting back.\n\n“You will not? Why is that?”\n\nAnd as he asked the question a disappointment which was not entirely\nthe disappointment of thwarted duty crossed d’Urberville’s face. It was\nunmistakably a symptom that something of his old passion for her had\nbeen revived; duty and desire ran hand-in-hand.\n\n“Surely,” he began again, in more impetuous tones, and then looked\nround at the labourer who turned the slicer.\n\nTess, too, felt that the argument could not be ended there. Informing\nthe man that a gentleman had come to see her, with whom she wished to\nwalk a little way, she moved off with d’Urberville across the\nzebra-striped field. When they reached the first newly-ploughed section\nhe held out his hand to help her over it; but she stepped forward on\nthe summits of the earth-rolls as if she did not see him.\n\n“You will not marry me, Tess, and make me a self-respecting man?” he\nrepeated, as soon as they were over the furrows.\n\n“I cannot.”\n\n“But why?”\n\n“You know I have no affection for you.”\n\n“But you would get to feel that in time, perhaps—as soon as you really\ncould forgive me?”\n\n“Never!”\n\n“Why so positive?”\n\n“I love somebody else.”\n\nThe words seemed to astonish him.\n\n“You do?” he cried. “Somebody else? But has not a sense of what is\nmorally right and proper any weight with you?”\n\n“No, no, no—don’t say that!”\n\n“Anyhow, then, your love for this other man may be only a passing\nfeeling which you will overcome—”\n\n“No—no.”\n\n“Yes, yes! Why not?”\n\n“I cannot tell you.”\n\n“You must in honour!”\n\n“Well then.... I have married him.”\n\n“Ah!” he exclaimed; and he stopped dead and gazed at her.\n\n“I did not wish to tell—I did not mean to!” she pleaded. “It is a\nsecret here, or at any rate but dimly known. So will you, _please_ will\nyou, keep from questioning me? You must remember that we are now\nstrangers.”\n\n“Strangers—are we? Strangers!”\n\nFor a moment a flash of his old irony marked his face; but he\ndeterminedly chastened it down.\n\n“Is that man your husband?” he asked mechanically, denoting by a sign\nthe labourer who turned the machine.\n\n“That man!” she said proudly. “I should think not!”\n\n“Who, then?”\n\n“Do not ask what I do not wish to tell!” she begged, and flashed her\nappeal to him from her upturned face and lash-shadowed eyes.\n\nD’Urberville was disturbed.\n\n“But I only asked for your sake!” he retorted hotly. “Angels of\nheaven!—God forgive me for such an expression—I came here, I swear, as\nI thought for your good. Tess—don’t look at me so—I cannot stand your\nlooks! There never were such eyes, surely, before Christianity or\nsince! There—I won’t lose my head; I dare not. I own that the sight of\nyou had waked up my love for you, which, I believed, was extinguished\nwith all such feelings. But I thought that our marriage might be a\nsanctification for us both. ‘The unbelieving husband is sanctified by\nthe wife, and the unbelieving wife is sanctified by the husband,’ I\nsaid to myself. But my plan is dashed from me; and I must bear the\ndisappointment!”\n\nHe moodily reflected with his eyes on the ground.\n\n“Married. Married!... Well, that being so,” he added, quite calmly,\ntearing the licence slowly into halves and putting them in his pocket;\n“that being prevented, I should like to do some good to you and your\nhusband, whoever he may be. There are many questions that I am tempted\nto ask, but I will not do so, of course, in opposition to your wishes.\nThough, if I could know your husband, I might more easily benefit him\nand you. Is he on this farm?”\n\n“No,” she murmured. “He is far away.”\n\n“Far away? From _you_? What sort of husband can he be?”\n\n“O, do not speak against him! It was through you! He found out—”\n\n“Ah, is it so!... That’s sad, Tess!”\n\n“Yes.”\n\n“But to stay away from you—to leave you to work like this!”\n\n“He does not leave me to work!” she cried, springing to the defence of\nthe absent one with all her fervour. “He don’t know it! It is by my own\narrangement.”\n\n“Then, does he write?”\n\n“I—I cannot tell you. There are things which are private to ourselves.”\n\n“Of course that means that he does not. You are a deserted wife, my\nfair Tess—”\n\nIn an impulse he turned suddenly to take her hand; the buff-glove was\non it, and he seized only the rough leather fingers which did not\nexpress the life or shape of those within.\n\n“You must not—you must not!” she cried fearfully, slipping her hand\nfrom the glove as from a pocket, and leaving it in his grasp. “O, will\nyou go away—for the sake of me and my husband—go, in the name of your\nown Christianity!”\n\n“Yes, yes; I will,” he said abruptly, and thrusting the glove back to\nher he turned to leave. Facing round, however, he said, “Tess, as God\nis my judge, I meant no humbug in taking your hand!”\n\nA pattering of hoofs on the soil of the field, which they had not\nnoticed in their preoccupation, ceased close behind them; and a voice\nreached her ear:\n\n“What the devil are you doing away from your work at this time o’ day?”\n\nFarmer Groby had espied the two figures from the distance, and had\ninquisitively ridden across, to learn what was their business in his\nfield.\n\n“Don’t speak like that to her!” said d’Urberville, his face blackening\nwith something that was not Christianity.\n\n“Indeed, Mister! And what mid Methodist pa’sons have to do with she?”\n\n“Who is the fellow?” asked d’Urberville, turning to Tess.\n\nShe went close up to him.\n\n“Go—I do beg you!” she said.\n\n“What! And leave you to that tyrant? I can see in his face what a churl\nhe is.”\n\n“He won’t hurt me. _He’s_ not in love with me. I can leave at\nLady-Day.”\n\n“Well, I have no right but to obey, I suppose. But—well, goodbye!”\n\nHer defender, whom she dreaded more than her assailant, having\nreluctantly disappeared, the farmer continued his reprimand, which Tess\ntook with the greatest coolness, that sort of attack being independent\nof sex. To have as a master this man of stone, who would have cuffed\nher if he had dared, was almost a relief after her former experiences.\nShe silently walked back towards the summit of the field that was the\nscene of her labour, so absorbed in the interview which had just taken\nplace that she was hardly aware that the nose of Groby’s horse almost\ntouched her shoulders.\n\n“If so be you make an agreement to work for me till Lady-Day, I’ll see\nthat you carry it out,” he growled. “’Od rot the women—now ’tis one\nthing, and then ’tis another. But I’ll put up with it no longer!”\n\nKnowing very well that he did not harass the other women of the farm as\nhe harassed her out of spite for the flooring he had once received, she\ndid for one moment picture what might have been the result if she had\nbeen free to accept the offer just made her of being the monied Alec’s\nwife. It would have lifted her completely out of subjection, not only\nto her present oppressive employer, but to a whole world who seemed to\ndespise her. “But no, no!” she said breathlessly; “I could not have\nmarried him now! He is so unpleasant to me.”\n\nThat very night she began an appealing letter to Clare, concealing from\nhim her hardships, and assuring him of her undying affection. Any one\nwho had been in a position to read between the lines would have seen\nthat at the back of her great love was some monstrous fear—almost a\ndesperation—as to some secret contingencies which were not disclosed.\nBut again she did not finish her effusion; he had asked Izz to go with\nhim, and perhaps he did not care for her at all. She put the letter in\nher box, and wondered if it would ever reach Angel’s hands.\n\nAfter this her daily tasks were gone through heavily enough, and\nbrought on the day which was of great import to agriculturists—the day\nof the Candlemas Fair. It was at this fair that new engagements were\nentered into for the twelve months following the ensuing Lady-Day, and\nthose of the farming population who thought of changing their places\nduly attended at the county-town where the fair was held. Nearly all\nthe labourers on Flintcomb-Ash farm intended flight, and early in the\nmorning there was a general exodus in the direction of the town, which\nlay at a distance of from ten to a dozen miles over hilly country.\nThough Tess also meant to leave at the quarter-day, she was one of the\nfew who did not go to the fair, having a vaguely-shaped hope that\nsomething would happen to render another outdoor engagement\nunnecessary.\n\nIt was a peaceful February day, of wonderful softness for the time, and\none would almost have thought that winter was over. She had hardly\nfinished her dinner when d’Urberville’s figure darkened the window of\nthe cottage wherein she was a lodger, which she had all to herself\nto-day.\n\nTess jumped up, but her visitor had knocked at the door, and she could\nhardly in reason run away. D’Urberville’s knock, his walk up to the\ndoor, had some indescribable quality of difference from his air when\nshe last saw him. They seemed to be acts of which the doer was ashamed.\nShe thought that she would not open the door; but, as there was no\nsense in that either, she arose, and having lifted the latch stepped\nback quickly. He came in, saw her, and flung himself down into a chair\nbefore speaking.\n\n“Tess—I couldn’t help it!” he began desperately, as he wiped his heated\nface, which had also a superimposed flush of excitement. “I felt that I\nmust call at least to ask how you are. I assure you I had not been\nthinking of you at all till I saw you that Sunday; now I cannot get rid\nof your image, try how I may! It is hard that a good woman should do\nharm to a bad man; yet so it is. If you would only pray for me, Tess!”\n\nThe suppressed discontent of his manner was almost pitiable, and yet\nTess did not pity him.\n\n“How can I pray for you,” she said, “when I am forbidden to believe\nthat the great Power who moves the world would alter His plans on my\naccount?”\n\n“You really think that?”\n\n“Yes. I have been cured of the presumption of thinking otherwise.”\n\n“Cured? By whom?”\n\n“By my husband, if I must tell.”\n\n“Ah—your husband—your husband! How strange it seems! I remember you\nhinted something of the sort the other day. What do you really believe\nin these matters, Tess?” he asked. “You seem to have no\nreligion—perhaps owing to me.”\n\n“But I have. Though I don’t believe in anything supernatural.”\n\nD’Urberville looked at her with misgiving.\n\n“Then do you think that the line I take is all wrong?”\n\n“A good deal of it.”\n\n“H’m—and yet I’ve felt so sure about it,” he said uneasily.\n\n“I believe in the _spirit_ of the Sermon on the Mount, and so did my\ndear husband.... But I don’t believe—”\n\nHere she gave her negations.\n\n“The fact is,” said d’Urberville drily, “whatever your dear husband\nbelieved you accept, and whatever he rejected you reject, without the\nleast inquiry or reasoning on your own part. That’s just like you\nwomen. Your mind is enslaved to his.”\n\n“Ah, because he knew everything!” said she, with a triumphant\nsimplicity of faith in Angel Clare that the most perfect man could\nhardly have deserved, much less her husband.\n\n“Yes, but you should not take negative opinions wholesale from another\nperson like that. A pretty fellow he must be to teach you such\nscepticism!”\n\n“He never forced my judgement! He would never argue on the subject with\nme! But I looked at it in this way; what he believed, after inquiring\ndeep into doctrines, was much more likely to be right than what I might\nbelieve, who hadn’t looked into doctrines at all.”\n\n“What used he to say? He must have said something?”\n\nShe reflected; and with her acute memory for the letter of Angel\nClare’s remarks, even when she did not comprehend their spirit, she\nrecalled a merciless polemical syllogism that she had heard him use\nwhen, as it occasionally happened, he indulged in a species of thinking\naloud with her at his side. In delivering it she gave also Clare’s\naccent and manner with reverential faithfulness.\n\n“Say that again,” asked d’Urberville, who had listened with the\ngreatest attention.\n\nShe repeated the argument, and d’Urberville thoughtfully murmured the\nwords after her.\n\n“Anything else?” he presently asked.\n\n“He said at another time something like this”; and she gave another,\nwhich might possibly have been paralleled in many a work of the\npedigree ranging from the _Dictionnaire Philosophique_ to Huxley’s\n_Essays_.\n\n“Ah—ha! How do you remember them?”\n\n“I wanted to believe what he believed, though he didn’t wish me to; and\nI managed to coax him to tell me a few of his thoughts. I can’t say I\nquite understand that one; but I know it is right.”\n\n“H’m. Fancy your being able to teach me what you don’t know yourself!”\n\nHe fell into thought.\n\n“And so I threw in my spiritual lot with his,” she resumed. “I didn’t\nwish it to be different. What’s good enough for him is good enough for\nme.”\n\n“Does he know that you are as big an infidel as he?”\n\n“No—I never told him—if I am an infidel.”\n\n“Well—you are better off to-day that I am, Tess, after all! You don’t\nbelieve that you ought to preach my doctrine, and, therefore, do no\ndespite to your conscience in abstaining. I do believe I ought to\npreach it, but, like the devils, I believe and tremble, for I suddenly\nleave off preaching it, and give way to my passion for you.”\n\n“How?”\n\n“Why,” he said aridly; “I have come all the way here to see you to-day!\nBut I started from home to go to Casterbridge Fair, where I have\nundertaken to preach the Word from a waggon at half-past two this\nafternoon, and where all the brethren are expecting me this minute.\nHere’s the announcement.”\n\nHe drew from his breast-pocket a poster whereon was printed the day,\nhour, and place of meeting, at which he, d’Urberville, would preach the\nGospel as aforesaid.\n\n“But how can you get there?” said Tess, looking at the clock.\n\n“I cannot get there! I have come here.”\n\n“What, you have really arranged to preach, and—”\n\n“I have arranged to preach, and I shall not be there—by reason of my\nburning desire to see a woman whom I once despised!—No, by my word and\ntruth, I never despised you; if I had I should not love you now! Why I\ndid not despise you was on account of your being unsmirched in spite of\nall; you withdrew yourself from me so quickly and resolutely when you\nsaw the situation; you did not remain at my pleasure; so there was one\npetticoat in the world for whom I had no contempt, and you are she. But\nyou may well despise me now! I thought I worshipped on the mountains,\nbut I find I still serve in the groves! Ha! ha!”\n\n“O Alec d’Urberville! what does this mean? What have I done!”\n\n“Done?” he said, with a soulless sneer in the word. “Nothing\nintentionally. But you have been the means—the innocent means—of my\nbacksliding, as they call it. I ask myself, am I, indeed, one of those\n‘servants of corruption’ who, ‘after they have escaped the pollutions\nof the world, are again entangled therein and overcome’—whose latter\nend is worse than their beginning?” He laid his hand on her shoulder.\n“Tess, my girl, I was on the way to, at least, social salvation till I\nsaw you again!” he said freakishly shaking her, as if she were a child.\n“And why then have you tempted me? I was firm as a man could be till I\nsaw those eyes and that mouth again—surely there never was such a\nmaddening mouth since Eve’s!” His voice sank, and a hot archness shot\nfrom his own black eyes. “You temptress, Tess; you dear damned witch of\nBabylon—I could not resist you as soon as I met you again!”\n\n“I couldn’t help your seeing me again!” said Tess, recoiling.\n\n“I know it—I repeat that I do not blame you. But the fact remains. When\nI saw you ill-used on the farm that day I was nearly mad to think that\nI had no legal right to protect you—that I could not have it; whilst he\nwho has it seems to neglect you utterly!”\n\n“Don’t speak against him—he is absent!” she cried in much excitement.\n“Treat him honourably—he has never wronged you! O leave his wife before\nany scandal spreads that may do harm to his honest name!”\n\n“I will—I will,” he said, like a man awakening from a luring dream. “I\nhave broken my engagement to preach to those poor drunken boobies at\nthe fair—it is the first time I have played such a practical joke. A\nmonth ago I should have been horrified at such a possibility. I’ll go\naway—to swear—and—ah, can I! to keep away.” Then, suddenly: “One clasp,\nTessy—one! Only for old friendship—”\n\n“I am without defence. Alec! A good man’s honour is in my\nkeeping—think—be ashamed!”\n\n“Pooh! Well, yes—yes!”\n\nHe clenched his lips, mortified with himself for his weakness. His eyes\nwere equally barren of worldly and religious faith. The corpses of\nthose old fitful passions which had lain inanimate amid the lines of\nhis face ever since his reformation seemed to wake and come together as\nin a resurrection. He went out indeterminately.\n\nThough d’Urberville had declared that this breach of his engagement\nto-day was the simple backsliding of a believer, Tess’s words, as\nechoed from Angel Clare, had made a deep impression upon him, and\ncontinued to do so after he had left her. He moved on in silence, as if\nhis energies were benumbed by the hitherto undreamt-of possibility that\nhis position was untenable. Reason had had nothing to do with his\nwhimsical conversion, which was perhaps the mere freak of a careless\nman in search of a new sensation, and temporarily impressed by his\nmother’s death.\n\nThe drops of logic Tess had let fall into the sea of his enthusiasm\nserved to chill its effervescence to stagnation. He said to himself, as\nhe pondered again and again over the crystallized phrases that she had\nhanded on to him, “That clever fellow little thought that, by telling\nher those things, he might be paving my way back to her!”\n\n\nXLVII\n\nIt is the threshing of the last wheat-rick at Flintcomb-Ash farm. The\ndawn of the March morning is singularly inexpressive, and there is\nnothing to show where the eastern horizon lies. Against the twilight\nrises the trapezoidal top of the stack, which has stood forlornly here\nthrough the washing and bleaching of the wintry weather.\n\nWhen Izz Huett and Tess arrived at the scene of operations only a\nrustling denoted that others had preceded them; to which, as the light\nincreased, there were presently added the silhouettes of two men on the\nsummit. They were busily “unhaling” the rick, that is, stripping off\nthe thatch before beginning to throw down the sheaves; and while this\nwas in progress Izz and Tess, with the other women-workers, in their\nwhitey-brown pinners, stood waiting and shivering, Farmer Groby having\ninsisted upon their being on the spot thus early to get the job over if\npossible by the end of the day. Close under the eaves of the stack, and\nas yet barely visible, was the red tyrant that the women had come to\nserve—a timber-framed construction, with straps and wheels\nappertaining—the threshing-machine which, whilst it was going, kept up\na despotic demand upon the endurance of their muscles and nerves.\n\nA little way off there was another indistinct figure; this one black,\nwith a sustained hiss that spoke of strength very much in reserve. The\nlong chimney running up beside an ash-tree, and the warmth which\nradiated from the spot, explained without the necessity of much\ndaylight that here was the engine which was to act as the _primum\nmobile_ of this little world. By the engine stood a dark, motionless\nbeing, a sooty and grimy embodiment of tallness, in a sort of trance,\nwith a heap of coals by his side: it was the engine-man. The isolation\nof his manner and colour lent him the appearance of a creature from\nTophet, who had strayed into the pellucid smokelessness of this region\nof yellow grain and pale soil, with which he had nothing in common, to\namaze and to discompose its aborigines.\n\nWhat he looked he felt. He was in the agricultural world, but not of\nit. He served fire and smoke; these denizens of the fields served\nvegetation, weather, frost, and sun. He travelled with his engine from\nfarm to farm, from county to county, for as yet the steam\nthreshing-machine was itinerant in this part of Wessex. He spoke in a\nstrange northern accent; his thoughts being turned inwards upon\nhimself, his eye on his iron charge, hardly perceiving the scenes\naround him, and caring for them not at all: holding only strictly\nnecessary intercourse with the natives, as if some ancient doom\ncompelled him to wander here against his will in the service of his\nPlutonic master. The long strap which ran from the driving-wheel of his\nengine to the red thresher under the rick was the sole tie-line between\nagriculture and him.\n\nWhile they uncovered the sheaves he stood apathetic beside his portable\nrepository of force, round whose hot blackness the morning air\nquivered. He had nothing to do with preparatory labour. His fire was\nwaiting incandescent, his steam was at high pressure, in a few seconds\nhe could make the long strap move at an invisible velocity. Beyond its\nextent the environment might be corn, straw, or chaos; it was all the\nsame to him. If any of the autochthonous idlers asked him what he\ncalled himself, he replied shortly, “an engineer.”\n\nThe rick was unhaled by full daylight; the men then took their places,\nthe women mounted, and the work began. Farmer Groby—or, as they called\nhim, “he”—had arrived ere this, and by his orders Tess was placed on\nthe platform of the machine, close to the man who fed it, her business\nbeing to untie every sheaf of corn handed on to her by Izz Huett, who\nstood next, but on the rick; so that the feeder could seize it and\nspread it over the revolving drum, which whisked out every grain in one\nmoment.\n\nThey were soon in full progress, after a preparatory hitch or two,\nwhich rejoiced the hearts of those who hated machinery. The work sped\non till breakfast time, when the thresher was stopped for half an hour;\nand on starting again after the meal the whole supplementary strength\nof the farm was thrown into the labour of constructing the straw-rick,\nwhich began to grow beside the stack of corn. A hasty lunch was eaten\nas they stood, without leaving their positions, and then another couple\nof hours brought them near to dinner-time; the inexorable wheel\ncontinuing to spin, and the penetrating hum of the thresher to thrill\nto the very marrow all who were near the revolving wire-cage.\n\nThe old men on the rising straw-rick talked of the past days when they\nhad been accustomed to thresh with flails on the oaken barn-floor; when\neverything, even to winnowing, was effected by hand-labour, which, to\ntheir thinking, though slow, produced better results. Those, too, on\nthe corn-rick talked a little; but the perspiring ones at the machine,\nincluding Tess, could not lighten their duties by the exchange of many\nwords. It was the ceaselessness of the work which tried her so\nseverely, and began to make her wish that she had never some to\nFlintcomb-Ash. The women on the corn-rick—Marian, who was one of them,\nin particular—could stop to drink ale or cold tea from the flagon now\nand then, or to exchange a few gossiping remarks while they wiped their\nfaces or cleared the fragments of straw and husk from their clothing;\nbut for Tess there was no respite; for, as the drum never stopped, the\nman who fed it could not stop, and she, who had to supply the man with\nuntied sheaves, could not stop either, unless Marian changed places\nwith her, which she sometimes did for half an hour in spite of Groby’s\nobjections that she was too slow-handed for a feeder.\n\nFor some probably economical reason it was usually a woman who was\nchosen for this particular duty, and Groby gave as his motive in\nselecting Tess that she was one of those who best combined strength\nwith quickness in untying, and both with staying power, and this may\nhave been true. The hum of the thresher, which prevented speech,\nincreased to a raving whenever the supply of corn fell short of the\nregular quantity. As Tess and the man who fed could never turn their\nheads she did not know that just before the dinner-hour a person had\ncome silently into the field by the gate, and had been standing under a\nsecond rick watching the scene and Tess in particular. He was dressed\nin a tweed suit of fashionable pattern, and he twirled a gay\nwalking-cane.\n\n“Who is that?” said Izz Huett to Marian. She had at first addressed the\ninquiry to Tess, but the latter could not hear it.\n\n“Somebody’s fancy-man, I s’pose,” said Marian laconically.\n\n“I’ll lay a guinea he’s after Tess.”\n\n“O no. ’Tis a ranter pa’son who’s been sniffing after her lately; not a\ndandy like this.”\n\n“Well—this is the same man.”\n\n“The same man as the preacher? But he’s quite different!”\n\n“He hev left off his black coat and white neckercher, and hev cut off\nhis whiskers; but he’s the same man for all that.”\n\n“D’ye really think so? Then I’ll tell her,” said Marian.\n\n“Don’t. She’ll see him soon enough, good-now.”\n\n“Well, I don’t think it at all right for him to join his preaching to\ncourting a married woman, even though her husband mid be abroad, and\nshe, in a sense, a widow.”\n\n“Oh—he can do her no harm,” said Izz drily. “Her mind can no more be\nheaved from that one place where it do bide than a stooded waggon from\nthe hole he’s in. Lord love ’ee, neither court-paying, nor preaching,\nnor the seven thunders themselves, can wean a woman when ’twould be\nbetter for her that she should be weaned.”\n\nDinner-time came, and the whirling ceased; whereupon Tess left her\npost, her knees trembling so wretchedly with the shaking of the machine\nthat she could scarcely walk.\n\n“You ought to het a quart o’ drink into ’ee, as I’ve done,” said\nMarian. “You wouldn’t look so white then. Why, souls above us, your\nface is as if you’d been hagrode!”\n\nIt occurred to the good-natured Marian that, as Tess was so tired, her\ndiscovery of her visitor’s presence might have the bad effect of taking\naway her appetite; and Marian was thinking of inducing Tess to descend\nby a ladder on the further side of the stack when the gentleman came\nforward and looked up.\n\nTess uttered a short little “Oh!” And a moment after she said, quickly,\n“I shall eat my dinner here—right on the rick.”\n\nSometimes, when they were so far from their cottages, they all did\nthis; but as there was rather a keen wind going to-day, Marian and the\nrest descended, and sat under the straw-stack.\n\nThe newcomer was, indeed, Alec d’Urberville, the late Evangelist,\ndespite his changed attire and aspect. It was obvious at a glance that\nthe original _Weltlust_ had come back; that he had restored himself, as\nnearly as a man could do who had grown three or four years older, to\nthe old jaunty, slapdash guise under which Tess had first known her\nadmirer, and cousin so-called. Having decided to remain where she was,\nTess sat down among the bundles, out of sight of the ground, and began\nher meal; till, by-and-by, she heard footsteps on the ladder, and\nimmediately after Alec appeared upon the stack—now an oblong and level\nplatform of sheaves. He strode across them, and sat down opposite of\nher without a word.\n\nTess continued to eat her modest dinner, a slice of thick pancake which\nshe had brought with her. The other workfolk were by this time all\ngathered under the rick, where the loose straw formed a comfortable\nretreat.\n\n“I am here again, as you see,” said d’Urberville.\n\n“Why do you trouble me so!” she cried, reproach flashing from her very\nfinger-ends.\n\n“_I_ trouble _you_? I think I may ask, why do you trouble me?”\n\n“Sure, I don’t trouble you any-when!”\n\n“You say you don’t? But you do! You haunt me. Those very eyes that you\nturned upon me with such a bitter flash a moment ago, they come to me\njust as you showed them then, in the night and in the day! Tess, ever\nsince you told me of that child of ours, it is just as if my feelings,\nwhich have been flowing in a strong puritanical stream, had suddenly\nfound a way open in the direction of you, and had all at once gushed\nthrough. The religious channel is left dry forthwith; and it is you who\nhave done it!”\n\nShe gazed in silence.\n\n“What—you have given up your preaching entirely?” she asked. She had\ngathered from Angel sufficient of the incredulity of modern thought to\ndespise flash enthusiasm; but, as a woman, she was somewhat appalled.\n\nIn affected severity d’Urberville continued—\n\n“Entirely. I have broken every engagement since that afternoon I was to\naddress the drunkards at Casterbridge Fair. The deuce only knows what I\nam thought of by the brethren. Ah-ha! The brethren! No doubt they pray\nfor me—weep for me; for they are kind people in their way. But what do\nI care? How could I go on with the thing when I had lost my faith in\nit?—it would have been hypocrisy of the basest kind! Among them I\nshould have stood like Hymenaeus and Alexander, who were delivered over\nto Satan that they might learn not to blaspheme. What a grand revenge\nyou have taken! I saw you innocent, and I deceived you. Four years\nafter, you find me a Christian enthusiast; you then work upon me,\nperhaps to my complete perdition! But Tess, my coz, as I used to call\nyou, this is only my way of talking, and you must not look so horribly\nconcerned. Of course you have done nothing except retain your pretty\nface and shapely figure. I saw it on the rick before you saw me—that\ntight pinafore-thing sets it off, and that wing-bonnet—you field-girls\nshould never wear those bonnets if you wish to keep out of danger.” He\nregarded her silently for a few moments, and with a short cynical laugh\nresumed: “I believe that if the bachelor-apostle, whose deputy I\nthought I was, had been tempted by such a pretty face, he would have\nlet go the plough for her sake as I do!”\n\nTess attempted to expostulate, but at this juncture all her fluency\nfailed her, and without heeding he added:\n\n“Well, this paradise that you supply is perhaps as good as any other,\nafter all. But to speak seriously, Tess.” D’Urberville rose and came\nnearer, reclining sideways amid the sheaves, and resting upon his\nelbow. “Since I last saw you, I have been thinking of what you said\nthat _he_ said. I have come to the conclusion that there does seem\nrather a want of common-sense in these threadbare old propositions; how\nI could have been so fired by poor Parson Clare’s enthusiasm, and have\ngone so madly to work, transcending even him, I cannot make out! As for\nwhat you said last time, on the strength of your wonderful husband’s\nintelligence—whose name you have never told me—about having what they\ncall an ethical system without any dogma, I don’t see my way to that at\nall.”\n\n“Why, you can have the religion of loving-kindness and purity at least,\nif you can’t have—what do you call it—dogma.”\n\n“O no! I’m a different sort of fellow from that! If there’s nobody to\nsay, ‘Do this, and it will be a good thing for you after you are dead;\ndo that, and if will be a bad thing for you,’ I can’t warm up. Hang it,\nI am not going to feel responsible for my deeds and passions if there’s\nnobody to be responsible to; and if I were you, my dear, I wouldn’t\neither!”\n\nShe tried to argue, and tell him that he had mixed in his dull brain\ntwo matters, theology and morals, which in the primitive days of\nmankind had been quite distinct. But owing to Angel Clare’s reticence,\nto her absolute want of training, and to her being a vessel of emotions\nrather than reasons, she could not get on.\n\n“Well, never mind,” he resumed. “Here I am, my love, as in the old\ntimes!”\n\n“Not as then—never as then—’tis different!” she entreated. “And there\nwas never warmth with me! O why didn’t you keep your faith, if the loss\nof it has brought you to speak to me like this!”\n\n“Because you’ve knocked it out of me; so the evil be upon your sweet\nhead! Your husband little thought how his teaching would recoil upon\nhim! Ha-ha—I’m awfully glad you have made an apostate of me all the\nsame! Tess, I am more taken with you than ever, and I pity you too. For\nall your closeness, I see you are in a bad way—neglected by one who\nought to cherish you.”\n\nShe could not get her morsels of food down her throat; her lips were\ndry, and she was ready to choke. The voices and laughs of the workfolk\neating and drinking under the rick came to her as if they were a\nquarter of a mile off.\n\n“It is cruelty to me!” she said. “How—how can you treat me to this\ntalk, if you care ever so little for me?”\n\n“True, true,” he said, wincing a little. “I did not come to reproach\nyou for my deeds. I came Tess, to say that I don’t like you to be\nworking like this, and I have come on purpose for you. You say you have\na husband who is not I. Well, perhaps you have; but I’ve never seen\nhim, and you’ve not told me his name; and altogether he seems rather a\nmythological personage. However, even if you have one, I think I am\nnearer to you than he is. I, at any rate, try to help you out of\ntrouble, but he does not, bless his invisible face! The words of the\nstern prophet Hosea that I used to read come back to me. Don’t you know\nthem, Tess?—‘And she shall follow after her lover, but she shall not\novertake him; and she shall seek him, but shall not find him; then\nshall she say, I will go and return to my first husband; for then was\nit better with me than now!’ ... Tess, my trap is waiting just under\nthe hill, and—darling mine, not his!—you know the rest.”\n\nHer face had been rising to a dull crimson fire while he spoke; but she\ndid not answer.\n\n“You have been the cause of my backsliding,” he continued, stretching\nhis arm towards her waist; “you should be willing to share it, and\nleave that mule you call husband for ever.”\n\nOne of her leather gloves, which she had taken off to eat her\nskimmer-cake, lay in her lap, and without the slightest warning she\npassionately swung the glove by the gauntlet directly in his face. It\nwas heavy and thick as a warrior’s, and it struck him flat on the\nmouth. Fancy might have regarded the act as the recrudescence of a\ntrick in which her armed progenitors were not unpractised. Alec\nfiercely started up from his reclining position. A scarlet oozing\nappeared where her blow had alighted, and in a moment the blood began\ndropping from his mouth upon the straw. But he soon controlled himself,\ncalmly drew his handkerchief from his pocket, and mopped his bleeding\nlips.\n\nShe too had sprung up, but she sank down again. “Now, punish me!” she\nsaid, turning up her eyes to him with the hopeless defiance of the\nsparrow’s gaze before its captor twists its neck. “Whip me, crush me;\nyou need not mind those people under the rick! I shall not cry out.\nOnce victim, always victim—that’s the law!”\n\n“O no, no, Tess,” he said blandly. “I can make full allowance for this.\nYet you most unjustly forget one thing, that I would have married you\nif you had not put it out of my power to do so. Did I not ask you\nflatly to be my wife—hey? Answer me.”\n\n“You did.”\n\n“And you cannot be. But remember one thing!” His voice hardened as his\ntemper got the better of him with the recollection of his sincerity in\nasking her and her present ingratitude, and he stepped across to her\nside and held her by the shoulders, so that she shook under his grasp.\n“Remember, my lady, I was your master once! I will be your master\nagain. If you are any man’s wife you are mine!”\n\nThe threshers now began to stir below.\n\n“So much for our quarrel,” he said, letting her go. “Now I shall leave\nyou, and shall come again for your answer during the afternoon. You\ndon’t know me yet! But I know you.”\n\nShe had not spoken again, remaining as if stunned. D’Urberville\nretreated over the sheaves, and descended the ladder, while the workers\nbelow rose and stretched their arms, and shook down the beer they had\ndrunk. Then the threshing-machine started afresh; and amid the renewed\nrustle of the straw Tess resumed her position by the buzzing drum as\none in a dream, untying sheaf after sheaf in endless succession.\n\n\nXLVIII\n\nIn the afternoon the farmer made it known that the rick was to be\nfinished that night, since there was a moon by which they could see to\nwork, and the man with the engine was engaged for another farm on the\nmorrow. Hence the twanging and humming and rustling proceeded with even\nless intermission than usual.\n\nIt was not till “nammet”-time, about three o’clock, that Tess raised\nher eyes and gave a momentary glance round. She felt but little\nsurprise at seeing that Alec d’Urberville had come back, and was\nstanding under the hedge by the gate. He had seen her lift her eyes,\nand waved his hand urbanely to her, while he blew her a kiss. It meant\nthat their quarrel was over. Tess looked down again, and carefully\nabstained from gazing in that direction.\n\nThus the afternoon dragged on. The wheat-rick shrank lower, and the\nstraw-rick grew higher, and the corn-sacks were carted away. At six\no’clock the wheat-rick was about shoulder-high from the ground. But the\nunthreshed sheaves remaining untouched seemed countless still,\nnotwithstanding the enormous numbers that had been gulped down by the\ninsatiable swallower, fed by the man and Tess, through whose two young\nhands the greater part of them had passed. And the immense stack of\nstraw where in the morning there had been nothing, appeared as the\n_faeces_ of the same buzzing red glutton. From the west sky a wrathful\nshine—all that wild March could afford in the way of sunset—had burst\nforth after the cloudy day, flooding the tired and sticky faces of the\nthreshers, and dyeing them with a coppery light, as also the flapping\ngarments of the women, which clung to them like dull flames.\n\nA panting ache ran through the rick. The man who fed was weary, and\nTess could see that the red nape of his neck was encrusted with dirt\nand husks. She still stood at her post, her flushed and perspiring face\ncoated with the corndust, and her white bonnet embrowned by it. She was\nthe only woman whose place was upon the machine so as to be shaken\nbodily by its spinning, and the decrease of the stack now separated her\nfrom Marian and Izz, and prevented their changing duties with her as\nthey had done. The incessant quivering, in which every fibre of her\nframe participated, had thrown her into a stupefied reverie in which\nher arms worked on independently of her consciousness. She hardly knew\nwhere she was, and did not hear Izz Huett tell her from below that her\nhair was tumbling down.\n\nBy degrees the freshest among them began to grow cadaverous and\nsaucer-eyed. Whenever Tess lifted her head she beheld always the great\nupgrown straw-stack, with the men in shirt-sleeves upon it, against the\ngray north sky; in front of it the long red elevator like a Jacob’s\nladder, on which a perpetual stream of threshed straw ascended, a\nyellow river running uphill, and spouting out on the top of the rick.\n\nShe knew that Alec d’Urberville was still on the scene, observing her\nfrom some point or other, though she could not say where. There was an\nexcuse for his remaining, for when the threshed rick drew near its\nfinal sheaves a little ratting was always done, and men unconnected\nwith the threshing sometimes dropped in for that performance—sporting\ncharacters of all descriptions, gents with terriers and facetious\npipes, roughs with sticks and stones.\n\nBut there was another hour’s work before the layer of live rats at the\nbase of the stack would be reached; and as the evening light in the\ndirection of the Giant’s Hill by Abbot’s-Cernel dissolved away, the\nwhite-faced moon of the season arose from the horizon that lay towards\nMiddleton Abbey and Shottsford on the other side. For the last hour or\ntwo Marian had felt uneasy about Tess, whom she could not get near\nenough to speak to, the other women having kept up their strength by\ndrinking ale, and Tess having done without it through traditionary\ndread, owing to its results at her home in childhood. But Tess still\nkept going: if she could not fill her part she would have to leave; and\nthis contingency, which she would have regarded with equanimity and\neven with relief a month or two earlier, had become a terror since\nd’Urberville had begun to hover round her.\n\nThe sheaf-pitchers and feeders had now worked the rick so low that\npeople on the ground could talk to them. To Tess’s surprise Farmer\nGroby came up on the machine to her, and said that if she desired to\njoin her friend he did not wish her to keep on any longer, and would\nsend somebody else to take her place. The “friend” was d’Urberville,\nshe knew, and also that this concession had been granted in obedience\nto the request of that friend, or enemy. She shook her head and toiled\non.\n\nThe time for the rat-catching arrived at last, and the hunt began. The\ncreatures had crept downwards with the subsidence of the rick till they\nwere all together at the bottom, and being now uncovered from their\nlast refuge, they ran across the open ground in all directions, a loud\nshriek from the by-this-time half-tipsy Marian informing her companions\nthat one of the rats had invaded her person—a terror which the rest of\nthe women had guarded against by various schemes of skirt-tucking and\nself-elevation. The rat was at last dislodged, and, amid the barking of\ndogs, masculine shouts, feminine screams, oaths, stampings, and\nconfusion as of Pandemonium, Tess untied her last sheaf; the drum\nslowed, the whizzing ceased, and she stepped from the machine to the\nground.\n\nHer lover, who had only looked on at the rat-catching, was promptly at\nher side.\n\n“What—after all—my insulting slap, too!” said she in an underbreath.\nShe was so utterly exhausted that she had not strength to speak louder.\n\n“I should indeed be foolish to feel offended at anything you say or\ndo,” he answered, in the seductive voice of the Trantridge time. “How\nthe little limbs tremble! You are as weak as a bled calf, you know you\nare; and yet you need have done nothing since I arrived. How could you\nbe so obstinate? However, I have told the farmer that he has no right\nto employ women at steam-threshing. It is not proper work for them; and\non all the better class of farms it has been given up, as he knows very\nwell. I will walk with you as far as your home.”\n\n“O yes,” she answered with a jaded gait. “Walk wi’ me if you will! I do\nbear in mind that you came to marry me before you knew o’ my state.\nPerhaps—perhaps you are a little better and kinder than I have been\nthinking you were. Whatever is meant as kindness I am grateful for;\nwhatever is meant in any other way I am angered at. I cannot sense your\nmeaning sometimes.”\n\n“If I cannot legitimize our former relations at least I can assist you.\nAnd I will do it with much more regard for your feelings than I\nformerly showed. My religious mania, or whatever it was, is over. But I\nretain a little good nature; I hope I do. Now, Tess, by all that’s\ntender and strong between man and woman, trust me! I have enough and\nmore than enough to put you out of anxiety, both for yourself and your\nparents and sisters. I can make them all comfortable if you will only\nshow confidence in me.”\n\n“Have you seen ’em lately?” she quickly inquired.\n\n“Yes. They didn’t know where you were. It was only by chance that I\nfound you here.”\n\nThe cold moon looked aslant upon Tess’s fagged face between the twigs\nof the garden-hedge as she paused outside the cottage which was her\ntemporary home, d’Urberville pausing beside her.\n\n“Don’t mention my little brothers and sisters—don’t make me break down\nquite!” she said. “If you want to help them—God knows they need it—do\nit without telling me. But no, no!” she cried. “I will take nothing\nfrom you, either for them or for me!”\n\nHe did not accompany her further, since, as she lived with the\nhousehold, all was public indoors. No sooner had she herself entered,\nlaved herself in a washing-tub, and shared supper with the family than\nshe fell into thought, and withdrawing to the table under the wall, by\nthe light of her own little lamp wrote in a passionate mood—\n\n    My own Husband,\n\n    Let me call you so—I must—even if it makes you angry to think of\n    such an unworthy wife as I. I must cry to you in my trouble—I have\n    no one else! I am so exposed to temptation, Angel. I fear to say\n    who it is, and I do not like to write about it at all. But I cling\n    to you in a way you cannot think! Can you not come to me now, at\n    once, before anything terrible happens? O, I know you cannot,\n    because you are so far away! I think I must die if you do not come\n    soon, or tell me to come to you. The punishment you have measured\n    out to me is deserved—I do know that—well deserved—and you are\n    right and just to be angry with me. But, Angel, please, please, not\n    to be just—only a little kind to me, even if I do not deserve it,\n    and come to me! If you would come, I could die in your arms! I\n    would be well content to do that if so be you had forgiven me!\n\n    Angel, I live entirely for you. I love you too much to blame you\n    for going away, and I know it was necessary you should find a farm.\n    Do not think I shall say a word of sting or bitterness. Only come\n    back to me. I am desolate without you, my darling, O, so desolate!\n    I do not mind having to work: but if you will send me one little\n    line, and say, “_I am coming soon_”, I will bide on, Angel—O, so\n    cheerfully!\n\n    It has been so much my religion ever since we were married to be\n    faithful to you in every thought and look, that even when a man\n    speaks a compliment to me before I am aware, it seems wronging you.\n    Have you never felt one little bit of what you used to feel when we\n    were at the dairy? If you have, how can you keep away from me? I am\n    the same woman, Angel, as you fell in love with; yes, the very\n    same!—not the one you disliked but never saw. What was the past to\n    me as soon as I met you? It was a dead thing altogether. I became\n    another woman, filled full of new life from you. How could I be the\n    early one? Why do you not see this? Dear, if you would only be a\n    little more conceited, and believe in yourself so far as to see\n    that you were strong enough to work this change in me, you would\n    perhaps be in a mind to come to me, your poor wife.\n\n    How silly I was in my happiness when I thought I could trust you\n    always to love me! I ought to have known that such as that was not\n    for poor me. But I am sick at heart, not only for old times, but\n    for the present. Think—think how it do hurt my heart not to see you\n    ever—ever! Ah, if I could only make your dear heart ache one little\n    minute of each day as mine does every day and all day long, it\n    might lead you to show pity to your poor lonely one.\n\n    People still say that I am rather pretty, Angel (handsome is the\n    word they use, since I wish to be truthful). Perhaps I am what they\n    say. But I do not value my good looks; I only like to have them\n    because they belong to you, my dear, and that there may be at least\n    one thing about me worth your having. So much have I felt this,\n    that when I met with annoyance on account of the same, I tied up my\n    face in a bandage as long as people would believe in it. O Angel, I\n    tell you all this not from vanity—you will certainly know I do\n    not—but only that you may come to me!\n\n    If you really cannot come to me, will you let me come to you? I am,\n    as I say, worried, pressed to do what I will not do. It cannot be\n    that I shall yield one inch, yet I am in terror as to what an\n    accident might lead to, and I so defenceless on account of my first\n    error. I cannot say more about this—it makes me too miserable. But\n    if I break down by falling into some fearful snare, my last state\n    will be worse than my first. O God, I cannot think of it! Let me\n    come at once, or at once come to me!\n\n    I would be content, ay, glad, to live with you as your servant, if\n    I may not as your wife; so that I could only be near you, and get\n    glimpses of you, and think of you as mine.\n\n    The daylight has nothing to show me, since you are not here, and I\n    don’t like to see the rooks and starlings in the field, because I\n    grieve and grieve to miss you who used to see them with me. I long\n    for only one thing in heaven or earth or under the earth, to meet\n    you, my own dear! Come to me—come to me, and save me from what\n    threatens me!—\n\n    Your faithful heartbroken\n        Tess\n\n\nXLIX\n\nThe appeal duly found its way to the breakfast-table of the quiet\nVicarage to the westward, in that valley where the air is so soft and\nthe soil so rich that the effort of growth requires but superficial aid\nby comparison with the tillage at Flintcomb-Ash, and where to Tess the\nhuman world seemed so different (though it was much the same). It was\npurely for security that she had been requested by Angel to send her\ncommunications through his father, whom he kept pretty well informed of\nhis changing addresses in the country he had gone to exploit for\nhimself with a heavy heart.\n\n“Now,” said old Mr Clare to his wife, when he had read the envelope,\n“if Angel proposes leaving Rio for a visit home at the end of next\nmonth, as he told us that he hoped to do, I think this may hasten his\nplans; for I believe it to be from his wife.” He breathed deeply at the\nthought of her; and the letter was redirected to be promptly sent on to\nAngel.\n\n“Dear fellow, I hope he will get home safely,” murmured Mrs Clare. “To\nmy dying day I shall feel that he has been ill-used. You should have\nsent him to Cambridge in spite of his want of faith and given him the\nsame chance as the other boys had. He would have grown out of it under\nproper influence, and perhaps would have taken Orders after all. Church\nor no Church, it would have been fairer to him.”\n\nThis was the only wail with which Mrs Clare ever disturbed her\nhusband’s peace in respect to their sons. And she did not vent this\noften; for she was as considerate as she was devout, and knew that his\nmind too was troubled by doubts as to his justice in this matter. Only\ntoo often had she heard him lying awake at night, stifling sighs for\nAngel with prayers. But the uncompromising Evangelical did not even now\nhold that he would have been justified in giving his son, an\nunbeliever, the same academic advantages that he had given to the two\nothers, when it was possible, if not probable, that those very\nadvantages might have been used to decry the doctrines which he had\nmade it his life’s mission and desire to propagate, and the mission of\nhis ordained sons likewise. To put with one hand a pedestal under the\nfeet of the two faithful ones, and with the other to exalt the\nunfaithful by the same artificial means, he deemed to be alike\ninconsistent with his convictions, his position, and his hopes.\nNevertheless, he loved his misnamed Angel, and in secret mourned over\nthis treatment of him as Abraham might have mourned over the doomed\nIsaac while they went up the hill together. His silent self-generated\nregrets were far bitterer than the reproaches which his wife rendered\naudible.\n\nThey blamed themselves for this unlucky marriage. If Angel had never\nbeen destined for a farmer he would never have been thrown with\nagricultural girls. They did not distinctly know what had separated him\nand his wife, nor the date on which the separation had taken place. At\nfirst they had supposed it must be something of the nature of a serious\naversion. But in his later letters he occasionally alluded to the\nintention of coming home to fetch her; from which expressions they\nhoped the division might not owe its origin to anything so hopelessly\npermanent as that. He had told them that she was with her relatives,\nand in their doubts they had decided not to intrude into a situation\nwhich they knew no way of bettering.\n\nThe eyes for which Tess’s letter was intended were gazing at this time\non a limitless expanse of country from the back of a mule which was\nbearing him from the interior of the South-American Continent towards\nthe coast. His experiences of this strange land had been sad. The\nsevere illness from which he had suffered shortly after his arrival had\nnever wholly left him, and he had by degrees almost decided to\nrelinquish his hope of farming here, though, as long as the bare\npossibility existed of his remaining, he kept this change of view a\nsecret from his parents.\n\nThe crowds of agricultural labourers who had come out to the country in\nhis wake, dazzled by representations of easy independence, had\nsuffered, died, and wasted away. He would see mothers from English\nfarms trudging along with their infants in their arms, when the child\nwould be stricken with fever and would die; the mother would pause to\ndig a hole in the loose earth with her bare hands, would bury the babe\ntherein with the same natural grave-tools, shed one tear, and again\ntrudge on.\n\nAngel’s original intention had not been emigration to Brazil but a\nnorthern or eastern farm in his own country. He had come to this place\nin a fit of desperation, the Brazil movement among the English\nagriculturists having by chance coincided with his desire to escape\nfrom his past existence.\n\nDuring this time of absence he had mentally aged a dozen years. What\narrested him now as of value in life was less its beauty than its\npathos. Having long discredited the old systems of mysticism, he now\nbegan to discredit the old appraisements of morality. He thought they\nwanted readjusting. Who was the moral man? Still more pertinently, who\nwas the moral woman? The beauty or ugliness of a character lay not only\nin its achievements, but in its aims and impulses; its true history\nlay, not among things done, but among things willed.\n\nHow, then, about Tess?\n\nViewing her in these lights, a regret for his hasty judgement began to\noppress him. Did he reject her eternally, or did he not? He could no\nlonger say that he would always reject her, and not to say that was in\nspirit to accept her now.\n\nThis growing fondness for her memory coincided in point of time with\nher residence at Flintcomb-Ash, but it was before she had felt herself\nat liberty to trouble him with a word about her circumstances or her\nfeelings. He was greatly perplexed; and in his perplexity as to her\nmotives in withholding intelligence, he did not inquire. Thus her\nsilence of docility was misinterpreted. How much it really said if he\nhad understood!—that she adhered with literal exactness to orders which\nhe had given and forgotten; that despite her natural fearlessness she\nasserted no rights, admitted his judgement to be in every respect the\ntrue one, and bent her head dumbly thereto.\n\nIn the before-mentioned journey by mules through the interior of the\ncountry, another man rode beside him. Angel’s companion was also an\nEnglishman, bent on the same errand, though he came from another part\nof the island. They were both in a state of mental depression, and they\nspoke of home affairs. Confidence begat confidence. With that curious\ntendency evinced by men, more especially when in distant lands, to\nentrust to strangers details of their lives which they would on no\naccount mention to friends, Angel admitted to this man as they rode\nalong the sorrowful facts of his marriage.\n\nThe stranger had sojourned in many more lands and among many more\npeoples than Angel; to his cosmopolitan mind such deviations from the\nsocial norm, so immense to domesticity, were no more than are the\nirregularities of vale and mountain-chain to the whole terrestrial\ncurve. He viewed the matter in quite a different light from Angel;\nthought that what Tess had been was of no importance beside what she\nwould be, and plainly told Clare that he was wrong in coming away from\nher.\n\nThe next day they were drenched in a thunder-storm. Angel’s companion\nwas struck down with fever, and died by the week’s end. Clare waited a\nfew hours to bury him, and then went on his way.\n\nThe cursory remarks of the large-minded stranger, of whom he knew\nabsolutely nothing beyond a commonplace name, were sublimed by his\ndeath, and influenced Clare more than all the reasoned ethics of the\nphilosophers. His own parochialism made him ashamed by its contrast.\nHis inconsistencies rushed upon him in a flood. He had persistently\nelevated Hellenic Paganism at the expense of Christianity; yet in that\ncivilization an illegal surrender was not certain disesteem. Surely\nthen he might have regarded that abhorrence of the un-intact state,\nwhich he had inherited with the creed of mysticism, as at least open to\ncorrection when the result was due to treachery. A remorse struck into\nhim. The words of Izz Huett, never quite stilled in his memory, came\nback to him. He had asked Izz if she loved him, and she had replied in\nthe affirmative. Did she love him more than Tess did? No, she had\nreplied; Tess would lay down her life for him, and she herself could do\nno more.\n\nHe thought of Tess as she had appeared on the day of the wedding. How\nher eyes had lingered upon him; how she had hung upon his words as if\nthey were a god’s! And during the terrible evening over the hearth,\nwhen her simple soul uncovered itself to his, how pitiful her face had\nlooked by the rays of the fire, in her inability to realize that his\nlove and protection could possibly be withdrawn.\n\nThus from being her critic he grew to be her advocate. Cynical things\nhe had uttered to himself about her; but no man can be always a cynic\nand live; and he withdrew them. The mistake of expressing them had\narisen from his allowing himself to be influenced by general principles\nto the disregard of the particular instance.\n\nBut the reasoning is somewhat musty; lovers and husbands have gone over\nthe ground before to-day. Clare had been harsh towards her; there is no\ndoubt of it. Men are too often harsh with women they love or have\nloved; women with men. And yet these harshnesses are tenderness itself\nwhen compared with the universal harshness out of which they grow; the\nharshness of the position towards the temperament, of the means towards\nthe aims, of to-day towards yesterday, of hereafter towards to-day.\n\nThe historic interest of her family—that masterful line of\nd’Urbervilles—whom he had despised as a spent force, touched his\nsentiments now. Why had he not known the difference between the\npolitical value and the imaginative value of these things? In the\nlatter aspect her d’Urberville descent was a fact of great dimensions;\nworthless to economics, it was a most useful ingredient to the dreamer,\nto the moralizer on declines and falls. It was a fact that would soon\nbe forgotten—that bit of distinction in poor Tess’s blood and name, and\noblivion would fall upon her hereditary link with the marble monuments\nand leaded skeletons at Kingsbere. So does Time ruthlessly destroy his\nown romances. In recalling her face again and again, he thought now\nthat he could see therein a flash of the dignity which must have graced\nher grand-dames; and the vision sent that _aura_ through his veins\nwhich he had formerly felt, and which left behind it a sense of\nsickness.\n\nDespite her not inviolate past, what still abode in such a woman as\nTess outvalued the freshness of her fellows. Was not the gleaning of\nthe grapes of Ephraim better than the vintage of Abi-ezer?\n\nSo spoke love renascent, preparing the way for Tess’s devoted\noutpouring, which was then just being forwarded to him by his father;\nthough owing to his distance inland it was to be a long time in\nreaching him.\n\nMeanwhile the writer’s expectation that Angel would come in response to\nthe entreaty was alternately great and small. What lessened it was that\nthe facts of her life which had led to the parting had not\nchanged—could never change; and that, if her presence had not\nattenuated them, her absence could not. Nevertheless she addressed her\nmind to the tender question of what she could do to please him best if\nhe should arrive. Sighs were expended on the wish that she had taken\nmore notice of the tunes he played on his harp, that she had inquired\nmore curiously of him which were his favourite ballads among those the\ncountry-girls sang. She indirectly inquired of Amby Seedling, who had\nfollowed Izz from Talbothays, and by chance Amby remembered that,\namongst the snatches of melody in which they had indulged at the\ndairyman’s, to induce the cows to let down their milk, Clare had seemed\nto like “Cupid’s Gardens”, “I have parks, I have hounds”, and “The\nbreak o’ the day”; and had seemed not to care for “The Tailor’s\nBreeches” and “Such a beauty I did grow”, excellent ditties as they\nwere.\n\nTo perfect the ballads was now her whimsical desire. She practised them\nprivately at odd moments, especially “The break o’ the day”:\n\n    Arise, arise, arise!\n    And pick your love a posy,\n    All o’ the sweetest flowers\n    That in the garden grow.\n    The turtle doves and sma’ birds\n    In every bough a-building,\n    So early in the May-time\n    At the break o’ the day!\n\nIt would have melted the heart of a stone to hear her singing these\nditties whenever she worked apart from the rest of the girls in this\ncold dry time; the tears running down her cheeks all the while at the\nthought that perhaps he would not, after all, come to hear her, and the\nsimple silly words of the songs resounding in painful mockery of the\naching heart of the singer.\n\nTess was so wrapt up in this fanciful dream that she seemed not to know\nhow the season was advancing; that the days had lengthened, that\nLady-Day was at hand, and would soon be followed by Old Lady-Day, the\nend of her term here.\n\nBut before the quarter-day had quite come, something happened which\nmade Tess think of far different matters. She was at her lodging as\nusual one evening, sitting in the downstairs room with the rest of the\nfamily, when somebody knocked at the door and inquired for Tess.\nThrough the doorway she saw against the declining light a figure with\nthe height of a woman and the breadth of a child, a tall, thin, girlish\ncreature whom she did not recognize in the twilight till the girl said\n“Tess!”\n\n“What—is it ’Liza-Lu?” asked Tess, in startled accents. Her sister,\nwhom a little over a year ago she had left at home as a child, had\nsprung up by a sudden shoot to a form of this presentation, of which as\nyet Lu seemed herself scarce able to understand the meaning. Her thin\nlegs, visible below her once-long frock, now short by her growing, and\nher uncomfortable hands and arms revealed her youth and inexperience.\n\n“Yes, I have been traipsing about all day, Tess,” said Lu, with\nunemotional gravity, “a-trying to find ’ee; and I’m very tired.”\n\n“What is the matter at home?”\n\n“Mother is took very bad, and the doctor says she’s dying, and as\nfather is not very well neither, and says ’tis wrong for a man of such\na high family as his to slave and drave at common labouring work, we\ndon’t know what to do.”\n\nTess stood in reverie a long time before she thought of asking ’Liza-Lu\nto come in and sit down. When she had done so, and ’Liza-Lu was having\nsome tea, she came to a decision. It was imperative that she should go\nhome. Her agreement did not end till Old Lady-Day, the sixth of April,\nbut as the interval thereto was not a long one she resolved to run the\nrisk of starting at once.\n\nTo go that night would be a gain of twelve-hours; but her sister was\ntoo tired to undertake such a distance till the morrow. Tess ran down\nto where Marian and Izz lived, informed them of what had happened, and\nbegged them to make the best of her case to the farmer. Returning, she\ngot Lu a supper, and after that, having tucked the younger into her own\nbed, packed up as many of her belongings as would go into a withy\nbasket, and started, directing Lu to follow her next morning.\n\n\nL\n\nShe plunged into the chilly equinoctial darkness as the clock struck\nten, for her fifteen miles’ walk under the steely stars. In lonely\ndistricts night is a protection rather than a danger to a noiseless\npedestrian, and knowing this, Tess pursued the nearest course along\nby-lanes that she would almost have feared in the day-time; but\nmarauders were wanting now, and spectral fears were driven out of her\nmind by thoughts of her mother. Thus she proceeded mile after mile,\nascending and descending till she came to Bulbarrow, and about midnight\nlooked from that height into the abyss of chaotic shade which was all\nthat revealed itself of the vale on whose further side she was born.\nHaving already traversed about five miles on the upland, she had now\nsome ten or eleven in the lowland before her journey would be finished.\nThe winding road downwards became just visible to her under the wan\nstarlight as she followed it, and soon she paced a soil so contrasting\nwith that above it that the difference was perceptible to the tread and\nto the smell. It was the heavy clay land of Blackmoor Vale, and a part\nof the Vale to which turnpike-roads had never penetrated. Superstitions\nlinger longest on these heavy soils. Having once been forest, at this\nshadowy time it seemed to assert something of its old character, the\nfar and the near being blended, and every tree and tall hedge making\nthe most of its presence. The harts that had been hunted here, the\nwitches that had been pricked and ducked, the green-spangled fairies\nthat “whickered” at you as you passed;—the place teemed with beliefs in\nthem still, and they formed an impish multitude now.\n\nAt Nuttlebury she passed the village inn, whose sign creaked in\nresponse to the greeting of her footsteps, which not a human soul heard\nbut herself. Under the thatched roofs her mind’s eye beheld relaxed\ntendons and flaccid muscles, spread out in the darkness beneath\ncoverlets made of little purple patchwork squares, and undergoing a\nbracing process at the hands of sleep for renewed labour on the morrow,\nas soon as a hint of pink nebulosity appeared on Hambledon Hill.\n\nAt three she turned the last corner of the maze of lanes she had\nthreaded, and entered Marlott, passing the field in which as a\nclub-girl she had first seen Angel Clare, when he had not danced with\nher; the sense of disappointment remained with her yet. In the\ndirection of her mother’s house she saw a light. It came from the\nbedroom window, and a branch waved in front of it and made it wink at\nher. As soon as she could discern the outline of the house—newly\nthatched with her money—it had all its old effect upon Tess’s\nimagination. Part of her body and life it ever seemed to be; the slope\nof its dormers, the finish of its gables, the broken courses of brick\nwhich topped the chimney, all had something in common with her personal\ncharacter. A stupefaction had come into these features, to her regard;\nit meant the illness of her mother.\n\nShe opened the door so softly as to disturb nobody; the lower room was\nvacant, but the neighbour who was sitting up with her mother came to\nthe top of the stairs, and whispered that Mrs Durbeyfield was no\nbetter, though she was sleeping just then. Tess prepared herself a\nbreakfast, and then took her place as nurse in her mother’s chamber.\n\nIn the morning, when she contemplated the children, they had all a\ncuriously elongated look; although she had been away little more than a\nyear, their growth was astounding; and the necessity of applying\nherself heart and soul to their needs took her out of her own cares.\n\nHer father’s ill-health was the same indefinite kind, and he sat in his\nchair as usual. But the day after her arrival he was unusually bright.\nHe had a rational scheme for living, and Tess asked him what it was.\n\n“I’m thinking of sending round to all the old antiqueerians in this\npart of England,” he said, “asking them to subscribe to a fund to\nmaintain me. I’m sure they’d see it as a romantical, artistical, and\nproper thing to do. They spend lots o’ money in keeping up old ruins,\nand finding the bones o’ things, and such like; and living remains must\nbe more interesting to ’em still, if they only knowed of me. Would that\nsomebody would go round and tell ’em what there is living among ’em,\nand they thinking nothing of him! If Pa’son Tringham, who discovered\nme, had lived, he’d ha’ done it, I’m sure.”\n\nTess postponed her arguments on this high project till she had grappled\nwith pressing matters in hand, which seemed little improved by her\nremittances. When indoor necessities had been eased, she turned her\nattention to external things. It was now the season for planting and\nsowing; many gardens and allotments of the villagers had already\nreceived their spring tillage; but the garden and the allotment of the\nDurbeyfields were behindhand. She found, to her dismay, that this was\nowing to their having eaten all the seed potatoes,—that last lapse of\nthe improvident. At the earliest moment she obtained what others she\ncould procure, and in a few days her father was well enough to see to\nthe garden, under Tess’s persuasive efforts: while she herself\nundertook the allotment-plot which they rented in a field a couple of\nhundred yards out of the village.\n\nShe liked doing it after the confinement of the sick chamber, where she\nwas not now required by reason of her mother’s improvement. Violent\nmotion relieved thought. The plot of ground was in a high, dry, open\nenclosure, where there were forty or fifty such pieces, and where\nlabour was at its briskest when the hired labour of the day had ended.\nDigging began usually at six o’clock and extended indefinitely into the\ndusk or moonlight. Just now heaps of dead weeds and refuse were burning\non many of the plots, the dry weather favouring their combustion.\n\nOne fine day Tess and ’Liza-Lu worked on here with their neighbours\ntill the last rays of the sun smote flat upon the white pegs that\ndivided the plots. As soon as twilight succeeded to sunset the flare of\nthe couch-grass and cabbage-stalk fires began to light up the\nallotments fitfully, their outlines appearing and disappearing under\nthe dense smoke as wafted by the wind. When a fire glowed, banks of\nsmoke, blown level along the ground, would themselves become\nilluminated to an opaque lustre, screening the workpeople from one\nanother; and the meaning of the “pillar of a cloud”, which was a wall\nby day and a light by night, could be understood.\n\nAs evening thickened, some of the gardening men and women gave over for\nthe night, but the greater number remained to get their planting done,\nTess being among them, though she sent her sister home. It was on one\nof the couch-burning plots that she laboured with her fork, its four\nshining prongs resounding against the stones and dry clods in little\nclicks. Sometimes she was completely involved in the smoke of her fire;\nthen it would leave her figure free, irradiated by the brassy glare\nfrom the heap. She was oddly dressed to-night, and presented a somewhat\nstaring aspect, her attire being a gown bleached by many washings, with\na short black jacket over it, the effect of the whole being that of a\nwedding and funeral guest in one. The women further back wore white\naprons, which, with their pale faces, were all that could be seen of\nthem in the gloom, except when at moments they caught a flash from the\nflames.\n\nWestward, the wiry boughs of the bare thorn hedge which formed the\nboundary of the field rose against the pale opalescence of the lower\nsky. Above, Jupiter hung like a full-blown jonquil, so bright as almost\nto throw a shade. A few small nondescript stars were appearing\nelsewhere. In the distance a dog barked, and wheels occasionally\nrattled along the dry road.\n\nStill the prongs continued to click assiduously, for it was not late;\nand though the air was fresh and keen there was a whisper of spring in\nit that cheered the workers on. Something in the place, the hours, the\ncrackling fires, the fantastic mysteries of light and shade, made\nothers as well as Tess enjoy being there. Nightfall, which in the frost\nof winter comes as a fiend and in the warmth of summer as a lover, came\nas a tranquillizer on this March day.\n\nNobody looked at his or her companions. The eyes of all were on the\nsoil as its turned surface was revealed by the fires. Hence as Tess\nstirred the clods and sang her foolish little songs with scarce now a\nhope that Clare would ever hear them, she did not for a long time\nnotice the person who worked nearest to her—a man in a long smockfrock\nwho, she found, was forking the same plot as herself, and whom she\nsupposed her father had sent there to advance the work. She became more\nconscious of him when the direction of his digging brought him closer.\nSometimes the smoke divided them; then it swerved, and the two were\nvisible to each other but divided from all the rest.\n\nTess did not speak to her fellow-worker, nor did he speak to her. Nor\ndid she think of him further than to recollect that he had not been\nthere when it was broad daylight, and that she did not know him as any\none of the Marlott labourers, which was no wonder, her absences having\nbeen so long and frequent of late years. By-and-by he dug so close to\nher that the fire-beams were reflected as distinctly from the steel\nprongs of his fork as from her own. On going up to the fire to throw a\npitch of dead weeds upon it, she found that he did the same on the\nother side. The fire flared up, and she beheld the face of\nd’Urberville.\n\nThe unexpectedness of his presence, the grotesqueness of his appearance\nin a gathered smockfrock, such as was now worn only by the most\nold-fashioned of the labourers, had a ghastly comicality that chilled\nher as to its bearing. D’Urberville emitted a low, long laugh.\n\n“If I were inclined to joke, I should say, How much this seems like\nParadise!” he remarked whimsically, looking at her with an inclined\nhead.\n\n“What do you say?” she weakly asked.\n\n“A jester might say this is just like Paradise. You are Eve, and I am\nthe old Other One come to tempt you in the disguise of an inferior\nanimal. I used to be quite up in that scene of Milton’s when I was\ntheological. Some of it goes—\n\n    ‘Empress, the way is ready, and not long,\n    Beyond a row of myrtles....\n    ... If thou accept\n    My conduct, I can bring thee thither soon.’\n    ‘Lead then,’ said Eve.\n\n“And so on. My dear Tess, I am only putting this to you as a thing that\nyou might have supposed or said quite untruly, because you think so\nbadly of me.”\n\n“I never said you were Satan, or thought it. I don’t think of you in\nthat way at all. My thoughts of you are quite cold, except when you\naffront me. What, did you come digging here entirely because of me?”\n\n“Entirely. To see you; nothing more. The smockfrock, which I saw\nhanging for sale as I came along, was an afterthought, that I mightn’t\nbe noticed. I come to protest against your working like this.”\n\n“But I like doing it—it is for my father.”\n\n“Your engagement at the other place is ended?”\n\n“Yes.”\n\n“Where are you going to next? To join your dear husband?”\n\nShe could not bear the humiliating reminder.\n\n“O—I don’t know!” she said bitterly. “I have no husband!”\n\n“It is quite true—in the sense you mean. But you have a friend, and I\nhave determined that you shall be comfortable in spite of yourself.\nWhen you get down to your house you will see what I have sent there for\nyou.”\n\n“O, Alec, I wish you wouldn’t give me anything at all! I cannot take it\nfrom you! I don’t like—it is not right!”\n\n“It _is_ right!” he cried lightly. “I am not going to see a woman whom\nI feel so tenderly for as I do for you in trouble without trying to\nhelp her.”\n\n“But I am very well off! I am only in trouble about—about—not about\nliving at all!”\n\nShe turned, and desperately resumed her digging, tears dripping upon\nthe fork-handle and upon the clods.\n\n“About the children—your brothers and sisters,” he resumed. “I’ve been\nthinking of them.”\n\nTess’s heart quivered—he was touching her in a weak place. He had\ndivined her chief anxiety. Since returning home her soul had gone out\nto those children with an affection that was passionate.\n\n“If your mother does not recover, somebody ought to do something for\nthem; since your father will not be able to do much, I suppose?”\n\n“He can with my assistance. He must!”\n\n“And with mine.”\n\n“No, sir!”\n\n“How damned foolish this is!” burst out d’Urberville. “Why, he thinks\nwe are the same family; and will be quite satisfied!”\n\n“He don’t. I’ve undeceived him.”\n\n“The more fool you!”\n\nD’Urberville in anger retreated from her to the hedge, where he pulled\noff the long smockfrock which had disguised him; and rolling it up and\npushing it into the couch-fire, went away.\n\nTess could not get on with her digging after this; she felt restless;\nshe wondered if he had gone back to her father’s house; and taking the\nfork in her hand proceeded homewards.\n\nSome twenty yards from the house she was met by one of her sisters.\n\n“O, Tessy—what do you think! ’Liza-Lu is a-crying, and there’s a lot of\nfolk in the house, and mother is a good deal better, but they think\nfather is dead!”\n\nThe child realized the grandeur of the news; but not as yet its\nsadness, and stood looking at Tess with round-eyed importance till,\nbeholding the effect produced upon her, she said—\n\n“What, Tess, shan’t we talk to father never no more?”\n\n“But father was only a little bit ill!” exclaimed Tess distractedly.\n\n’Liza-Lu came up.\n\n“He dropped down just now, and the doctor who was there for mother said\nthere was no chance for him, because his heart was growed in.”\n\nYes; the Durbeyfield couple had changed places; the dying one was out\nof danger, and the indisposed one was dead. The news meant even more\nthan it sounded. Her father’s life had a value apart from his personal\nachievements, or perhaps it would not have had much. It was the last of\nthe three lives for whose duration the house and premises were held\nunder a lease; and it had long been coveted by the tenant-farmer for\nhis regular labourers, who were stinted in cottage accommodation.\nMoreover, “liviers” were disapproved of in villages almost as much as\nlittle freeholders, because of their independence of manner, and when a\nlease determined it was never renewed.\n\nThus the Durbeyfields, once d’Urbervilles, saw descending upon them the\ndestiny which, no doubt, when they were among the Olympians of the\ncounty, they had caused to descend many a time, and severely enough,\nupon the heads of such landless ones as they themselves were now. So do\nflux and reflux—the rhythm of change—alternate and persist in\neverything under the sky.\n\n\nLI\n\nAt length it was the eve of Old Lady-Day, and the agricultural world\nwas in a fever of mobility such as only occurs at that particular date\nof the year. It is a day of fulfilment; agreements for outdoor service\nduring the ensuing year, entered into at Candlemas, are to be now\ncarried out. The labourers—or “work-folk”, as they used to call\nthemselves immemorially till the other word was introduced from\nwithout—who wish to remain no longer in old places are removing to the\nnew farms.\n\nThese annual migrations from farm to farm were on the increase here.\nWhen Tess’s mother was a child the majority of the field-folk about\nMarlott had remained all their lives on one farm, which had been the\nhome also of their fathers and grandfathers; but latterly the desire\nfor yearly removal had risen to a high pitch. With the younger families\nit was a pleasant excitement which might possibly be an advantage. The\nEgypt of one family was the Land of Promise to the family who saw it\nfrom a distance, till by residence there it became in turn their Egypt\nalso; and so they changed and changed.\n\nHowever, all the mutations so increasingly discernible in village life\ndid not originate entirely in the agricultural unrest. A depopulation\nwas also going on. The village had formerly contained, side by side\nwith the argicultural labourers, an interesting and better-informed\nclass, ranking distinctly above the former—the class to which Tess’s\nfather and mother had belonged—and including the carpenter, the smith,\nthe shoemaker, the huckster, together with nondescript workers other\nthan farm-labourers; a set of people who owed a certain stability of\naim and conduct to the fact of their being lifeholders like Tess’s\nfather, or copyholders, or occasionally, small freeholders. But as the\nlong holdings fell in, they were seldom again let to similar tenants,\nand were mostly pulled down, if not absolutely required by the farmer\nfor his hands. Cottagers who were not directly employed on the land\nwere looked upon with disfavour, and the banishment of some starved the\ntrade of others, who were thus obliged to follow. These families, who\nhad formed the backbone of the village life in the past, who were the\ndepositaries of the village traditions, had to seek refuge in the large\ncentres; the process, humorously designated by statisticians as “the\ntendency of the rural population towards the large towns”, being really\nthe tendency of water to flow uphill when forced by machinery.\n\nThe cottage accommodation at Marlott having been in this manner\nconsiderably curtailed by demolitions, every house which remained\nstanding was required by the agriculturist for his work-people. Ever\nsince the occurrence of the event which had cast such a shadow over\nTess’s life, the Durbeyfield family (whose descent was not credited)\nhad been tacitly looked on as one which would have to go when their\nlease ended, if only in the interests of morality. It was, indeed,\nquite true that the household had not been shining examples either of\ntemperance, soberness, or chastity. The father, and even the mother,\nhad got drunk at times, the younger children seldom had gone to church,\nand the eldest daughter had made queer unions. By some means the\nvillage had to be kept pure. So on this, the first Lady-Day on which\nthe Durbeyfields were expellable, the house, being roomy, was required\nfor a carter with a large family; and Widow Joan, her daughters Tess\nand ’Liza-Lu, the boy Abraham, and the younger children had to go\nelsewhere.\n\nOn the evening preceding their removal it was getting dark betimes by\nreason of a drizzling rain which blurred the sky. As it was the last\nnight they would spend in the village which had been their home and\nbirthplace, Mrs Durbeyfield, ’Liza-Lu, and Abraham had gone out to bid\nsome friends goodbye, and Tess was keeping house till they should\nreturn.\n\nShe was kneeling in the window-bench, her face close to the casement,\nwhere an outer pane of rain-water was sliding down the inner pane of\nglass. Her eyes rested on the web of a spider, probably starved long\nago, which had been mistakenly placed in a corner where no flies ever\ncame, and shivered in the slight draught through the casement. Tess was\nreflecting on the position of the household, in which she perceived her\nown evil influence. Had she not come home, her mother and the children\nmight probably have been allowed to stay on as weekly tenants. But she\nhad been observed almost immediately on her return by some people of\nscrupulous character and great influence: they had seen her idling in\nthe churchyard, restoring as well as she could with a little trowel a\nbaby’s obliterated grave. By this means they had found that she was\nliving here again; her mother was scolded for “harbouring” her; sharp\nretorts had ensued from Joan, who had independently offered to leave at\nonce; she had been taken at her word; and here was the result.\n\n“I ought never to have come home,” said Tess to herself, bitterly.\n\nShe was so intent upon these thoughts that she hardly at first took\nnote of a man in a white mackintosh whom she saw riding down the\nstreet. Possibly it was owing to her face being near to the pane that\nhe saw her so quickly, and directed his horse so close to the\ncottage-front that his hoofs were almost upon the narrow border for\nplants growing under the wall. It was not till he touched the window\nwith his riding-crop that she observed him. The rain had nearly ceased,\nand she opened the casement in obedience to his gesture.\n\n“Didn’t you see me?” asked d’Urberville.\n\n“I was not attending,” she said. “I heard you, I believe, though I\nfancied it was a carriage and horses. I was in a sort of dream.”\n\n“Ah! you heard the d’Urberville Coach, perhaps. You know the legend, I\nsuppose?”\n\n“No. My—somebody was going to tell it me once, but didn’t.”\n\n“If you are a genuine d’Urberville I ought not to tell you either, I\nsuppose. As for me, I’m a sham one, so it doesn’t matter. It is rather\ndismal. It is that this sound of a non-existent coach can only be heard\nby one of d’Urberville blood, and it is held to be of ill-omen to the\none who hears it. It has to do with a murder, committed by one of the\nfamily, centuries ago.”\n\n“Now you have begun it, finish it.”\n\n“Very well. One of the family is said to have abducted some beautiful\nwoman, who tried to escape from the coach in which he was carrying her\noff, and in the struggle he killed her—or she killed him—I forget\nwhich. Such is one version of the tale... I see that your tubs and\nbuckets are packed. Going away, aren’t you?”\n\n“Yes, to-morrow—Old Lady Day.”\n\n“I heard you were, but could hardly believe it; it seems so sudden. Why\nis it?”\n\n“Father’s was the last life on the property, and when that dropped we\nhad no further right to stay. Though we might, perhaps, have stayed as\nweekly tenants—if it had not been for me.”\n\n“What about you?”\n\n“I am not a—proper woman.”\n\nD’Urberville’s face flushed.\n\n“What a blasted shame! Miserable snobs! May their dirty souls be burnt\nto cinders!” he exclaimed in tones of ironic resentment. “That’s why\nyou are going, is it? Turned out?”\n\n“We are not turned out exactly; but as they said we should have to go\nsoon, it was best to go now everybody was moving, because there are\nbetter chances.”\n\n“Where are you going to?”\n\n“Kingsbere. We have taken rooms there. Mother is so foolish about\nfather’s people that she will go there.”\n\n“But your mother’s family are not fit for lodgings, and in a little\nhole of a town like that. Now why not come to my garden-house at\nTrantridge? There are hardly any poultry now, since my mother’s death;\nbut there’s the house, as you know it, and the garden. It can be\nwhitewashed in a day, and your mother can live there quite comfortably;\nand I will put the children to a good school. Really I ought to do\nsomething for you!”\n\n“But we have already taken the rooms at Kingsbere!” she declared. “And\nwe can wait there—”\n\n“Wait—what for? For that nice husband, no doubt. Now look here, Tess, I\nknow what men are, and, bearing in mind the _grounds_ of your\nseparation, I am quite positive he will never make it up with you. Now,\nthough I have been your enemy, I am your friend, even if you won’t\nbelieve it. Come to this cottage of mine. We’ll get up a regular colony\nof fowls, and your mother can attend to them excellently; and the\nchildren can go to school.”\n\nTess breathed more and more quickly, and at length she said—\n\n“How do I know that you would do all this? Your views may change—and\nthen—we should be—my mother would be—homeless again.”\n\n“O no—no. I would guarantee you against such as that in writing, if\nnecessary. Think it over.”\n\nTess shook her head. But d’Urberville persisted; she had seldom seen\nhim so determined; he would not take a negative.\n\n“Please just tell your mother,” he said, in emphatic tones. “It is her\nbusiness to judge—not yours. I shall get the house swept out and\nwhitened to-morrow morning, and fires lit; and it will be dry by the\nevening, so that you can come straight there. Now mind, I shall expect\nyou.”\n\nTess again shook her head, her throat swelling with complicated\nemotion. She could not look up at d’Urberville.\n\n“I owe you something for the past, you know,” he resumed. “And you\ncured me, too, of that craze; so I am glad—”\n\n“I would rather you had kept the craze, so that you had kept the\npractice which went with it!”\n\n“I am glad of this opportunity of repaying you a little. To-morrow I\nshall expect to hear your mother’s goods unloading... Give me your hand\non it now—dear, beautiful Tess!”\n\nWith the last sentence he had dropped his voice to a murmur, and put\nhis hand in at the half-open casement. With stormy eyes she pulled the\nstay-bar quickly, and, in doing so, caught his arm between the casement\nand the stone mullion.\n\n“Damnation—you are very cruel!” he said, snatching out his arm. “No,\nno!—I know you didn’t do it on purpose. Well, I shall expect you, or\nyour mother and children at least.”\n\n“I shall not come—I have plenty of money!” she cried.\n\n“Where?”\n\n“At my father-in-law’s, if I ask for it.”\n\n“_If_ you ask for it. But you won’t, Tess; I know you; you’ll never ask\nfor it—you’ll starve first!”\n\nWith these words he rode off. Just at the corner of the street he met\nthe man with the paint-pot, who asked him if he had deserted the\nbrethren.\n\n“You go to the devil!” said d’Urberville.\n\nTess remained where she was a long while, till a sudden rebellious\nsense of injustice caused the region of her eyes to swell with the rush\nof hot tears thither. Her husband, Angel Clare himself, had, like\nothers, dealt out hard measure to her; surely he had! She had never\nbefore admitted such a thought; but he had surely! Never in her\nlife—she could swear it from the bottom of her soul—had she ever\nintended to do wrong; yet these hard judgements had come. Whatever her\nsins, they were not sins of intention, but of inadvertence, and why\nshould she have been punished so persistently?\n\nShe passionately seized the first piece of paper that came to hand, and\nscribbled the following lines:\n\n    O why have you treated me so monstrously, Angel! I do not deserve\n    it. I have thought it all over carefully, and I can never, never\n    forgive you! You know that I did not intend to wrong you—why have\n    you so wronged me? You are cruel, cruel indeed! I will try to\n    forget you. It is all injustice I have received at your hands!\n\n            T.\n\nShe watched till the postman passed by, ran out to him with her\nepistle, and then again took her listless place inside the\nwindow-panes.\n\nIt was just as well to write like that as to write tenderly. How could\nhe give way to entreaty? The facts had not changed: there was no new\nevent to alter his opinion.\n\nIt grew darker, the fire-light shining over the room. The two biggest\nof the younger children had gone out with their mother; the four\nsmallest, their ages ranging from three-and-a-half years to eleven, all\nin black frocks, were gathered round the hearth babbling their own\nlittle subjects. Tess at length joined them, without lighting a candle.\n\n“This is the last night that we shall sleep here, dears, in the house\nwhere we were born,” she said quickly. “We ought to think of it,\noughtn’t we?”\n\nThey all became silent; with the impressibility of their age they were\nready to burst into tears at the picture of finality she had conjured\nup, though all the day hitherto they had been rejoicing in the idea of\na new place. Tess changed the subject.\n\n“Sing to me, dears,” she said.\n\n“What shall we sing?”\n\n“Anything you know; I don’t mind.”\n\nThere was a momentary pause; it was broken, first, in one little\ntentative note; then a second voice strengthened it, and a third and a\nfourth chimed in unison, with words they had learnt at the\nSunday-school—\n\n    Here we suffer grief and pain,\n    Here we meet to part again;\n    In Heaven we part no more.\n\nThe four sang on with the phlegmatic passivity of persons who had long\nago settled the question, and there being no mistake about it, felt\nthat further thought was not required. With features strained hard to\nenunciate the syllables they continued to regard the centre of the\nflickering fire, the notes of the youngest straying over into the\npauses of the rest.\n\nTess turned from them, and went to the window again. Darkness had now\nfallen without, but she put her face to the pane as though to peer into\nthe gloom. It was really to hide her tears. If she could only believe\nwhat the children were singing; if she were only sure, how different\nall would now be; how confidently she would leave them to Providence\nand their future kingdom! But, in default of that, it behoved her to do\nsomething; to be their Providence; for to Tess, as to not a few\nmillions of others, there was ghastly satire in the poet’s lines—\n\n    Not in utter nakedness\n    But trailing clouds of glory do we come.\n\nTo her and her like, birth itself was an ordeal of degrading personal\ncompulsion, whose gratuitousness nothing in the result seemed to\njustify, and at best could only palliate.\n\nIn the shades of the wet road she soon discerned her mother with tall\n’Liza-Lu and Abraham. Mrs Durbeyfield’s pattens clicked up to the door,\nand Tess opened it.\n\n“I see the tracks of a horse outside the window,” said Joan. “Hev\nsomebody called?”\n\n“No,” said Tess.\n\nThe children by the fire looked gravely at her, and one murmured—\n\n“Why, Tess, the gentleman a-horseback!”\n\n“He didn’t call,” said Tess. “He spoke to me in passing.”\n\n“Who was the gentleman?” asked the mother. “Your husband?”\n\n“No. He’ll never, never come,” answered Tess in stony hopelessness.\n\n“Then who was it?”\n\n“Oh, you needn’t ask. You’ve seen him before, and so have I.”\n\n“Ah! What did he say?” said Joan curiously.\n\n“I will tell you when we are settled in our lodging at Kingsbere\nto-morrow—every word.”\n\nIt was not her husband, she had said. Yet a consciousness that in a\nphysical sense this man alone was her husband seemed to weigh on her\nmore and more.\n\n\nLII\n\nDuring the small hours of the next morning, while it was still dark,\ndwellers near the highways were conscious of a disturbance of their\nnight’s rest by rumbling noises, intermittently continuing till\ndaylight—noises as certain to recur in this particular first week of\nthe month as the voice of the cuckoo in the third week of the same.\nThey were the preliminaries of the general removal, the passing of the\nempty waggons and teams to fetch the goods of the migrating families;\nfor it was always by the vehicle of the farmer who required his\nservices that the hired man was conveyed to his destination. That this\nmight be accomplished within the day was the explanation of the\nreverberation occurring so soon after midnight, the aim of the carters\nbeing to reach the door of the outgoing households by six o’clock, when\nthe loading of their movables at once began.\n\nBut to Tess and her mother’s household no such anxious farmer sent his\nteam. They were only women; they were not regular labourers; they were\nnot particularly required anywhere; hence they had to hire a waggon at\ntheir own expense, and got nothing sent gratuitously.\n\nIt was a relief to Tess, when she looked out of the window that\nmorning, to find that though the weather was windy and louring, it did\nnot rain, and that the waggon had come. A wet Lady-Day was a spectre\nwhich removing families never forgot; damp furniture, damp bedding,\ndamp clothing accompanied it, and left a train of ills.\n\nHer mother, ’Liza-Lu, and Abraham were also awake, but the younger\nchildren were let sleep on. The four breakfasted by the thin light, and\nthe “house-ridding” was taken in hand.\n\nIt proceeded with some cheerfulness, a friendly neighbour or two\nassisting. When the large articles of furniture had been packed in\nposition, a circular nest was made of the beds and bedding, in which\nJoan Durbeyfield and the young children were to sit through the\njourney. After loading there was a long delay before the horses were\nbrought, these having been unharnessed during the ridding; but at\nlength, about two o’clock, the whole was under way, the cooking-pot\nswinging from the axle of the waggon, Mrs Durbeyfield and family at the\ntop, the matron having in her lap, to prevent injury to its works, the\nhead of the clock, which, at any exceptional lurch of the waggon,\nstruck one, or one-and-a-half, in hurt tones. Tess and the next eldest\ngirl walked alongside till they were out of the village.\n\nThey had called on a few neighbours that morning and the previous\nevening, and some came to see them off, all wishing them well, though,\nin their secret hearts, hardly expecting welfare possible to such a\nfamily, harmless as the Durbeyfields were to all except themselves.\nSoon the equipage began to ascend to higher ground, and the wind grew\nkeener with the change of level and soil.\n\nThe day being the sixth of April, the Durbeyfield waggon met many other\nwaggons with families on the summit of the load, which was built on a\nwellnigh unvarying principle, as peculiar, probably, to the rural\nlabourer as the hexagon to the bee. The groundwork of the arrangement\nwas the family dresser, which, with its shining handles, and\nfinger-marks, and domestic evidences thick upon it, stood importantly\nin front, over the tails of the shaft-horses, in its erect and natural\nposition, like some Ark of the Covenant that they were bound to carry\nreverently.\n\nSome of the households were lively, some mournful; some were stopping\nat the doors of wayside inns; where, in due time, the Durbeyfield\nmenagerie also drew up to bait horses and refresh the travellers.\n\nDuring the halt Tess’s eyes fell upon a three-pint blue mug, which was\nascending and descending through the air to and from the feminine\nsection of a household, sitting on the summit of a load that had also\ndrawn up at a little distance from the same inn. She followed one of\nthe mug’s journeys upward, and perceived it to be clasped by hands\nwhose owner she well knew. Tess went towards the waggon.\n\n“Marian and Izz!” she cried to the girls, for it was they, sitting with\nthe moving family at whose house they had lodged. “Are you\nhouse-ridding to-day, like everybody else?”\n\nThey were, they said. It had been too rough a life for them at\nFlintcomb-Ash, and they had come away, almost without notice, leaving\nGroby to prosecute them if he chose. They told Tess their destination,\nand Tess told them hers.\n\nMarian leant over the load, and lowered her voice. “Do you know that\nthe gentleman who follows ’ee—you’ll guess who I mean—came to ask for\n’ee at Flintcomb after you had gone? We didn’t tell’n where you was,\nknowing you wouldn’t wish to see him.”\n\n“Ah—but I did see him!” Tess murmured. “He found me.”\n\n“And do he know where you be going?”\n\n“I think so.”\n\n“Husband come back?”\n\n“No.”\n\nShe bade her acquaintance goodbye—for the respective carters had now\ncome out from the inn—and the two waggons resumed their journey in\nopposite directions; the vehicle whereon sat Marian, Izz, and the\nploughman’s family with whom they had thrown in their lot, being\nbrightly painted, and drawn by three powerful horses with shining brass\nornaments on their harness; while the waggon on which Mrs Durbeyfield\nand her family rode was a creaking erection that would scarcely bear\nthe weight of the superincumbent load; one which had known no paint\nsince it was made, and drawn by two horses only. The contrast well\nmarked the difference between being fetched by a thriving farmer and\nconveying oneself whither no hirer waited one’s coming.\n\nThe distance was great—too great for a day’s journey—and it was with\nthe utmost difficulty that the horses performed it. Though they had\nstarted so early, it was quite late in the afternoon when they turned\nthe flank of an eminence which formed part of the upland called\nGreenhill. While the horses stood to stale and breathe themselves Tess\nlooked around. Under the hill, and just ahead of them, was the\nhalf-dead townlet of their pilgrimage, Kingsbere, where lay those\nancestors of whom her father had spoken and sung to painfulness:\nKingsbere, the spot of all spots in the world which could be considered\nthe d’Urbervilles’ home, since they had resided there for full five\nhundred years.\n\nA man could be seen advancing from the outskirts towards them, and when\nhe beheld the nature of their waggon-load he quickened his steps.\n\n“You be the woman they call Mrs Durbeyfield, I reckon?” he said to\nTess’s mother, who had descended to walk the remainder of the way.\n\nShe nodded. “Though widow of the late Sir John d’Urberville, poor\nnobleman, if I cared for my rights; and returning to the domain of his\nforefathers.”\n\n“Oh? Well, I know nothing about that; but if you be Mrs Durbeyfield, I\nam sent to tell ’ee that the rooms you wanted be let. We didn’t know\nthat you was coming till we got your letter this morning—when ’twas too\nlate. But no doubt you can get other lodgings somewhere.”\n\nThe man had noticed the face of Tess, which had become ash-pale at his\nintelligence. Her mother looked hopelessly at fault. “What shall we do\nnow, Tess?” she said bitterly. “Here’s a welcome to your ancestors’\nlands! However, let’s try further.”\n\nThey moved on into the town, and tried with all their might, Tess\nremaining with the waggon to take care of the children whilst her\nmother and ’Liza-Lu made inquiries. At the last return of Joan to the\nvehicle, an hour later, when her search for accommodation had still\nbeen fruitless, the driver of the waggon said the goods must be\nunloaded, as the horses were half-dead, and he was bound to return part\nof the way at least that night.\n\n“Very well—unload it here,” said Joan recklessly. “I’ll get shelter\nsomewhere.”\n\nThe waggon had drawn up under the churchyard wall, in a spot screened\nfrom view, and the driver, nothing loth, soon hauled down the poor heap\nof household goods. This done, she paid him, reducing herself to almost\nher last shilling thereby, and he moved off and left them, only too\nglad to get out of further dealings with such a family. It was a dry\nnight, and he guessed that they would come to no harm.\n\nTess gazed desperately at the pile of furniture. The cold sunlight of\nthis spring evening peered invidiously upon the crocks and kettles,\nupon the bunches of dried herbs shivering in the breeze, upon the brass\nhandles of the dresser, upon the wicker-cradle they had all been rocked\nin, and upon the well-rubbed clock-case, all of which gave out the\nreproachful gleam of indoor articles abandoned to the vicissitudes of a\nroofless exposure for which they were never made. Round about were\ndeparked hills and slopes—now cut up into little paddocks—and the green\nfoundations that showed where the d’Urberville mansion once had stood;\nalso an outlying stretch of Egdon Heath that had always belonged to the\nestate. Hard by, the aisle of the church called the d’Urberville Aisle\nlooked on imperturbably.\n\n“Isn’t your family vault your own freehold?” said Tess’s mother, as she\nreturned from a reconnoitre of the church and graveyard. “Why, of\ncourse ’tis, and that’s where we will camp, girls, till the place of\nyour ancestors finds us a roof! Now, Tess and ’Liza and Abraham, you\nhelp me. We’ll make a nest for these children, and then we’ll have\nanother look round.”\n\nTess listlessly lent a hand, and in a quarter of an hour the old\nfour-post bedstead was dissociated from the heap of goods, and erected\nunder the south wall of the church, the part of the building known as\nthe d’Urberville Aisle, beneath which the huge vaults lay. Over the\ntester of the bedstead was a beautiful traceried window, of many\nlights, its date being the fifteenth century. It was called the\nd’Urberville Window, and in the upper part could be discerned heraldic\nemblems like those on Durbeyfield’s old seal and spoon.\n\nJoan drew the curtains round the bed so as to make an excellent tent of\nit, and put the smaller children inside. “If it comes to the worst we\ncan sleep there too, for one night,” she said. “But let us try further\non, and get something for the dears to eat! O, Tess, what’s the use of\nyour playing at marrying gentlemen, if it leaves us like this!”\n\nAccompanied by ’Liza-Lu and the boy, she again ascended the little lane\nwhich secluded the church from the townlet. As soon as they got into\nthe street they beheld a man on horseback gazing up and down. “Ah—I’m\nlooking for you!” he said, riding up to them. “This is indeed a family\ngathering on the historic spot!”\n\nIt was Alec d’Urberville. “Where is Tess?” he asked.\n\nPersonally Joan had no liking for Alec. She cursorily signified the\ndirection of the church, and went on, d’Urberville saying that he would\nsee them again, in case they should be still unsuccessful in their\nsearch for shelter, of which he had just heard. When they had gone,\nd’Urberville rode to the inn, and shortly after came out on foot.\n\nIn the interim Tess, left with the children inside the bedstead,\nremained talking with them awhile, till, seeing that no more could be\ndone to make them comfortable just then, she walked about the\nchurchyard, now beginning to be embrowned by the shades of nightfall.\nThe door of the church was unfastened, and she entered it for the first\ntime in her life.\n\nWithin the window under which the bedstead stood were the tombs of the\nfamily, covering in their dates several centuries. They were canopied,\naltar-shaped, and plain; their carvings being defaced and broken; their\nbrasses torn from the matrices, the rivet-holes remaining like\nmartin-holes in a sandcliff. Of all the reminders that she had ever\nreceived that her people were socially extinct, there was none so\nforcible as this spoliation.\n\nShe drew near to a dark stone on which was inscribed:\n\n    OSTIUM SEPULCHRI ANTIQUAE FAMILIAE D’URBERVILLE\n\nTess did not read Church-Latin like a Cardinal, but she knew that this\nwas the door of her ancestral sepulchre, and that the tall knights of\nwhom her father had chanted in his cups lay inside.\n\nShe musingly turned to withdraw, passing near an altar-tomb, the oldest\nof them all, on which was a recumbent figure. In the dusk she had not\nnoticed it before, and would hardly have noticed it now but for an odd\nfancy that the effigy moved. As soon as she drew close to it she\ndiscovered all in a moment that the figure was a living person; and the\nshock to her sense of not having been alone was so violent that she was\nquite overcome, and sank down nigh to fainting, not, however, till she\nhad recognized Alec d’Urberville in the form.\n\nHe leapt off the slab and supported her.\n\n“I saw you come in,” he said smiling, “and got up there not to\ninterrupt your meditations. A family gathering, is it not, with these\nold fellows under us here? Listen.”\n\nHe stamped with his heel heavily on the floor; whereupon there arose a\nhollow echo from below.\n\n“That shook them a bit, I’ll warrant!” he continued. “And you thought I\nwas the mere stone reproduction of one of them. But no. The old order\nchangeth. The little finger of the sham d’Urberville can do more for\nyou than the whole dynasty of the real underneath.... Now command me.\nWhat shall I do?”\n\n“Go away!” she murmured.\n\n“I will—I’ll look for your mother,” said he blandly. But in passing her\nhe whispered: “Mind this; you’ll be civil yet!”\n\nWhen he was gone she bent down upon the entrance to the vaults, and\nsaid—\n\n“Why am I on the wrong side of this door!”\n\nIn the meantime Marian and Izz Huett had journeyed onward with the\nchattels of the ploughman in the direction of their land of Canaan—the\nEgypt of some other family who had left it only that morning. But the\ngirls did not for a long time think of where they were going. Their\ntalk was of Angel Clare and Tess, and Tess’s persistent lover, whose\nconnection with her previous history they had partly heard and partly\nguessed ere this.\n\n“’Tisn’t as though she had never known him afore,” said Marian. “His\nhaving won her once makes all the difference in the world. ’Twould be a\nthousand pities if he were to tole her away again. Mr Clare can never\nbe anything to us, Izz; and why should we grudge him to her, and not\ntry to mend this quarrel? If he could on’y know what straits she’s put\nto, and what’s hovering round, he might come to take care of his own.”\n\n“Could we let him know?”\n\nThey thought of this all the way to their destination; but the bustle\nof re-establishment in their new place took up all their attention\nthen. But when they were settled, a month later, they heard of Clare’s\napproaching return, though they had learnt nothing more of Tess. Upon\nthat, agitated anew by their attachment to him, yet honourably disposed\nto her, Marian uncorked the penny ink-bottle they shared, and a few\nlines were concocted between the two girls.\n\n    Honour’d Sir,\n\n    Look to your Wife if you do love her as much as she do love you.\n    For she is sore put to by an Enemy in the shape of a Friend. Sir,\n    there is one near her who ought to be Away. A woman should not be\n    try’d beyond her Strength, and continual dropping will wear away a\n    Stone—ay, more—a Diamond.\n\n    From Two Well-Wishers\n\nThis was addressed to Angel Clare at the only place they had ever heard\nhim to be connected with, Emminster Vicarage; after which they\ncontinued in a mood of emotional exaltation at their own generosity,\nwhich made them sing in hysterical snatches and weep at the same time.\n\n\nEnd of Phase the Sixth\n\n\nPhase the Seventh:\n\nFulfilment\n\n\nLIII\n\nIt was evening at Emminster Vicarage. The two customary candles were\nburning under their green shades in the Vicar’s study, but he had not\nbeen sitting there. Occasionally he came in, stirred the small fire\nwhich sufficed for the increasing mildness of the spring, and went out\nagain; sometimes pausing at the front door, going on to the\ndrawing-room, then returning again to the front door.\n\nIt faced westward, and though gloom prevailed inside, there was still\nlight enough without to see with distinctness. Mrs Clare, who had been\nsitting in the drawing-room, followed him hither.\n\n“Plenty of time yet,” said the Vicar. “He doesn’t reach Chalk-Newton\ntill six, even if the train should be punctual, and ten miles of\ncountry-road, five of them in Crimmercrock Lane, are not jogged over in\na hurry by our old horse.”\n\n“But he has done it in an hour with us, my dear.”\n\n“Years ago.”\n\nThus they passed the minutes, each well knowing that this was only\nwaste of breath, the one essential being simply to wait.\n\nAt length there was a slight noise in the lane, and the old pony-chaise\nappeared indeed outside the railings. They saw alight therefrom a form\nwhich they affected to recognize, but would actually have passed by in\nthe street without identifying had he not got out of their carriage at\nthe particular moment when a particular person was due.\n\nMrs Clare rushed through the dark passage to the door, and her husband\ncame more slowly after her.\n\nThe new arrival, who was just about to enter, saw their anxious faces\nin the doorway and the gleam of the west in their spectacles because\nthey confronted the last rays of day; but they could only see his shape\nagainst the light.\n\n“O, my boy, my boy—home again at last!” cried Mrs Clare, who cared no\nmore at that moment for the stains of heterodoxy which had caused all\nthis separation than for the dust upon his clothes. What woman, indeed,\namong the most faithful adherents of the truth, believes the promises\nand threats of the Word in the sense in which she believes in her own\nchildren, or would not throw her theology to the wind if weighed\nagainst their happiness? As soon as they reached the room where the\ncandles were lighted she looked at his face.\n\n“O, it is not Angel—not my son—the Angel who went away!” she cried in\nall the irony of sorrow, as she turned herself aside.\n\nHis father, too, was shocked to see him, so reduced was that figure\nfrom its former contours by worry and the bad season that Clare had\nexperienced, in the climate to which he had so rashly hurried in his\nfirst aversion to the mockery of events at home. You could see the\nskeleton behind the man, and almost the ghost behind the skeleton. He\nmatched Crivelli’s dead _Christus_. His sunken eye-pits were of morbid\nhue, and the light in his eyes had waned. The angular hollows and lines\nof his aged ancestors had succeeded to their reign in his face twenty\nyears before their time.\n\n“I was ill over there, you know,” he said. “I am all right now.”\n\nAs if, however, to falsify this assertion, his legs seemed to give way,\nand he suddenly sat down to save himself from falling. It was only a\nslight attack of faintness, resulting from the tedious day’s journey,\nand the excitement of arrival.\n\n“Has any letter come for me lately?” he asked. “I received the last you\nsent on by the merest chance, and after considerable delay through\nbeing inland; or I might have come sooner.”\n\n“It was from your wife, we supposed?”\n\n“It was.”\n\nOnly one other had recently come. They had not sent it on to him,\nknowing he would start for home so soon.\n\nHe hastily opened the letter produced, and was much disturbed to read\nin Tess’s handwriting the sentiments expressed in her last hurried\nscrawl to him.\n\n    O why have you treated me so monstrously, Angel! I do not deserve\n    it. I have thought it all over carefully, and I can never, never\n    forgive you! You know that I did not intend to wrong you—why have\n    you so wronged me? You are cruel, cruel indeed! I will try to\n    forget you. It is all injustice I have received at your hands!\n\n            T.\n\n“It is quite true!” said Angel, throwing down the letter. “Perhaps she\nwill never be reconciled to me!”\n\n“Don’t, Angel, be so anxious about a mere child of the soil!” said his\nmother.\n\n“Child of the soil! Well, we all are children of the soil. I wish she\nwere so in the sense you mean; but let me now explain to you what I\nhave never explained before, that her father is a descendant in the\nmale line of one of the oldest Norman houses, like a good many others\nwho lead obscure agricultural lives in our villages, and are dubbed\n‘sons of the soil.’”\n\nHe soon retired to bed; and the next morning, feeling exceedingly\nunwell, he remained in his room pondering. The circumstances amid which\nhe had left Tess were such that though, while on the south of the\nEquator and just in receipt of her loving epistle, it had seemed the\neasiest thing in the world to rush back into her arms the moment he\nchose to forgive her, now that he had arrived it was not so easy as it\nhad seemed. She was passionate, and her present letter, showing that\nher estimate of him had changed under his delay—too justly changed, he\nsadly owned,—made him ask himself if it would be wise to confront her\nunannounced in the presence of her parents. Supposing that her love had\nindeed turned to dislike during the last weeks of separation, a sudden\nmeeting might lead to bitter words.\n\nClare therefore thought it would be best to prepare Tess and her family\nby sending a line to Marlott announcing his return, and his hope that\nshe was still living with them there, as he had arranged for her to do\nwhen he left England. He despatched the inquiry that very day, and\nbefore the week was out there came a short reply from Mrs Durbeyfield\nwhich did not remove his embarrassment, for it bore no address, though\nto his surprise it was not written from Marlott.\n\n    Sir,\n\n    J write these few lines to say that my Daughter is away from me at\n    present, and J am not sure when she will return, but J will let you\n    know as Soon as she do. J do not feel at liberty to tell you Where\n    she is temperly biding. J should say that me and my Family have\n    left Marlott for some Time.—\n\n    Yours,\n\n    J. Durbeyfield\n\nIt was such a relief to Clare to learn that Tess was at least\napparently well that her mother’s stiff reticence as to her whereabouts\ndid not long distress him. They were all angry with him, evidently. He\nwould wait till Mrs Durbeyfield could inform him of Tess’s return,\nwhich her letter implied to be soon. He deserved no more. His had been\na love “which alters when it alteration finds”. He had undergone some\nstrange experiences in his absence; he had seen the virtual Faustina in\nthe literal Cornelia, a spiritual Lucretia in a corporeal Phryne; he\nhad thought of the woman taken and set in the midst as one deserving to\nbe stoned, and of the wife of Uriah being made a queen; and he had\nasked himself why he had not judged Tess constructively rather than\nbiographically, by the will rather than by the deed?\n\nA day or two passed while he waited at his father’s house for the\npromised second note from Joan Durbeyfield, and indirectly to recover a\nlittle more strength. The strength showed signs of coming back, but\nthere was no sign of Joan’s letter. Then he hunted up the old letter\nsent on to him in Brazil, which Tess had written from Flintcomb-Ash,\nand re-read it. The sentences touched him now as much as when he had\nfirst perused them.\n\n...I must cry to you in my trouble—I have no one else!... I think I\nmust die if you do not come soon, or tell me to come to you... please,\nplease, not to be just—only a little kind to me.... If you would come,\nI could die in your arms! I would be well content to do that if so be\nyou had forgiven me!... if you will send me one little line, and say,\n_I am coming soon_, I will bide on, Angel—O, so cheerfully!... think\nhow it do hurt my heart not to see you ever—ever! Ah, if I could only\nmake your dear heart ache one little minute of each day as mine does\nevery day and all day long, it might lead you to show pity to your poor\nlonely one.... I would be content, ay, glad, to live with you as your\nservant, if I may not as your wife; so that I could only be near you,\nand get glimpses of you, and think of you as mine.... I long for only\none thing in heaven or earth or under the earth, to meet you, my own\ndear! Come to me—come to me, and save me from what threatens me!\n\n\nClare determined that he would no longer believe in her more recent and\nseverer regard of him, but would go and find her immediately. He asked\nhis father if she had applied for any money during his absence. His\nfather returned a negative, and then for the first time it occurred to\nAngel that her pride had stood in her way, and that she had suffered\nprivation. From his remarks his parents now gathered the real reason of\nthe separation; and their Christianity was such that, reprobates being\ntheir especial care, the tenderness towards Tess which her blood, her\nsimplicity, even her poverty, had not engendered, was instantly excited\nby her sin.\n\nWhilst he was hastily packing together a few articles for his journey\nhe glanced over a poor plain missive also lately come to hand—the one\nfrom Marian and Izz Huett, beginning—\n\n“Honour’d Sir, Look to your Wife if you do love her as much as she do\nlove you,” and signed, “From Two Well-Wishers.”\n\n\nLIV\n\nIn a quarter of an hour Clare was leaving the house, whence his mother\nwatched his thin figure as it disappeared into the street. He had\ndeclined to borrow his father’s old mare, well knowing of its necessity\nto the household. He went to the inn, where he hired a trap, and could\nhardly wait during the harnessing. In a very few minutes after, he was\ndriving up the hill out of the town which, three or four months earlier\nin the year, Tess had descended with such hopes and ascended with such\nshattered purposes.\n\nBenvill Lane soon stretched before him, its hedges and trees purple\nwith buds; but he was looking at other things, and only recalled\nhimself to the scene sufficiently to enable him to keep the way. In\nsomething less than an hour-and-a-half he had skirted the south of the\nKing’s Hintock estates and ascended to the untoward solitude of\nCross-in-Hand, the unholy stone whereon Tess had been compelled by Alec\nd’Urberville, in his whim of reformation, to swear the strange oath\nthat she would never wilfully tempt him again. The pale and blasted\nnettle-stems of the preceding year even now lingered nakedly in the\nbanks, young green nettles of the present spring growing from their\nroots.\n\nThence he went along the verge of the upland overhanging the other\nHintocks, and, turning to the right, plunged into the bracing\ncalcareous region of Flintcomb-Ash, the address from which she had\nwritten to him in one of the letters, and which he supposed to be the\nplace of sojourn referred to by her mother. Here, of course, he did not\nfind her; and what added to his depression was the discovery that no\n“Mrs Clare” had ever been heard of by the cottagers or by the farmer\nhimself, though Tess was remembered well enough by her Christian name.\nHis name she had obviously never used during their separation, and her\ndignified sense of their total severance was shown not much less by\nthis abstention than by the hardships she had chosen to undergo (of\nwhich he now learnt for the first time) rather than apply to his father\nfor more funds.\n\nFrom this place they told him Tess Durbeyfield had gone, without due\nnotice, to the home of her parents on the other side of Blackmoor, and\nit therefore became necessary to find Mrs Durbeyfield. She had told him\nshe was not now at Marlott, but had been curiously reticent as to her\nactual address, and the only course was to go to Marlott and inquire\nfor it. The farmer who had been so churlish with Tess was quite\nsmooth-tongued to Clare, and lent him a horse and man to drive him\ntowards Marlott, the gig he had arrived in being sent back to\nEmminster; for the limit of a day’s journey with that horse was\nreached.\n\nClare would not accept the loan of the farmer’s vehicle for a further\ndistance than to the outskirts of the Vale, and, sending it back with\nthe man who had driven him, he put up at an inn, and next day entered\non foot the region wherein was the spot of his dear Tess’s birth. It\nwas as yet too early in the year for much colour to appear in the\ngardens and foliage; the so-called spring was but winter overlaid with\na thin coat of greenness, and it was of a parcel with his expectations.\n\nThe house in which Tess had passed the years of her childhood was now\ninhabited by another family who had never known her. The new residents\nwere in the garden, taking as much interest in their own doings as if\nthe homestead had never passed its primal time in conjunction with the\nhistories of others, beside which the histories of these were but as a\ntale told by an idiot. They walked about the garden paths with thoughts\nof their own concerns entirely uppermost, bringing their actions at\nevery moment in jarring collision with the dim ghosts behind them,\ntalking as though the time when Tess lived there were not one whit\nintenser in story than now. Even the spring birds sang over their heads\nas if they thought there was nobody missing in particular.\n\nOn inquiry of these precious innocents, to whom even the name of their\npredecessors was a failing memory, Clare learned that John Durbeyfield\nwas dead; that his widow and children had left Marlott, declaring that\nthey were going to live at Kingsbere, but instead of doing so had gone\non to another place they mentioned. By this time Clare abhorred the\nhouse for ceasing to contain Tess, and hastened away from its hated\npresence without once looking back.\n\nHis way was by the field in which he had first beheld her at the dance.\nIt was as bad as the house—even worse. He passed on through the\nchurchyard, where, amongst the new headstones, he saw one of a somewhat\nsuperior design to the rest. The inscription ran thus:\n\n    In memory of John Durbeyfield, rightly d’Urberville, of the once\n    powerful family of that Name, and Direct Descendant through an\n    illustrious Line from Sir Pagan d’Urberville, one of the Knights of\n    the Conqueror. Died March 10th, 18—\n\n    How are the Mighty Fallen.\n\nSome man, apparently the sexton, had observed Clare standing there, and\ndrew nigh. “Ah, sir, now that’s a man who didn’t want to lie here, but\nwished to be carried to Kingsbere, where his ancestors be.”\n\n“And why didn’t they respect his wish?”\n\n“Oh—no money. Bless your soul, sir, why—there, I wouldn’t wish to say\nit everywhere, but—even this headstone, for all the flourish wrote upon\nen, is not paid for.”\n\n“Ah, who put it up?”\n\nThe man told the name of a mason in the village, and, on leaving the\nchurchyard, Clare called at the mason’s house. He found that the\nstatement was true, and paid the bill. This done, he turned in the\ndirection of the migrants.\n\nThe distance was too long for a walk, but Clare felt such a strong\ndesire for isolation that at first he would neither hire a conveyance\nnor go to a circuitous line of railway by which he might eventually\nreach the place. At Shaston, however, he found he must hire; but the\nway was such that he did not enter Joan’s place till about seven\no’clock in the evening, having traversed a distance of over twenty\nmiles since leaving Marlott.\n\nThe village being small he had little difficulty in finding Mrs\nDurbeyfield’s tenement, which was a house in a walled garden, remote\nfrom the main road, where she had stowed away her clumsy old furniture\nas best she could. It was plain that for some reason or other she had\nnot wished him to visit her, and he felt his call to be somewhat of an\nintrusion. She came to the door herself, and the light from the evening\nsky fell upon her face.\n\nThis was the first time that Clare had ever met her, but he was too\npreoccupied to observe more than that she was still a handsome woman,\nin the garb of a respectable widow. He was obliged to explain that he\nwas Tess’s husband, and his object in coming there, and he did it\nawkwardly enough. “I want to see her at once,” he added. “You said you\nwould write to me again, but you have not done so.”\n\n“Because she’ve not come home,” said Joan.\n\n“Do you know if she is well?”\n\n“I don’t. But you ought to, sir,” said she.\n\n“I admit it. Where is she staying?”\n\nFrom the beginning of the interview Joan had disclosed her\nembarrassment by keeping her hand to the side of her cheek.\n\n“I—don’t know exactly where she is staying,” she answered. “She\nwas—but—”\n\n“Where was she?”\n\n“Well, she is not there now.”\n\nIn her evasiveness she paused again, and the younger children had by\nthis time crept to the door, where, pulling at his mother’s skirts, the\nyoungest murmured—\n\n“Is this the gentleman who is going to marry Tess?”\n\n“He has married her,” Joan whispered. “Go inside.”\n\nClare saw her efforts for reticence, and asked—\n\n“Do you think Tess would wish me to try and find her? If not, of\ncourse—”\n\n“I don’t think she would.”\n\n“Are you sure?”\n\n“I am sure she wouldn’t.”\n\nHe was turning away; and then he thought of Tess’s tender letter.\n\n“I am sure she would!” he retorted passionately. “I know her better\nthan you do.”\n\n“That’s very likely, sir; for I have never really known her.”\n\n“Please tell me her address, Mrs Durbeyfield, in kindness to a lonely\nwretched man!” Tess’s mother again restlessly swept her cheek with her\nvertical hand, and seeing that he suffered, she at last said, is a low\nvoice—\n\n“She is at Sandbourne.”\n\n“Ah—where there? Sandbourne has become a large place, they say.”\n\n“I don’t know more particularly than I have said—Sandbourne. For\nmyself, I was never there.”\n\nIt was apparent that Joan spoke the truth in this, and he pressed her\nno further.\n\n“Are you in want of anything?” he said gently.\n\n“No, sir,” she replied. “We are fairly well provided for.”\n\nWithout entering the house Clare turned away. There was a station three\nmiles ahead, and paying off his coachman, he walked thither. The last\ntrain to Sandbourne left shortly after, and it bore Clare on its\nwheels.\n\n\nLV\n\nAt eleven o’clock that night, having secured a bed at one of the hotels\nand telegraphed his address to his father immediately on his arrival,\nhe walked out into the streets of Sandbourne. It was too late to call\non or inquire for any one, and he reluctantly postponed his purpose\ntill the morning. But he could not retire to rest just yet.\n\nThis fashionable watering-place, with its eastern and its western\nstations, its piers, its groves of pines, its promenades, and its\ncovered gardens, was, to Angel Clare, like a fairy place suddenly\ncreated by the stroke of a wand, and allowed to get a little dusty. An\noutlying eastern tract of the enormous Egdon Waste was close at hand,\nyet on the very verge of that tawny piece of antiquity such a\nglittering novelty as this pleasure city had chosen to spring up.\nWithin the space of a mile from its outskirts every irregularity of the\nsoil was prehistoric, every channel an undisturbed British trackway;\nnot a sod having been turned there since the days of the Cæsars. Yet\nthe exotic had grown here, suddenly as the prophet’s gourd; and had\ndrawn hither Tess.\n\nBy the midnight lamps he went up and down the winding way of this new\nworld in an old one, and could discern between the trees and against\nthe stars the lofty roofs, chimneys, gazebos, and towers of the\nnumerous fanciful residences of which the place was composed. It was a\ncity of detached mansions; a Mediterranean lounging-place on the\nEnglish Channel; and as seen now by night it seemed even more imposing\nthan it was.\n\nThe sea was near at hand, but not intrusive; it murmured, and he\nthought it was the pines; the pines murmured in precisely the same\ntones, and he thought they were the sea.\n\nWhere could Tess possibly be, a cottage-girl, his young wife, amidst\nall this wealth and fashion? The more he pondered, the more was he\npuzzled. Were there any cows to milk here? There certainly were no\nfields to till. She was most probably engaged to do something in one of\nthese large houses; and he sauntered along, looking at the\nchamber-windows and their lights going out one by one, and wondered\nwhich of them might be hers.\n\nConjecture was useless, and just after twelve o’clock he entered and\nwent to bed. Before putting out his light he re-read Tess’s impassioned\nletter. Sleep, however, he could not—so near her, yet so far from\nher—and he continually lifted the window-blind and regarded the backs\nof the opposite houses, and wondered behind which of the sashes she\nreposed at that moment.\n\nHe might almost as well have sat up all night. In the morning he arose\nat seven, and shortly after went out, taking the direction of the chief\npost-office. At the door he met an intelligent postman coming out with\nletters for the morning delivery.\n\n“Do you know the address of a Mrs Clare?” asked Angel. The postman\nshook his head.\n\nThen, remembering that she would have been likely to continue the use\nof her maiden name, Clare said—\n\n“Of a Miss Durbeyfield?”\n\n“Durbeyfield?”\n\nThis also was strange to the postman addressed.\n\n“There’s visitors coming and going every day, as you know, sir,” he\nsaid; “and without the name of the house ’tis impossible to find ’em.”\n\nOne of his comrades hastening out at that moment, the name was repeated\nto him.\n\n“I know no name of Durbeyfield; but there is the name of d’Urberville\nat The Herons,” said the second.\n\n“That’s it!” cried Clare, pleased to think that she had reverted to the\nreal pronunciation. “What place is The Herons?”\n\n“A stylish lodging-house. ’Tis all lodging-houses here, bless ’ee.”\n\nClare received directions how to find the house, and hastened thither,\narriving with the milkman. The Herons, though an ordinary villa, stood\nin its own grounds, and was certainly the last place in which one would\nhave expected to find lodgings, so private was its appearance. If poor\nTess was a servant here, as he feared, she would go to the back-door to\nthat milkman, and he was inclined to go thither also. However, in his\ndoubts he turned to the front, and rang.\n\nThe hour being early, the landlady herself opened the door. Clare\ninquired for Teresa d’Urberville or Durbeyfield.\n\n“Mrs d’Urberville?”\n\n“Yes.”\n\nTess, then, passed as a married woman, and he felt glad, even though\nshe had not adopted his name.\n\n“Will you kindly tell her that a relative is anxious to see her?”\n\n“It is rather early. What name shall I give, sir?”\n\n“Angel.”\n\n“Mr Angel?”\n\n“No; Angel. It is my Christian name. She’ll understand.”\n\n“I’ll see if she is awake.”\n\nHe was shown into the front room—the dining-room—and looked out through\nthe spring curtains at the little lawn, and the rhododendrons and other\nshrubs upon it. Obviously her position was by no means so bad as he had\nfeared, and it crossed his mind that she must somehow have claimed and\nsold the jewels to attain it. He did not blame her for one moment. Soon\nhis sharpened ear detected footsteps upon the stairs, at which his\nheart thumped so painfully that he could hardly stand firm. “Dear me!\nwhat will she think of me, so altered as I am!” he said to himself; and\nthe door opened.\n\nTess appeared on the threshold—not at all as he had expected to see\nher—bewilderingly otherwise, indeed. Her great natural beauty was, if\nnot heightened, rendered more obvious by her attire. She was loosely\nwrapped in a cashmere dressing-gown of gray-white, embroidered in\nhalf-mourning tints, and she wore slippers of the same hue. Her neck\nrose out of a frill of down, and her well-remembered cable of\ndark-brown hair was partially coiled up in a mass at the back of her\nhead and partly hanging on her shoulder—the evident result of haste.\n\nHe had held out his arms, but they had fallen again to his side; for\nshe had not come forward, remaining still in the opening of the\ndoorway. Mere yellow skeleton that he was now, he felt the contrast\nbetween them, and thought his appearance distasteful to her.\n\n“Tess!” he said huskily, “can you forgive me for going away? Can’t\nyou—come to me? How do you get to be—like this?”\n\n“It is too late,” said she, her voice sounding hard through the room,\nher eyes shining unnaturally.\n\n“I did not think rightly of you—I did not see you as you were!” he\ncontinued to plead. “I have learnt to since, dearest Tessy mine!”\n\n“Too late, too late!” she said, waving her hand in the impatience of a\nperson whose tortures cause every instant to seem an hour. “Don’t come\nclose to me, Angel! No—you must not. Keep away.”\n\n“But don’t you love me, my dear wife, because I have been so pulled\ndown by illness? You are not so fickle—I am come on purpose for you—my\nmother and father will welcome you now!”\n\n“Yes—O, yes, yes! But I say, I say it is too late.”\n\nShe seemed to feel like a fugitive in a dream, who tries to move away,\nbut cannot. “Don’t you know all—don’t you know it? Yet how do you come\nhere if you do not know?”\n\n“I inquired here and there, and I found the way.”\n\n“I waited and waited for you,” she went on, her tones suddenly resuming\ntheir old fluty pathos. “But you did not come! And I wrote to you, and\nyou did not come! He kept on saying you would never come any more, and\nthat I was a foolish woman. He was very kind to me, and to mother, and\nto all of us after father’s death. He—”\n\n“I don’t understand.”\n\n“He has won me back to him.”\n\nClare looked at her keenly, then, gathering her meaning, flagged like\none plague-stricken, and his glance sank; it fell on her hands, which,\nonce rosy, were now white and more delicate.\n\nShe continued—\n\n“He is upstairs. I hate him now, because he told me a lie—that you\nwould not come again; and you _have_ come! These clothes are what he’s\nput upon me: I didn’t care what he did wi’ me! But—will you go away,\nAngel, please, and never come any more?”\n\nThey stood fixed, their baffled hearts looking out of their eyes with a\njoylessness pitiful to see. Both seemed to implore something to shelter\nthem from reality.\n\n“Ah—it is my fault!” said Clare.\n\nBut he could not get on. Speech was as inexpressive as silence. But he\nhad a vague consciousness of one thing, though it was not clear to him\ntill later; that his original Tess had spiritually ceased to recognize\nthe body before him as hers—allowing it to drift, like a corpse upon\nthe current, in a direction dissociated from its living will.\n\nA few instants passed, and he found that Tess was gone. His face grew\ncolder and more shrunken as he stood concentrated on the moment, and a\nminute or two after, he found himself in the street, walking along he\ndid not know whither.\n\n\nLVI\n\nMrs Brooks, the lady who was the householder at The Herons and owner of\nall the handsome furniture, was not a person of an unusually curious\nturn of mind. She was too deeply materialized, poor woman, by her long\nand enforced bondage to that arithmetical demon Profit-and-Loss, to\nretain much curiousity for its own sake, and apart from possible\nlodgers’ pockets. Nevertheless, the visit of Angel Clare to her\nwell-paying tenants, Mr and Mrs d’Urberville, as she deemed them, was\nsufficiently exceptional in point of time and manner to reinvigorate\nthe feminine proclivity which had been stifled down as useless save in\nits bearings to the letting trade.\n\nTess had spoken to her husband from the doorway, without entering the\ndining-room, and Mrs Brooks, who stood within the partly-closed door of\nher own sitting-room at the back of the passage, could hear fragments\nof the conversation—if conversation it could be called—between those\ntwo wretched souls. She heard Tess re-ascend the stairs to the first\nfloor, and the departure of Clare, and the closing of the front door\nbehind him. Then the door of the room above was shut, and Mrs Brooks\nknew that Tess had re-entered her apartment. As the young lady was not\nfully dressed, Mrs Brooks knew that she would not emerge again for some\ntime.\n\nShe accordingly ascended the stairs softly, and stood at the door of\nthe front room—a drawing-room, connected with the room immediately\nbehind it (which was a bedroom) by folding-doors in the common manner.\nThis first floor, containing Mrs Brooks’s best apartments, had been\ntaken by the week by the d’Urbervilles. The back room was now in\nsilence; but from the drawing-room there came sounds.\n\nAll that she could at first distinguish of them was one syllable,\ncontinually repeated in a low note of moaning, as if it came from a\nsoul bound to some Ixionian wheel—\n\n“O—O—O!”\n\nThen a silence, then a heavy sigh, and again—\n\n“O—O—O!”\n\nThe landlady looked through the keyhole. Only a small space of the room\ninside was visible, but within that space came a corner of the\nbreakfast table, which was already spread for the meal, and also a\nchair beside. Over the seat of the chair Tess’s face was bowed, her\nposture being a kneeling one in front of it; her hands were clasped\nover her head, the skirts of her dressing-gown and the embroidery of\nher night-gown flowed upon the floor behind her, and her stockingless\nfeet, from which the slippers had fallen, protruded upon the carpet. It\nwas from her lips that came the murmur of unspeakable despair.\n\nThen a man’s voice from the adjoining bedroom—\n\n“What’s the matter?”\n\nShe did not answer, but went on, in a tone which was a soliloquy rather\nthan an exclamation, and a dirge rather than a soliloquy. Mrs Brooks\ncould only catch a portion:\n\n“And then my dear, dear husband came home to me ... and I did not know\nit!... And you had used your cruel persuasion upon me ... you did not\nstop using it—no—you did not stop! My little sisters and brothers and\nmy mother’s needs—they were the things you moved me by ... and you said\nmy husband would never come back—never; and you taunted me, and said\nwhat a simpleton I was to expect him!... And at last I believed you and\ngave way!... And then he came back! Now he is gone. Gone a second time,\nand I have lost him now for ever ... and he will not love me the\nlittlest bit ever any more—only hate me!... O yes, I have lost him\nnow—again because of—you!” In writhing, with her head on the chair, she\nturned her face towards the door, and Mrs Brooks could see the pain\nupon it, and that her lips were bleeding from the clench of her teeth\nupon them, and that the long lashes of her closed eyes stuck in wet\ntags to her cheeks. She continued: “And he is dying—he looks as if he\nis dying!... And my sin will kill him and not kill me!... O, you have\ntorn my life all to pieces ... made me be what I prayed you in pity not\nto make me be again!... My own true husband will never, never—O God—I\ncan’t bear this!—I cannot!”\n\nThere were more and sharper words from the man; then a sudden rustle;\nshe had sprung to her feet. Mrs Brooks, thinking that the speaker was\ncoming to rush out of the door, hastily retreated down the stairs.\n\nShe need not have done so, however, for the door of the sitting-room\nwas not opened. But Mrs Brooks felt it unsafe to watch on the landing\nagain, and entered her own parlour below.\n\nShe could hear nothing through the floor, although she listened\nintently, and thereupon went to the kitchen to finish her interrupted\nbreakfast. Coming up presently to the front room on the ground floor\nshe took up some sewing, waiting for her lodgers to ring that she might\ntake away the breakfast, which she meant to do herself, to discover\nwhat was the matter if possible. Overhead, as she sat, she could now\nhear the floorboards slightly creak, as if some one were walking about,\nand presently the movement was explained by the rustle of garments\nagainst the banisters, the opening and the closing of the front door,\nand the form of Tess passing to the gate on her way into the street.\nShe was fully dressed now in the walking costume of a well-to-do young\nlady in which she had arrived, with the sole addition that over her hat\nand black feathers a veil was drawn.\n\nMrs Brooks had not been able to catch any word of farewell, temporary\nor otherwise, between her tenants at the door above. They might have\nquarrelled, or Mr d’Urberville might still be asleep, for he was not an\nearly riser.\n\nShe went into the back room, which was more especially her own\napartment, and continued her sewing there. The lady lodger did not\nreturn, nor did the gentleman ring his bell. Mrs Brooks pondered on the\ndelay, and on what probable relation the visitor who had called so\nearly bore to the couple upstairs. In reflecting she leant back in her\nchair.\n\nAs she did so her eyes glanced casually over the ceiling till they were\narrested by a spot in the middle of its white surface which she had\nnever noticed there before. It was about the size of a wafer when she\nfirst observed it, but it speedily grew as large as the palm of her\nhand, and then she could perceive that it was red. The oblong white\nceiling, with this scarlet blot in the midst, had the appearance of a\ngigantic ace of hearts.\n\nMrs Brooks had strange qualms of misgiving. She got upon the table, and\ntouched the spot in the ceiling with her fingers. It was damp, and she\nfancied that it was a blood stain.\n\nDescending from the table, she left the parlour, and went upstairs,\nintending to enter the room overhead, which was the bedchamber at the\nback of the drawing-room. But, nerveless woman as she had now become,\nshe could not bring herself to attempt the handle. She listened. The\ndead silence within was broken only by a regular beat.\n\nDrip, drip, drip.\n\nMrs Brooks hastened downstairs, opened the front door, and ran into the\nstreet. A man she knew, one of the workmen employed at an adjoining\nvilla, was passing by, and she begged him to come in and go upstairs\nwith her; she feared something had happened to one of her lodgers. The\nworkman assented, and followed her to the landing.\n\nShe opened the door of the drawing-room, and stood back for him to pass\nin, entering herself behind him. The room was empty; the breakfast—a\nsubstantial repast of coffee, eggs, and a cold ham—lay spread upon the\ntable untouched, as when she had taken it up, excepting that the\ncarving-knife was missing. She asked the man to go through the\nfolding-doors into the adjoining room.\n\nHe opened the doors, entered a step or two, and came back almost\ninstantly with a rigid face. “My good God, the gentleman in bed is\ndead! I think he has been hurt with a knife—a lot of blood has run down\nupon the floor!”\n\nThe alarm was soon given, and the house which had lately been so quiet\nresounded with the tramp of many footsteps, a surgeon among the rest.\nThe wound was small, but the point of the blade had touched the heart\nof the victim, who lay on his back, pale, fixed, dead, as if he had\nscarcely moved after the infliction of the blow. In a quarter of an\nhour the news that a gentleman who was a temporary visitor to the town\nhad been stabbed in his bed, spread through every street and villa of\nthe popular watering-place.\n\n\nLVII\n\nMeanwhile Angel Clare had walked automatically along the way by which\nhe had come, and, entering his hotel, sat down over the breakfast,\nstaring at nothingness. He went on eating and drinking unconsciously\ntill on a sudden he demanded his bill; having paid which, he took his\ndressing-bag in his hand, the only luggage he had brought with him, and\nwent out.\n\nAt the moment of his departure a telegram was handed to him—a few words\nfrom his mother, stating that they were glad to know his address, and\ninforming him that his brother Cuthbert had proposed to and been\naccepted by Mercy Chant.\n\nClare crumpled up the paper and followed the route to the station;\nreaching it, he found that there would be no train leaving for an hour\nand more. He sat down to wait, and having waited a quarter of an hour\nfelt that he could wait there no longer. Broken in heart and numbed, he\nhad nothing to hurry for; but he wished to get out of a town which had\nbeen the scene of such an experience, and turned to walk to the first\nstation onward, and let the train pick him up there.\n\nThe highway that he followed was open, and at a little distance dipped\ninto a valley, across which it could be seen running from edge to edge.\nHe had traversed the greater part of this depression, and was climbing\nthe western acclivity when, pausing for breath, he unconsciously looked\nback. Why he did so he could not say, but something seemed to impel him\nto the act. The tape-like surface of the road diminished in his rear as\nfar as he could see, and as he gazed a moving spot intruded on the\nwhite vacuity of its perspective.\n\nIt was a human figure running. Clare waited, with a dim sense that\nsomebody was trying to overtake him.\n\nThe form descending the incline was a woman’s, yet so entirely was his\nmind blinded to the idea of his wife’s following him that even when she\ncame nearer he did not recognize her under the totally changed attire\nin which he now beheld her. It was not till she was quite close that he\ncould believe her to be Tess.\n\n“I saw you—turn away from the station—just before I got there—and I\nhave been following you all this way!”\n\nShe was so pale, so breathless, so quivering in every muscle, that he\ndid not ask her a single question, but seizing her hand, and pulling it\nwithin his arm, he led her along. To avoid meeting any possible\nwayfarers he left the high road and took a footpath under some\nfir-trees. When they were deep among the moaning boughs he stopped and\nlooked at her inquiringly.\n\n“Angel,” she said, as if waiting for this, “do you know what I have\nbeen running after you for? To tell you that I have killed him!” A\npitiful white smile lit her face as she spoke.\n\n“What!” said he, thinking from the strangeness of her manner that she\nwas in some delirium.\n\n“I have done it—I don’t know how,” she continued. “Still, I owed it to\nyou, and to myself, Angel. I feared long ago, when I struck him on the\nmouth with my glove, that I might do it some day for the trap he set\nfor me in my simple youth, and his wrong to you through me. He has come\nbetween us and ruined us, and now he can never do it any more. I never\nloved him at all, Angel, as I loved you. You know it, don’t you? You\nbelieve it? You didn’t come back to me, and I was obliged to go back to\nhim. Why did you go away—why did you—when I loved you so? I can’t think\nwhy you did it. But I don’t blame you; only, Angel, will you forgive me\nmy sin against you, now I have killed him? I thought as I ran along\nthat you would be sure to forgive me now I have done that. It came to\nme as a shining light that I should get you back that way. I could not\nbear the loss of you any longer—you don’t know how entirely I was\nunable to bear your not loving me! Say you do now, dear, dear husband;\nsay you do, now I have killed him!”\n\n“I do love you, Tess—O, I do—it is all come back!” he said, tightening\nhis arms round her with fervid pressure. “But how do you mean—you have\nkilled him?”\n\n“I mean that I have,” she murmured in a reverie.\n\n“What, bodily? Is he dead?”\n\n“Yes. He heard me crying about you, and he bitterly taunted me; and\ncalled you by a foul name; and then I did it. My heart could not bear\nit. He had nagged me about you before. And then I dressed myself and\ncame away to find you.”\n\nBy degrees he was inclined to believe that she had faintly attempted,\nat least, what she said she had done; and his horror at her impulse was\nmixed with amazement at the strength of her affection for himself, and\nat the strangeness of its quality, which had apparently extinguished\nher moral sense altogether. Unable to realize the gravity of her\nconduct, she seemed at last content; and he looked at her as she lay\nupon his shoulder, weeping with happiness, and wondered what obscure\nstrain in the d’Urberville blood had led to this aberration—if it were\nan aberration. There momentarily flashed through his mind that the\nfamily tradition of the coach and murder might have arisen because the\nd’Urbervilles had been known to do these things. As well as his\nconfused and excited ideas could reason, he supposed that in the moment\nof mad grief of which she spoke, her mind had lost its balance, and\nplunged her into this abyss.\n\nIt was very terrible if true; if a temporary hallucination, sad. But,\nanyhow, here was this deserted wife of his, this passionately-fond\nwoman, clinging to him without a suspicion that he would be anything to\nher but a protector. He saw that for him to be otherwise was not, in\nher mind, within the region of the possible. Tenderness was absolutely\ndominant in Clare at last. He kissed her endlessly with his white lips,\nand held her hand, and said—\n\n“I will not desert you! I will protect you by every means in my power,\ndearest love, whatever you may have done or not have done!”\n\nThey then walked on under the trees, Tess turning her head every now\nand then to look at him. Worn and unhandsome as he had become, it was\nplain that she did not discern the least fault in his appearance. To\nher he was, as of old, all that was perfection, personally and\nmentally. He was still her Antinous, her Apollo even; his sickly face\nwas beautiful as the morning to her affectionate regard on this day no\nless than when she first beheld him; for was it not the face of the one\nman on earth who had loved her purely, and who had believed in her as\npure!\n\nWith an instinct as to possibilities, he did not now, as he had\nintended, make for the first station beyond the town, but plunged still\nfarther under the firs, which here abounded for miles. Each clasping\nthe other round the waist they promenaded over the dry bed of\nfir-needles, thrown into a vague intoxicating atmosphere at the\nconsciousness of being together at last, with no living soul between\nthem; ignoring that there was a corpse. Thus they proceeded for several\nmiles till Tess, arousing herself, looked about her, and said, timidly—\n\n“Are we going anywhere in particular?”\n\n“I don’t know, dearest. Why?”\n\n“I don’t know.”\n\n“Well, we might walk a few miles further, and when it is evening find\nlodgings somewhere or other—in a lonely cottage, perhaps. Can you walk\nwell, Tessy?”\n\n“O yes! I could walk for ever and ever with your arm round me!”\n\nUpon the whole it seemed a good thing to do. Thereupon they quickened\ntheir pace, avoiding high roads, and following obscure paths tending\nmore or less northward. But there was an unpractical vagueness in their\nmovements throughout the day; neither one of them seemed to consider\nany question of effectual escape, disguise, or long concealment. Their\nevery idea was temporary and unforefending, like the plans of two\nchildren.\n\nAt mid-day they drew near to a roadside inn, and Tess would have\nentered it with him to get something to eat, but he persuaded her to\nremain among the trees and bushes of this half-woodland, half-moorland\npart of the country till he should come back. Her clothes were of\nrecent fashion; even the ivory-handled parasol that she carried was of\na shape unknown in the retired spot to which they had now wandered; and\nthe cut of such articles would have attracted attention in the settle\nof a tavern. He soon returned, with food enough for half-a-dozen people\nand two bottles of wine—enough to last them for a day or more, should\nany emergency arise.\n\nThey sat down upon some dead boughs and shared their meal. Between one\nand two o’clock they packed up the remainder and went on again.\n\n“I feel strong enough to walk any distance,” said she.\n\n“I think we may as well steer in a general way towards the interior of\nthe country, where we can hide for a time, and are less likely to be\nlooked for than anywhere near the coast,” Clare remarked. “Later on,\nwhen they have forgotten us, we can make for some port.”\n\nShe made no reply to this beyond that of grasping him more tightly, and\nstraight inland they went. Though the season was an English May, the\nweather was serenely bright, and during the afternoon it was quite\nwarm. Through the latter miles of their walk their footpath had taken\nthem into the depths of the New Forest, and towards evening, turning\nthe corner of a lane, they perceived behind a brook and bridge a large\nboard on which was painted in white letters, “This desirable Mansion to\nbe Let Furnished”; particulars following, with directions to apply to\nsome London agents. Passing through the gate they could see the house,\nan old brick building of regular design and large accommodation.\n\n“I know it,” said Clare. “It is Bramshurst Court. You can see that it\nis shut up, and grass is growing on the drive.”\n\n“Some of the windows are open,” said Tess.\n\n“Just to air the rooms, I suppose.”\n\n“All these rooms empty, and we without a roof to our heads!”\n\n“You are getting tired, my Tess!” he said. “We’ll stop soon.” And\nkissing her sad mouth, he again led her onwards.\n\nHe was growing weary likewise, for they had wandered a dozen or fifteen\nmiles, and it became necessary to consider what they should do for\nrest. They looked from afar at isolated cottages and little inns, and\nwere inclined to approach one of the latter, when their hearts failed\nthem, and they sheered off. At length their gait dragged, and they\nstood still.\n\n“Could we sleep under the trees?” she asked.\n\nHe thought the season insufficiently advanced.\n\n“I have been thinking of that empty mansion we passed,” he said. “Let\nus go back towards it again.”\n\nThey retraced their steps, but it was half an hour before they stood\nwithout the entrance-gate as earlier. He then requested her to stay\nwhere she was, whilst he went to see who was within.\n\nShe sat down among the bushes within the gate, and Clare crept towards\nthe house. His absence lasted some considerable time, and when he\nreturned Tess was wildly anxious, not for herself, but for him. He had\nfound out from a boy that there was only an old woman in charge as\ncaretaker, and she only came there on fine days, from the hamlet near,\nto open and shut the windows. She would come to shut them at sunset.\n“Now, we can get in through one of the lower windows, and rest there,”\nsaid he.\n\nUnder his escort she went tardily forward to the main front, whose\nshuttered windows, like sightless eyeballs, excluded the possibility of\nwatchers. The door was reached a few steps further, and one of the\nwindows beside it was open. Clare clambered in, and pulled Tess in\nafter him.\n\nExcept the hall, the rooms were all in darkness, and they ascended the\nstaircase. Up here also the shutters were tightly closed, the\nventilation being perfunctorily done, for this day at least, by opening\nthe hall-window in front and an upper window behind. Clare unlatched\nthe door of a large chamber, felt his way across it, and parted the\nshutters to the width of two or three inches. A shaft of dazzling\nsunlight glanced into the room, revealing heavy, old-fashioned\nfurniture, crimson damask hangings, and an enormous four-post bedstead,\nalong the head of which were carved running figures, apparently\nAtalanta’s race.\n\n“Rest at last!” said he, setting down his bag and the parcel of viands.\n\nThey remained in great quietness till the caretaker should have come to\nshut the windows: as a precaution, putting themselves in total darkness\nby barring the shutters as before, lest the woman should open the door\nof their chamber for any casual reason. Between six and seven o’clock\nshe came, but did not approach the wing they were in. They heard her\nclose the windows, fasten them, lock the door, and go away. Then Clare\nagain stole a chink of light from the window, and they shared another\nmeal, till by-and-by they were enveloped in the shades of night which\nthey had no candle to disperse.\n\n\nLVIII\n\nThe night was strangely solemn and still. In the small hours she\nwhispered to him the whole story of how he had walked in his sleep with\nher in his arms across the Froom stream, at the imminent risk of both\ntheir lives, and laid her down in the stone coffin at the ruined abbey.\nHe had never known of that till now.\n\n“Why didn’t you tell me next day?” he said. “It might have prevented\nmuch misunderstanding and woe.”\n\n“Don’t think of what’s past!” said she. “I am not going to think\noutside of now. Why should we! Who knows what to-morrow has in store?”\n\nBut it apparently had no sorrow. The morning was wet and foggy, and\nClare, rightly informed that the caretaker only opened the windows on\nfine days, ventured to creep out of their chamber and explore the\nhouse, leaving Tess asleep. There was no food on the premises, but\nthere was water, and he took advantage of the fog to emerge from the\nmansion and fetch tea, bread, and butter from a shop in a little place\ntwo miles beyond, as also a small tin kettle and spirit-lamp, that they\nmight get fire without smoke. His re-entry awoke her; and they\nbreakfasted on what he had brought.\n\nThey were indisposed to stir abroad, and the day passed, and the night\nfollowing, and the next, and next; till, almost without their being\naware, five days had slipped by in absolute seclusion, not a sight or\nsound of a human being disturbing their peacefulness, such as it was.\nThe changes of the weather were their only events, the birds of the New\nForest their only company. By tacit consent they hardly once spoke of\nany incident of the past subsequent to their wedding-day. The gloomy\nintervening time seemed to sink into chaos, over which the present and\nprior times closed as if it never had been. Whenever he suggested that\nthey should leave their shelter, and go forwards towards Southampton or\nLondon, she showed a strange unwillingness to move.\n\n“Why should we put an end to all that’s sweet and lovely!” she\ndeprecated. “What must come will come.” And, looking through the\nshutter-chink: “All is trouble outside there; inside here content.”\n\nHe peeped out also. It was quite true; within was affection, union,\nerror forgiven: outside was the inexorable.\n\n“And—and,” she said, pressing her cheek against his, “I fear that what\nyou think of me now may not last. I do not wish to outlive your present\nfeeling for me. I would rather not. I would rather be dead and buried\nwhen the time comes for you to despise me, so that it may never be\nknown to me that you despised me.”\n\n“I cannot ever despise you.”\n\n“I also hope that. But considering what my life has been, I cannot see\nwhy any man should, sooner or later, be able to help despising me....\nHow wickedly mad I was! Yet formerly I never could bear to hurt a fly\nor a worm, and the sight of a bird in a cage used often to make me\ncry.”\n\nThey remained yet another day. In the night the dull sky cleared, and\nthe result was that the old caretaker at the cottage awoke early. The\nbrilliant sunrise made her unusually brisk; she decided to open the\ncontiguous mansion immediately, and to air it thoroughly on such a day.\nThus it occurred that, having arrived and opened the lower rooms before\nsix o’clock, she ascended to the bedchambers, and was about to turn the\nhandle of the one wherein they lay. At that moment she fancied she\ncould hear the breathing of persons within. Her slippers and her\nantiquity had rendered her progress a noiseless one so far, and she\nmade for instant retreat; then, deeming that her hearing might have\ndeceived her, she turned anew to the door and softly tried the handle.\nThe lock was out of order, but a piece of furniture had been moved\nforward on the inside, which prevented her opening the door more than\nan inch or two. A stream of morning light through the shutter-chink\nfell upon the faces of the pair, wrapped in profound slumber, Tess’s\nlips being parted like a half-opened flower near his cheek. The\ncaretaker was so struck with their innocent appearance, and with the\nelegance of Tess’s gown hanging across a chair, her silk stockings\nbeside it, the pretty parasol, and the other habits in which she had\narrived because she had none else, that her first indignation at the\neffrontery of tramps and vagabonds gave way to a momentary\nsentimentality over this genteel elopement, as it seemed. She closed\nthe door, and withdrew as softly as she had come, to go and consult\nwith her neighbours on the odd discovery.\n\nNot more than a minute had elapsed after her withdrawal when Tess woke,\nand then Clare. Both had a sense that something had disturbed them,\nthough they could not say what; and the uneasy feeling which it\nengendered grew stronger. As soon as he was dressed he narrowly scanned\nthe lawn through the two or three inches of shutter-chink.\n\n“I think we will leave at once,” said he. “It is a fine day. And I\ncannot help fancying somebody is about the house. At any rate, the\nwoman will be sure to come to-day.”\n\nShe passively assented, and putting the room in order, they took up the\nfew articles that belonged to them, and departed noiselessly. When they\nhad got into the Forest she turned to take a last look at the house.\n\n“Ah, happy house—goodbye!” she said. “My life can only be a question of\na few weeks. Why should we not have stayed there?”\n\n“Don’t say it, Tess! We shall soon get out of this district altogether.\nWe’ll continue our course as we’ve begun it, and keep straight north.\nNobody will think of looking for us there. We shall be looked for at\nthe Wessex ports if we are sought at all. When we are in the north we\nwill get to a port and away.”\n\nHaving thus persuaded her, the plan was pursued, and they kept a\nbee-line northward. Their long repose at the manor-house lent them\nwalking power now; and towards mid-day they found that they were\napproaching the steepled city of Melchester, which lay directly in\ntheir way. He decided to rest her in a clump of trees during the\nafternoon, and push onward under cover of darkness. At dusk Clare\npurchased food as usual, and their night march began, the boundary\nbetween Upper and Mid-Wessex being crossed about eight o’clock.\n\nTo walk across country without much regard to roads was not new to\nTess, and she showed her old agility in the performance. The\nintercepting city, ancient Melchester, they were obliged to pass\nthrough in order to take advantage of the town bridge for crossing a\nlarge river that obstructed them. It was about midnight when they went\nalong the deserted streets, lighted fitfully by the few lamps, keeping\noff the pavement that it might not echo their footsteps. The graceful\npile of cathedral architecture rose dimly on their left hand, but it\nwas lost upon them now. Once out of the town they followed the\nturnpike-road, which after a few miles plunged across an open plain.\n\nThough the sky was dense with cloud, a diffused light from some\nfragment of a moon had hitherto helped them a little. But the moon had\nnow sunk, the clouds seemed to settle almost on their heads, and the\nnight grew as dark as a cave. However, they found their way along,\nkeeping as much on the turf as possible that their tread might not\nresound, which it was easy to do, there being no hedge or fence of any\nkind. All around was open loneliness and black solitude, over which a\nstiff breeze blew.\n\nThey had proceeded thus gropingly two or three miles further when on a\nsudden Clare became conscious of some vast erection close in his front,\nrising sheer from the grass. They had almost struck themselves against\nit.\n\n“What monstrous place is this?” said Angel.\n\n“It hums,” said she. “Hearken!”\n\nHe listened. The wind, playing upon the edifice, produced a booming\ntune, like the note of some gigantic one-stringed harp. No other sound\ncame from it, and lifting his hand and advancing a step or two, Clare\nfelt the vertical surface of the structure. It seemed to be of solid\nstone, without joint or moulding. Carrying his fingers onward he found\nthat what he had come in contact with was a colossal rectangular\npillar; by stretching out his left hand he could feel a similar one\nadjoining. At an indefinite height overhead something made the black\nsky blacker, which had the semblance of a vast architrave uniting the\npillars horizontally. They carefully entered beneath and between; the\nsurfaces echoed their soft rustle; but they seemed to be still out of\ndoors. The place was roofless. Tess drew her breath fearfully, and\nAngel, perplexed, said—\n\n“What can it be?”\n\nFeeling sideways they encountered another tower-like pillar, square and\nuncompromising as the first; beyond it another and another. The place\nwas all doors and pillars, some connected above by continuous\narchitraves.\n\n“A very Temple of the Winds,” he said.\n\nThe next pillar was isolated; others composed a trilithon; others were\nprostrate, their flanks forming a causeway wide enough for a carriage;\nand it was soon obvious that they made up a forest of monoliths grouped\nupon the grassy expanse of the plain. The couple advanced further into\nthis pavilion of the night till they stood in its midst.\n\n“It is Stonehenge!” said Clare.\n\n“The heathen temple, you mean?”\n\n“Yes. Older than the centuries; older than the d’Urbervilles! Well,\nwhat shall we do, darling? We may find shelter further on.”\n\nBut Tess, really tired by this time, flung herself upon an oblong slab\nthat lay close at hand, and was sheltered from the wind by a pillar.\nOwing to the action of the sun during the preceding day, the stone was\nwarm and dry, in comforting contrast to the rough and chill grass\naround, which had damped her skirts and shoes.\n\n“I don’t want to go any further, Angel,” she said, stretching out her\nhand for his. “Can’t we bide here?”\n\n“I fear not. This spot is visible for miles by day, although it does\nnot seem so now.”\n\n“One of my mother’s people was a shepherd hereabouts, now I think of\nit. And you used to say at Talbothays that I was a heathen. So now I am\nat home.”\n\nHe knelt down beside her outstretched form, and put his lips upon hers.\n\n“Sleepy are you, dear? I think you are lying on an altar.”\n\n“I like very much to be here,” she murmured. “It is so solemn and\nlonely—after my great happiness—with nothing but the sky above my face.\nIt seems as if there were no folk in the world but we two; and I wish\nthere were not—except ’Liza-Lu.”\n\nClare though she might as well rest here till it should get a little\nlighter, and he flung his overcoat upon her, and sat down by her side.\n\n“Angel, if anything happens to me, will you watch over ’Liza-Lu for my\nsake?” she asked, when they had listened a long time to the wind among\nthe pillars.\n\n“I will.”\n\n“She is so good and simple and pure. O, Angel—I wish you would marry\nher if you lose me, as you will do shortly. O, if you would!”\n\n“If I lose you I lose all! And she is my sister-in-law.”\n\n“That’s nothing, dearest. People marry sister-laws continually about\nMarlott; and ’Liza-Lu is so gentle and sweet, and she is growing so\nbeautiful. O, I could share you with her willingly when we are spirits!\nIf you would train her and teach her, Angel, and bring her up for your\nown self!... She had all the best of me without the bad of me; and if\nshe were to become yours it would almost seem as if death had not\ndivided us... Well, I have said it. I won’t mention it again.”\n\nShe ceased, and he fell into thought. In the far north-east sky he\ncould see between the pillars a level streak of light. The uniform\nconcavity of black cloud was lifting bodily like the lid of a pot,\nletting in at the earth’s edge the coming day, against which the\ntowering monoliths and trilithons began to be blackly defined.\n\n“Did they sacrifice to God here?” asked she.\n\n“No,” said he.\n\n“Who to?”\n\n“I believe to the sun. That lofty stone set away by itself is in the\ndirection of the sun, which will presently rise behind it.”\n\n“This reminds me, dear,” she said. “You remember you never would\ninterfere with any belief of mine before we were married? But I knew\nyour mind all the same, and I thought as you thought—not from any\nreasons of my own, but because you thought so. Tell me now, Angel, do\nyou think we shall meet again after we are dead? I want to know.”\n\nHe kissed her to avoid a reply at such a time.\n\n“O, Angel—I fear that means no!” said she, with a suppressed sob. “And\nI wanted so to see you again—so much, so much! What—not even you and I,\nAngel, who love each other so well?”\n\nLike a greater than himself, to the critical question at the critical\ntime he did not answer; and they were again silent. In a minute or two\nher breathing became more regular, her clasp of his hand relaxed, and\nshe fell asleep. The band of silver paleness along the east horizon\nmade even the distant parts of the Great Plain appear dark and near;\nand the whole enormous landscape bore that impress of reserve,\ntaciturnity, and hesitation which is usual just before day. The\neastward pillars and their architraves stood up blackly against the\nlight, and the great flame-shaped Sun-stone beyond them; and the Stone\nof Sacrifice midway. Presently the night wind died out, and the\nquivering little pools in the cup-like hollows of the stones lay still.\nAt the same time something seemed to move on the verge of the dip\neastward—a mere dot. It was the head of a man approaching them from the\nhollow beyond the Sun-stone. Clare wished they had gone onward, but in\nthe circumstances decided to remain quiet. The figure came straight\ntowards the circle of pillars in which they were.\n\nHe heard something behind him, the brush of feet. Turning, he saw over\nthe prostrate columns another figure; then before he was aware, another\nwas at hand on the right, under a trilithon, and another on the left.\nThe dawn shone full on the front of the man westward, and Clare could\ndiscern from this that he was tall, and walked as if trained. They all\nclosed in with evident purpose. Her story then was true! Springing to\nhis feet, he looked around for a weapon, loose stone, means of escape,\nanything. By this time the nearest man was upon him.\n\n“It is no use, sir,” he said. “There are sixteen of us on the Plain,\nand the whole country is reared.”\n\n“Let her finish her sleep!” he implored in a whisper of the men as they\ngathered round.\n\nWhen they saw where she lay, which they had not done till then, they\nshowed no objection, and stood watching her, as still as the pillars\naround. He went to the stone and bent over her, holding one poor little\nhand; her breathing now was quick and small, like that of a lesser\ncreature than a woman. All waited in the growing light, their faces and\nhands as if they were silvered, the remainder of their figures dark,\nthe stones glistening green-gray, the Plain still a mass of shade. Soon\nthe light was strong, and a ray shone upon her unconscious form,\npeering under her eyelids and waking her.\n\n“What is it, Angel?” she said, starting up. “Have they come for me?”\n\n“Yes, dearest,” he said. “They have come.”\n\n“It is as it should be,” she murmured. “Angel, I am almost glad—yes,\nglad! This happiness could not have lasted. It was too much. I have had\nenough; and now I shall not live for you to despise me!”\n\nShe stood up, shook herself, and went forward, neither of the men\nhaving moved.\n\n“I am ready,” she said quietly.\n\n\nLIX\n\nThe city of Wintoncester, that fine old city, aforetime capital of\nWessex, lay amidst its convex and concave downlands in all the\nbrightness and warmth of a July morning. The gabled brick, tile, and\nfreestone houses had almost dried off for the season their integument\nof lichen, the streams in the meadows were low, and in the sloping High\nStreet, from the West Gateway to the mediæval cross, and from the\nmediæval cross to the bridge, that leisurely dusting and sweeping was\nin progress which usually ushers in an old-fashioned market-day.\n\nFrom the western gate aforesaid the highway, as every Wintoncestrian\nknows, ascends a long and regular incline of the exact length of a\nmeasured mile, leaving the houses gradually behind. Up this road from\nthe precincts of the city two persons were walking rapidly, as if\nunconscious of the trying ascent—unconscious through preoccupation and\nnot through buoyancy. They had emerged upon this road through a narrow,\nbarred wicket in a high wall a little lower down. They seemed anxious\nto get out of the sight of the houses and of their kind, and this road\nappeared to offer the quickest means of doing so. Though they were\nyoung, they walked with bowed heads, which gait of grief the sun’s rays\nsmiled on pitilessly.\n\nOne of the pair was Angel Clare, the other a tall budding creature—half\ngirl, half woman—a spiritualized image of Tess, slighter than she, but\nwith the same beautiful eyes—Clare’s sister-in-law, ’Liza-Lu. Their\npale faces seemed to have shrunk to half their natural size. They moved\non hand in hand, and never spoke a word, the drooping of their heads\nbeing that of Giotto’s “Two Apostles”.\n\nWhen they had nearly reached the top of the great West Hill the clocks\nin the town struck eight. Each gave a start at the notes, and, walking\nonward yet a few steps, they reached the first milestone, standing\nwhitely on the green margin of the grass, and backed by the down, which\nhere was open to the road. They entered upon the turf, and, impelled by\na force that seemed to overrule their will, suddenly stood still,\nturned, and waited in paralyzed suspense beside the stone.\n\nThe prospect from this summit was almost unlimited. In the valley\nbeneath lay the city they had just left, its more prominent buildings\nshowing as in an isometric drawing—among them the broad cathedral\ntower, with its Norman windows and immense length of aisle and nave,\nthe spires of St Thomas’s, the pinnacled tower of the College, and,\nmore to the right, the tower and gables of the ancient hospice, where\nto this day the pilgrim may receive his dole of bread and ale. Behind\nthe city swept the rotund upland of St Catherine’s Hill; further off,\nlandscape beyond landscape, till the horizon was lost in the radiance\nof the sun hanging above it.\n\nAgainst these far stretches of country rose, in front of the other city\nedifices, a large red-brick building, with level gray roofs, and rows\nof short barred windows bespeaking captivity, the whole contrasting\ngreatly by its formalism with the quaint irregularities of the Gothic\nerections. It was somewhat disguised from the road in passing it by\nyews and evergreen oaks, but it was visible enough up here. The wicket\nfrom which the pair had lately emerged was in the wall of this\nstructure. From the middle of the building an ugly flat-topped\noctagonal tower ascended against the east horizon, and viewed from this\nspot, on its shady side and against the light, it seemed the one blot\non the city’s beauty. Yet it was with this blot, and not with the\nbeauty, that the two gazers were concerned.\n\nUpon the cornice of the tower a tall staff was fixed. Their eyes were\nriveted on it. A few minutes after the hour had struck something moved\nslowly up the staff, and extended itself upon the breeze. It was a\nblack flag.\n\n“Justice” was done, and the President of the Immortals, in Æschylean\nphrase, had ended his sport with Tess. And the d’Urberville knights and\ndames slept on in their tombs unknowing. The two speechless gazers bent\nthemselves down to the earth, as if in prayer, and remained thus a long\ntime, absolutely motionless: the flag continued to wave silently. As\nsoon as they had strength, they arose, joined hands again, and went on.",
