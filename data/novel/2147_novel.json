And, to signify that peculiar musical quality of Poe’s genius\nwhich inthralls every reader, Mr. Lowell suggested this additional\nverse, from the “Haunted Palace”:\n\n   And all with pearl and ruby glowing\n    Was the fair palace door,\n   Through which came flowing, flowing, flowing,\n    And sparkling ever more,\n   A troop of Echoes, whose sweet duty\n    Was but to sing,\n   In voices of surpassing beauty,\n    The wit and wisdom of their king.\n\n\nBorn in poverty at Boston, January 19, 1809, dying under painful\ncircumstances at Baltimore, October 7, 1849, his whole literary career\nof scarcely fifteen years a pitiful struggle for mere subsistence, his\nmemory malignantly misrepresented by his earliest biographer, Griswold,\nhow completely has truth at last routed falsehood and how magnificently\nhas Poe come into his own. For “The Raven,” first published in 1845,\nand, within a few months, read, recited and parodied wherever the\nEnglish language was spoken, the half-starved poet received $10! Less\nthan a year later his brother poet, N. P. Willis, issued this touching\nappeal to the admirers of genius on behalf of the neglected author, his\ndying wife and her devoted mother, then living under very straitened\ncircumstances in a little cottage at Fordham, N. Y.:\n\n“Here is one of the finest scholars, one of the most original men of\ngenius, and one of the most industrious of the literary profession of\nour country, whose temporary suspension of labor, from bodily illness,\ndrops him immediately to a level with the common objects of public\ncharity. There is no intermediate stopping-place, no respectful shelter,\nwhere, with the delicacy due to genius and culture, he might secure\naid, till, with returning health, he would resume his labors, and his\nunmortified sense of independence.”\n\nAnd this was the tribute paid by the American public to the master who\nhad given to it such tales of conjuring charm, of witchery and mystery\nas “The Fall of the House of Usher” and “Ligeia”; such fascinating\nhoaxes as “The Unparalleled Adventure of Hans Pfaall,” “MSS. Found in a\nBottle,” “A Descent Into a Maelstrom” and “The Balloon-Hoax”; such tales\nof conscience as “William Wilson,” “The Black Cat” and “The Tell-tale\nHeart,” wherein the retributions of remorse are portrayed with an awful\nfidelity; such tales of natural beauty as “The Island of the Fay” and\n“The Domain of Arnheim”; such marvellous studies in ratiocination as the\n“Gold-bug,” “The Murders in the Rue Morgue,” “The Purloined Letter”\n and “The Mystery of Marie Roget,” the latter, a recital of fact,\ndemonstrating the author’s wonderful capability of correctly analyzing\nthe mysteries of the human mind; such tales of illusion and banter\nas “The Premature Burial” and “The System of Dr. Tarr and Professor\nFether”; such bits of extravaganza as “The Devil in the Belfry” and “The\nAngel of the Odd”; such tales of adventure as “The Narrative of Arthur\nGordon Pym”; such papers of keen criticism and review as won for Poe the\nenthusiastic admiration of Charles Dickens, although they made him many\nenemies among the over-puffed minor American writers so mercilessly\nexposed by him; such poems of beauty and melody as “The Bells,” “The\nHaunted Palace,” “Tamerlane,” “The City in the Sea” and “The Raven.”\n What delight for the jaded senses of the reader is this enchanted domain\nof wonder-pieces! What an atmosphere of beauty, music, color! What\nresources of imagination, construction, analysis and absolute art! One\nmight almost sympathize with Sarah Helen Whitman, who, confessing to\na half faith in the old superstition of the significance of anagrams,\nfound, in the transposed letters of Edgar Poe’s name, the words “a\nGod-peer.” His mind, she says, was indeed a “Haunted Palace,” echoing to\nthe footfalls of angels and demons.\n\n“No man,” Poe himself wrote, “has recorded, no man has dared to record,\nthe wonders of his inner life.”\n\nIn these twentieth century days--of lavish recognition--artistic,\npopular and material--of genius, what rewards might not a Poe claim!\n\nEdgar’s father, a son of General David Poe, the American revolutionary\npatriot and friend of Lafayette, had married Mrs. Hopkins, an English\nactress, and, the match meeting with parental disapproval, had himself\ntaken to the stage as a profession. Notwithstanding Mrs. Poe’s beauty\nand talent the young couple had a sorry struggle for existence. When\nEdgar, at the age of two years, was orphaned, the family was in the\nutmost destitution. Apparently the future poet was to be cast upon the\nworld homeless and friendless. But fate decreed that a few glimmers of\nsunshine were to illumine his life, for the little fellow was adopted\nby John Allan, a wealthy merchant of Richmond, Va. A brother and sister,\nthe remaining children, were cared for by others.\n\nIn his new home Edgar found all the luxury and advantages money could\nprovide. He was petted, spoiled and shown off to strangers. In Mrs.\nAllan he found all the affection a childless wife could bestow. Mr.\nAllan took much pride in the captivating, precocious lad. At the age of\nfive the boy recited, with fine effect, passages of English poetry to\nthe visitors at the Allan house.\n\nFrom his eighth to his thirteenth year he attended the Manor House\nschool, at Stoke-Newington, a suburb of London. It was the Rev. Dr.\nBransby, head of the school, whom Poe so quaintly portrayed in “William\nWilson.” Returning to Richmond in 1820 Edgar was sent to the school\nof Professor Joseph H. Clarke. He proved an apt pupil. Years afterward\nProfessor Clarke thus wrote:\n\n“While the other boys wrote mere mechanical verses, Poe wrote genuine\npoetry; the boy was a born poet. As a scholar he was ambitious to\nexcel. He was remarkable for self-respect, without haughtiness. He had\na sensitive and tender heart and would do anything for a friend. His\nnature was entirely free from selfishness.”\n\nAt the age of seventeen Poe entered the University of Virginia at\nCharlottesville. He left that institution after one session. Official\nrecords prove that he was not expelled. On the contrary, he gained\na creditable record as a student, although it is admitted that he\ncontracted debts and had “an ungovernable passion for card-playing.”\n These debts may have led to his quarrel with Mr. Allan which eventually\ncompelled him to make his own way in the world.\n\nEarly in 1827 Poe made his first literary venture. He induced Calvin\nThomas, a poor and youthful printer, to publish a small volume of his\nverses under the title “Tamerlane and Other Poems.” In 1829 we find Poe\nin Baltimore with another manuscript volume of verses, which was soon\npublished. Its title was “Al Aaraaf, Tamerlane and Other Poems.” Neither\nof these ventures seems to have attracted much attention.\n\nSoon after Mrs. Allan’s death, which occurred in 1829, Poe, through\nthe aid of Mr. Allan, secured admission to the United States Military\nAcademy at West Point. Any glamour which may have attached to cadet life\nin Poe’s eyes was speedily lost, for discipline at West Point was never\nso severe nor were the accommodations ever so poor. Poe’s bent was\nmore and more toward literature. Life at the academy daily became\nincreasingly distasteful. Soon he began to purposely neglect his studies\nand to disregard his duties, his aim being to secure his dismissal from\nthe United States service. In this he succeeded. On March 7, 1831, Poe\nfound himself free. Mr. Allan’s second marriage had thrown the lad on\nhis own resources. His literary career was to begin.\n\nPoe’s first genuine victory was won in 1833, when he was the successful\ncompetitor for a prize of $100 offered by a Baltimore periodical for the\nbest prose story. “A MSS. Found in a Bottle” was the winning tale. Poe\nhad submitted six stories in a volume. “Our only difficulty,” says Mr.\nLatrobe, one of the judges, “was in selecting from the rich contents of\nthe volume.”\n\nDuring the fifteen years of his literary life Poe was connected with\nvarious newspapers and magazines in Richmond, Philadelphia and New York.\nHe was faithful, punctual, industrious, thorough. N. P. Willis, who for\nsome time employed Poe as critic and sub-editor on the “Evening Mirror,”\n wrote thus:\n\n“With the highest admiration for Poe’s genius, and a willingness to\nlet it alone for more than ordinary irregularity, we were led by\ncommon report to expect a very capricious attention to his duties, and\noccasionally a scene of violence and difficulty. Time went on,\nhowever, and he was invariably punctual and industrious. We saw but\none presentiment of the man-a quiet, patient, industrious and most\ngentlemanly person.\n\n“We heard, from one who knew him well (what should be stated in all\nmention of his lamentable irregularities), that with a single glass of\nwine his whole nature was reversed, the demon became uppermost, and,\nthough none of the usual signs of intoxication were visible, his will\nwas palpably insane. In this reversed character, we repeat, it was never\nour chance to meet him.”\n\nOn September 22, 1835, Poe married his cousin, Virginia Clemm, in\nBaltimore. She had barely turned thirteen years, Poe himself was but\ntwenty-six. He then was a resident of Richmond and a regular contributor\nto the “Southern Literary Messenger.” It was not until a year later that\nthe bride and her widowed mother followed him thither.\n\nPoe’s devotion to his child-wife was one of the most beautiful features\nof his life. Many of his famous poetic productions were inspired by her\nbeauty and charm. Consumption had marked her for its victim, and the\nconstant efforts of husband and mother were to secure for her all the\ncomfort and happiness their slender means permitted. Virginia died\nJanuary 30, 1847, when but twenty-five years of age. A friend of the\nfamily pictures the death-bed scene--mother and husband trying to impart\nwarmth to her by chafing her hands and her feet, while her pet cat was\nsuffered to nestle upon her bosom for the sake of added warmth.\n\nThese verses from “Annabel Lee,” written by Poe in 1849, the last year\nof his life, tell of his sorrow at the loss of his child-wife:\n\n     I was a child and _she_ was a child,\n      In a kingdom by the sea;\n\n     But we loved with _a _love that was more than love--\n       I and my Annabel Lee;\n\n     With a love that the winged seraphs of heaven\n      Coveted her and me.\n     And this was the reason that, long ago;\n      In this kingdom by the sea.\n     A wind blew out of a cloud, chilling\n      My beautiful Annabel Lee;\n\n     So that her high-born kinsmen came\n      And bore her away from me,\n     To shut her up in a sepulchre\n      In this kingdom by the sea,\n\n\nPoe was connected at various times and in various capacities with the\n“Southern Literary Messenger” in Richmond, Va.; “Graham’s Magazine” and\nthe “Gentleman’s Magazine” in Philadelphia; the “Evening Mirror,” the\n“Broadway Journal,” and “Godey’s Lady’s Book” in New York. Everywhere\nPoe’s life was one of unremitting toil. No tales and poems were ever\nproduced at a greater cost of brain and spirit.\n\nPoe’s initial salary with the “Southern Literary Messenger,” to which\nhe contributed the first drafts of a number of his best-known tales,\nwas $10 a week! Two years later his salary was but $600 a year. Even in\n1844, when his literary reputation was established securely, he wrote to\na friend expressing his pleasure because a magazine to which he was to\ncontribute had agreed to pay him $20 monthly for two pages of criticism.\n\nThose were discouraging times in American literature, but Poe never\nlost faith. He was finally to triumph wherever pre-eminent talents win\nadmirers. His genius has had no better description than in this stanza\nfrom William Winter’s poem, read at the dedication exercises of the\nActors’ Monument to Poe, May 4, 1885, in New York:\n\n     He was the voice of beauty and of woe,\n     Passion and mystery and the dread unknown;\n     Pure as the mountains of perpetual snow,\n     Cold as the icy winds that round them moan,\n     Dark as the caves wherein earth’s thunders groan,\n     Wild as the tempests of the upper sky,\n     Sweet as the faint, far-off celestial tone of angel\n         whispers, fluttering from on high,\n     And tender as love’s tear when youth and beauty die.\n\n\nIn the two and a half score years that have elapsed since Poe’s death\nhe has come fully into his own. For a while Griswold’s malignant\nmisrepresentations colored the public estimate of Poe as man and as\nwriter. But, thanks to J. H. Ingram, W. F. Gill, Eugene Didier, Sarah\nHelen Whitman and others these scandals have been dispelled and Poe is\nseen as he actually was-not as a man without failings, it is true, but\nas the finest and most original genius in American letters. As the\nyears go on his fame increases. His works have been translated into\nmany foreign languages. His is a household name in France and England-in\nfact, the latter nation has often uttered the reproach that Poe’s own\ncountry has been slow to appreciate him. But that reproach, if it ever\nwas warranted, certainly is untrue.\n\n                                     W. H. R.\n\n\n\n\nEDGAR ALLAN POE\n\nBy James Russell Lowell\n\n\nTHE situation of American literature is anomalous. It has no centre, or,\nif it have, it is like that of the sphere of Hermes. It is divided\ninto many systems, each revolving round its several suns, and often\npresenting to the rest only the faint glimmer of a milk-and-water way.\nOur capital city, unlike London or Paris, is not a great central heart\nfrom which life and vigor radiate to the extremities, but resembles more\nan isolated umbilicus stuck down as near as may be to the centre of the\nland, and seeming rather to tell a legend of former usefulness than to\nserve any present need. Boston, New York, Philadelphia, each has its\nliterature almost more distinct than those of the different dialects\nof Germany; and the Young Queen of the West has also one of her own,\nof which some articulate rumor barely has reached us dwellers by the\nAtlantic.\n\nPerhaps there is no task more difficult than the just criticism of\ncontemporary literature. It is even more grateful to give praise where\nit is needed than where it is deserved, and friendship so often seduces\nthe iron stylus of justice into a vague flourish, that she writes what\nseems rather like an epitaph than a criticism. Yet if praise be given\nas an alms, we could not drop so poisonous a one into any man’s hat. The\ncritic’s ink may suffer equally from too large an infusion of nutgalls\nor of sugar. But it is easier to be generous than to be just, and we\nmight readily put faith in that fabulous direction to the hiding place\nof truth, did we judge from the amount of water which we usually find\nmixed with it.\n\nRemarkable experiences are usually confined to the inner life of\nimaginative men, but Mr. Poe’s biography displays a vicissitude and\npeculiarity of interest such as is rarely met with. The offspring of a\nromantic marriage, and left an orphan at an early age, he was adopted\nby Mr. Allan, a wealthy Virginian, whose barren marriage-bed seemed the\nwarranty of a large estate to the young poet.\n\nHaving received a classical education in England, he returned home and\nentered the University of Virginia, where, after an extravagant course,\nfollowed by reformation at the last extremity, he was graduated with\nthe highest honors of his class. Then came a boyish attempt to join the\nfortunes of the insurgent Greeks, which ended at St. Petersburg, where\nhe got into difficulties through want of a passport, from which he\nwas rescued by the American consul and sent home. He now entered the\nmilitary academy at West Point, from which he obtained a dismissal\non hearing of the birth of a son to his adopted father, by a second\nmarriage, an event which cut off his expectations as an heir. The death\nof Mr. Allan, in whose will his name was not mentioned, soon after\nrelieved him of all doubt in this regard, and he committed himself at\nonce to authorship for a support. Previously to this, however, he had\npublished (in 1827) a small volume of poems, which soon ran through\nthree editions, and excited high expectations of its author’s future\ndistinction in the minds of many competent judges.\n\nThat no certain augury can be drawn from a poet’s earliest lispings\nthere are instances enough to prove. Shakespeare’s first poems, though\nbrimful of vigor and youth and picturesqueness, give but a very faint\npromise of the directness, condensation and overflowing moral of his\nmaturer works. Perhaps, however, Shakespeare is hardly a case in\npoint, his “Venus and Adonis” having been published, we believe, in his\ntwenty-sixth year. Milton’s Latin verses show tenderness, a fine eye for\nnature, and a delicate appreciation of classic models, but give no hint\nof the author of a new style in poetry. Pope’s youthful pieces have\nall the sing-song, wholly unrelieved by the glittering malignity\nand eloquent irreligion of his later productions. Collins’ callow\nnamby-pamby died and gave no sign of the vigorous and original genius\nwhich he afterward displayed. We have never thought that the world lost\nmore in the “marvellous boy,” Chatterton, than a very ingenious imitator\nof obscure and antiquated dulness. Where he becomes original (as it is\ncalled), the interest of ingenuity ceases and he becomes stupid. Kirke\nWhite’s promises were indorsed by the respectable name of Mr. Southey,\nbut surely with no authority from Apollo. They have the merit of a\ntraditional piety, which to our mind, if uttered at all, had been less\nobjectionable in the retired closet of a diary, and in the sober raiment\nof prose. They do not clutch hold of the memory with the drowning\npertinacity of Watts; neither have they the interest of his occasional\nsimple, lucky beauty. Burns having fortunately been rescued by his\nhumble station from the contaminating society of the “Best models,”\n wrote well and naturally from the first. Had he been unfortunate enough\nto have had an educated taste, we should have had a series of poems from\nwhich, as from his letters, we could sift here and there a kernel from\nthe mass of chaff. Coleridge’s youthful efforts give no promise whatever\nof that poetical genius which produced at once the wildest, tenderest,\nmost original and most purely imaginative poems of modern times. Byron’s\n“Hours of Idleness” would never find a reader except from an intrepid\nand indefatigable curiosity. In Wordsworth’s first preludings there\nis but a dim foreboding of the creator of an era. From Southey’s early\npoems, a safer augury might have been drawn. They show the patient\ninvestigator, the close student of history, and the unwearied explorer\nof the beauties of predecessors, but they give no assurances of a man\nwho should add aught to stock of household words, or to the rarer\nand more sacred delights of the fireside or the arbor. The earliest\nspecimens of Shelley’s poetic mind already, also, give tokens of that\nethereal sublimation in which the spirit seems to soar above the regions\nof words, but leaves its body, the verse, to be entombed, without hope\nof resurrection, in a mass of them. Cowley is generally instanced as a\nwonder of precocity. But his early insipidities show only a capacity\nfor rhyming and for the metrical arrangement of certain conventional\ncombinations of words, a capacity wholly dependent on a delicate\nphysical organization, and an unhappy memory. An early poem is only\nremarkable when it displays an effort of _reason, _and the rudest verses\nin which we can trace some conception of the ends of poetry, are worth\nall the miracles of smooth juvenile versification. A school-boy, one\nwould say, might acquire the regular see-saw of Pope merely by an\nassociation with the motion of the play-ground tilt.\n\nMr. Poe’s early productions show that he could see through the verse to\nthe spirit beneath, and that he already had a feeling that all the life\nand grace of the one must depend on and be modulated by the will of the\nother. We call them the most remarkable boyish poems that we have\never read. We know of none that can compare with them for maturity of\npurpose, and a nice understanding of the effects of language and metre.\nSuch pieces are only valuable when they display what we can only express\nby the contradictory phrase of _innate experience. _We copy one of the\nshorter poems, written when the author was only fourteen. There is a\nlittle dimness in the filling up, but the grace and symmetry of the\noutline are such as few poets ever attain. There is a smack of ambrosia\nabout it.\n\n     TO HELEN\n\n     Helen, thy beauty is to me\n       Like those Nicean barks of yore,\n     That gently, o’er a perfumed sea,\n       The weary, way-worn wanderer bore\n     To his own native shore.\n\n     On desperate seas long wont to roam,\n       Thy hyacinth hair, thy classic face,\n     Thy Naiad airs have brought me home\n       To the glory that was Greece\n     And the grandeur that was Rome.\n\n     Lo! in yon brilliant window-niche\n       How statue-like I see thee stand!\n     The agate lamp within thy hand,\n       Ah! Psyche, from the regions which\n     Are Holy Land!\n\n\nIt is the tendency of the young poet that impresses us. Here is no\n“withering scorn,” no heart “blighted” ere it has safely got into its\nteens, none of the drawing-room sansculottism which Byron had brought\ninto vogue. All is limpid and serene, with a pleasant dash of the Greek\nHelicon in it. The melody of the whole, too, is remarkable. It is not of\nthat kind which can be demonstrated arithmetically upon the tips of\nthe fingers. It is of that finer sort which the inner ear alone\n_can _estimate. It seems simple, like a Greek column, because of its\nperfection. In a poem named “Ligeia,” under which title he intended\nto personify the music of nature, our boy-poet gives us the following\nexquisite picture:\n\n       Ligeia! Ligeia!\n     My beautiful one,\n       Whose harshest idea\n     Will to melody run,\n       Say, is it thy will,\n     On the breezes to toss,\n       Or, capriciously still,\n     Like the lone albatross,\n       Incumbent on night,\n     As she on the air,\n       To keep watch with delight\n     On the harmony there?\n\nJohn Neal, himself a man of genius, and whose lyre has been too long\ncapriciously silent, appreciated the high merit of these and similar\npassages, and drew a proud horoscope for their author.\n\nMr. Poe had that indescribable something which men have agreed to call\n_genius_. No man could ever tell us precisely what it is, and yet there\nis none who is not inevitably aware of its presence and its power. Let\ntalent writhe and contort itself as it may, it has no such magnetism.\nLarger of bone and sinew it may be, but the wings are wanting. Talent\nsticks fast to earth, and its most perfect works have still one foot of\nclay. Genius claims kindred with the very workings of Nature herself, so\nthat a sunset shall seem like a quotation from Dante, and if Shakespeare\nbe read in the very presence of the sea itself, his verses shall but\nseem nobler for the sublime criticism of ocean. Talent may make friends\nfor itself, but only genius can give to its creations the divine power\nof winning love and veneration. Enthusiasm cannot cling to what itself\nis unenthusiastic, nor will he ever have disciples who has not himself\nimpulsive zeal enough to be a disciple. Great wits are allied to madness\nonly inasmuch as they are possessed and carried away by their demon,\nwhile talent keeps him, as Paracelsus did, securely prisoned in the\npommel of his sword. To the eye of genius, the veil of the spiritual\nworld is ever rent asunder that it may perceive the ministers of good\nand evil who throng continually around it. No man of mere talent ever\nflung his inkstand at the devil.\n\nWhen we say that Mr. Poe had genius, we do not mean to say that he has\nproduced evidence of the highest. But to say that he possesses it at\nall is to say that he needs only zeal, industry, and a reverence for the\ntrust reposed in him, to achieve the proudest triumphs and the greenest\nlaurels. If we may believe the Longinuses and Aristotles of our\nnewspapers, we have quite too many geniuses of the loftiest order to\nrender a place among them at all desirable, whether for its hardness\nof attainment or its seclusion. The highest peak of our Parnassus is,\naccording to these gentlemen, by far the most thickly settled portion\nof the country, a circumstance which must make it an uncomfortable\nresidence for individuals of a poetical temperament, if love of\nsolitude be, as immemorial tradition asserts, a necessary part of their\nidiosyncrasy.\n\nMr. Poe has two of the prime qualities of genius, a faculty of vigorous\nyet minute analysis, and a wonderful fecundity of imagination. The first\nof these faculties is as needful to the artist in words, as a knowledge\nof anatomy is to the artist in colors or in stone. This enables him to\nconceive truly, to maintain a proper relation of parts, and to draw a\ncorrect outline, while the second groups, fills up and colors. Both\nof these Mr. Poe has displayed with singular distinctness in his prose\nworks, the last predominating in his earlier tales, and the first in his\nlater ones. In judging of the merit of an author, and assigning him his\nniche among our household gods, we have a right to regard him from\nour own point of view, and to measure him by our own standard. But,\nin estimating the amount of power displayed in his works, we must be\ngoverned by his own design, and placing them by the side of his own\nideal, find how much is wanting. We differ from Mr. Poe in his opinions\nof the objects of art. He esteems that object to be the creation of\nBeauty, and perhaps it is only in the definition of that word that we\ndisagree with him. But in what we shall say of his writings, we shall\ntake his own standard as our guide. The temple of the god of song is\nequally accessible from every side, and there is room enough in it for\nall who bring offerings, or seek in oracle.\n\nIn his tales, Mr. Poe has chosen to exhibit his power chiefly in that\ndim region which stretches from the very utmost limits of the probable\ninto the weird confines of superstition and unreality. He combines in\na very remarkable manner two faculties which are seldom found united; a\npower of influencing the mind of the reader by the impalpable shadows\nof mystery, and a minuteness of detail which does not leave a pin or\na button unnoticed. Both are, in truth, the natural results of the\npredominating quality of his mind, to which we have before alluded,\nanalysis. It is this which distinguishes the artist. His mind at once\nreaches forward to the effect to be produced. Having resolved to bring\nabout certain emotions in the reader, he makes all subordinate parts\ntend strictly to the common centre. Even his mystery is mathematical\nto his own mind. To him X is a known quantity all along. In any picture\nthat he paints he understands the chemical properties of all his\ncolors. However vague some of his figures may seem, however formless\nthe shadows, to him the outline is as clear and distinct as that of\na geometrical diagram. For this reason Mr. Poe has no sympathy with\nMysticism. The Mystic dwells in the mystery, is enveloped with it; it\ncolors all his thoughts; it affects his optic nerve especially, and the\ncommonest things get a rainbow edging from it. Mr. Poe, on the other\nhand, is a spectator _ab extra_. He analyzes, he dissects, he watches\n\n        “with an eye serene,\n     The very pulse of the machine,”\n\n\nfor such it practically is to him, with wheels and cogs and piston-rods,\nall working to produce a certain end.\n\nThis analyzing tendency of his mind balances the poetical, and by giving\nhim the patience to be minute, enables him to throw a wonderful reality\ninto his most unreal fancies. A monomania he paints with great power. He\nloves to dissect one of these cancers of the mind, and to trace all the\nsubtle ramifications of its roots. In raising images of horror, also,\nhe has strange success, conveying to us sometimes by a dusky hint\nsome terrible _doubt _which is the secret of all horror. He leaves to\nimagination the task of finishing the picture, a task to which only she\nis competent.\n\n     “For much imaginary work was there;\n     Conceit deceitful, so compact, so kind,\n     That for Achilles’ image stood his spear\n     Grasped in an armed hand; himself behind\n     Was left unseen, save to the eye of mind.”\n\nBesides the merit of conception, Mr. Poe’s writings have also that of\nform.\n\nHis style is highly finished, graceful and truly classical. It would be\nhard to find a living author who had displayed such varied powers. As an\nexample of his style we would refer to one of his tales, “The House\nof Usher,” in the first volume of his “Tales of the Grotesque and\nArabesque.” It has a singular charm for us, and we think that no one\ncould read it without being strongly moved by its serene and sombre\nbeauty. Had its author written nothing else, it would alone have been\nenough to stamp him as a man of genius, and the master of a classic\nstyle. In this tale occurs, perhaps, the most beautiful of his poems.\n\nThe great masters of imagination have seldom resorted to the vague and\nthe unreal as sources of effect. They have not used dread and horror\nalone, but only in combination with other qualities, as means of\nsubjugating the fancies of their readers. The loftiest muse has ever a\nhousehold and fireside charm about her. Mr. Poe’s secret lies mainly in\nthe skill with which he has employed the strange fascination of mystery\nand terror. In this his success is so great and striking as to deserve\nthe name of art, not artifice. We cannot call his materials the noblest\nor purest, but we must concede to him the highest merit of construction.\n\nAs a critic, Mr. Poe was aesthetically deficient. Unerring in his\nanalysis of dictions, metres and plots, he seemed wanting in the faculty\nof perceiving the profounder ethics of art. His criticisms are, however,\ndistinguished for scientific precision and coherence of logic. They\nhave the exactness, and at the same time, the coldness of mathematical\ndemonstrations. Yet they stand in strikingly refreshing contrast with\nthe vague generalisms and sharp personalities of the day. If deficient\nin warmth, they are also without the heat of partisanship. They are\nespecially valuable as illustrating the great truth, too generally\noverlooked, that analytic power is a subordinate quality of the critic.\n\nOn the whole, it may be considered certain that Mr. Poe has attained an\nindividual eminence in our literature which he will keep. He has given\nproof of power and originality. He has done that which could only be\ndone once with success or safety, and the imitation or repetition of\nwhich would produce weariness.\n\n\n\n\nDEATH OF EDGAR A. POE\n\nBy N. P. Willis\n\n\nTHE ancient fable of two antagonistic spirits imprisoned in one body,\nequally powerful and having the complete mastery by turns-of one man,\nthat is to say, inhabited by both a devil and an angel seems to\nhave been realized, if all we hear is true, in the character of the\nextraordinary man whose name we have written above. Our own impression\nof the nature of Edgar A. Poe, differs in some important degree,\nhowever, from that which has been generally conveyed in the notices of\nhis death. Let us, before telling what we personally know of him, copy\na graphic and highly finished portraiture, from the pen of Dr. Rufus W.\nGriswold, which appeared in a recent number of the “Tribune”:\n\n“Edgar Allen Poe is dead. He died in Baltimore on Sunday, October 7th.\nThis announcement will startle many, but few will be grieved by it. The\npoet was known, personally or by reputation, in all this country; he had\nreaders in England and in several of the states of Continental Europe;\nbut he had few or no friends; and the regrets for his death will be\nsuggested principally by the consideration that in him literary art has\nlost one of its most brilliant but erratic stars.\n\n“His conversation was at times almost supramortal in its eloquence. His\nvoice was modulated with astonishing skill, and his large and variably\nexpressive eyes looked repose or shot fiery tumult into theirs who\nlistened, while his own face glowed, or was changeless in pallor, as his\nimagination quickened his blood or drew it back frozen to his heart. His\nimagery was from the worlds which no mortals can see but with the vision\nof genius. Suddenly starting from a proposition, exactly and sharply\ndefined, in terms of utmost simplicity and clearness, he rejected the\nforms of customary logic, and by a crystalline process of accretion,\nbuilt up his ocular demonstrations in forms of gloomiest and ghastliest\ngrandeur, or in those of the most airy and delicious beauty, so minutely\nand distinctly, yet so rapidly, that the attention which was yielded\nto him was chained till it stood among his wonderful creations, till he\nhimself dissolved the spell, and brought his hearers back to common\nand base existence, by vulgar fancies or exhibitions of the ignoblest\npassion.\n\n“He was at all times a dreamer dwelling in ideal realms, in heaven or\nhell, peopled with the creatures and the accidents of his brain. He\nwalked the streets, in madness or melancholy, with lips moving in\nindistinct curses, or with eyes upturned in passionate prayer (never for\nhimself, for he felt, or professed to feel, that he was already damned,\nbut) for their happiness who at the moment were objects of his idolatry;\nor with his glances introverted to a heart gnawed with anguish, and with\na face shrouded in gloom, he would brave the wildest storms, and all\nnight, with drenched garments and arms beating the winds and rains,\nwould speak as if the spirits that at such times only could be evoked by\nhim from the Aidenn, close by whose portals his disturbed soul sought to\nforget the ills to which his constitution subjected him--close by the\nAidenn where were those he loved--the Aidenn which he might never see,\nbut in fitful glimpses, as its gates opened to receive the less fiery\nand more happy natures whose destiny to sin did not involve the doom of\ndeath.\n\n“He seemed, except when some fitful pursuit subjugated his will and\nengrossed his faculties, always to bear the memory of some controlling\nsorrow. The remarkable poem of ‘The Raven’ was probably much more nearly\nthan has been supposed, even by those who were very intimate with him, a\nreflection and an echo of his own history. _He_ was that bird’s\n\n     “‘Unhappy master whom unmerciful Disaster\n     Followed fast and followed faster till his songs one burden bore--\n     Till the dirges of his Hope that melancholy burden bore\n          Of ‘Never-never more.’\n\n\n“Every genuine author in a greater or less degree leaves in his works,\nwhatever their design, traces of his personal character: elements of his\nimmortal being, in which the individual survives the person. While we\nread the pages of the ‘Fall of the House of Usher,’ or of ‘Mesmeric\nRevelations,’ we see in the solemn and stately gloom which invests one,\nand in the subtle metaphysical analysis of both, indications of the\nidiosyncrasies of what was most remarkable and peculiar in the author’s\nintellectual nature. But we see here only the better phases of his\nnature, only the symbols of his juster action, for his harsh experience\nhad deprived him of all faith in man or woman. He had made up his mind\nupon the numberless complexities of the social world, and the whole\nsystem with him was an imposture. This conviction gave a direction to\nhis shrewd and naturally unamiable character. Still, though he regarded\nsociety as composed altogether of villains, the sharpness of his\nintellect was not of that kind which enabled him to cope with villany,\nwhile it continually caused him by overshots to fail of the success of\nhonesty. He was in many respects like Francis Vivian in Bulwer’s novel\nof ‘The Caxtons.’ Passion, in him, comprehended--many of the worst\nemotions which militate against human happiness. You could not\ncontradict him, but you raised quick choler; you could not speak of\nwealth, but his cheek paled with gnawing envy. The astonishing natural\nadvantages of this poor boy--his beauty, his readiness, the daring\nspirit that breathed around him like a fiery atmosphere--had raised his\nconstitutional self-confidence into an arrogance that turned his\nvery claims to admiration into prejudices against him. Irascible,\nenvious--bad enough, but not the worst, for these salient angles were\nall varnished over with a cold, repellant cynicism, his passions vented\nthemselves in sneers. There seemed to him no moral susceptibility; and,\nwhat was more remarkable in a proud nature, little or nothing of the\ntrue point of honor. He had, to a morbid excess, that, desire to rise\nwhich is vulgarly called ambition, but no wish for the esteem or the\nlove of his species; only the hard wish to succeed-not shine, not\nserve--succeed, that he might have the right to despise a world which\ngalled his self-conceit.\n\n“We have suggested the influence of his aims and vicissitudes upon his\nliterature. It was more conspicuous in his later than in his\nearlier writings. Nearly all that he wrote in the last two or three\nyears-including much of his best poetry-was in some sense biographical;\nin draperies of his imagination, those who had taken the trouble to\ntrace his steps, could perceive, but slightly concealed, the figure of\nhimself.”\n\nApropos of the disparaging portion of the above well-written sketch, let\nus truthfully say:\n\nSome four or five years since, when editing a daily paper in this\ncity, Mr. Poe was employed by us, for several months, as critic and\nsub-editor. This was our first personal acquaintance with him. He\nresided with his wife and mother at Fordham, a few miles out of town,\nbut was at his desk in the office, from nine in the morning till the\nevening paper went to press. With the highest admiration for his genius,\nand a willingness to let it atone for more than ordinary irregularity,\nwe were led by common report to expect a very capricious attention to\nhis duties, and occasionally a scene of violence and difficulty. Time\nwent on, however, and he was invariably punctual and industrious. With\nhis pale, beautiful, and intellectual face, as a reminder of what genius\nwas in him, it was impossible, of course, not to treat him always with\ndeferential courtesy, and, to our occasional request that he would not\nprobe too deep in a criticism, or that he would erase a passage colored\ntoo highly with his resentments against society and mankind, he readily\nand courteously assented-far more yielding than most men, we thought,\non points so excusably sensitive. With a prospect of taking the lead in\nanother periodical, he, at last, voluntarily gave up his employment\nwith us, and, through all this considerable period, we had seen but\none presentment of the man-a quiet, patient, industrious, and most\ngentlemanly person, commanding the utmost respect and good feeling by\nhis unvarying deportment and ability.\n\nResiding as he did in the country, we never met Mr. Poe in hours of\nleisure; but he frequently called on us afterward at our place of\nbusiness, and we met him often in the street-invariably the same sad\nmannered, winning and refined gentleman, such as we had always known\nhim. It was by rumor only, up to the day of his death, that we knew of\nany other development of manner or character. We heard, from one who\nknew him well (what should be stated in all mention of his lamentable\nirregularities), that, with a single glass of wine, his whole nature\nwas reversed, the demon became uppermost, and, though none of the\nusual signs of intoxication were visible, his will was palpably insane.\nPossessing his reasoning faculties in excited activity, at such times,\nand seeking his acquaintances with his wonted look and memory, he easily\nseemed personating only another phase of his natural character, and was\naccused, accordingly, of insulting arrogance and bad-heartedness. In\nthis reversed character, we repeat, it was never our chance to see him.\nWe know it from hearsay, and we mention it in connection with this sad\ninfirmity of physical constitution; which puts it upon very nearly the\nground of a temporary and almost irresponsible insanity.\n\nThe arrogance, vanity, and depravity of heart, of which Mr. Poe was\ngenerally accused, seem to us referable altogether to this reversed\nphase of his character. Under that degree of intoxication which only\nacted upon him by demonizing his sense of truth and right, he doubtless\nsaid and did much that was wholly irreconcilable with his better nature;\nbut, when himself, and as we knew him only, his modesty and unaffected\nhumility, as to his own deservings, were a constant charm to his\ncharacter. His letters, of which the constant application for autographs\nhas taken from us, we are sorry to confess, the greater portion,\nexhibited this quality very strongly. In one of the carelessly written\nnotes of which we chance still to retain possession, for instance, he\nspeaks of “The Raven”--that extraordinary poem which electrified the\nworld of imaginative readers, and has become the type of a school of\npoetry of its own-and, in evident earnest, attributes its success to\nthe few words of commendation with which we had prefaced it in this\npaper.--It will throw light on his sane character to give a literal copy\nof the note:\n\n                                  “FORDHAM, April 20, 1849\n\n\n“My DEAR WILLIS--The poem which I inclose, and which I am so vain as to\nhope you will like, in some respects, has been just published in a paper\nfor which sheer necessity compels me to write, now and then. It pays\nwell as times go-but unquestionably it ought to pay ten prices; for\nwhatever I send it I feel I am consigning to the tomb of the Capulets.\nThe verses accompanying this, may I beg you to take out of the tomb, and\nbring them to light in the ‘Home journal?’ If you can oblige me so far\nas to copy them, I do not think it will be necessary to say ‘From the\n----, that would be too bad; and, perhaps, ‘From a late ---- paper,’\nwould do.\n\n“I have not forgotten how a ‘good word in season’ from you made ‘The\nRaven,’ and made ‘Ulalume’ (which by-the-way, people have done me the\nhonor of attributing to you), therefore, I would ask you (if I dared) to\nsay something of these lines if they please you.\n\n                      “Truly yours ever,\n\n                        “EDGAR A. POE.”\n\n\nIn double proof of his earnest disposition to do the best for himself,\nand of the trustful and grateful nature which has been denied him, we\ngive another of the only three of his notes which we chance to retain:\n\n                          “FORDHAM, January 22, 1848.\n\n\n“My DEAR MR. WILLIS--I am about to make an effort at re-establishing\nmyself in the literary world, and _feel _that I may depend upon your\naid.\n\n“My general aim is to start a Magazine, to be called ‘The Stylus,’ but\nit would be useless to me, even when established, if not entirely out of\nthe control of a publisher. I mean, therefore, to get up a journal which\nshall be _my own_ at all points. With this end in view, I must get a\nlist of at least five hundred subscribers to begin with; nearly two\nhundred I have already. I propose, however, to go South and West,\namong my personal and literary friends--old college and West Point\nacquaintances--and see what I can do. In order to get the means of\ntaking the first step, I propose to lecture at the Society Library,\non Thursday, the 3d of February, and, that there may be no cause of\n_squabbling_, my subject shall _not be literary _at all. I have chosen a\nbroad text: ‘The Universe.’\n\n“Having thus given you _the facts_ of the case, I leave all the rest\nto the suggestions of your own tact and generosity. Gratefully, _most\ngratefully,_\n\n                         _“Your friend always,_\n\n                             _“EDGAR A. POE._”\n\n\nBrief and chance-taken as these letters are, we think they sufficiently\nprove the existence of the very qualities denied to Mr. Poe-humility,\nwillingness to persevere, belief in another’s friendship, and capability\nof cordial and grateful friendship! Such he assuredly was when sane.\nSuch only he has invariably seemed to us, in all we have happened\npersonally to know of him, through a friendship of five or six years.\nAnd so much easier is it to believe what we have seen and known, than\nwhat we hear of only, that we remember him but with admiration and\nrespect; these descriptions of him, when morally insane, seeming to\nus like portraits, painted in sickness, of a man we have only known in\nhealth.\n\nBut there is another, more touching, and far more forcible evidence that\nthere was _goodness _in Edgar A. Poe. To reveal it we are obliged to\nventure upon the lifting of the veil which sacredly covers grief and\nrefinement in poverty; but we think it may be excused, if so we can\nbrighten the memory of the poet, even were there not a more needed and\nimmediate service which it may render to the nearest link broken by his\ndeath.\n\nOur first knowledge of Mr. Poe’s removal to this city was by a call\nwhich we received from a lady who introduced herself to us as the mother\nof his wife. She was in search of employment for him, and she excused\nher errand by mentioning that he was ill, that her daughter was a\nconfirmed invalid, and that their circumstances were such as compelled\nher taking it upon herself. The countenance of this lady, made beautiful\nand saintly with an evidently complete giving up of her life to\nprivation and sorrowful tenderness, her gentle and mournful voice urging\nits plea, her long-forgotten but habitually and unconsciously refined\nmanners, and her appealing and yet appreciative mention of the claims\nand abilities of her son, disclosed at once the presence of one of those\nangels upon earth that women in adversity can be. It was a hard fate\nthat she was watching over. Mr. Poe wrote with fastidious difficulty,\nand in a style too much above the popular level to be well paid. He was\nalways in pecuniary difficulty, and, with his sick wife, frequently in\nwant of the merest necessaries of life. Winter after winter, for\nyears, the most touching sight to us, in this whole city, has been that\ntireless minister to genius, thinly and insufficiently clad, going from\noffice to office with a poem, or an article on some literary subject, to\nsell, sometimes simply pleading in a broken voice that he was ill, and\nbegging for him, mentioning nothing but that “he was ill,” whatever\nmight be the reason for his writing nothing, and never, amid all her\ntears and recitals of distress, suffering one syllable to escape her\nlips that could convey a doubt of him, or a complaint, or a lessening of\npride in his genius and good intentions. Her daughter died a year and\na half since, but she did not desert him. She continued his ministering\nangel--living with him, caring for him, guarding him against exposure,\nand when he was carried away by temptation, amid grief and the\nloneliness of feelings unreplied to, and awoke from his self abandonment\nprostrated in destitution and suffering, _begging _for him still. If\nwoman’s devotion, born with a first love, and fed with human passion,\nhallow its object, as it is allowed to do, what does not a devotion\nlike this-pure, disinterested and holy as the watch of an invisible\nspirit-say for him who inspired it?\n\nWe have a letter before us, written by this lady, Mrs. Clemm, on the\nmorning in which she heard of the death of this object of her untiring\ncare. It is merely a request that we would call upon her, but we will\ncopy a few of its words--sacred as its privacy is--to warrant the truth\nof the picture we have drawn above, and add force to the appeal we wish\nto make for her:\n\n“I have this morning heard of the death of my darling Eddie.... Can you\ngive me any circumstances or particulars?... Oh! do not desert your\npoor friend in his bitter affliction!... Ask Mr. ---- to come, as I must\ndeliver a message to him from my poor Eddie.... I need not ask you to\nnotice his death and to speak well of him. I know you will. But say what\nan affectionate son he was to me, his poor desolate mother...”\n\nTo hedge round a grave with respect, what choice is there, between the\nrelinquished wealth and honors of the world, and the story of such a\nwoman’s unrewarded devotion! Risking what we do, in delicacy, by making\nit public, we feel--other reasons aside--that it betters the world to\nmake known that there are such ministrations to its erring and gifted.\nWhat we have said will speak to some hearts. There are those who will\nbe glad to know how the lamp, whose light of poetry has beamed on their\nfar-away recognition, was watched over with care and pain, that they\nmay send to her, who is more darkened than they by its extinction, some\ntoken of their sympathy. She is destitute and alone. If any, far or\nnear, will send to us what may aid and cheer her through the remainder\nof her life, we will joyfully place it in her hands.\n\n\n\n\n\nTHE UNPARALLELED ADVENTURES OF ONE HANS PFAALL (*1)\n\nBY late accounts from Rotterdam, that city seems to be in a high state\nof philosophical excitement. Indeed, phenomena have there occurred of\na nature so completely unexpected--so entirely novel--so utterly at\nvariance with preconceived opinions--as to leave no doubt on my mind\nthat long ere this all Europe is in an uproar, all physics in a ferment,\nall reason and astronomy together by the ears.\n\nIt appears that on the---- day of---- (I am not positive about the\ndate), a vast crowd of people, for purposes not specifically\nmentioned, were assembled in the great square of the Exchange in the\nwell-conditioned city of Rotterdam. The day was warm--unusually so for\nthe season--there was hardly a breath of air stirring; and the multitude\nwere in no bad humor at being now and then besprinkled with friendly\nshowers of momentary duration, that fell from large white masses\nof cloud which chequered in a fitful manner the blue vault of the\nfirmament. Nevertheless, about noon, a slight but remarkable agitation\nbecame apparent in the assembly: the clattering of ten thousand tongues\nsucceeded; and, in an instant afterward, ten thousand faces were\nupturned toward the heavens, ten thousand pipes descended simultaneously\nfrom the corners of ten thousand mouths, and a shout, which could be\ncompared to nothing but the roaring of Niagara, resounded long, loudly,\nand furiously, through all the environs of Rotterdam.\n\nThe origin of this hubbub soon became sufficiently evident. From behind\nthe huge bulk of one of those sharply-defined masses of cloud already\nmentioned, was seen slowly to emerge into an open area of blue space, a\nqueer, heterogeneous, but apparently solid substance, so oddly shaped,\nso whimsically put together, as not to be in any manner comprehended,\nand never to be sufficiently admired, by the host of sturdy burghers who\nstood open-mouthed below. What could it be? In the name of all the vrows\nand devils in Rotterdam, what could it possibly portend? No one knew, no\none could imagine; no one--not even the burgomaster Mynheer Superbus Von\nUnderduk--had the slightest clew by which to unravel the mystery; so, as\nnothing more reasonable could be done, every one to a man replaced his\npipe carefully in the corner of his mouth, and cocking up his right\neye towards the phenomenon, puffed, paused, waddled about, and grunted\nsignificantly--then waddled back, grunted, paused, and finally--puffed\nagain.\n\nIn the meantime, however, lower and still lower toward the goodly city,\ncame the object of so much curiosity, and the cause of so much smoke. In\na very few minutes it arrived near enough to be accurately discerned. It\nappeared to be--yes! it was undoubtedly a species of balloon; but surely\nno such balloon had ever been seen in Rotterdam before. For who, let me\nask, ever heard of a balloon manufactured entirely of dirty newspapers?\nNo man in Holland certainly; yet here, under the very noses of the\npeople, or rather at some distance above their noses was the identical\nthing in question, and composed, I have it on the best authority, of\nthe precise material which no one had ever before known to be used for\na similar purpose. It was an egregious insult to the good sense of the\nburghers of Rotterdam. As to the shape of the phenomenon, it was even\nstill more reprehensible. Being little or nothing better than a huge\nfoolscap turned upside down. And this similitude was regarded as by no\nmeans lessened when, upon nearer inspection, there was perceived a large\ntassel depending from its apex, and, around the upper rim or base of the\ncone, a circle of little instruments, resembling sheep-bells, which kept\nup a continual tinkling to the tune of Betty Martin. But still worse.\nSuspended by blue ribbons to the end of this fantastic machine,\nthere hung, by way of car, an enormous drab beaver hat, with a brim\nsuperlatively broad, and a hemispherical crown with a black band and a\nsilver buckle. It is, however, somewhat remarkable that many citizens\nof Rotterdam swore to having seen the same hat repeatedly before; and\nindeed the whole assembly seemed to regard it with eyes of familiarity;\nwhile the vrow Grettel Pfaall, upon sight of it, uttered an exclamation\nof joyful surprise, and declared it to be the identical hat of her good\nman himself. Now this was a circumstance the more to be observed, as\nPfaall, with three companions, had actually disappeared from Rotterdam\nabout five years before, in a very sudden and unaccountable manner, and\nup to the date of this narrative all attempts had failed of obtaining\nany intelligence concerning them whatsoever. To be sure, some bones\nwhich were thought to be human, mixed up with a quantity of odd-looking\nrubbish, had been lately discovered in a retired situation to the east\nof Rotterdam, and some people went so far as to imagine that in this\nspot a foul murder had been committed, and that the sufferers were in\nall probability Hans Pfaall and his associates. But to return.\n\nThe balloon (for such no doubt it was) had now descended to within\na hundred feet of the earth, allowing the crowd below a sufficiently\ndistinct view of the person of its occupant. This was in truth a very\ndroll little somebody. He could not have been more than two feet in\nheight; but this altitude, little as it was, would have been sufficient\nto destroy his equilibrium, and tilt him over the edge of his tiny\ncar, but for the intervention of a circular rim reaching as high as\nthe breast, and rigged on to the cords of the balloon. The body of the\nlittle man was more than proportionately broad, giving to his entire\nfigure a rotundity highly absurd. His feet, of course, could not be seen\nat all, although a horny substance of suspicious nature was occasionally\nprotruded through a rent in the bottom of the car, or to speak more\nproperly, in the top of the hat. His hands were enormously large. His\nhair was extremely gray, and collected in a cue behind. His nose was\nprodigiously long, crooked, and inflammatory; his eyes full, brilliant,\nand acute; his chin and cheeks, although wrinkled with age, were broad,\npuffy, and double; but of ears of any kind or character there was not a\nsemblance to be discovered upon any portion of his head. This odd little\ngentleman was dressed in a loose surtout of sky-blue satin, with tight\nbreeches to match, fastened with silver buckles at the knees. His vest\nwas of some bright yellow material; a white taffety cap was set jauntily\non one side of his head; and, to complete his equipment, a blood-red\nsilk handkerchief enveloped his throat, and fell down, in a dainty\nmanner, upon his bosom, in a fantastic bow-knot of super-eminent\ndimensions.\n\nHaving descended, as I said before, to about one hundred feet from the\nsurface of the earth, the little old gentleman was suddenly seized\nwith a fit of trepidation, and appeared disinclined to make any nearer\napproach to terra firma. Throwing out, therefore, a quantity of sand\nfrom a canvas bag, which, he lifted with great difficulty, he became\nstationary in an instant. He then proceeded, in a hurried and agitated\nmanner, to extract from a side-pocket in his surtout a large morocco\npocket-book. This he poised suspiciously in his hand, then eyed it with\nan air of extreme surprise, and was evidently astonished at its weight.\nHe at length opened it, and drawing there from a huge letter sealed with\nred sealing-wax and tied carefully with red tape, let it fall precisely\nat the feet of the burgomaster, Superbus Von Underduk. His Excellency\nstooped to take it up. But the aeronaut, still greatly discomposed, and\nhaving apparently no farther business to detain him in Rotterdam, began\nat this moment to make busy preparations for departure; and it being\nnecessary to discharge a portion of ballast to enable him to reascend,\nthe half dozen bags which he threw out, one after another, without\ntaking the trouble to empty their contents, tumbled, every one of them,\nmost unfortunately upon the back of the burgomaster, and rolled him over\nand over no less than one-and-twenty times, in the face of every man in\nRotterdam. It is not to be supposed, however, that the great Underduk\nsuffered this impertinence on the part of the little old man to pass off\nwith impunity. It is said, on the contrary, that during each and every\none of his one-and twenty circumvolutions he emitted no less than\none-and-twenty distinct and furious whiffs from his pipe, to which he\nheld fast the whole time with all his might, and to which he intends\nholding fast until the day of his death.\n\nIn the meantime the balloon arose like a lark, and, soaring far away\nabove the city, at length drifted quietly behind a cloud similar to that\nfrom which it had so oddly emerged, and was thus lost forever to the\nwondering eyes of the good citizens of Rotterdam. All attention was\nnow directed to the letter, the descent of which, and the consequences\nattending thereupon, had proved so fatally subversive of both person and\npersonal dignity to his Excellency, the illustrious Burgomaster Mynheer\nSuperbus Von Underduk. That functionary, however, had not failed, during\nhis circumgyratory movements, to bestow a thought upon the important\nsubject of securing the packet in question, which was seen, upon\ninspection, to have fallen into the most proper hands, being actually\naddressed to himself and Professor Rub-a-dub, in their official\ncapacities of President and Vice-President of the Rotterdam College of\nAstronomy. It was accordingly opened by those dignitaries upon the\nspot, and found to contain the following extraordinary, and indeed very\nserious, communications.\n\nTo their Excellencies Von Underduk and Rub-a-dub, President and\nVice-President of the States’ College of Astronomers, in the city of\nRotterdam.\n\n“Your Excellencies may perhaps be able to remember an humble artizan, by\nname Hans Pfaall, and by occupation a mender of bellows, who, with three\nothers, disappeared from Rotterdam, about five years ago, in a manner\nwhich must have been considered by all parties at once sudden, and\nextremely unaccountable. If, however, it so please your Excellencies, I,\nthe writer of this communication, am the identical Hans Pfaall himself.\nIt is well known to most of my fellow citizens, that for the period of\nforty years I continued to occupy the little square brick building, at\nthe head of the alley called Sauerkraut, in which I resided at the time\nof my disappearance. My ancestors have also resided therein time out of\nmind--they, as well as myself, steadily following the respectable and\nindeed lucrative profession of mending of bellows. For, to speak the\ntruth, until of late years, that the heads of all the people have been\nset agog with politics, no better business than my own could an\nhonest citizen of Rotterdam either desire or deserve. Credit was good,\nemployment was never wanting, and on all hands there was no lack of\neither money or good-will. But, as I was saying, we soon began to feel\nthe effects of liberty and long speeches, and radicalism, and all that\nsort of thing. People who were formerly, the very best customers in the\nworld, had now not a moment of time to think of us at all. They had, so\nthey said, as much as they could do to read about the revolutions, and\nkeep up with the march of intellect and the spirit of the age. If a fire\nwanted fanning, it could readily be fanned with a newspaper, and as the\ngovernment grew weaker, I have no doubt that leather and iron acquired\ndurability in proportion, for, in a very short time, there was not a\npair of bellows in all Rotterdam that ever stood in need of a stitch or\nrequired the assistance of a hammer. This was a state of things not\nto be endured. I soon grew as poor as a rat, and, having a wife and\nchildren to provide for, my burdens at length became intolerable, and I\nspent hour after hour in reflecting upon the most convenient method of\nputting an end to my life. Duns, in the meantime, left me little leisure\nfor contemplation. My house was literally besieged from morning till\nnight, so that I began to rave, and foam, and fret like a caged\ntiger against the bars of his enclosure. There were three fellows in\nparticular who worried me beyond endurance, keeping watch continually\nabout my door, and threatening me with the law. Upon these three I\ninternally vowed the bitterest revenge, if ever I should be so happy as\nto get them within my clutches; and I believe nothing in the world but\nthe pleasure of this anticipation prevented me from putting my plan\nof suicide into immediate execution, by blowing my brains out with a\nblunderbuss. I thought it best, however, to dissemble my wrath, and to\ntreat them with promises and fair words, until, by some good turn of\nfate, an opportunity of vengeance should be afforded me.\n\n“One day, having given my creditors the slip, and feeling more than\nusually dejected, I continued for a long time to wander about the most\nobscure streets without object whatever, until at length I chanced to\nstumble against the corner of a bookseller’s stall. Seeing a chair close\nat hand, for the use of customers, I threw myself doggedly into it,\nand, hardly knowing why, opened the pages of the first volume which\ncame within my reach. It proved to be a small pamphlet treatise on\nSpeculative Astronomy, written either by Professor Encke of Berlin or\nby a Frenchman of somewhat similar name. I had some little tincture of\ninformation on matters of this nature, and soon became more and more\nabsorbed in the contents of the book, reading it actually through twice\nbefore I awoke to a recollection of what was passing around me. By this\ntime it began to grow dark, and I directed my steps toward home. But\nthe treatise had made an indelible impression on my mind, and, as I\nsauntered along the dusky streets, I revolved carefully over in my\nmemory the wild and sometimes unintelligible reasonings of the writer.\nThere are some particular passages which affected my imagination in a\npowerful and extraordinary manner. The longer I meditated upon these\nthe more intense grew the interest which had been excited within me.\nThe limited nature of my education in general, and more especially my\nignorance on subjects connected with natural philosophy, so far from\nrendering me diffident of my own ability to comprehend what I had read,\nor inducing me to mistrust the many vague notions which had arisen in\nconsequence, merely served as a farther stimulus to imagination; and I\nwas vain enough, or perhaps reasonable enough, to doubt whether\nthose crude ideas which, arising in ill-regulated minds, have all the\nappearance, may not often in effect possess all the force, the reality,\nand other inherent properties, of instinct or intuition; whether, to\nproceed a step farther, profundity itself might not, in matters of a\npurely speculative nature, be detected as a legitimate source of falsity\nand error. In other words, I believed, and still do believe, that truth,\nis frequently of its own essence, superficial, and that, in many cases,\nthe depth lies more in the abysses where we seek her, than in the actual\nsituations wherein she may be found. Nature herself seemed to afford\nme corroboration of these ideas. In the contemplation of the heavenly\nbodies it struck me forcibly that I could not distinguish a star with\nnearly as much precision, when I gazed on it with earnest, direct and\nundeviating attention, as when I suffered my eye only to glance in\nits vicinity alone. I was not, of course, at that time aware that this\napparent paradox was occasioned by the center of the visual area being\nless susceptible of feeble impressions of light than the exterior\nportions of the retina. This knowledge, and some of another kind, came\nafterwards in the course of an eventful five years, during which I\nhave dropped the prejudices of my former humble situation in life, and\nforgotten the bellows-mender in far different occupations. But at the\nepoch of which I speak, the analogy which a casual observation of a star\noffered to the conclusions I had already drawn, struck me with the force\nof positive conformation, and I then finally made up my mind to the\ncourse which I afterwards pursued.\n\n“It was late when I reached home, and I went immediately to bed. My\nmind, however, was too much occupied to sleep, and I lay the whole night\nburied in meditation. Arising early in the morning, and contriving\nagain to escape the vigilance of my creditors, I repaired eagerly to the\nbookseller’s stall, and laid out what little ready money I possessed,\nin the purchase of some volumes of Mechanics and Practical Astronomy.\nHaving arrived at home safely with these, I devoted every spare moment\nto their perusal, and soon made such proficiency in studies of this\nnature as I thought sufficient for the execution of my plan. In the\nintervals of this period, I made every endeavor to conciliate the\nthree creditors who had given me so much annoyance. In this I finally\nsucceeded--partly by selling enough of my household furniture to satisfy\na moiety of their claim, and partly by a promise of paying the balance\nupon completion of a little project which I told them I had in view, and\nfor assistance in which I solicited their services. By these means--for\nthey were ignorant men--I found little difficulty in gaining them over\nto my purpose.\n\n“Matters being thus arranged, I contrived, by the aid of my wife and\nwith the greatest secrecy and caution, to dispose of what property I had\nremaining, and to borrow, in small sums, under various pretences,\nand without paying any attention to my future means of repayment, no\ninconsiderable quantity of ready money. With the means thus accruing I\nproceeded to procure at intervals, cambric muslin, very fine, in pieces\nof twelve yards each; twine; a lot of the varnish of caoutchouc; a\nlarge and deep basket of wicker-work, made to order; and several other\narticles necessary in the construction and equipment of a balloon of\nextraordinary dimensions. This I directed my wife to make up as soon as\npossible, and gave her all requisite information as to the particular\nmethod of proceeding. In the meantime I worked up the twine into\na net-work of sufficient dimensions; rigged it with a hoop and the\nnecessary cords; bought a quadrant, a compass, a spy-glass, a common\nbarometer with some important modifications, and two astronomical\ninstruments not so generally known. I then took opportunities of\nconveying by night, to a retired situation east of Rotterdam, five\niron-bound casks, to contain about fifty gallons each, and one of a\nlarger size; six tinned ware tubes, three inches in diameter, properly\nshaped, and ten feet in length; a quantity of a particular metallic\nsubstance, or semi-metal, which I shall not name, and a dozen demijohns\nof a very common acid. The gas to be formed from these latter materials\nis a gas never yet generated by any other person than myself--or at\nleast never applied to any similar purpose. The secret I would make no\ndifficulty in disclosing, but that it of right belongs to a citizen of\nNantz, in France, by whom it was conditionally communicated to myself.\nThe same individual submitted to me, without being at all aware of my\nintentions, a method of constructing balloons from the membrane of a\ncertain animal, through which substance any escape of gas was nearly an\nimpossibility. I found it, however, altogether too expensive, and was\nnot sure, upon the whole, whether cambric muslin with a coating of\ngum caoutchouc, was not equally as good. I mention this circumstance,\nbecause I think it probable that hereafter the individual in question\nmay attempt a balloon ascension with the novel gas and material I have\nspoken of, and I do not wish to deprive him of the honor of a very\nsingular invention.\n\n“On the spot which I intended each of the smaller casks to occupy\nrespectively during the inflation of the balloon, I privately dug a hole\ntwo feet deep; the holes forming in this manner a circle twenty-five\nfeet in diameter. In the centre of this circle, being the station\ndesigned for the large cask, I also dug a hole three feet in depth. In\neach of the five smaller holes, I deposited a canister containing\nfifty pounds, and in the larger one a keg holding one hundred and fifty\npounds, of cannon powder. These--the keg and canisters--I connected in\na proper manner with covered trains; and having let into one of the\ncanisters the end of about four feet of slow match, I covered up the\nhole, and placed the cask over it, leaving the other end of the match\nprotruding about an inch, and barely visible beyond the cask. I then\nfilled up the remaining holes, and placed the barrels over them in their\ndestined situation.\n\n“Besides the articles above enumerated, I conveyed to the depot, and\nthere secreted, one of M. Grimm’s improvements upon the apparatus for\ncondensation of the atmospheric air. I found this machine, however,\nto require considerable alteration before it could be adapted to the\npurposes to which I intended making it applicable. But, with severe\nlabor and unremitting perseverance, I at length met with entire success\nin all my preparations. My balloon was soon completed. It would contain\nmore than forty thousand cubic feet of gas; would take me up easily, I\ncalculated, with all my implements, and, if I managed rightly, with\none hundred and seventy-five pounds of ballast into the bargain. It\nhad received three coats of varnish, and I found the cambric muslin to\nanswer all the purposes of silk itself, quite as strong and a good deal\nless expensive.\n\n“Everything being now ready, I exacted from my wife an oath of secrecy\nin relation to all my actions from the day of my first visit to the\nbookseller’s stall; and promising, on my part, to return as soon as\ncircumstances would permit, I gave her what little money I had left,\nand bade her farewell. Indeed I had no fear on her account. She was\nwhat people call a notable woman, and could manage matters in the world\nwithout my assistance. I believe, to tell the truth, she always looked\nupon me as an idle boy, a mere make-weight, good for nothing but\nbuilding castles in the air, and was rather glad to get rid of me.\nIt was a dark night when I bade her good-bye, and taking with me, as\naides-de-camp, the three creditors who had given me so much trouble,\nwe carried the balloon, with the car and accoutrements, by a roundabout\nway, to the station where the other articles were deposited. We there\nfound them all unmolested, and I proceeded immediately to business.\n\n“It was the first of April. The night, as I said before, was dark; there\nwas not a star to be seen; and a drizzling rain, falling at intervals,\nrendered us very uncomfortable. But my chief anxiety was concerning\nthe balloon, which, in spite of the varnish with which it was defended,\nbegan to grow rather heavy with the moisture; the powder also was liable\nto damage. I therefore kept my three duns working with great diligence,\npounding down ice around the central cask, and stirring the acid in the\nothers. They did not cease, however, importuning me with questions as\nto what I intended to do with all this apparatus, and expressed much\ndissatisfaction at the terrible labor I made them undergo. They could\nnot perceive, so they said, what good was likely to result from\ntheir getting wet to the skin, merely to take a part in such horrible\nincantations. I began to get uneasy, and worked away with all my might,\nfor I verily believe the idiots supposed that I had entered into a\ncompact with the devil, and that, in short, what I was now doing was\nnothing better than it should be. I was, therefore, in great fear of\ntheir leaving me altogether. I contrived, however, to pacify them by\npromises of payment of all scores in full, as soon as I could bring\nthe present business to a termination. To these speeches they gave, of\ncourse, their own interpretation; fancying, no doubt, that at all events\nI should come into possession of vast quantities of ready money; and\nprovided I paid them all I owed, and a trifle more, in consideration of\ntheir services, I dare say they cared very little what became of either\nmy soul or my carcass.\n\n“In about four hours and a half I found the balloon sufficiently\ninflated. I attached the car, therefore, and put all my implements in\nit--not forgetting the condensing apparatus, a copious supply of water,\nand a large quantity of provisions, such as pemmican, in which much\nnutriment is contained in comparatively little bulk. I also secured in\nthe car a pair of pigeons and a cat. It was now nearly daybreak, and I\nthought it high time to take my departure. Dropping a lighted cigar on\nthe ground, as if by accident, I took the opportunity, in stooping to\npick it up, of igniting privately the piece of slow match, whose end,\nas I said before, protruded a very little beyond the lower rim of one of\nthe smaller casks. This manoeuvre was totally unperceived on the part of\nthe three duns; and, jumping into the car, I immediately cut the single\ncord which held me to the earth, and was pleased to find that I shot\nupward, carrying with all ease one hundred and seventy-five pounds of\nleaden ballast, and able to have carried up as many more.\n\n“Scarcely, however, had I attained the height of fifty yards, when,\nroaring and rumbling up after me in the most horrible and tumultuous\nmanner, came so dense a hurricane of fire, and smoke, and sulphur, and\nlegs and arms, and gravel, and burning wood, and blazing metal, that\nmy very heart sunk within me, and I fell down in the bottom of the car,\ntrembling with unmitigated terror. Indeed, I now perceived that I had\nentirely overdone the business, and that the main consequences of the\nshock were yet to be experienced. Accordingly, in less than a second,\nI felt all the blood in my body rushing to my temples, and immediately\nthereupon, a concussion, which I shall never forget, burst abruptly\nthrough the night and seemed to rip the very firmament asunder. When\nI afterward had time for reflection, I did not fail to attribute the\nextreme violence of the explosion, as regarded myself, to its proper\ncause--my situation directly above it, and in the line of its greatest\npower. But at the time, I thought only of preserving my life. The\nballoon at first collapsed, then furiously expanded, then whirled round\nand round with horrible velocity, and finally, reeling and staggering\nlike a drunken man, hurled me with great force over the rim of the car,\nand left me dangling, at a terrific height, with my head downward, and\nmy face outwards, by a piece of slender cord about three feet in\nlength, which hung accidentally through a crevice near the bottom of\nthe wicker-work, and in which, as I fell, my left foot became most\nprovidentially entangled. It is impossible--utterly impossible--to form\nany adequate idea of the horror of my situation. I gasped convulsively\nfor breath--a shudder resembling a fit of the ague agitated every nerve\nand muscle of my frame--I felt my eyes starting from their sockets--a\nhorrible nausea overwhelmed me--and at length I fainted away.\n\n“How long I remained in this state it is impossible to say. It must,\nhowever, have been no inconsiderable time, for when I partially\nrecovered the sense of existence, I found the day breaking, the balloon\nat a prodigious height over a wilderness of ocean, and not a trace\nof land to be discovered far and wide within the limits of the vast\nhorizon. My sensations, however, upon thus recovering, were by no means\nso rife with agony as might have been anticipated. Indeed, there was\nmuch of incipient madness in the calm survey which I began to take of my\nsituation. I drew up to my eyes each of my hands, one after the other,\nand wondered what occurrence could have given rise to the swelling of\nthe veins, and the horrible blackness of the fingernails. I afterward\ncarefully examined my head, shaking it repeatedly, and feeling it with\nminute attention, until I succeeded in satisfying myself that it was\nnot, as I had more than half suspected, larger than my balloon. Then,\nin a knowing manner, I felt in both my breeches pockets, and, missing\ntherefrom a set of tablets and a toothpick case, endeavored to account\nfor their disappearance, and not being able to do so, felt inexpressibly\nchagrined. It now occurred to me that I suffered great uneasiness in the\njoint of my left ankle, and a dim consciousness of my situation began to\nglimmer through my mind. But, strange to say! I was neither astonished\nnor horror-stricken. If I felt any emotion at all, it was a kind of\nchuckling satisfaction at the cleverness I was about to display in\nextricating myself from this dilemma; and I never, for a moment, looked\nupon my ultimate safety as a question susceptible of doubt. For a few\nminutes I remained wrapped in the profoundest meditation. I have a\ndistinct recollection of frequently compressing my lips, putting\nmy forefinger to the side of my nose, and making use of other\ngesticulations and grimaces common to men who, at ease in their\narm-chairs, meditate upon matters of intricacy or importance. Having,\nas I thought, sufficiently collected my ideas, I now, with great caution\nand deliberation, put my hands behind my back, and unfastened the large\niron buckle which belonged to the waistband of my inexpressibles. This\nbuckle had three teeth, which, being somewhat rusty, turned with great\ndifficulty on their axis. I brought them, however, after some trouble,\nat right angles to the body of the buckle, and was glad to find them\nremain firm in that position. Holding the instrument thus obtained\nwithin my teeth, I now proceeded to untie the knot of my cravat. I had\nto rest several times before I could accomplish this manoeuvre, but it\nwas at length accomplished. To one end of the cravat I then made fast\nthe buckle, and the other end I tied, for greater security, tightly\naround my wrist. Drawing now my body upwards, with a prodigious exertion\nof muscular force, I succeeded, at the very first trial, in throwing\nthe buckle over the car, and entangling it, as I had anticipated, in the\ncircular rim of the wicker-work.\n\n“My body was now inclined towards the side of the car, at an angle\nof about forty-five degrees; but it must not be understood that I was\ntherefore only forty-five degrees below the perpendicular. So far from\nit, I still lay nearly level with the plane of the horizon; for the\nchange of situation which I had acquired, had forced the bottom of the\ncar considerably outwards from my position, which was accordingly one\nof the most imminent and deadly peril. It should be remembered, however,\nthat when I fell in the first instance, from the car, if I had fallen\nwith my face turned toward the balloon, instead of turned outwardly from\nit, as it actually was; or if, in the second place, the cord by which\nI was suspended had chanced to hang over the upper edge, instead of\nthrough a crevice near the bottom of the car,--I say it may be readily\nconceived that, in either of these supposed cases, I should have been\nunable to accomplish even as much as I had now accomplished, and the\nwonderful adventures of Hans Pfaall would have been utterly lost to\nposterity, I had therefore every reason to be grateful; although, in\npoint of fact, I was still too stupid to be anything at all, and hung\nfor, perhaps, a quarter of an hour in that extraordinary manner, without\nmaking the slightest farther exertion whatsoever, and in a singularly\ntranquil state of idiotic enjoyment. But this feeling did not fail to\ndie rapidly away, and thereunto succeeded horror, and dismay, and a\nchilling sense of utter helplessness and ruin. In fact, the blood so\nlong accumulating in the vessels of my head and throat, and which had\nhitherto buoyed up my spirits with madness and delirium, had now begun\nto retire within their proper channels, and the distinctness which was\nthus added to my perception of the danger, merely served to deprive me\nof the self-possession and courage to encounter it. But this weakness\nwas, luckily for me, of no very long duration. In good time came to my\nrescue the spirit of despair, and, with frantic cries and struggles, I\njerked my way bodily upwards, till at length, clutching with a vise-like\ngrip the long-desired rim, I writhed my person over it, and fell\nheadlong and shuddering within the car.\n\n“It was not until some time afterward that I recovered myself\nsufficiently to attend to the ordinary cares of the balloon. I then,\nhowever, examined it with attention, and found it, to my great relief,\nuninjured. My implements were all safe, and, fortunately, I had lost\nneither ballast nor provisions. Indeed, I had so well secured them in\ntheir places, that such an accident was entirely out of the question.\nLooking at my watch, I found it six o’clock. I was still rapidly\nascending, and my barometer gave a present altitude of three and\nthree-quarter miles. Immediately beneath me in the ocean, lay a small\nblack object, slightly oblong in shape, seemingly about the size, and\nin every way bearing a great resemblance to one of those childish\ntoys called a domino. Bringing my telescope to bear upon it, I plainly\ndiscerned it to be a British ninety four-gun ship, close-hauled, and\npitching heavily in the sea with her head to the W.S.W. Besides this\nship, I saw nothing but the ocean and the sky, and the sun, which had\nlong arisen.\n\n“It is now high time that I should explain to your Excellencies the\nobject of my perilous voyage. Your Excellencies will bear in mind that\ndistressed circumstances in Rotterdam had at length driven me to the\nresolution of committing suicide. It was not, however, that to life\nitself I had any, positive disgust, but that I was harassed beyond\nendurance by the adventitious miseries attending my situation. In this\nstate of mind, wishing to live, yet wearied with life, the treatise at\nthe stall of the bookseller opened a resource to my imagination. I then\nfinally made up my mind. I determined to depart, yet live--to leave the\nworld, yet continue to exist--in short, to drop enigmas, I resolved, let\nwhat would ensue, to force a passage, if I could, to the moon. Now, lest\nI should be supposed more of a madman than I actually am, I will detail,\nas well as I am able, the considerations which led me to believe that\nan achievement of this nature, although without doubt difficult, and\nincontestably full of danger, was not absolutely, to a bold spirit,\nbeyond the confines of the possible.\n\n“The moon’s actual distance from the earth was the first thing to be\nattended to. Now, the mean or average interval between the centres of\nthe two planets is 59.9643 of the earth’s equatorial radii, or only\nabout 237,000 miles. I say the mean or average interval. But it must\nbe borne in mind that the form of the moon’s orbit being an ellipse of\neccentricity amounting to no less than 0.05484 of the major semi-axis of\nthe ellipse itself, and the earth’s centre being situated in its focus,\nif I could, in any manner, contrive to meet the moon, as it were, in its\nperigee, the above mentioned distance would be materially diminished.\nBut, to say nothing at present of this possibility, it was very certain\nthat, at all events, from the 237,000 miles I would have to deduct the\nradius of the earth, say 4,000, and the radius of the moon, say 1080,\nin all 5,080, leaving an actual interval to be traversed, under average\ncircumstances, of 231,920 miles. Now this, I reflected, was no\nvery extraordinary distance. Travelling on land has been repeatedly\naccomplished at the rate of thirty miles per hour, and indeed a much\ngreater speed may be anticipated. But even at this velocity, it would\ntake me no more than 322 days to reach the surface of the moon. There\nwere, however, many particulars inducing me to believe that my average\nrate of travelling might possibly very much exceed that of thirty miles\nper hour, and, as these considerations did not fail to make a deep\nimpression upon my mind, I will mention them more fully hereafter.\n\n“The next point to be regarded was a matter of far greater importance.\nFrom indications afforded by the barometer, we find that, in ascensions\nfrom the surface of the earth we have, at the height of 1,000 feet, left\nbelow us about one-thirtieth of the entire mass of atmospheric air, that\nat 10,600 we have ascended through nearly one-third; and that at 18,000,\nwhich is not far from the elevation of Cotopaxi, we have surmounted\none-half the material, or, at all events, one-half the ponderable,\nbody of air incumbent upon our globe. It is also calculated that at an\naltitude not exceeding the hundredth part of the earth’s diameter--that\nis, not exceeding eighty miles--the rarefaction would be so excessive\nthat animal life could in no manner be sustained, and, moreover, that\nthe most delicate means we possess of ascertaining the presence of the\natmosphere would be inadequate to assure us of its existence. But I\ndid not fail to perceive that these latter calculations are founded\naltogether on our experimental knowledge of the properties of air, and\nthe mechanical laws regulating its dilation and compression, in what may\nbe called, comparatively speaking, the immediate vicinity of the earth\nitself; and, at the same time, it is taken for granted that animal\nlife is and must be essentially incapable of modification at any given\nunattainable distance from the surface. Now, all such reasoning and from\nsuch data must, of course, be simply analogical. The greatest height\never reached by man was that of 25,000 feet, attained in the aeronautic\nexpedition of Messieurs Gay-Lussac and Biot. This is a moderate\naltitude, even when compared with the eighty miles in question; and I\ncould not help thinking that the subject admitted room for doubt and\ngreat latitude for speculation.\n\n“But, in point of fact, an ascension being made to any given altitude,\nthe ponderable quantity of air surmounted in any farther ascension is\nby no means in proportion to the additional height ascended (as may\nbe plainly seen from what has been stated before), but in a ratio\nconstantly decreasing. It is therefore evident that, ascend as high as\nwe may, we cannot, literally speaking, arrive at a limit beyond which\nno atmosphere is to be found. It must exist, I argued; although it may\nexist in a state of infinite rarefaction.\n\n“On the other hand, I was aware that arguments have not been wanting\nto prove the existence of a real and definite limit to the atmosphere,\nbeyond which there is absolutely no air whatsoever. But a circumstance\nwhich has been left out of view by those who contend for such a limit\nseemed to me, although no positive refutation of their creed, still\na point worthy very serious investigation. On comparing the intervals\nbetween the successive arrivals of Encke’s comet at its perihelion,\nafter giving credit, in the most exact manner, for all the disturbances\ndue to the attractions of the planets, it appears that the periods are\ngradually diminishing; that is to say, the major axis of the comet’s\nellipse is growing shorter, in a slow but perfectly regular decrease.\nNow, this is precisely what ought to be the case, if we suppose a\nresistance experienced from the comet from an extremely rare ethereal\nmedium pervading the regions of its orbit. For it is evident that such\na medium must, in retarding the comet’s velocity, increase its\ncentripetal, by weakening its centrifugal force. In other words, the\nsun’s attraction would be constantly attaining greater power, and the\ncomet would be drawn nearer at every revolution. Indeed, there is no\nother way of accounting for the variation in question. But again. The\nreal diameter of the same comet’s nebulosity is observed to contract\nrapidly as it approaches the sun, and dilate with equal rapidity in its\ndeparture towards its aphelion. Was I not justifiable in supposing with\nM. Valz, that this apparent condensation of volume has its origin in\nthe compression of the same ethereal medium I have spoken of before,\nand which is only denser in proportion to its solar vicinity? The\nlenticular-shaped phenomenon, also called the zodiacal light, was a\nmatter worthy of attention. This radiance, so apparent in the tropics,\nand which cannot be mistaken for any meteoric lustre, extends from the\nhorizon obliquely upward, and follows generally the direction of the\nsun’s equator. It appeared to me evidently in the nature of a rare\natmosphere extending from the sun outward, beyond the orbit of Venus at\nleast, and I believed indefinitely farther.(*2) Indeed, this medium I\ncould not suppose confined to the path of the comet’s ellipse, or to\nthe immediate neighborhood of the sun. It was easy, on the contrary,\nto imagine it pervading the entire regions of our planetary system,\ncondensed into what we call atmosphere at the planets themselves, and\nperhaps at some of them modified by considerations, so to speak, purely\ngeological.\n\n“Having adopted this view of the subject, I had little further\nhesitation. Granting that on my passage I should meet with atmosphere\nessentially the same as at the surface of the earth, I conceived that,\nby means of the very ingenious apparatus of M. Grimm, I should readily\nbe enabled to condense it in sufficient quantity for the purposes of\nrespiration. This would remove the chief obstacle in a journey to the\nmoon. I had indeed spent some money and great labor in adapting the\napparatus to the object intended, and confidently looked forward to its\nsuccessful application, if I could manage to complete the voyage within\nany reasonable period. This brings me back to the rate at which it might\nbe possible to travel.\n\n“It is true that balloons, in the first stage of their ascensions from\nthe earth, are known to rise with a velocity comparatively moderate.\nNow, the power of elevation lies altogether in the superior lightness of\nthe gas in the balloon compared with the atmospheric air; and, at\nfirst sight, it does not appear probable that, as the balloon acquires\naltitude, and consequently arrives successively in atmospheric strata\nof densities rapidly diminishing--I say, it does not appear at all\nreasonable that, in this its progress upwards, the original velocity\nshould be accelerated. On the other hand, I was not aware that, in any\nrecorded ascension, a diminution was apparent in the absolute rate\nof ascent; although such should have been the case, if on account\nof nothing else, on account of the escape of gas through balloons\nill-constructed, and varnished with no better material than the ordinary\nvarnish. It seemed, therefore, that the effect of such escape was only\nsufficient to counterbalance the effect of some accelerating power. I\nnow considered that, provided in my passage I found the medium I\nhad imagined, and provided that it should prove to be actually\nand essentially what we denominate atmospheric air, it could make\ncomparatively little difference at what extreme state of rarefaction\nI should discover it--that is to say, in regard to my power of\nascending--for the gas in the balloon would not only be itself subject\nto rarefaction partially similar (in proportion to the occurrence of\nwhich, I could suffer an escape of so much as would be requisite to\nprevent explosion), but, being what it was, would, at all events,\ncontinue specifically lighter than any compound whatever of mere\nnitrogen and oxygen. In the meantime, the force of gravitation would be\nconstantly diminishing, in proportion to the squares of the distances,\nand thus, with a velocity prodigiously accelerating, I should at\nlength arrive in those distant regions where the force of the earth’s\nattraction would be superseded by that of the moon. In accordance with\nthese ideas, I did not think it worth while to encumber myself with more\nprovisions than would be sufficient for a period of forty days.\n\n“There was still, however, another difficulty, which occasioned me some\nlittle disquietude. It has been observed, that, in balloon ascensions to\nany considerable height, besides the pain attending respiration, great\nuneasiness is experienced about the head and body, often accompanied\nwith bleeding at the nose, and other symptoms of an alarming kind,\nand growing more and more inconvenient in proportion to the altitude\nattained.(*3) This was a reflection of a nature somewhat startling. Was\nit not probable that these symptoms would increase indefinitely, or at\nleast until terminated by death itself? I finally thought not. Their\norigin was to be looked for in the progressive removal of the customary\natmospheric pressure upon the surface of the body, and consequent\ndistention of the superficial blood-vessels--not in any positive\ndisorganization of the animal system, as in the case of difficulty in\nbreathing, where the atmospheric density is chemically insufficient\nfor the due renovation of blood in a ventricle of the heart. Unless for\ndefault of this renovation, I could see no reason, therefore, why\nlife could not be sustained even in a vacuum; for the expansion and\ncompression of chest, commonly called breathing, is action purely\nmuscular, and the cause, not the effect, of respiration. In a word,\nI conceived that, as the body should become habituated to the want\nof atmospheric pressure, the sensations of pain would gradually\ndiminish--and to endure them while they continued, I relied with\nconfidence upon the iron hardihood of my constitution.\n\n“Thus, may it please your Excellencies, I have detailed some, though by\nno means all, the considerations which led me to form the project of\na lunar voyage. I shall now proceed to lay before you the result of an\nattempt so apparently audacious in conception, and, at all events, so\nutterly unparalleled in the annals of mankind.\n\n“Having attained the altitude before mentioned, that is to say three\nmiles and three-quarters, I threw out from the car a quantity of\nfeathers, and found that I still ascended with sufficient rapidity;\nthere was, therefore, no necessity for discharging any ballast. I was\nglad of this, for I wished to retain with me as much weight as I could\ncarry, for reasons which will be explained in the sequel. I as yet\nsuffered no bodily inconvenience, breathing with great freedom, and\nfeeling no pain whatever in the head. The cat was lying very demurely\nupon my coat, which I had taken off, and eyeing the pigeons with an air\nof nonchalance. These latter being tied by the leg, to prevent their\nescape, were busily employed in picking up some grains of rice scattered\nfor them in the bottom of the car.\n\n“At twenty minutes past six o’clock, the barometer showed an elevation\nof 26,400 feet, or five miles to a fraction. The prospect seemed\nunbounded. Indeed, it is very easily calculated by means of spherical\ngeometry, what a great extent of the earth’s area I beheld. The convex\nsurface of any segment of a sphere is, to the entire surface of the\nsphere itself, as the versed sine of the segment to the diameter of the\nsphere. Now, in my case, the versed sine--that is to say, the thickness\nof the segment beneath me--was about equal to my elevation, or the\nelevation of the point of sight above the surface. ‘As five miles, then,\nto eight thousand,’ would express the proportion of the earth’s area\nseen by me. In other words, I beheld as much as a sixteen-hundredth\npart of the whole surface of the globe. The sea appeared unruffled as a\nmirror, although, by means of the spy-glass, I could perceive it to be\nin a state of violent agitation. The ship was no longer visible, having\ndrifted away, apparently to the eastward. I now began to experience, at\nintervals, severe pain in the head, especially about the ears--still,\nhowever, breathing with tolerable freedom. The cat and pigeons seemed to\nsuffer no inconvenience whatsoever.\n\n“At twenty minutes before seven, the balloon entered a long series of\ndense cloud, which put me to great trouble, by damaging my condensing\napparatus and wetting me to the skin. This was, to be sure, a singular\nrecontre, for I had not believed it possible that a cloud of this nature\ncould be sustained at so great an elevation. I thought it best, however,\nto throw out two five-pound pieces of ballast, reserving still a weight\nof one hundred and sixty-five pounds. Upon so doing, I soon rose above\nthe difficulty, and perceived immediately, that I had obtained a great\nincrease in my rate of ascent. In a few seconds after my leaving the\ncloud, a flash of vivid lightning shot from one end of it to the other,\nand caused it to kindle up, throughout its vast extent, like a mass of\nignited and glowing charcoal. This, it must be remembered, was in the\nbroad light of day. No fancy may picture the sublimity which might have\nbeen exhibited by a similar phenomenon taking place amid the darkness of\nthe night. Hell itself might have been found a fitting image. Even as\nit was, my hair stood on end, while I gazed afar down within the yawning\nabysses, letting imagination descend, as it were, and stalk about in the\nstrange vaulted halls, and ruddy gulfs, and red ghastly chasms of the\nhideous and unfathomable fire. I had indeed made a narrow escape. Had\nthe balloon remained a very short while longer within the cloud--that\nis to say--had not the inconvenience of getting wet, determined me to\ndischarge the ballast, inevitable ruin would have been the consequence.\nSuch perils, although little considered, are perhaps the greatest which\nmust be encountered in balloons. I had by this time, however, attained\ntoo great an elevation to be any longer uneasy on this head.\n\n“I was now rising rapidly, and by seven o’clock the barometer indicated\nan altitude of no less than nine miles and a half. I began to find great\ndifficulty in drawing my breath. My head, too, was excessively painful;\nand, having felt for some time a moisture about my cheeks, I at length\ndiscovered it to be blood, which was oozing quite fast from the drums of\nmy ears. My eyes, also, gave me great uneasiness. Upon passing the\nhand over them they seemed to have protruded from their sockets in no\ninconsiderable degree; and all objects in the car, and even the balloon\nitself, appeared distorted to my vision. These symptoms were more than\nI had expected, and occasioned me some alarm. At this juncture, very\nimprudently, and without consideration, I threw out from the car three\nfive-pound pieces of ballast. The accelerated rate of ascent thus\nobtained, carried me too rapidly, and without sufficient gradation, into\na highly rarefied stratum of the atmosphere, and the result had nearly\nproved fatal to my expedition and to myself. I was suddenly seized with\na spasm which lasted for more than five minutes, and even when this, in\na measure, ceased, I could catch my breath only at long intervals, and\nin a gasping manner--bleeding all the while copiously at the nose and\nears, and even slightly at the eyes. The pigeons appeared distressed\nin the extreme, and struggled to escape; while the cat mewed piteously,\nand, with her tongue hanging out of her mouth, staggered to and fro in\nthe car as if under the influence of poison. I now too late discovered\nthe great rashness of which I had been guilty in discharging the\nballast, and my agitation was excessive. I anticipated nothing less than\ndeath, and death in a few minutes. The physical suffering I underwent\ncontributed also to render me nearly incapable of making any exertion\nfor the preservation of my life. I had, indeed, little power of\nreflection left, and the violence of the pain in my head seemed to be\ngreatly on the increase. Thus I found that my senses would shortly give\nway altogether, and I had already clutched one of the valve ropes with\nthe view of attempting a descent, when the recollection of the trick I\nhad played the three creditors, and the possible consequences to myself,\nshould I return, operated to deter me for the moment. I lay down in the\nbottom of the car, and endeavored to collect my faculties. In this I\nso far succeeded as to determine upon the experiment of losing blood.\nHaving no lancet, however, I was constrained to perform the operation in\nthe best manner I was able, and finally succeeded in opening a vein\nin my right arm, with the blade of my penknife. The blood had hardly\ncommenced flowing when I experienced a sensible relief, and by the time\nI had lost about half a moderate basin full, most of the worst symptoms\nhad abandoned me entirely. I nevertheless did not think it expedient to\nattempt getting on my feet immediately; but, having tied up my arm as\nwell as I could, I lay still for about a quarter of an hour. At the end\nof this time I arose, and found myself freer from absolute pain of any\nkind than I had been during the last hour and a quarter of my ascension.\nThe difficulty of breathing, however, was diminished in a very slight\ndegree, and I found that it would soon be positively necessary to make\nuse of my condenser. In the meantime, looking toward the cat, who was\nagain snugly stowed away upon my coat, I discovered to my infinite\nsurprise, that she had taken the opportunity of my indisposition to\nbring into light a litter of three little kittens. This was an addition\nto the number of passengers on my part altogether unexpected; but I was\npleased at the occurrence. It would afford me a chance of bringing to a\nkind of test the truth of a surmise, which, more than anything else,\nhad influenced me in attempting this ascension. I had imagined that the\nhabitual endurance of the atmospheric pressure at the surface of\nthe earth was the cause, or nearly so, of the pain attending animal\nexistence at a distance above the surface. Should the kittens be found\nto suffer uneasiness in an equal degree with their mother, I must\nconsider my theory in fault, but a failure to do so I should look upon\nas a strong confirmation of my idea.\n\n“By eight o’clock I had actually attained an elevation of seventeen\nmiles above the surface of the earth. Thus it seemed to me evident that\nmy rate of ascent was not only on the increase, but that the progression\nwould have been apparent in a slight degree even had I not discharged\nthe ballast which I did. The pains in my head and ears returned, at\nintervals, with violence, and I still continued to bleed occasionally at\nthe nose; but, upon the whole, I suffered much less than might have\nbeen expected. I breathed, however, at every moment, with more and\nmore difficulty, and each inhalation was attended with a troublesome\nspasmodic action of the chest. I now unpacked the condensing apparatus,\nand got it ready for immediate use.\n\n“The view of the earth, at this period of my ascension, was beautiful\nindeed. To the westward, the northward, and the southward, as far as I\ncould see, lay a boundless sheet of apparently unruffled ocean, which\nevery moment gained a deeper and a deeper tint of blue and began already\nto assume a slight appearance of convexity. At a vast distance to the\neastward, although perfectly discernible, extended the islands of Great\nBritain, the entire Atlantic coasts of France and Spain, with a small\nportion of the northern part of the continent of Africa. Of individual\nedifices not a trace could be discovered, and the proudest cities of\nmankind had utterly faded away from the face of the earth. From the rock\nof Gibraltar, now dwindled into a dim speck, the dark Mediterranean sea,\ndotted with shining islands as the heaven is dotted with stars, spread\nitself out to the eastward as far as my vision extended, until its\nentire mass of waters seemed at length to tumble headlong over the abyss\nof the horizon, and I found myself listening on tiptoe for the echoes\nof the mighty cataract. Overhead, the sky was of a jetty black, and the\nstars were brilliantly visible.\n\n“The pigeons about this time seeming to undergo much suffering, I\ndetermined upon giving them their liberty. I first untied one of them,\na beautiful gray-mottled pigeon, and placed him upon the rim of the\nwicker-work. He appeared extremely uneasy, looking anxiously around him,\nfluttering his wings, and making a loud cooing noise, but could not be\npersuaded to trust himself from off the car. I took him up at last,\nand threw him to about half a dozen yards from the balloon. He made,\nhowever, no attempt to descend as I had expected, but struggled with\ngreat vehemence to get back, uttering at the same time very shrill and\npiercing cries. He at length succeeded in regaining his former station\non the rim, but had hardly done so when his head dropped upon his\nbreast, and he fell dead within the car. The other one did not prove so\nunfortunate. To prevent his following the example of his companion, and\naccomplishing a return, I threw him downward with all my force, and was\npleased to find him continue his descent, with great velocity, making\nuse of his wings with ease, and in a perfectly natural manner. In a very\nshort time he was out of sight, and I have no doubt he reached home in\nsafety. Puss, who seemed in a great measure recovered from her illness,\nnow made a hearty meal of the dead bird and then went to sleep with much\napparent satisfaction. Her kittens were quite lively, and so far evinced\nnot the slightest sign of any uneasiness whatever.\n\n“At a quarter-past eight, being no longer able to draw breath without\nthe most intolerable pain, I proceeded forthwith to adjust around\nthe car the apparatus belonging to the condenser. This apparatus will\nrequire some little explanation, and your Excellencies will please to\nbear in mind that my object, in the first place, was to surround myself\nand cat entirely with a barricade against the highly rarefied atmosphere\nin which I was existing, with the intention of introducing within this\nbarricade, by means of my condenser, a quantity of this same atmosphere\nsufficiently condensed for the purposes of respiration. With this object\nin view I had prepared a very strong perfectly air-tight, but flexible\ngum-elastic bag. In this bag, which was of sufficient dimensions, the\nentire car was in a manner placed. That is to say, it (the bag) was\ndrawn over the whole bottom of the car, up its sides, and so on, along\nthe outside of the ropes, to the upper rim or hoop where the net-work\nis attached. Having pulled the bag up in this way, and formed a complete\nenclosure on all sides, and at bottom, it was now necessary to fasten\nup its top or mouth, by passing its material over the hoop of the\nnet-work--in other words, between the net-work and the hoop. But if the\nnet-work were separated from the hoop to admit this passage, what was\nto sustain the car in the meantime? Now the net-work was not permanently\nfastened to the hoop, but attached by a series of running loops or\nnooses. I therefore undid only a few of these loops at one time, leaving\nthe car suspended by the remainder. Having thus inserted a portion of\nthe cloth forming the upper part of the bag, I refastened the loops--not\nto the hoop, for that would have been impossible, since the cloth\nnow intervened--but to a series of large buttons, affixed to the cloth\nitself, about three feet below the mouth of the bag, the intervals\nbetween the buttons having been made to correspond to the intervals\nbetween the loops. This done, a few more of the loops were unfastened\nfrom the rim, a farther portion of the cloth introduced, and the\ndisengaged loops then connected with their proper buttons. In this way\nit was possible to insert the whole upper part of the bag between the\nnet-work and the hoop. It is evident that the hoop would now drop down\nwithin the car, while the whole weight of the car itself, with all its\ncontents, would be held up merely by the strength of the buttons. This,\nat first sight, would seem an inadequate dependence; but it was by no\nmeans so, for the buttons were not only very strong in themselves, but\nso close together that a very slight portion of the whole weight was\nsupported by any one of them. Indeed, had the car and contents been\nthree times heavier than they were, I should not have been at\nall uneasy. I now raised up the hoop again within the covering of\ngum-elastic, and propped it at nearly its former height by means of\nthree light poles prepared for the occasion. This was done, of course,\nto keep the bag distended at the top, and to preserve the lower part\nof the net-work in its proper situation. All that now remained was to\nfasten up the mouth of the enclosure; and this was readily accomplished\nby gathering the folds of the material together, and twisting them up\nvery tightly on the inside by means of a kind of stationary tourniquet.\n\n“In the sides of the covering thus adjusted round the car, had been\ninserted three circular panes of thick but clear glass, through which I\ncould see without difficulty around me in every horizontal direction.\nIn that portion of the cloth forming the bottom, was likewise, a fourth\nwindow, of the same kind, and corresponding with a small aperture in the\nfloor of the car itself. This enabled me to see perpendicularly\ndown, but having found it impossible to place any similar contrivance\noverhead, on account of the peculiar manner of closing up the opening\nthere, and the consequent wrinkles in the cloth, I could expect to see\nno objects situated directly in my zenith. This, of course, was a matter\nof little consequence; for had I even been able to place a window at\ntop, the balloon itself would have prevented my making any use of it.\n\n“About a foot below one of the side windows was a circular opening,\neight inches in diameter, and fitted with a brass rim adapted in its\ninner edge to the windings of a screw. In this rim was screwed the large\ntube of the condenser, the body of the machine being, of course, within\nthe chamber of gum-elastic. Through this tube a quantity of the rare\natmosphere circumjacent being drawn by means of a vacuum created in the\nbody of the machine, was thence discharged, in a state of condensation,\nto mingle with the thin air already in the chamber. This operation being\nrepeated several times, at length filled the chamber with atmosphere\nproper for all the purposes of respiration. But in so confined a space\nit would, in a short time, necessarily become foul, and unfit for use\nfrom frequent contact with the lungs. It was then ejected by a small\nvalve at the bottom of the car--the dense air readily sinking into the\nthinner atmosphere below. To avoid the inconvenience of making a total\nvacuum at any moment within the chamber, this purification was never\naccomplished all at once, but in a gradual manner--the valve being\nopened only for a few seconds, then closed again, until one or two\nstrokes from the pump of the condenser had supplied the place of the\natmosphere ejected. For the sake of experiment I had put the cat and\nkittens in a small basket, and suspended it outside the car to a button\nat the bottom, close by the valve, through which I could feed them at\nany moment when necessary. I did this at some little risk, and before\nclosing the mouth of the chamber, by reaching under the car with one of\nthe poles before mentioned to which a hook had been attached.\n\n“By the time I had fully completed these arrangements and filled the\nchamber as explained, it wanted only ten minutes of nine o’clock. During\nthe whole period of my being thus employed, I endured the most terrible\ndistress from difficulty of respiration, and bitterly did I repent the\nnegligence or rather fool-hardiness, of which I had been guilty, of\nputting off to the last moment a matter of so much importance. But\nhaving at length accomplished it, I soon began to reap the benefit of\nmy invention. Once again I breathed with perfect freedom and ease--and\nindeed why should I not? I was also agreeably surprised to find myself,\nin a great measure, relieved from the violent pains which had hitherto\ntormented me. A slight headache, accompanied with a sensation of fulness\nor distention about the wrists, the ankles, and the throat, was nearly\nall of which I had now to complain. Thus it seemed evident that a\ngreater part of the uneasiness attending the removal of atmospheric\npressure had actually worn off, as I had expected, and that much of\nthe pain endured for the last two hours should have been attributed\naltogether to the effects of a deficient respiration.\n\n“At twenty minutes before nine o’clock--that is to say, a short time\nprior to my closing up the mouth of the chamber, the mercury attained\nits limit, or ran down, in the barometer, which, as I mentioned before,\nwas one of an extended construction. It then indicated an altitude on\nmy part of 132,000 feet, or five-and-twenty miles, and I consequently\nsurveyed at that time an extent of the earth’s area amounting to no less\nthan the three hundred-and-twentieth part of its entire superficies.\nAt nine o’clock I had again lost sight of land to the eastward, but not\nbefore I became aware that the balloon was drifting rapidly to the N.\nN. W. The convexity of the ocean beneath me was very evident indeed,\nalthough my view was often interrupted by the masses of cloud which\nfloated to and fro. I observed now that even the lightest vapors never\nrose to more than ten miles above the level of the sea.\n\n“At half past nine I tried the experiment of throwing out a handful of\nfeathers through the valve. They did not float as I had expected; but\ndropped down perpendicularly, like a bullet, en masse, and with the\ngreatest velocity--being out of sight in a very few seconds. I did not\nat first know what to make of this extraordinary phenomenon; not being\nable to believe that my rate of ascent had, of a sudden, met with\nso prodigious an acceleration. But it soon occurred to me that the\natmosphere was now far too rare to sustain even the feathers; that they\nactually fell, as they appeared to do, with great rapidity; and that I\nhad been surprised by the united velocities of their descent and my own\nelevation.\n\n“By ten o’clock I found that I had very little to occupy my immediate\nattention. Affairs went swimmingly, and I believed the balloon to be\ngoing upward with a speed increasing momently although I had no longer\nany means of ascertaining the progression of the increase. I suffered no\npain or uneasiness of any kind, and enjoyed better spirits than I had\nat any period since my departure from Rotterdam, busying myself now in\nexamining the state of my various apparatus, and now in regenerating the\natmosphere within the chamber. This latter point I determined to\nattend to at regular intervals of forty minutes, more on account of\nthe preservation of my health, than from so frequent a renovation\nbeing absolutely necessary. In the meanwhile I could not help making\nanticipations. Fancy revelled in the wild and dreamy regions of the\nmoon. Imagination, feeling herself for once unshackled, roamed at will\namong the ever-changing wonders of a shadowy and unstable land. Now\nthere were hoary and time-honored forests, and craggy precipices, and\nwaterfalls tumbling with a loud noise into abysses without a bottom.\nThen I came suddenly into still noonday solitudes, where no wind of\nheaven ever intruded, and where vast meadows of poppies, and slender,\nlily-looking flowers spread themselves out a weary distance, all silent\nand motionless forever. Then again I journeyed far down away into\nanother country where it was all one dim and vague lake, with a boundary\nline of clouds. And out of this melancholy water arose a forest of tall\neastern trees, like a wilderness of dreams. And I have in mind that\nthe shadows of the trees which fell upon the lake remained not on\nthe surface where they fell, but sunk slowly and steadily down, and\ncommingled with the waves, while from the trunks of the trees other\nshadows were continually coming out, and taking the place of their\nbrothers thus entombed. “This then,” I said thoughtfully, “is the very\nreason why the waters of this lake grow blacker with age, and more\nmelancholy as the hours run on.” But fancies such as these were not the\nsole possessors of my brain. Horrors of a nature most stern and most\nappalling would too frequently obtrude themselves upon my mind, and\nshake the innermost depths of my soul with the bare supposition of their\npossibility. Yet I would not suffer my thoughts for any length of time\nto dwell upon these latter speculations, rightly judging the real and\npalpable dangers of the voyage sufficient for my undivided attention.\n\n“At five o’clock, p.m., being engaged in regenerating the atmosphere\nwithin the chamber, I took that opportunity of observing the cat and\nkittens through the valve. The cat herself appeared to suffer again very\nmuch, and I had no hesitation in attributing her uneasiness chiefly to a\ndifficulty in breathing; but my experiment with the kittens had resulted\nvery strangely. I had expected, of course, to see them betray a sense of\npain, although in a less degree than their mother, and this would have\nbeen sufficient to confirm my opinion concerning the habitual endurance\nof atmospheric pressure. But I was not prepared to find them, upon close\nexamination, evidently enjoying a high degree of health, breathing with\nthe greatest ease and perfect regularity, and evincing not the slightest\nsign of any uneasiness whatever. I could only account for all this by\nextending my theory, and supposing that the highly rarefied atmosphere\naround might perhaps not be, as I had taken for granted, chemically\ninsufficient for the purposes of life, and that a person born in such\na medium might, possibly, be unaware of any inconvenience attending its\ninhalation, while, upon removal to the denser strata near the earth,\nhe might endure tortures of a similar nature to those I had so lately\nexperienced. It has since been to me a matter of deep regret that an\nawkward accident, at this time, occasioned me the loss of my little\nfamily of cats, and deprived me of the insight into this matter which a\ncontinued experiment might have afforded. In passing my hand through\nthe valve, with a cup of water for the old puss, the sleeves of my shirt\nbecame entangled in the loop which sustained the basket, and thus, in\na moment, loosened it from the bottom. Had the whole actually vanished\ninto air, it could not have shot from my sight in a more abrupt and\ninstantaneous manner. Positively, there could not have intervened the\ntenth part of a second between the disengagement of the basket and its\nabsolute and total disappearance with all that it contained. My good\nwishes followed it to the earth, but of course, I had no hope that\neither cat or kittens would ever live to tell the tale of their\nmisfortune.\n\n“At six o’clock, I perceived a great portion of the earth’s visible area\nto the eastward involved in thick shadow, which continued to advance\nwith great rapidity, until, at five minutes before seven, the whole\nsurface in view was enveloped in the darkness of night. It was not,\nhowever, until long after this time that the rays of the setting sun\nceased to illumine the balloon; and this circumstance, although of\ncourse fully anticipated, did not fail to give me an infinite deal\nof pleasure. It was evident that, in the morning, I should behold the\nrising luminary many hours at least before the citizens of Rotterdam, in\nspite of their situation so much farther to the eastward, and thus, day\nafter day, in proportion to the height ascended, would I enjoy the light\nof the sun for a longer and a longer period. I now determined to keep a\njournal of my passage, reckoning the days from one to twenty-four\nhours continuously, without taking into consideration the intervals of\ndarkness.\n\n“At ten o’clock, feeling sleepy, I determined to lie down for the rest\nof the night; but here a difficulty presented itself, which, obvious as\nit may appear, had escaped my attention up to the very moment of which\nI am now speaking. If I went to sleep as I proposed, how could the\natmosphere in the chamber be regenerated in the interim? To breathe\nit for more than an hour, at the farthest, would be a matter of\nimpossibility, or, if even this term could be extended to an hour and a\nquarter, the most ruinous consequences might ensue. The consideration\nof this dilemma gave me no little disquietude; and it will hardly be\nbelieved, that, after the dangers I had undergone, I should look\nupon this business in so serious a light, as to give up all hope of\naccomplishing my ultimate design, and finally make up my mind to the\nnecessity of a descent. But this hesitation was only momentary. I\nreflected that man is the veriest slave of custom, and that many points\nin the routine of his existence are deemed essentially important, which\nare only so at all by his having rendered them habitual. It was very\ncertain that I could not do without sleep; but I might easily bring\nmyself to feel no inconvenience from being awakened at intervals of an\nhour during the whole period of my repose. It would require but five\nminutes at most to regenerate the atmosphere in the fullest manner, and\nthe only real difficulty was to contrive a method of arousing myself\nat the proper moment for so doing. But this was a question which, I am\nwilling to confess, occasioned me no little trouble in its solution. To\nbe sure, I had heard of the student who, to prevent his falling asleep\nover his books, held in one hand a ball of copper, the din of whose\ndescent into a basin of the same metal on the floor beside his chair,\nserved effectually to startle him up, if, at any moment, he should\nbe overcome with drowsiness. My own case, however, was very different\nindeed, and left me no room for any similar idea; for I did not wish to\nkeep awake, but to be aroused from slumber at regular intervals of time.\nI at length hit upon the following expedient, which, simple as it may\nseem, was hailed by me, at the moment of discovery, as an invention\nfully equal to that of the telescope, the steam-engine, or the art of\nprinting itself.\n\n“It is necessary to premise, that the balloon, at the elevation now\nattained, continued its course upward with an even and undeviating\nascent, and the car consequently followed with a steadiness so perfect\nthat it would have been impossible to detect in it the slightest\nvacillation whatever. This circumstance favored me greatly in the\nproject I now determined to adopt. My supply of water had been put on\nboard in kegs containing five gallons each, and ranged very securely\naround the interior of the car. I unfastened one of these, and taking\ntwo ropes tied them tightly across the rim of the wicker-work from one\nside to the other; placing them about a foot apart and parallel so as to\nform a kind of shelf, upon which I placed the keg, and steadied it in a\nhorizontal position. About eight inches immediately below these ropes,\nand four feet from the bottom of the car I fastened another shelf--but\nmade of thin plank, being the only similar piece of wood I had. Upon\nthis latter shelf, and exactly beneath one of the rims of the keg, a\nsmall earthern pitcher was deposited. I now bored a hole in the end of\nthe keg over the pitcher, and fitted in a plug of soft wood, cut in a\ntapering or conical shape. This plug I pushed in or pulled out, as might\nhappen, until, after a few experiments, it arrived at that exact degree\nof tightness, at which the water, oozing from the hole, and falling into\nthe pitcher below, would fill the latter to the brim in the period\nof sixty minutes. This, of course, was a matter briefly and easily\nascertained, by noticing the proportion of the pitcher filled in any\ngiven time. Having arranged all this, the rest of the plan is obvious.\nMy bed was so contrived upon the floor of the car, as to bring my\nhead, in lying down, immediately below the mouth of the pitcher. It was\nevident, that, at the expiration of an hour, the pitcher, getting full,\nwould be forced to run over, and to run over at the mouth, which was\nsomewhat lower than the rim. It was also evident, that the water thus\nfalling from a height of more than four feet, could not do otherwise\nthan fall upon my face, and that the sure consequences would be, to\nwaken me up instantaneously, even from the soundest slumber in the\nworld.\n\n“It was fully eleven by the time I had completed these arrangements,\nand I immediately betook myself to bed, with full confidence in the\nefficiency of my invention. Nor in this matter was I disappointed.\nPunctually every sixty minutes was I aroused by my trusty chronometer,\nwhen, having emptied the pitcher into the bung-hole of the keg, and\nperformed the duties of the condenser, I retired again to bed. These\nregular interruptions to my slumber caused me even less discomfort than\nI had anticipated; and when I finally arose for the day, it was seven\no’clock, and the sun had attained many degrees above the line of my\nhorizon.\n\n“April 3d. I found the balloon at an immense height indeed, and the\nearth’s apparent convexity increased in a material degree. Below me in\nthe ocean lay a cluster of black specks, which undoubtedly were islands.\nFar away to the northward I perceived a thin, white, and exceedingly\nbrilliant line, or streak, on the edge of the horizon, and I had no\nhesitation in supposing it to be the southern disk of the ices of the\nPolar Sea. My curiosity was greatly excited, for I had hopes of passing\non much farther to the north, and might possibly, at some period, find\nmyself placed directly above the Pole itself. I now lamented that my\ngreat elevation would, in this case, prevent my taking as accurate a\nsurvey as I could wish. Much, however, might be ascertained. Nothing\nelse of an extraordinary nature occurred during the day. My apparatus\nall continued in good order, and the balloon still ascended without any\nperceptible vacillation. The cold was intense, and obliged me to wrap\nup closely in an overcoat. When darkness came over the earth, I betook\nmyself to bed, although it was for many hours afterward broad daylight\nall around my immediate situation. The water-clock was punctual in its\nduty, and I slept until next morning soundly, with the exception of the\nperiodical interruption.\n\n“April 4th. Arose in good health and spirits, and was astonished at the\nsingular change which had taken place in the appearance of the sea.\nIt had lost, in a great measure, the deep tint of blue it had hitherto\nworn, being now of a grayish-white, and of a lustre dazzling to the eye.\nThe islands were no longer visible; whether they had passed down the\nhorizon to the southeast, or whether my increasing elevation had left\nthem out of sight, it is impossible to say. I was inclined, however, to\nthe latter opinion. The rim of ice to the northward was growing more\nand more apparent. Cold by no means so intense. Nothing of importance\noccurred, and I passed the day in reading, having taken care to supply\nmyself with books.\n\n“April 5th. Beheld the singular phenomenon of the sun rising while\nnearly the whole visible surface of the earth continued to be involved\nin darkness. In time, however, the light spread itself over all, and I\nagain saw the line of ice to the northward. It was now very distinct,\nand appeared of a much darker hue than the waters of the ocean. I was\nevidently approaching it, and with great rapidity. Fancied I could\nagain distinguish a strip of land to the eastward, and one also to the\nwestward, but could not be certain. Weather moderate. Nothing of any\nconsequence happened during the day. Went early to bed.\n\n“April 6th. Was surprised at finding the rim of ice at a very moderate\ndistance, and an immense field of the same material stretching away off\nto the horizon in the north. It was evident that if the balloon held its\npresent course, it would soon arrive above the Frozen Ocean, and I had\nnow little doubt of ultimately seeing the Pole. During the whole of the\nday I continued to near the ice. Toward night the limits of my horizon\nvery suddenly and materially increased, owing undoubtedly to the\nearth’s form being that of an oblate spheroid, and my arriving above the\nflattened regions in the vicinity of the Arctic circle. When darkness at\nlength overtook me, I went to bed in great anxiety, fearing to pass over\nthe object of so much curiosity when I should have no opportunity of\nobserving it.\n\n“April 7th. Arose early, and, to my great joy, at length beheld what\nthere could be no hesitation in supposing the northern Pole itself. It\nwas there, beyond a doubt, and immediately beneath my feet; but, alas! I\nhad now ascended to so vast a distance, that nothing could with accuracy\nbe discerned. Indeed, to judge from the progression of the numbers\nindicating my various altitudes, respectively, at different periods,\nbetween six A.M. on the second of April, and twenty minutes before nine\nA.M. of the same day (at which time the barometer ran down), it might be\nfairly inferred that the balloon had now, at four o’clock in the morning\nof April the seventh, reached a height of not less, certainly, than\n7,254 miles above the surface of the sea. This elevation may appear\nimmense, but the estimate upon which it is calculated gave a result in\nall probability far inferior to the truth. At all events I undoubtedly\nbeheld the whole of the earth’s major diameter; the entire northern\nhemisphere lay beneath me like a chart orthographically projected: and\nthe great circle of the equator itself formed the boundary line of\nmy horizon. Your Excellencies may, however, readily imagine that the\nconfined regions hitherto unexplored within the limits of the Arctic\ncircle, although situated directly beneath me, and therefore seen\nwithout any appearance of being foreshortened, were still, in\nthemselves, comparatively too diminutive, and at too great a distance\nfrom the point of sight, to admit of any very accurate examination.\nNevertheless, what could be seen was of a nature singular and exciting.\nNorthwardly from that huge rim before mentioned, and which, with slight\nqualification, may be called the limit of human discovery in these\nregions, one unbroken, or nearly unbroken, sheet of ice continues to\nextend. In the first few degrees of this its progress, its surface is\nvery sensibly flattened, farther on depressed into a plane, and finally,\nbecoming not a little concave, it terminates, at the Pole itself, in a\ncircular centre, sharply defined, whose apparent diameter subtended at\nthe balloon an angle of about sixty-five seconds, and whose dusky hue,\nvarying in intensity, was, at all times, darker than any other spot upon\nthe visible hemisphere, and occasionally deepened into the most\nabsolute and impenetrable blackness. Farther than this, little could\nbe ascertained. By twelve o’clock the circular centre had materially\ndecreased in circumference, and by seven P.M. I lost sight of it\nentirely; the balloon passing over the western limb of the ice, and\nfloating away rapidly in the direction of the equator.\n\n“April 8th. Found a sensible diminution in the earth’s apparent\ndiameter, besides a material alteration in its general color and\nappearance. The whole visible area partook in different degrees of a\ntint of pale yellow, and in some portions had acquired a brilliancy even\npainful to the eye. My view downward was also considerably impeded by\nthe dense atmosphere in the vicinity of the surface being loaded with\nclouds, between whose masses I could only now and then obtain a glimpse\nof the earth itself. This difficulty of direct vision had troubled me\nmore or less for the last forty-eight hours; but my present enormous\nelevation brought closer together, as it were, the floating bodies of\nvapor, and the inconvenience became, of course, more and more palpable\nin proportion to my ascent. Nevertheless, I could easily perceive that\nthe balloon now hovered above the range of great lakes in the continent\nof North America, and was holding a course, due south, which would bring\nme to the tropics. This circumstance did not fail to give me the most\nheartful satisfaction, and I hailed it as a happy omen of ultimate\nsuccess. Indeed, the direction I had hitherto taken, had filled me with\nuneasiness; for it was evident that, had I continued it much longer,\nthere would have been no possibility of my arriving at the moon at all,\nwhose orbit is inclined to the ecliptic at only the small angle of 5\ndegrees 8’ 48”.\n\n“April 9th. To-day the earth’s diameter was greatly diminished, and the\ncolor of the surface assumed hourly a deeper tint of yellow. The balloon\nkept steadily on her course to the southward, and arrived, at nine P.M.,\nover the northern edge of the Mexican Gulf.\n\n“April 10th. I was suddenly aroused from slumber, about five o’clock\nthis morning, by a loud, crackling, and terrific sound, for which I\ncould in no manner account. It was of very brief duration, but, while\nit lasted resembled nothing in the world of which I had any previous\nexperience. It is needless to say that I became excessively alarmed,\nhaving, in the first instance, attributed the noise to the bursting of\nthe balloon. I examined all my apparatus, however, with great attention,\nand could discover nothing out of order. Spent a great part of the day\nin meditating upon an occurrence so extraordinary, but could find no\nmeans whatever of accounting for it. Went to bed dissatisfied, and in a\nstate of great anxiety and agitation.\n\n“April 11th. Found a startling diminution in the apparent diameter of\nthe earth, and a considerable increase, now observable for the first\ntime, in that of the moon itself, which wanted only a few days of being\nfull. It now required long and excessive labor to condense within the\nchamber sufficient atmospheric air for the sustenance of life.\n\n“April 12th. A singular alteration took place in regard to the direction\nof the balloon, and although fully anticipated, afforded me the most\nunequivocal delight. Having reached, in its former course, about the\ntwentieth parallel of southern latitude, it turned off suddenly, at an\nacute angle, to the eastward, and thus proceeded throughout the day,\nkeeping nearly, if not altogether, in the exact plane of the lunar\nelipse. What was worthy of remark, a very perceptible vacillation in\nthe car was a consequence of this change of route--a vacillation which\nprevailed, in a more or less degree, for a period of many hours.\n\n“April 13th. Was again very much alarmed by a repetition of the loud,\ncrackling noise which terrified me on the tenth. Thought long upon\nthe subject, but was unable to form any satisfactory conclusion. Great\ndecrease in the earth’s apparent diameter, which now subtended from the\nballoon an angle of very little more than twenty-five degrees. The moon\ncould not be seen at all, being nearly in my zenith. I still continued\nin the plane of the elipse, but made little progress to the eastward.\n\n“April 14th. Extremely rapid decrease in the diameter of the earth.\nTo-day I became strongly impressed with the idea, that the balloon was\nnow actually running up the line of apsides to the point of perigee--in\nother words, holding the direct course which would bring it immediately\nto the moon in that part of its orbit the nearest to the earth. The moon\nitself was directly overhead, and consequently hidden from my view.\nGreat and long-continued labor necessary for the condensation of the\natmosphere.\n\n“April 15th. Not even the outlines of continents and seas could now\nbe traced upon the earth with anything approaching distinctness. About\ntwelve o’clock I became aware, for the third time, of that appalling\nsound which had so astonished me before. It now, however, continued for\nsome moments, and gathered intensity as it continued. At length, while,\nstupefied and terror-stricken, I stood in expectation of I knew not what\nhideous destruction, the car vibrated with excessive violence, and\na gigantic and flaming mass of some material which I could not\ndistinguish, came with a voice of a thousand thunders, roaring and\nbooming by the balloon. When my fears and astonishment had in some\ndegree subsided, I had little difficulty in supposing it to be some\nmighty volcanic fragment ejected from that world to which I was so\nrapidly approaching, and, in all probability, one of that singular class\nof substances occasionally picked up on the earth, and termed meteoric\nstones for want of a better appellation.\n\n“April 16th. To-day, looking upward as well as I could, through each\nof the side windows alternately, I beheld, to my great delight, a very\nsmall portion of the moon’s disk protruding, as it were, on all sides\nbeyond the huge circumference of the balloon. My agitation was extreme;\nfor I had now little doubt of soon reaching the end of my perilous\nvoyage. Indeed, the labor now required by the condenser had increased\nto a most oppressive degree, and allowed me scarcely any respite from\nexertion. Sleep was a matter nearly out of the question. I became quite\nill, and my frame trembled with exhaustion. It was impossible that human\nnature could endure this state of intense suffering much longer. During\nthe now brief interval of darkness a meteoric stone again passed in my\nvicinity, and the frequency of these phenomena began to occasion me much\napprehension.\n\n“April 17th. This morning proved an epoch in my voyage. It will be\nremembered that, on the thirteenth, the earth subtended an angular\nbreadth of twenty-five degrees. On the fourteenth this had greatly\ndiminished; on the fifteenth a still more remarkable decrease was\nobservable; and, on retiring on the night of the sixteenth, I had\nnoticed an angle of no more than about seven degrees and fifteen\nminutes. What, therefore, must have been my amazement, on awakening\nfrom a brief and disturbed slumber, on the morning of this day,\nthe seventeenth, at finding the surface beneath me so suddenly and\nwonderfully augmented in volume, as to subtend no less than thirty-nine\ndegrees in apparent angular diameter! I was thunderstruck! No words\ncan give any adequate idea of the extreme, the absolute horror and\nastonishment, with which I was seized possessed, and altogether\noverwhelmed. My knees tottered beneath me--my teeth chattered--my hair\nstarted up on end. “The balloon, then, had actually burst!” These were\nthe first tumultuous ideas that hurried through my mind: “The balloon\nhad positively burst!--I was falling--falling with the most impetuous,\nthe most unparalleled velocity! To judge by the immense distance already\nso quickly passed over, it could not be more than ten minutes, at the\nfarthest, before I should meet the surface of the earth, and be hurled\ninto annihilation!” But at length reflection came to my relief. I\npaused; I considered; and I began to doubt. The matter was impossible.\nI could not in any reason have so rapidly come down. Besides, although\nI was evidently approaching the surface below me, it was with a speed\nby no means commensurate with the velocity I had at first so horribly\nconceived. This consideration served to calm the perturbation of my\nmind, and I finally succeeded in regarding the phenomenon in its proper\npoint of view. In fact, amazement must have fairly deprived me of my\nsenses, when I could not see the vast difference, in appearance, between\nthe surface below me, and the surface of my mother earth. The latter\nwas indeed over my head, and completely hidden by the balloon, while the\nmoon--the moon itself in all its glory--lay beneath me, and at my feet.\n\n“The stupor and surprise produced in my mind by this extraordinary\nchange in the posture of affairs was perhaps, after all, that part of\nthe adventure least susceptible of explanation. For the bouleversement\nin itself was not only natural and inevitable, but had been long\nactually anticipated as a circumstance to be expected whenever I should\narrive at that exact point of my voyage where the attraction of the\nplanet should be superseded by the attraction of the satellite--or, more\nprecisely, where the gravitation of the balloon toward the earth should\nbe less powerful than its gravitation toward the moon. To be sure I\narose from a sound slumber, with all my senses in confusion, to the\ncontemplation of a very startling phenomenon, and one which, although\nexpected, was not expected at the moment. The revolution itself must, of\ncourse, have taken place in an easy and gradual manner, and it is by no\nmeans clear that, had I even been awake at the time of the occurrence,\nI should have been made aware of it by any internal evidence of an\ninversion--that is to say, by any inconvenience or disarrangement,\neither about my person or about my apparatus.\n\n“It is almost needless to say that, upon coming to a due sense of my\nsituation, and emerging from the terror which had absorbed every faculty\nof my soul, my attention was, in the first place, wholly directed to\nthe contemplation of the general physical appearance of the moon. It\nlay beneath me like a chart--and although I judged it to be still at no\ninconsiderable distance, the indentures of its surface were defined\nto my vision with a most striking and altogether unaccountable\ndistinctness. The entire absence of ocean or sea, and indeed of any lake\nor river, or body of water whatsoever, struck me, at first glance, as\nthe most extraordinary feature in its geological condition. Yet, strange\nto say, I beheld vast level regions of a character decidedly alluvial,\nalthough by far the greater portion of the hemisphere in sight was\ncovered with innumerable volcanic mountains, conical in shape, and\nhaving more the appearance of artificial than of natural protuberance.\nThe highest among them does not exceed three and three-quarter miles\nin perpendicular elevation; but a map of the volcanic districts of the\nCampi Phlegraei would afford to your Excellencies a better idea of their\ngeneral surface than any unworthy description I might think proper to\nattempt. The greater part of them were in a state of evident eruption,\nand gave me fearfully to understand their fury and their power, by the\nrepeated thunders of the miscalled meteoric stones, which now rushed\nupward by the balloon with a frequency more and more appalling.\n\n“April 18th. To-day I found an enormous increase in the moon’s apparent\nbulk--and the evidently accelerated velocity of my descent began to fill\nme with alarm. It will be remembered, that, in the earliest stage of\nmy speculations upon the possibility of a passage to the moon, the\nexistence, in its vicinity, of an atmosphere, dense in proportion to the\nbulk of the planet, had entered largely into my calculations; this too\nin spite of many theories to the contrary, and, it may be added, in\nspite of a general disbelief in the existence of any lunar atmosphere at\nall. But, in addition to what I have already urged in regard to Encke’s\ncomet and the zodiacal light, I had been strengthened in my opinion by\ncertain observations of Mr. Schroeter, of Lilienthal. He observed the\nmoon when two days and a half old, in the evening soon after sunset,\nbefore the dark part was visible, and continued to watch it until it\nbecame visible. The two cusps appeared tapering in a very sharp faint\nprolongation, each exhibiting its farthest extremity faintly illuminated\nby the solar rays, before any part of the dark hemisphere was\nvisible. Soon afterward, the whole dark limb became illuminated. This\nprolongation of the cusps beyond the semicircle, I thought, must have\narisen from the refraction of the sun’s rays by the moon’s atmosphere. I\ncomputed, also, the height of the atmosphere (which could refract light\nenough into its dark hemisphere to produce a twilight more luminous than\nthe light reflected from the earth when the moon is about 32 degrees\nfrom the new) to be 1,356 Paris feet; in this view, I supposed the\ngreatest height capable of refracting the solar ray, to be 5,376 feet.\nMy ideas on this topic had also received confirmation by a passage in\nthe eighty-second volume of the Philosophical Transactions, in which\nit is stated that at an occultation of Jupiter’s satellites, the third\ndisappeared after having been about 1” or 2” of time indistinct, and the\nfourth became indiscernible near the limb.(*4)\n\n“Cassini frequently observed Saturn, Jupiter, and the fixed stars,\nwhen approaching the moon to occultation, to have their circular figure\nchanged into an oval one; and, in other occultations, he found no\nalteration of figure at all. Hence it might be supposed, that at some\ntimes and not at others, there is a dense matter encompassing the moon\nwherein the rays of the stars are refracted.\n\n“Upon the resistance or, more properly, upon the support of an\natmosphere, existing in the state of density imagined, I had, of course,\nentirely depended for the safety of my ultimate descent. Should I then,\nafter all, prove to have been mistaken, I had in consequence nothing\nbetter to expect, as a finale to my adventure, than being dashed into\natoms against the rugged surface of the satellite. And, indeed, I\nhad now every reason to be terrified. My distance from the moon was\ncomparatively trifling, while the labor required by the condenser was\ndiminished not at all, and I could discover no indication whatever of a\ndecreasing rarity in the air.\n\n“April 19th. This morning, to my great joy, about nine o’clock, the\nsurface of the moon being frightfully near, and my apprehensions excited\nto the utmost, the pump of my condenser at length gave evident tokens\nof an alteration in the atmosphere. By ten, I had reason to believe\nits density considerably increased. By eleven, very little labor was\nnecessary at the apparatus; and at twelve o’clock, with some hesitation,\nI ventured to unscrew the tourniquet, when, finding no inconvenience\nfrom having done so, I finally threw open the gum-elastic chamber, and\nunrigged it from around the car. As might have been expected, spasms\nand violent headache were the immediate consequences of an experiment\nso precipitate and full of danger. But these and other difficulties\nattending respiration, as they were by no means so great as to put me\nin peril of my life, I determined to endure as I best could, in\nconsideration of my leaving them behind me momently in my approach\nto the denser strata near the moon. This approach, however, was still\nimpetuous in the extreme; and it soon became alarmingly certain that,\nalthough I had probably not been deceived in the expectation of an\natmosphere dense in proportion to the mass of the satellite, still I\nhad been wrong in supposing this density, even at the surface, at all\nadequate to the support of the great weight contained in the car of my\nballoon. Yet this should have been the case, and in an equal degree\nas at the surface of the earth, the actual gravity of bodies at either\nplanet supposed in the ratio of the atmospheric condensation. That\nit was not the case, however, my precipitous downfall gave testimony\nenough; why it was not so, can only be explained by a reference to those\npossible geological disturbances to which I have formerly alluded. At\nall events I was now close upon the planet, and coming down with the\nmost terrible impetuosity. I lost not a moment, accordingly, in throwing\noverboard first my ballast, then my water-kegs, then my condensing\napparatus and gum-elastic chamber, and finally every article within the\ncar. But it was all to no purpose. I still fell with horrible rapidity,\nand was now not more than half a mile from the surface. As a last\nresource, therefore, having got rid of my coat, hat, and boots, I cut\nloose from the balloon the car itself, which was of no inconsiderable\nweight, and thus, clinging with both hands to the net-work, I had barely\ntime to observe that the whole country, as far as the eye could reach,\nwas thickly interspersed with diminutive habitations, ere I tumbled\nheadlong into the very heart of a fantastical-looking city, and into the\nmiddle of a vast crowd of ugly little people, who none of them uttered\na single syllable, or gave themselves the least trouble to render me\nassistance, but stood, like a parcel of idiots, grinning in a ludicrous\nmanner, and eyeing me and my balloon askant, with their arms set\na-kimbo. I turned from them in contempt, and, gazing upward at the earth\nso lately left, and left perhaps for ever, beheld it like a huge, dull,\ncopper shield, about two degrees in diameter, fixed immovably in the\nheavens overhead, and tipped on one of its edges with a crescent\nborder of the most brilliant gold. No traces of land or water could be\ndiscovered, and the whole was clouded with variable spots, and belted\nwith tropical and equatorial zones.\n\n“Thus, may it please your Excellencies, after a series of great\nanxieties, unheard of dangers, and unparalleled escapes, I had, at\nlength, on the nineteenth day of my departure from Rotterdam, arrived in\nsafety at the conclusion of a voyage undoubtedly the most extraordinary,\nand the most momentous, ever accomplished, undertaken, or conceived by\nany denizen of earth. But my adventures yet remain to be related. And\nindeed your Excellencies may well imagine that, after a residence of\nfive years upon a planet not only deeply interesting in its own peculiar\ncharacter, but rendered doubly so by its intimate connection, in\ncapacity of satellite, with the world inhabited by man, I may have\nintelligence for the private ear of the States’ College of Astronomers\nof far more importance than the details, however wonderful, of the mere\nvoyage which so happily concluded. This is, in fact, the case. I\nhave much--very much which it would give me the greatest pleasure to\ncommunicate. I have much to say of the climate of the planet; of its\nwonderful alternations of heat and cold, of unmitigated and burning\nsunshine for one fortnight, and more than polar frigidity for the next;\nof a constant transfer of moisture, by distillation like that in vacuo,\nfrom the point beneath the sun to the point the farthest from it; of\na variable zone of running water, of the people themselves; of their\nmanners, customs, and political institutions; of their peculiar physical\nconstruction; of their ugliness; of their want of ears, those useless\nappendages in an atmosphere so peculiarly modified; of their consequent\nignorance of the use and properties of speech; of their substitute\nfor speech in a singular method of inter-communication; of the\nincomprehensible connection between each particular individual in\nthe moon with some particular individual on the earth--a connection\nanalogous with, and depending upon, that of the orbs of the planet and\nthe satellites, and by means of which the lives and destinies of the\ninhabitants of the one are interwoven with the lives and destinies\nof the inhabitants of the other; and above all, if it so please your\nExcellencies--above all, of those dark and hideous mysteries which lie\nin the outer regions of the moon--regions which, owing to the almost\nmiraculous accordance of the satellite’s rotation on its own axis with\nits sidereal revolution about the earth, have never yet been turned,\nand, by God’s mercy, never shall be turned, to the scrutiny of the\ntelescopes of man. All this, and more--much more--would I most\nwillingly detail. But, to be brief, I must have my reward. I am pining\nfor a return to my family and to my home, and as the price of any\nfarther communication on my part--in consideration of the light which\nI have it in my power to throw upon many very important branches of\nphysical and metaphysical science--I must solicit, through the influence\nof your honorable body, a pardon for the crime of which I have been\nguilty in the death of the creditors upon my departure from Rotterdam.\nThis, then, is the object of the present paper. Its bearer, an\ninhabitant of the moon, whom I have prevailed upon, and properly\ninstructed, to be my messenger to the earth, will await your\nExcellencies’ pleasure, and return to me with the pardon in question, if\nit can, in any manner, be obtained.\n\n“I have the honor to be, etc., your Excellencies’ very humble servant,\n\n“HANS PFAALL.”\n\nUpon finishing the perusal of this very extraordinary document,\nProfessor Rub-a-dub, it is said, dropped his pipe upon the ground in\nthe extremity of his surprise, and Mynheer Superbus Von Underduk having\ntaken off his spectacles, wiped them, and deposited them in his pocket,\nso far forgot both himself and his dignity, as to turn round three times\nupon his heel in the quintessence of astonishment and admiration. There\nwas no doubt about the matter--the pardon should be obtained. So at\nleast swore, with a round oath, Professor Rub-a-dub, and so finally\nthought the illustrious Von Underduk, as he took the arm of his brother\nin science, and without saying a word, began to make the best of his way\nhome to deliberate upon the measures to be adopted. Having reached the\ndoor, however, of the burgomaster’s dwelling, the professor ventured to\nsuggest that as the messenger had thought proper to disappear--no\ndoubt frightened to death by the savage appearance of the burghers of\nRotterdam--the pardon would be of little use, as no one but a man of\nthe moon would undertake a voyage to so vast a distance. To the truth of\nthis observation the burgomaster assented, and the matter was therefore\nat an end. Not so, however, rumors and speculations. The letter, having\nbeen published, gave rise to a variety of gossip and opinion. Some of\nthe over-wise even made themselves ridiculous by decrying the whole\nbusiness; as nothing better than a hoax. But hoax, with these sort\nof people, is, I believe, a general term for all matters above their\ncomprehension. For my part, I cannot conceive upon what data they have\nfounded such an accusation. Let us see what they say:\n\nImprimus. That certain wags in Rotterdam have certain especial\nantipathies to certain burgomasters and astronomers.\n\nDon’t understand at all.\n\nSecondly. That an odd little dwarf and bottle conjurer, both of whose\nears, for some misdemeanor, have been cut off close to his head, has\nbeen missing for several days from the neighboring city of Bruges.\n\nWell--what of that?\n\nThirdly. That the newspapers which were stuck all over the little\nballoon were newspapers of Holland, and therefore could not have been\nmade in the moon. They were dirty papers--very dirty--and Gluck, the\nprinter, would take his Bible oath to their having been printed in\nRotterdam.\n\nHe was mistaken--undoubtedly--mistaken.\n\nFourthly, That Hans Pfaall himself, the drunken villain, and the three\nvery idle gentlemen styled his creditors, were all seen, no longer than\ntwo or three days ago, in a tippling house in the suburbs, having just\nreturned, with money in their pockets, from a trip beyond the sea.\n\nDon’t believe it--don’t believe a word of it.\n\nLastly. That it is an opinion very generally received, or which ought\nto be generally received, that the College of Astronomers in the city\nof Rotterdam, as well as other colleges in all other parts of the\nworld,--not to mention colleges and astronomers in general,--are, to say\nthe least of the matter, not a whit better, nor greater, nor wiser than\nthey ought to be.\n\n~~~ End of Text ~~~\n\nNotes to Hans Pfaal\n\n(*1) NOTE--Strictly speaking, there is but little similarity between the\nabove sketchy trifle and the celebrated “Moon-Story” of Mr. Locke; but\nas both have the character of _hoaxes _(although the one is in a tone of\nbanter, the other of downright earnest), and as both hoaxes are on the\nsame subject, the moon--moreover, as both attempt to give plausibility\nby scientific detail--the author of “Hans Pfaall” thinks it necessary to\nsay, in _self-defence, _that his own _jeu d’esprit _was published in the\n“Southern Literary Messenger” about three weeks before the commencement\nof Mr. L’s in the “New York Sun.” Fancying a likeness which, perhaps,\ndoes not exist, some of the New York papers copied “Hans Pfaall,” and\ncollated it with the “Moon-Hoax,” by way of detecting the writer of the\none in the writer of the other.\n\nAs many more persons were actually gulled by the “Moon-Hoax” than would\nbe willing to acknowledge the fact, it may here afford some little\namusement to show why no one should have been deceived-to point out\nthose particulars of the story which should have been sufficient to\nestablish its real character. Indeed, however rich the imagination\ndisplayed in this ingenious fiction, it wanted much of the force which\nmight have been given it by a more scrupulous attention to facts and\nto general analogy. That the public were misled, even for an instant,\nmerely proves the gross ignorance which is so generally prevalent upon\nsubjects of an astronomical nature.\n\nThe moon’s distance from the earth is, in round numbers, 240,000 miles.\nIf we desire to ascertain how near, apparently, a lens would bring the\nsatellite (or any distant object), we, of course, have but to divide the\ndistance by the magnifying or, more strictly, by the space-penetrating\npower of the glass. Mr. L. makes his lens have a power of 42,000 times.\nBy this divide 240,000 (the moon’s real distance), and we have five\nmiles and five sevenths, as the apparent distance. No animal at all\ncould be seen so far; much less the minute points particularized in the\nstory. Mr. L. speaks about Sir John Herschel’s perceiving flowers (the\nPapaver rheas, etc.), and even detecting the color and the shape of the\neyes of small birds. Shortly before, too, he has himself observed that\nthe lens would not render perceptible objects of less than eighteen\ninches in diameter; but even this, as I have said, is giving the glass\nby far too great power. It may be observed, in passing, that this\nprodigious glass is said to have been molded at the glasshouse of\nMessrs. Hartley and Grant, in Dumbarton; but Messrs. H. and G.’s\nestablishment had ceased operations for many years previous to the\npublication of the hoax.\n\nOn page 13, pamphlet edition, speaking of “a hairy veil” over the eyes\nof a species of bison, the author says: “It immediately occurred to the\nacute mind of Dr. Herschel that this was a providential contrivance\nto protect the eyes of the animal from the great extremes of light\nand darkness to which all the inhabitants of our side of the moon are\nperiodically subjected.” But this cannot be thought a very “acute”\n observation of the Doctor’s. The inhabitants of our side of the moon\nhave, evidently, no darkness at all, so there can be nothing of the\n“extremes” mentioned. In the absence of the sun they have a light from\nthe earth equal to that of thirteen full unclouded moons.\n\nThe topography throughout, even when professing to accord with Blunt’s\nLunar Chart, is entirely at variance with that or any other lunar chart,\nand even grossly at variance with itself. The points of the compass,\ntoo, are in inextricable confusion; the writer appearing to be ignorant\nthat, on a lunar map, these are not in accordance with terrestrial\npoints; the east being to the left, etc.\n\nDeceived, perhaps, by the vague titles, Mare Nubium, Mare\nTranquillitatis, Mare Faecunditatis, etc., given to the dark spots by\nformer astronomers, Mr. L. has entered into details regarding oceans\nand other large bodies of water in the moon; whereas there is no\nastronomical point more positively ascertained than that no such bodies\nexist there. In examining the boundary between light and darkness (in\nthe crescent or gibbous moon) where this boundary crosses any of the\ndark places, the line of division is found to be rough and jagged; but,\nwere these dark places liquid, it would evidently be even.\n\nThe description of the wings of the man-bat, on page 21, is but a\nliteral copy of Peter Wilkins’ account of the wings of his flying\nislanders. This simple fact should have induced suspicion, at least, it\nmight be thought.\n\nOn page 23, we have the following: “What a prodigious influence must our\nthirteen times larger globe have exercised upon this satellite when an\nembryo in the womb of time, the passive subject of chemical affinity!”\n This is very fine; but it should be observed that no astronomer would\nhave made such remark, especially to any journal of Science; for the\nearth, in the sense intended, is not only thirteen, but forty-nine times\nlarger than the moon. A similar objection applies to the whole of the\nconcluding pages, where, by way of introduction to some discoveries in\nSaturn, the philosophical correspondent enters into a minute schoolboy\naccount of that planet--this to the “Edinburgh journal of Science!”\n\nBut there is one point, in particular, which should have betrayed the\nfiction. Let us imagine the power actually possessed of seeing animals\nupon the moon’s surface--what would first arrest the attention of an\nobserver from the earth? Certainly neither their shape, size, nor any\nother such peculiarity, so soon as their remarkable _situation_. They\nwould appear to be walking, with heels up and head down, in the manner\nof flies on a ceiling. The _real_ observer would have uttered an instant\nejaculation of surprise (however prepared by previous knowledge) at the\nsingularity of their position; the _fictitious_ observer has not even\nmentioned the subject, but speaks of seeing the entire bodies of such\ncreatures, when it is demonstrable that he could have seen only the\ndiameter of their heads!\n\nIt might as well be remarked, in conclusion, that the size, and\nparticularly the powers of the man-bats (for example, their ability to\nfly in so rare an atmosphere--if, indeed, the moon have any), with most\nof the other fancies in regard to animal and vegetable existence, are at\nvariance, generally, with all analogical reasoning on these themes; and\nthat analogy here will often amount to conclusive demonstration. It is,\nperhaps, scarcely necessary to add, that all the suggestions attributed\nto Brewster and Herschel, in the beginning of the article, about “a\ntransfusion of artificial light through the focal object of vision,”\n etc., etc., belong to that species of figurative writing which comes,\nmost properly, under the denomination of rigmarole.\n\nThere is a real and very definite limit to optical discovery among the\nstars--a limit whose nature need only be stated to be understood. If,\nindeed, the casting of large lenses were all that is required, man’s\ningenuity would ultimately prove equal to the task, and we might have\nthem of any size demanded. But, unhappily, in proportion to the increase\nof size in the lens, and consequently of space-penetrating power, is the\ndiminution of light from the object, by diffusion of its rays. And for\nthis evil there is no remedy within human ability; for an object is seen\nby means of that light alone which proceeds from itself, whether direct\nor reflected. Thus the only “artificial” light which could avail\nMr. Locke, would be some artificial light which he should be able to\nthrow-not upon the “focal object of vision,” but upon the real object\nto be viewed-to wit: upon the moon. It has been easily calculated that,\nwhen the light proceeding from a star becomes so diffused as to be as\nweak as the natural light proceeding from the whole of the stars, in\na clear and moonless night, then the star is no longer visible for any\npractical purpose.\n\nThe Earl of Ross’s telescope, lately constructed in England, has\na _speculum_ with a reflecting surface of 4,071 square inches; the\nHerschel telescope having one of only 1,811. The metal of the Earl of\nRoss’s is 6 feet diameter; it is 5 1/2 inches thick at the edges, and 5\nat the centre. The weight is 3 tons. The focal length is 50 feet.\n\nI have lately read a singular and somewhat ingenious little book, whose\ntitle-page runs thus: “L’Homme dans la lvne ou le Voyage Chimerique\nfait au Monde de la Lvne, nouellement decouvert par Dominique Gonzales,\nAduanturier Espagnol, autrem?t dit le Courier volant. Mis en notre\nlangve par J. B. D. A. Paris, chez Francois Piot, pres la Fontaine de\nSaint Benoist. Et chez J. Goignard, au premier pilier de la grand’salle\ndu Palais, proche les Consultations, MDCXLVII.” Pp. 76.\n\nThe writer professes to have translated his work from the English of one\nMr. D’Avisson (Davidson?) although there is a terrible ambiguity in the\nstatement. “J’ en ai eu,” says he “l’original de Monsieur D’Avisson,\nmedecin des mieux versez qui soient aujourd’huy dans la cõnoissance des\nBelles Lettres, et sur tout de la Philosophic Naturelle. Je lui ai cette\nobligation entre les autres, de m’ auoir non seulement mis en main\ncc Livre en anglois, mais encore le Manuscrit du Sieur Thomas D’Anan,\ngentilhomme Eccossois, recommandable pour sa vertu, sur la version\nduquel j’ advoue que j’ ay tiré le plan de la mienne.”\n\nAfter some irrelevant adventures, much in the manner of Gil Blas, and\nwhich occupy the first thirty pages, the author relates that, being\nill during a sea voyage, the crew abandoned him, together with a\nnegro servant, on the island of St. Helena. To increase the chances of\nobtaining food, the two separate, and live as far apart as possible.\nThis brings about a training of birds, to serve the purpose of\ncarrier-pigeons between them. By and by these are taught to carry\nparcels of some weight-and this weight is gradually increased. At length\nthe idea is entertained of uniting the force of a great number of the\nbirds, with a view to raising the author himself. A machine is contrived\nfor the purpose, and we have a minute description of it, which is\nmaterially helped out by a steel engraving. Here we perceive the\nSignor Gonzales, with point ruffles and a huge periwig, seated astride\nsomething which resembles very closely a broomstick, and borne aloft by\na multitude of wild swans _(ganzas) _who had strings reaching from their\ntails to the machine.\n\nThe main event detailed in the Signor’s narrative depends upon a very\nimportant fact, of which the reader is kept in ignorance until near the\nend of the book. The _ganzas, _with whom he had become so familiar, were\nnot really denizens of St. Helena, but of the moon. Thence it had been\ntheir custom, time out of mind, to migrate annually to some portion of\nthe earth. In proper season, of course, they would return home; and\nthe author, happening, one day, to require their services for a short\nvoyage, is unexpectedly carried straight tip, and in a very brief period\narrives at the satellite. Here he finds, among other odd things, that\nthe people enjoy extreme happiness; that they have no _law; _that they\ndie without pain; that they are from ten to thirty feet in height;\nthat they live five thousand years; that they have an emperor called\nIrdonozur; and that they can jump sixty feet high, when, being out of\nthe gravitating influence, they fly about with fans.\n\nI cannot forbear giving a specimen of the general _philosophy _of the\nvolume.\n\n“I must not forget here, that the stars appeared only on that side of\nthe globe turned toward the moon, and that the closer they were to it\nthe larger they seemed. I have also me and the earth. As to the\nstars, _since there was no night where I was, they always had the same\nappearance; not brilliant, as usual, but pale, and very nearly like the\nmoon of a morning. _But few of them were visible, and these ten times\nlarger (as well as I could judge) than they seem to the inhabitants\nof the earth. The moon, which wanted two days of being full, was of a\nterrible bigness.\n\n “I must not forget here, that the stars appeared only on that side\nof the globe turned toward the moon, and that the closer they were to it\nthe larger they seemed. I have also to inform you that, whether it was\ncalm weather or stormy, I found myself _always immediately between the\nmoon and the earth._ I_ _was convinced of this for two reasons-because\nmy birds always flew in a straight line; and because whenever we\nattempted to rest, _we were carried insensibly around the globe of the\nearth. _For I admit the opinion of Copernicus, who maintains that it\nnever ceases to revolve _from the east to the west, _not upon the poles\nof the Equinoctial, commonly called the poles of the world, but upon\nthose of the Zodiac, a question of which I propose to speak more at\nlength here-after, when I shall have leisure to refresh my memory in\nregard to the astrology which I learned at Salamanca when young, and\nhave since forgotten.”\n\nNotwithstanding the blunders italicized, the book is not without\nsome claim to attention, as affording a naive specimen of the current\nastronomical notions of the time. One of these assumed, that the\n“gravitating power” extended but a short distance from the earth’s\nsurface, and, accordingly, we find our voyager “carried insensibly\naround the globe,” etc.\n\nThere have been other “voyages to the moon,” but none of higher merit\nthan the one just mentioned. That of Bergerac is utterly meaningless. In\nthe third volume of the “American Quarterly Review” will be found\nquite an elaborate criticism upon a certain “journey” of the kind in\nquestion--a criticism in which it is difficult to say whether the critic\nmost exposes the stupidity of the book, or his own absurd ignorance of\nastronomy. I forget the title of the work; but the _means _of the voyage\nare more deplorably ill conceived than are even the _ganzas _of our\nfriend the Signor Gonzales. The adventurer, in digging the earth,\nhappens to discover a peculiar metal for which the moon has a strong\nattraction, and straightway constructs of it a box, which, when cast\nloose from its terrestrial fastenings, flies with him, forthwith, to\nthe satellite. The “Flight of Thomas O’Rourke,” is a _jeu d’ esprit _not\naltogether contemptible, and has been translated into German. Thomas,\nthe hero, was, in fact, the gamekeeper of an Irish peer, whose\neccentricities gave rise to the tale. The “flight” is made on an eagle’s\nback, from Hungry Hill, a lofty mountain at the end of Bantry Bay.\n\nIn these various _brochures _the aim is always satirical; the theme\nbeing a description of Lunarian customs as compared with ours. In none\nis there any effort at _plausibility _in the details of the voyage\nitself. The writers seem, in each instance, to be utterly uninformed in\nrespect to astronomy. In “Hans Pfaall” the design is original, inasmuch\nas regards an attempt at _verisimilitude, _in the application of\nscientific principles (so far as the whimsical nature of the subject\nwould permit), to the actual passage between the earth and the moon.\n\n(*2) The zodiacal light is probably what the ancients called Trabes.\nEmicant Trabes quos docos vocant.--Pliny, lib. 2, p. 26.\n\n(*3) Since the original publication of Hans Pfaall, I find that Mr.\nGreen, of Nassau balloon notoriety, and other late aeronauts, deny\nthe assertions of Humboldt, in this respect, and speak of a decreasing\ninconvenience,--precisely in accordance with the theory here urged in a\nmere spirit of banter.\n\n(*4) Havelius writes that he has several times found, in skies\nperfectly clear, when even stars of the sixth and seventh magnitude\nwere conspicuous, that, at the same altitude of the moon, at the\nsame elongation from the earth, and with one and the same excellent\ntelescope, the moon and its maculae did not appear equally lucid at all\ntimes. From the circumstances of the observation, it is evident that the\ncause of this phenomenon is not either in our air, in the tube, in\nthe moon, or in the eye of the spectator, but must be looked for in\nsomething (an atmosphere?) existing about the moon.\n\n\n\n\nTHE GOLD-BUG\n\n          What ho! what ho! this fellow is dancing mad!\n\n               He hath been bitten by the Tarantula.\n\n                    _--All in the Wrong._\n\nMANY years ago, I contracted an intimacy with a Mr. William Legrand.\nHe was of an ancient Huguenot family, and had once been wealthy; but\na series of misfortunes had reduced him to want. To avoid the\nmortification consequent upon his disasters, he left New Orleans, the\ncity of his forefathers, and took up his residence at Sullivan’s Island,\nnear Charleston, South Carolina. This Island is a very singular one.\nIt consists of little else than the sea sand, and is about three\nmiles long. Its breadth at no point exceeds a quarter of a mile. It is\nseparated from the main land by a scarcely perceptible creek, oozing its\nway through a wilderness of reeds and slime, a favorite resort of the\nmarsh hen. The vegetation, as might be supposed, is scant, or at least\ndwarfish. No trees of any magnitude are to be seen. Near the western\nextremity, where Fort Moultrie stands, and where are some miserable\nframe buildings, tenanted, during summer, by the fugitives from\nCharleston dust and fever, may be found, indeed, the bristly palmetto;\nbut the whole island, with the exception of this western point, and\na line of hard, white beach on the seacoast, is covered with a dense\nundergrowth of the sweet myrtle, so much prized by the horticulturists\nof England. The shrub here often attains the height of fifteen or twenty\nfeet, and forms an almost impenetrable coppice, burthening the air with\nits fragrance.\n\nIn the inmost recesses of this coppice, not far from the eastern or more\nremote end of the island, Legrand had built himself a small hut, which\nhe occupied when I first, by mere accident, made his acquaintance.\nThis soon ripened into friendship--for there was much in the recluse\nto excite interest and esteem. I found him well educated, with unusual\npowers of mind, but infected with misanthropy, and subject to perverse\nmoods of alternate enthusiasm and melancholy. He had with him many\nbooks, but rarely employed them. His chief amusements were gunning and\nfishing, or sauntering along the beach and through the myrtles, in quest\nof shells or entomological specimens;--his collection of the latter\nmight have been envied by a Swammerdamm. In these excursions he was\nusually accompanied by an old negro, called Jupiter, who had been\nmanumitted before the reverses of the family, but who could be induced,\nneither by threats nor by promises, to abandon what he considered his\nright of attendance upon the footsteps of his young “Massa Will.” It\nis not improbable that the relatives of Legrand, conceiving him to be\nsomewhat unsettled in intellect, had contrived to instil this obstinacy\ninto Jupiter, with a view to the supervision and guardianship of the\nwanderer.\n\nThe winters in the latitude of Sullivan’s Island are seldom very severe,\nand in the fall of the year it is a rare event indeed when a fire is\nconsidered necessary. About the middle of October, 18-, there occurred,\nhowever, a day of remarkable chilliness. Just before sunset I scrambled\nmy way through the evergreens to the hut of my friend, whom I had\nnot visited for several weeks--my residence being, at that time,\nin Charleston, a distance of nine miles from the Island, while the\nfacilities of passage and re-passage were very far behind those of\nthe present day. Upon reaching the hut I rapped, as was my custom,\nand getting no reply, sought for the key where I knew it was secreted,\nunlocked the door and went in. A fine fire was blazing upon the hearth.\nIt was a novelty, and by no means an ungrateful one. I threw off an\novercoat, took an arm-chair by the crackling logs, and awaited patiently\nthe arrival of my hosts.\n\nSoon after dark they arrived, and gave me a most cordial welcome.\nJupiter, grinning from ear to ear, bustled about to prepare some\nmarsh-hens for supper. Legrand was in one of his fits--how else shall\nI term them?--of enthusiasm. He had found an unknown bivalve, forming\na new genus, and, more than this, he had hunted down and secured, with\nJupiter’s assistance, a scarabæus which he believed to be totally new,\nbut in respect to which he wished to have my opinion on the morrow.\n\n“And why not to-night?” I asked, rubbing my hands over the blaze, and\nwishing the whole tribe of scarabæi at the devil.\n\n“Ah, if I had only known you were here!” said Legrand, “but it’s so long\nsince I saw you; and how could I foresee that you would pay me a visit\nthis very night of all others? As I was coming home I met Lieutenant\nG--, from the fort, and, very foolishly, I lent him the bug; so it will\nbe impossible for you to see it until the morning. Stay here to-night,\nand I will send Jup down for it at sunrise. It is the loveliest thing in\ncreation!”\n\n“What?--sunrise?”\n\n“Nonsense! no!--the bug. It is of a brilliant gold color--about the size\nof a large hickory-nut--with two jet black spots near one extremity of\nthe back, and another, somewhat longer, at the other. The antennæ are--”\n\n“Dey aint no tin in him, Massa Will, I keep a tellin on you,” here\ninterrupted Jupiter; “de bug is a goole bug, solid, ebery bit of him,\ninside and all, sep him wing--neber feel half so hebby a bug in my\nlife.”\n\n“Well, suppose it is, Jup,” replied Legrand, somewhat more earnestly,\nit seemed to me, than the case demanded, “is that any reason for your\nletting the birds burn? The color”--here he turned to me--“is really\nalmost enough to warrant Jupiter’s idea. You never saw a more brilliant\nmetallic lustre than the scales emit--but of this you cannot judge\ntill tomorrow. In the mean time I can give you some idea of the shape.”\n Saying this, he seated himself at a small table, on which were a pen and\nink, but no paper. He looked for some in a drawer, but found none.\n\n“Never mind,” said he at length, “this will answer;” and he drew from\nhis waistcoat pocket a scrap of what I took to be very dirty foolscap,\nand made upon it a rough drawing with the pen. While he did this, I\nretained my seat by the fire, for I was still chilly. When the design\nwas complete, he handed it to me without rising. As I received it, a\nloud growl was heard, succeeded by a scratching at the door. Jupiter\nopened it, and a large Newfoundland, belonging to Legrand, rushed in,\nleaped upon my shoulders, and loaded me with caresses; for I had shown\nhim much attention during previous visits. When his gambols were over, I\nlooked at the paper, and, to speak the truth, found myself not a little\npuzzled at what my friend had depicted.\n\n“Well!” I said, after contemplating it for some minutes, “this is a\nstrange scarabæus, I must confess: new to me: never saw anything like it\nbefore--unless it was a skull, or a death’s-head--which it more nearly\nresembles than anything else that has come under my observation.”\n\n“A death’s-head!” echoed Legrand--“Oh--yes--well, it has something of\nthat appearance upon paper, no doubt. The two upper black spots look\nlike eyes, eh? and the longer one at the bottom like a mouth--and then\nthe shape of the whole is oval.”\n\n“Perhaps so,” said I; “but, Legrand, I fear you are no artist. I must\nwait until I see the beetle itself, if I am to form any idea of its\npersonal appearance.”\n\n“Well, I don’t know,” said he, a little nettled, “I draw\ntolerably--should do it at least--have had good masters, and flatter\nmyself that I am not quite a blockhead.”\n\n“But, my dear fellow, you are joking then,” said I, “this is a very\npassable skull--indeed, I may say that it is a very excellent skull,\naccording to the vulgar notions about such specimens of physiology--and\nyour scarabæus must be the queerest scarabæus in the world if it\nresembles it. Why, we may get up a very thrilling bit of superstition\nupon this hint. I presume you will call the bug scarabæus caput hominis,\nor something of that kind--there are many similar titles in the Natural\nHistories. But where are the antennæ you spoke of?”\n\n“The antennæ!” said Legrand, who seemed to be getting unaccountably warm\nupon the subject; “I am sure you must see the antennæ. I made them\nas distinct as they are in the original insect, and I presume that is\nsufficient.”\n\n“Well, well,” I said, “perhaps you have--still I don’t see them;” and\nI handed him the paper without additional remark, not wishing to ruffle\nhis temper; but I was much surprised at the turn affairs had taken; his\nill humor puzzled me--and, as for the drawing of the beetle, there\nwere positively no antennæ visible, and the whole did bear a very close\nresemblance to the ordinary cuts of a death’s-head.\n\nHe received the paper very peevishly, and was about to crumple it,\napparently to throw it in the fire, when a casual glance at the design\nseemed suddenly to rivet his attention. In an instant his face grew\nviolently red--in another as excessively pale. For some minutes he\ncontinued to scrutinize the drawing minutely where he sat. At length he\narose, took a candle from the table, and proceeded to seat himself upon\na sea-chest in the farthest corner of the room. Here again he made an\nanxious examination of the paper; turning it in all directions. He said\nnothing, however, and his conduct greatly astonished me; yet I thought\nit prudent not to exacerbate the growing moodiness of his temper by any\ncomment. Presently he took from his coat pocket a wallet, placed the\npaper carefully in it, and deposited both in a writing-desk, which he\nlocked. He now grew more composed in his demeanor; but his original air\nof enthusiasm had quite disappeared. Yet he seemed not so much sulky as\nabstracted. As the evening wore away he became more and more absorbed in\nreverie, from which no sallies of mine could arouse him. It had been my\nintention to pass the night at the hut, as I had frequently done before,\nbut, seeing my host in this mood, I deemed it proper to take leave. He\ndid not press me to remain, but, as I departed, he shook my hand with\neven more than his usual cordiality.\n\nIt was about a month after this (and during the interval I had seen\nnothing of Legrand) when I received a visit, at Charleston, from his\nman, Jupiter. I had never seen the good old negro look so dispirited,\nand I feared that some serious disaster had befallen my friend.\n\n“Well, Jup,” said I, “what is the matter now?--how is your master?”\n\n“Why, to speak de troof, massa, him not so berry well as mought be.”\n\n“Not well! I am truly sorry to hear it. What does he complain of?”\n\n“Dar! dat’s it!--him neber plain of notin--but him berry sick for all\ndat.”\n\n“Very sick, Jupiter!--why didn’t you say so at once? Is he confined to\nbed?”\n\n“No, dat he aint!--he aint find nowhar--dat’s just whar de shoe\npinch--my mind is got to be berry hebby bout poor Massa Will.”\n\n“Jupiter, I should like to understand what it is you are talking about.\nYou say your master is sick. Hasn’t he told you what ails him?”\n\n“Why, massa, taint worf while for to git mad about de matter--Massa\nWill say noffin at all aint de matter wid him--but den what make him go\nabout looking dis here way, wid he head down and he soldiers up, and as\nwhite as a gose? And den he keep a syphon all de time--”\n\n“Keeps a what, Jupiter?”\n\n“Keeps a syphon wid de figgurs on de slate--de queerest figgurs I ebber\ndid see. Ise gittin to be skeered, I tell you. Hab for to keep mighty\ntight eye pon him noovers. Todder day he gib me slip fore de sun up and\nwas gone de whole ob de blessed day. I had a big stick ready cut for to\ngib him deuced good beating when he did come--but Ise sich a fool dat I\nhadn’t de heart arter all--he look so berry poorly.”\n\n“Eh?--what?--ah yes!--upon the whole I think you had better not be too\nsevere with the poor fellow--don’t flog him, Jupiter--he can’t very well\nstand it--but can you form no idea of what has occasioned this illness,\nor rather this change of conduct? Has anything unpleasant happened since\nI saw you?”\n\n“No, massa, dey aint bin noffin unpleasant since den--‘twas fore den I’m\nfeared--‘twas de berry day you was dare.”\n\n“How? what do you mean?”\n\n“Why, massa, I mean de bug--dare now.”\n\n“The what?”\n\n“De bug,--I’m berry sartain dat Massa Will bin bit somewhere bout de\nhead by dat goole-bug.”\n\n“And what cause have you, Jupiter, for such a supposition?”\n\n“Claws enuff, massa, and mouth too. I nebber did see sick a deuced\nbug--he kick and he bite ebery ting what cum near him. Massa Will cotch\nhim fuss, but had for to let him go gin mighty quick, I tell you--den\nwas de time he must ha got de bite. I did n’t like de look oh de bug\nmouff, myself, no how, so I would n’t take hold ob him wid my finger,\nbut I cotch him wid a piece ob paper dat I found. I rap him up in de\npaper and stuff piece ob it in he mouff--dat was de way.”\n\n“And you think, then, that your master was really bitten by the beetle,\nand that the bite made him sick?”\n\n“I do n’t tink noffin about it--I nose it. What make him dream bout de\ngoole so much, if taint cause he bit by de goole-bug? Ise heerd bout dem\ngoole-bugs fore dis.”\n\n“But how do you know he dreams about gold?”\n\n“How I know? why cause he talk about it in he sleep--dat’s how I nose.”\n\n“Well, Jup, perhaps you are right; but to what fortunate circumstance am\nI to attribute the honor of a visit from you to-day?”\n\n“What de matter, massa?”\n\n“Did you bring any message from Mr. Legrand?”\n\n“No, massa, I bring dis here pissel;” and here Jupiter handed me a note\nwhich ran thus:\n\n    MY DEAR ----\n\nWhy have I not seen you for so long a time? I hope you have not been so\nfoolish as to take offence at any little _brusquerie_ of mine; but no,\nthat is improbable. Since I saw you I have had great cause for anxiety.\nI have something to tell you, yet scarcely know how to tell it, or\nwhether I should tell it at all.\n\nI have not been quite well for some days past, and poor old Jup annoys\nme, almost beyond endurance, by his well-meant attentions Would you\nbelieve it?--he had prepared a huge stick, the other day, with which\nto chastise me for giving him the slip, and spending the day, _solus_,\namong the hills on the main land. I verily believe that my ill looks\nalone saved me a flogging.\n\nI have made no addition to my cabinet since we met.\n\nIf you can, in any way, make it convenient, come over with Jupiter.\n_Do_ come. I wish to see you to-_night_, upon business of importance. I\nassure you that it is of the _highest_ importance.\n\n        Ever yours,                     WILLIAM LEGRAND.\n\nThere was something in the tone of this note which gave me great\nuneasiness. Its whole style differed materially from that of Legrand.\nWhat could he be dreaming of? What new crotchet possessed his excitable\nbrain? What “business of the highest importance” could he possibly have\nto transact? Jupiter’s account of him boded no good. I dreaded lest the\ncontinued pressure of misfortune had, at length, fairly unsettled\nthe reason of my friend. Without a moment’s hesitation, therefore, I\nprepared to accompany the negro.\n\nUpon reaching the wharf, I noticed a scythe and three spades, all\napparently new, lying in the bottom of the boat in which we were to\nembark.\n\n“What is the meaning of all this, Jup?” I inquired.\n\n“Him syfe, massa, and spade.”\n\n“Very true; but what are they doing here?”\n\n“Him de syfe and de spade what Massa Will sis pon my buying for him in\nde town, and de debbils own lot of money I had to gib for em.”\n\n“But what, in the name of all that is mysterious, is your ‘Massa Will’\ngoing to do with scythes and spades?”\n\n“Dat’s more dan I know, and debbil take me if I don’t blieve ‘tis more\ndan he know, too. But it’s all cum ob do bug.”\n\nFinding that no satisfaction was to be obtained of Jupiter, whose whole\nintellect seemed to be absorbed by “de bug,” I now stepped into the boat\nand made sail. With a fair and strong breeze we soon ran into the little\ncove to the northward of Fort Moultrie, and a walk of some two miles\nbrought us to the hut. It was about three in the afternoon when we\narrived. Legrand had been awaiting us in eager expectation. He grasped\nmy hand with a nervous empressement which alarmed me and strengthened\nthe suspicions already entertained. His countenance was pale even to\nghastliness, and his deep-set eyes glared with unnatural lustre. After\nsome inquiries respecting his health, I asked him, not knowing what\nbetter to say, if he had yet obtained the scarabæus from Lieutenant\nG ----.\n\n“Oh, yes,” he replied, coloring violently, “I got it from him the next\nmorning. Nothing should tempt me to part with that scarabæus. Do you\nknow that Jupiter is quite right about it?”\n\n“In what way?” I asked, with a sad foreboding at heart.\n\n“In supposing it to be a bug of real gold.” He said this with an air of\nprofound seriousness, and I felt inexpressibly shocked.\n\n“This bug is to make my fortune,” he continued, with a triumphant smile,\n“to reinstate me in my family possessions. Is it any wonder, then, that\nI prize it? Since Fortune has thought fit to bestow it upon me, I have\nonly to use it properly and I shall arrive at the gold of which it is\nthe index. Jupiter; bring me that scarabæus!”\n\n“What! de bug, massa? I’d rudder not go fer trubble dat bug--you mus git\nhim for your own self.” Hereupon Legrand arose, with a grave and\nstately air, and brought me the beetle from a glass case in which it was\nenclosed. It was a beautiful scarabæus, and, at that time, unknown to\nnaturalists--of course a great prize in a scientific point of view.\nThere were two round, black spots near one extremity of the back, and\na long one near the other. The scales were exceedingly hard and glossy,\nwith all the appearance of burnished gold. The weight of the insect\nwas very remarkable, and, taking all things into consideration, I could\nhardly blame Jupiter for his opinion respecting it; but what to make of\nLegrand’s concordance with that opinion, I could not, for the life of\nme, tell.\n\n“I sent for you,” said he, in a grandiloquent tone, when I had completed\nmy examination of the beetle, “I sent for you, that I might have your\ncounsel and assistance in furthering the views of Fate and of the bug”--\n\n“My dear Legrand,” I cried, interrupting him, “you are certainly unwell,\nand had better use some little precautions. You shall go to bed, and\nI will remain with you a few days, until you get over this. You are\nfeverish and”--\n\n“Feel my pulse,” said he.\n\nI felt it, and, to say the truth, found not the slightest indication of\nfever.\n\n“But you may be ill and yet have no fever. Allow me this once to\nprescribe for you. In the first place, go to bed. In the next”--\n\n“You are mistaken,” he interposed, “I am as well as I can expect to be\nunder the excitement which I suffer. If you really wish me well, you\nwill relieve this excitement.”\n\n“And how is this to be done?”\n\n“Very easily. Jupiter and myself are going upon an expedition into the\nhills, upon the main land, and, in this expedition we shall need the\naid of some person in whom we can confide. You are the only one we can\ntrust. Whether we succeed or fail, the excitement which you now perceive\nin me will be equally allayed.”\n\n“I am anxious to oblige you in any way,” I replied; “but do you mean to\nsay that this infernal beetle has any connection with your expedition\ninto the hills?”\n\n“It has.”\n\n“Then, Legrand, I can become a party to no such absurd proceeding.”\n\n“I am sorry--very sorry--for we shall have to try it by ourselves.”\n\n“Try it by yourselves! The man is surely mad!--but stay!--how long do\nyou propose to be absent?”\n\n“Probably all night. We shall start immediately, and be back, at all\nevents, by sunrise.”\n\n“And will you promise me, upon your honor, that when this freak of yours\nis over, and the bug business (good God!) settled to your satisfaction,\nyou will then return home and follow my advice implicitly, as that of\nyour physician?”\n\n“Yes; I promise; and now let us be off, for we have no time to lose.”\n\nWith a heavy heart I accompanied my friend. We started about four\no’clock--Legrand, Jupiter, the dog, and myself. Jupiter had with him the\nscythe and spades--the whole of which he insisted upon carrying--more\nthrough fear, it seemed to me, of trusting either of the implements\nwithin reach of his master, than from any excess of industry or\ncomplaisance. His demeanor was dogged in the extreme, and “dat deuced\nbug” were the sole words which escaped his lips during the journey. For\nmy own part, I had charge of a couple of dark lanterns, while Legrand\ncontented himself with the scarabæus, which he carried attached to the\nend of a bit of whip-cord; twirling it to and fro, with the air of a\nconjuror, as he went. When I observed this last, plain evidence of my\nfriend’s aberration of mind, I could scarcely refrain from tears. I\nthought it best, however, to humor his fancy, at least for the present,\nor until I could adopt some more energetic measures with a chance of\nsuccess. In the mean time I endeavored, but all in vain, to sound him in\nregard to the object of the expedition. Having succeeded in inducing\nme to accompany him, he seemed unwilling to hold conversation upon any\ntopic of minor importance, and to all my questions vouchsafed no other\nreply than “we shall see!”\n\nWe crossed the creek at the head of the island by means of a skiff; and,\nascending the high grounds on the shore of the main land, proceeded in a\nnorthwesterly direction, through a tract of country excessively wild and\ndesolate, where no trace of a human footstep was to be seen. Legrand led\nthe way with decision; pausing only for an instant, here and there, to\nconsult what appeared to be certain landmarks of his own contrivance\nupon a former occasion.\n\nIn this manner we journeyed for about two hours, and the sun was just\nsetting when we entered a region infinitely more dreary than any yet\nseen. It was a species of table land, near the summit of an almost\ninaccessible hill, densely wooded from base to pinnacle, and\ninterspersed with huge crags that appeared to lie loosely upon the soil,\nand in many cases were prevented from precipitating themselves into the\nvalleys below, merely by the support of the trees against which they\nreclined. Deep ravines, in various directions, gave an air of still\nsterner solemnity to the scene.\n\nThe natural platform to which we had clambered was thickly overgrown\nwith brambles, through which we soon discovered that it would have\nbeen impossible to force our way but for the scythe; and Jupiter, by\ndirection of his master, proceeded to clear for us a path to the foot of\nan enormously tall tulip-tree, which stood, with some eight or ten oaks,\nupon the level, and far surpassed them all, and all other trees which I\nhad then ever seen, in the beauty of its foliage and form, in the wide\nspread of its branches, and in the general majesty of its appearance.\nWhen we reached this tree, Legrand turned to Jupiter, and asked him if\nhe thought he could climb it. The old man seemed a little staggered\nby the question, and for some moments made no reply. At length he\napproached the huge trunk, walked slowly around it, and examined it with\nminute attention. When he had completed his scrutiny, he merely said,\n\n“Yes, massa, Jup climb any tree he ebber see in he life.”\n\n“Then up with you as soon as possible, for it will soon be too dark to\nsee what we are about.”\n\n“How far mus go up, massa?” inquired Jupiter.\n\n“Get up the main trunk first, and then I will tell you which way to\ngo--and here--stop! take this beetle with you.”\n\n“De bug, Massa Will!--de goole bug!” cried the negro, drawing back in\ndismay--“what for mus tote de bug way up de tree?--d-n if I do!”\n\n“If you are afraid, Jup, a great big negro like you, to take hold of\na harmless little dead beetle, why you can carry it up by this\nstring--but, if you do not take it up with you in some way, I shall be\nunder the necessity of breaking your head with this shovel.”\n\n“What de matter now, massa?” said Jup, evidently shamed into compliance;\n“always want for to raise fuss wid old nigger. Was only funnin any how.\nMe feered de bug! what I keer for de bug?” Here he took cautiously hold\nof the extreme end of the string, and, maintaining the insect as far\nfrom his person as circumstances would permit, prepared to ascend the\ntree.\n\nIn youth, the tulip-tree, or Liriodendron Tulipferum, the most\nmagnificent of American foresters, has a trunk peculiarly smooth, and\noften rises to a great height without lateral branches; but, in its\nriper age, the bark becomes gnarled and uneven, while many short limbs\nmake their appearance on the stem. Thus the difficulty of ascension, in\nthe present case, lay more in semblance than in reality. Embracing the\nhuge cylinder, as closely as possible, with his arms and knees, seizing\nwith his hands some projections, and resting his naked toes upon\nothers, Jupiter, after one or two narrow escapes from falling, at length\nwriggled himself into the first great fork, and seemed to consider the\nwhole business as virtually accomplished. The risk of the achievement\nwas, in fact, now over, although the climber was some sixty or seventy\nfeet from the ground.\n\n“Which way mus go now, Massa Will?” he asked.\n\n“Keep up the largest branch--the one on this side,” said Legrand. The\nnegro obeyed him promptly, and apparently with but little trouble;\nascending higher and higher, until no glimpse of his squat figure could\nbe obtained through the dense foliage which enveloped it. Presently his\nvoice was heard in a sort of halloo.\n\n“How much fudder is got for go?”\n\n“How high up are you?” asked Legrand.\n\n“Ebber so fur,” replied the negro; “can see de sky fru de top ob de\ntree.”\n\n“Never mind the sky, but attend to what I say. Look down the trunk and\ncount the limbs below you on this side. How many limbs have you passed?”\n\n“One, two, tree, four, fibe--I done pass fibe big limb, massa, pon dis\nside.”\n\n“Then go one limb higher.”\n\nIn a few minutes the voice was heard again, announcing that the seventh\nlimb was attained.\n\n“Now, Jup,” cried Legrand, evidently much excited, “I want you to work\nyour way out upon that limb as far as you can. If you see anything\nstrange, let me know.” By this time what little doubt I might have\nentertained of my poor friend’s insanity, was put finally at rest. I had\nno alternative but to conclude him stricken with lunacy, and I became\nseriously anxious about getting him home. While I was pondering upon\nwhat was best to be done, Jupiter’s voice was again heard.\n\n“Mos feerd for to ventur pon dis limb berry far--tis dead limb putty\nmuch all de way.”\n\n“Did you say it was a dead limb, Jupiter?” cried Legrand in a quavering\nvoice.\n\n“Yes, massa, him dead as de door-nail--done up for sartain--done\ndeparted dis here life.”\n\n“What in the name heaven shall I do?” asked Legrand, seemingly in the\ngreatest distress. “Do!” said I, glad of an opportunity to interpose\na word, “why come home and go to bed. Come now!--that’s a fine fellow.\nIt’s getting late, and, besides, you remember your promise.”\n\n“Jupiter,” cried he, without heeding me in the least, “do you hear me?”\n\n“Yes, Massa Will, hear you ebber so plain.”\n\n“Try the wood well, then, with your knife, and see if you think it very\nrotten.”\n\n“Him rotten, massa, sure nuff,” replied the negro in a few moments, “but\nnot so berry rotten as mought be. Mought ventur out leetle way pon de\nlimb by myself, dat’s true.”\n\n“By yourself!--what do you mean?”\n\n“Why I mean de bug. ‘Tis berry hebby bug. Spose I drop him down fuss,\nand den de limb won’t break wid just de weight ob one nigger.”\n\n“You infernal scoundrel!” cried Legrand, apparently much relieved, “what\ndo you mean by telling me such nonsense as that? As sure as you drop\nthat beetle I’ll break your neck. Look here, Jupiter, do you hear me?”\n\n“Yes, massa, needn’t hollo at poor nigger dat style.”\n\n“Well! now listen!--if you will venture out on the limb as far as you\nthink safe, and not let go the beetle, I’ll make you a present of a\nsilver dollar as soon as you get down.”\n\n“I’m gwine, Massa Will--deed I is,” replied the negro very\npromptly--“mos out to the eend now.”\n\n“Out to the end!” here fairly screamed Legrand, “do you say you are out\nto the end of that limb?”\n\n“Soon be to de eend, massa,--o-o-o-o-oh! Lor-gol-a-marcy! what is dis\nhere pon de tree?”\n\n“Well!” cried Legrand, highly delighted, “what is it?”\n\n“Why taint noffin but a skull--somebody bin lef him head up de tree, and\nde crows done gobble ebery bit ob de meat off.”\n\n“A skull, you say!--very well!--how is it fastened to the limb?--what\nholds it on?”\n\n“Sure nuff, massa; mus look. Why dis berry curous sarcumstance, pon my\nword--dare’s a great big nail in de skull, what fastens ob it on to de\ntree.”\n\n“Well now, Jupiter, do exactly as I tell you--do you hear?”\n\n“Yes, massa.”\n\n“Pay attention, then!--find the left eye of the skull.”\n\n“Hum! hoo! dat’s good! why dare aint no eye lef at all.”\n\n“Curse your stupidity! do you know your right hand from your left?”\n\n“Yes, I nose dat--nose all bout dat--tis my lef hand what I chops de\nwood wid.”\n\n“To be sure! you are left-handed; and your left eye is on the same\nside as your left hand. Now, I suppose, you can find the left eye of the\nskull, or the place where the left eye has been. Have you found it?”\n\nHere was a long pause. At length the negro asked,\n\n“Is de lef eye of de skull pon de same side as de lef hand of de skull,\ntoo?--cause de skull aint got not a bit ob a hand at all--nebber mind!\nI got de lef eye now--here de lef eye! what mus do wid it?”\n\n“Let the beetle drop through it, as far as the string will reach--but\nbe careful and not let go your hold of the string.”\n\n“All dat done, Massa Will; mighty easy ting for to put de bug fru de\nhole--look out for him dare below!”\n\nDuring this colloquy no portion of Jupiter’s person could be seen; but\nthe beetle, which he had suffered to descend, was now visible at the\nend of the string, and glistened, like a globe of burnished gold, in the\nlast rays of the setting sun, some of which still faintly illumined\nthe eminence upon which we stood. The scarabæus hung quite clear of\nany branches, and, if allowed to fall, would have fallen at our feet.\nLegrand immediately took the scythe, and cleared with it a circular\nspace, three or four yards in diameter, just beneath the insect, and,\nhaving accomplished this, ordered Jupiter to let go the string and come\ndown from the tree.\n\nDriving a peg, with great nicety, into the ground, at the precise spot\nwhere the beetle fell, my friend now produced from his pocket a tape\nmeasure. Fastening one end of this at that point of the trunk, of the\ntree which was nearest the peg, he unrolled it till it reached the peg,\nand thence farther unrolled it, in the direction already established\nby the two points of the tree and the peg, for the distance of fifty\nfeet--Jupiter clearing away the brambles with the scythe. At the spot\nthus attained a second peg was driven, and about this, as a centre, a\nrude circle, about four feet in diameter, described. Taking now a spade\nhimself, and giving one to Jupiter and one to me, Legrand begged us to\nset about digging as quickly as possible.\n\nTo speak the truth, I had no especial relish for such amusement at any\ntime, and, at that particular moment, would most willingly have declined\nit; for the night was coming on, and I felt much fatigued with the\nexercise already taken; but I saw no mode of escape, and was fearful\nof disturbing my poor friend’s equanimity by a refusal. Could I have\ndepended, indeed, upon Jupiter’s aid, I would have had no hesitation in\nattempting to get the lunatic home by force; but I was too well assured\nof the old negro’s disposition, to hope that he would assist me, under\nany circumstances, in a personal contest with his master. I made no\ndoubt that the latter had been infected with some of the innumerable\nSouthern superstitions about money buried, and that his phantasy had\nreceived confirmation by the finding of the scarabæus, or, perhaps, by\nJupiter’s obstinacy in maintaining it to be “a bug of real gold.” A\nmind disposed to lunacy would readily be led away by such\nsuggestions--especially if chiming in with favorite preconceived\nideas--and then I called to mind the poor fellow’s speech about the\nbeetle’s being “the index of his fortune.” Upon the whole, I was sadly\nvexed and puzzled, but, at length, I concluded to make a virtue of\nnecessity--to dig with a good will, and thus the sooner to convince the\nvisionary, by ocular demonstration, of the fallacy of the opinions he\nentertained.\n\nThe lanterns having been lit, we all fell to work with a zeal worthy\na more rational cause; and, as the glare fell upon our persons and\nimplements, I could not help thinking how picturesque a group we\ncomposed, and how strange and suspicious our labors must have appeared\nto any interloper who, by chance, might have stumbled upon our\nwhereabouts.\n\nWe dug very steadily for two hours. Little was said; and our chief\nembarrassment lay in the yelpings of the dog, who took exceeding\ninterest in our proceedings. He, at length, became so obstreperous\nthat we grew fearful of his giving the alarm to some stragglers in\nthe vicinity;--or, rather, this was the apprehension of Legrand;--for\nmyself, I should have rejoiced at any interruption which might have\nenabled me to get the wanderer home. The noise was, at length, very\neffectually silenced by Jupiter, who, getting out of the hole with a\ndogged air of deliberation, tied the brute’s mouth up with one of his\nsuspenders, and then returned, with a grave chuckle, to his task.\n\nWhen the time mentioned had expired, we had reached a depth of five\nfeet, and yet no signs of any treasure became manifest. A general pause\nensued, and I began to hope that the farce was at an end. Legrand,\nhowever, although evidently much disconcerted, wiped his brow\nthoughtfully and recommenced. We had excavated the entire circle of four\nfeet diameter, and now we slightly enlarged the limit, and went to the\nfarther depth of two feet. Still nothing appeared. The gold-seeker, whom\nI sincerely pitied, at length clambered from the pit, with the bitterest\ndisappointment imprinted upon every feature, and proceeded, slowly\nand reluctantly, to put on his coat, which he had thrown off at the\nbeginning of his labor. In the mean time I made no remark. Jupiter, at a\nsignal from his master, began to gather up his tools. This done, and the\ndog having been unmuzzled, we turned in profound silence towards home.\n\nWe had taken, perhaps, a dozen steps in this direction, when, with a\nloud oath, Legrand strode up to Jupiter, and seized him by the collar.\nThe astonished negro opened his eyes and mouth to the fullest extent,\nlet fall the spades, and fell upon his knees.\n\n“You scoundrel,” said Legrand, hissing out the syllables from between\nhis clenched teeth--“you infernal black villain!--speak, I tell\nyou!--answer me this instant, without prevarication!--which--which is\nyour left eye?”\n\n“Oh, my golly, Massa Will! aint dis here my lef eye for sartain?” roared\nthe terrified Jupiter, placing his hand upon his right organ of vision,\nand holding it there with a desperate pertinacity, as if in immediate\ndread of his master’s attempt at a gouge.\n\n“I thought so!--I knew it! hurrah!” vociferated Legrand, letting the\nnegro go, and executing a series of curvets and caracols, much to the\nastonishment of his valet, who, arising from his knees, looked, mutely,\nfrom his master to myself, and then from myself to his master.\n\n“Come! we must go back,” said the latter, “the game’s not up yet;” and\nhe again led the way to the tulip-tree.\n\n“Jupiter,” said he, when we reached its foot, “come here! was the skull\nnailed to the limb with the face outwards, or with the face to the\nlimb?”\n\n“De face was out, massa, so dat de crows could get at de eyes good,\nwidout any trouble.”\n\n“Well, then, was it this eye or that through which you dropped the\nbeetle?”--here Legrand touched each of Jupiter’s eyes.\n\n“Twas dis eye, massa--de lef eye--jis as you tell me,” and here it was\nhis right eye that the negro indicated.\n\n“That will do--must try it again.”\n\nHere my friend, about whose madness I now saw, or fancied that I saw,\ncertain indications of method, removed the peg which marked the spot\nwhere the beetle fell, to a spot about three inches to the westward\nof its former position. Taking, now, the tape measure from the nearest\npoint of the trunk to the peg, as before, and continuing the extension\nin a straight line to the distance of fifty feet, a spot was indicated,\nremoved, by several yards, from the point at which we had been digging.\n\nAround the new position a circle, somewhat larger than in the former\ninstance, was now described, and we again set to work with the spades.\nI was dreadfully weary, but, scarcely understanding what had occasioned\nthe change in my thoughts, I felt no longer any great aversion from the\nlabor imposed. I had become most unaccountably interested--nay, even\nexcited. Perhaps there was something, amid all the extravagant demeanor\nof Legrand--some air of forethought, or of deliberation, which impressed\nme. I dug eagerly, and now and then caught myself actually looking,\nwith something that very much resembled expectation, for the fancied\ntreasure, the vision of which had demented my unfortunate companion. At\na period when such vagaries of thought most fully possessed me, and\nwhen we had been at work perhaps an hour and a half, we were again\ninterrupted by the violent howlings of the dog. His uneasiness, in the\nfirst instance, had been, evidently, but the result of playfulness or\ncaprice, but he now assumed a bitter and serious tone. Upon Jupiter’s\nagain attempting to muzzle him, he made furious resistance, and, leaping\ninto the hole, tore up the mould frantically with his claws. In a few\nseconds he had uncovered a mass of human bones, forming two complete\nskeletons, intermingled with several buttons of metal, and what appeared\nto be the dust of decayed woollen. One or two strokes of a spade\nupturned the blade of a large Spanish knife, and, as we dug farther,\nthree or four loose pieces of gold and silver coin came to light.\n\nAt sight of these the joy of Jupiter could scarcely be restrained, but\nthe countenance of his master wore an air of extreme disappointment He\nurged us, however, to continue our exertions, and the words were hardly\nuttered when I stumbled and fell forward, having caught the toe of my\nboot in a large ring of iron that lay half buried in the loose earth.\n\nWe now worked in earnest, and never did I pass ten minutes of more\nintense excitement. During this interval we had fairly unearthed an\noblong chest of wood, which, from its perfect preservation and\nwonderful hardness, had plainly been subjected to some mineralizing\nprocess--perhaps that of the Bi-chloride of Mercury. This box was three\nfeet and a half long, three feet broad, and two and a half feet deep. It\nwas firmly secured by bands of wrought iron, riveted, and forming a kind\nof open trelliswork over the whole. On each side of the chest, near the\ntop, were three rings of iron--six in all--by means of which a firm hold\ncould be obtained by six persons. Our utmost united endeavors served\nonly to disturb the coffer very slightly in its bed. We at once saw\nthe impossibility of removing so great a weight. Luckily, the sole\nfastenings of the lid consisted of two sliding bolts. These we drew\nback--trembling and panting with anxiety. In an instant, a treasure of\nincalculable value lay gleaming before us. As the rays of the lanterns\nfell within the pit, there flashed upwards a glow and a glare, from a\nconfused heap of gold and of jewels, that absolutely dazzled our eyes.\n\nI shall not pretend to describe the feelings with which I gazed.\nAmazement was, of course, predominant. Legrand appeared exhausted with\nexcitement, and spoke very few words. Jupiter’s countenance wore, for\nsome minutes, as deadly a pallor as it is possible, in nature of things,\nfor any negro’s visage to assume. He seemed stupified--thunderstricken.\nPresently he fell upon his knees in the pit, and, burying his naked\narms up to the elbows in gold, let them there remain, as if enjoying the\nluxury of a bath. At length, with a deep sigh, he exclaimed, as if in a\nsoliloquy,\n\n“And dis all cum ob de goole-bug! de putty goole bug! de poor little\ngoole-bug, what I boosed in dat sabage kind ob style! Aint you shamed ob\nyourself, nigger?--answer me dat!”\n\nIt became necessary, at last, that I should arouse both master and valet\nto the expediency of removing the treasure. It was growing late, and\nit behooved us to make exertion, that we might get every thing housed\nbefore daylight. It was difficult to say what should be done, and much\ntime was spent in deliberation--so confused were the ideas of all. We,\nfinally, lightened the box by removing two thirds of its contents,\nwhen we were enabled, with some trouble, to raise it from the hole. The\narticles taken out were deposited among the brambles, and the dog\nleft to guard them, with strict orders from Jupiter neither, upon any\npretence, to stir from the spot, nor to open his mouth until our return.\nWe then hurriedly made for home with the chest; reaching the hut in\nsafety, but after excessive toil, at one o’clock in the morning. Worn\nout as we were, it was not in human nature to do more immediately. We\nrested until two, and had supper; starting for the hills immediately\nafterwards, armed with three stout sacks, which, by good luck, were upon\nthe premises. A little before four we arrived at the pit, divided the\nremainder of the booty, as equally as might be, among us, and, leaving\nthe holes unfilled, again set out for the hut, at which, for the second\ntime, we deposited our golden burthens, just as the first faint streaks\nof the dawn gleamed from over the tree-tops in the East.\n\nWe were now thoroughly broken down; but the intense excitement of the\ntime denied us repose. After an unquiet slumber of some three or four\nhours’ duration, we arose, as if by preconcert, to make examination of\nour treasure.\n\nThe chest had been full to the brim, and we spent the whole day, and the\ngreater part of the next night, in a scrutiny of its contents. There had\nbeen nothing like order or arrangement. Every thing had been heaped\nin promiscuously. Having assorted all with care, we found ourselves\npossessed of even vaster wealth than we had at first supposed. In\ncoin there was rather more than four hundred and fifty thousand\ndollars--estimating the value of the pieces, as accurately as we could,\nby the tables of the period. There was not a particle of silver. All was\ngold of antique date and of great variety--French, Spanish, and German\nmoney, with a few English guineas, and some counters, of which we had\nnever seen specimens before. There were several very large and heavy\ncoins, so worn that we could make nothing of their inscriptions. There\nwas no American money. The value of the jewels we found more difficulty\nin estimating. There were diamonds--some of them exceedingly large and\nfine--a hundred and ten in all, and not one of them small; eighteen\nrubies of remarkable brilliancy;--three hundred and ten emeralds, all\nvery beautiful; and twenty-one sapphires, with an opal. These stones had\nall been broken from their settings and thrown loose in the chest. The\nsettings themselves, which we picked out from among the other gold,\nappeared to have been beaten up with hammers, as if to prevent\nidentification. Besides all this, there was a vast quantity of solid\ngold ornaments;--nearly two hundred massive finger and earrings;--rich\nchains--thirty of these, if I remember;--eighty-three very large and\nheavy crucifixes;--five gold censers of great value;--a prodigious\ngolden punch bowl, ornamented with richly chased vine-leaves and\nBacchanalian figures; with two sword-handles exquisitely embossed, and\nmany other smaller articles which I cannot recollect. The weight of\nthese valuables exceeded three hundred and fifty pounds avoirdupois; and\nin this estimate I have not included one hundred and ninety-seven superb\ngold watches; three of the number being worth each five hundred dollars,\nif one. Many of them were very old, and as time keepers valueless; the\nworks having suffered, more or less, from corrosion--but all were richly\njewelled and in cases of great worth. We estimated the entire contents\nof the chest, that night, at a million and a half of dollars; and upon\nthe subsequent disposal of the trinkets and jewels (a few being retained\nfor our own use), it was found that we had greatly undervalued the\ntreasure. When, at length, we had concluded our examination, and the\nintense excitement of the time had, in some measure, subsided, Legrand,\nwho saw that I was dying with impatience for a solution of this\nmost extraordinary riddle, entered into a full detail of all the\ncircumstances connected with it.\n\n“You remember;” said he, “the night when I handed you the rough sketch I\nhad made of the scarabæus. You recollect also, that I became quite vexed\nat you for insisting that my drawing resembled a death’s-head. When you\nfirst made this assertion I thought you were jesting; but afterwards\nI called to mind the peculiar spots on the back of the insect, and\nadmitted to myself that your remark had some little foundation in fact.\nStill, the sneer at my graphic powers irritated me--for I am considered\na good artist--and, therefore, when you handed me the scrap of\nparchment, I was about to crumple it up and throw it angrily into the\nfire.”\n\n“The scrap of paper, you mean,” said I.\n\n“No; it had much of the appearance of paper, and at first I supposed it\nto be such, but when I came to draw upon it, I discovered it, at once,\nto be a piece of very thin parchment. It was quite dirty, you remember.\nWell, as I was in the very act of crumpling it up, my glance fell\nupon the sketch at which you had been looking, and you may imagine my\nastonishment when I perceived, in fact, the figure of a death’s-head\njust where, it seemed to me, I had made the drawing of the beetle. For\na moment I was too much amazed to think with accuracy. I knew that my\ndesign was very different in detail from this--although there was a\ncertain similarity in general outline. Presently I took a candle, and\nseating myself at the other end of the room, proceeded to scrutinize the\nparchment more closely. Upon turning it over, I saw my own sketch\nupon the reverse, just as I had made it. My first idea, now, was mere\nsurprise at the really remarkable similarity of outline--at the singular\ncoincidence involved in the fact, that unknown to me, there should have\nbeen a skull upon the other side of the parchment, immediately beneath\nmy figure of the scarabæus, and that this skull, not only in outline,\nbut in size, should so closely resemble my drawing. I say the\nsingularity of this coincidence absolutely stupified me for a time.\nThis is the usual effect of such coincidences. The mind struggles to\nestablish a connexion--a sequence of cause and effect--and, being\nunable to do so, suffers a species of temporary paralysis. But, when I\nrecovered from this stupor, there dawned upon me gradually a conviction\nwhich startled me even far more than the coincidence. I began\ndistinctly, positively, to remember that there had been no drawing upon\nthe parchment when I made my sketch of the scarabæus. I became perfectly\ncertain of this; for I recollected turning up first one side and then\nthe other, in search of the cleanest spot. Had the skull been then\nthere, of course I could not have failed to notice it. Here was indeed\na mystery which I felt it impossible to explain; but, even at that early\nmoment, there seemed to glimmer, faintly, within the most remote and\nsecret chambers of my intellect, a glow-worm-like conception of\nthat truth which last night’s adventure brought to so magnificent a\ndemonstration. I arose at once, and putting the parchment securely away,\ndismissed all farther reflection until I should be alone.\n\n“When you had gone, and when Jupiter was fast asleep, I betook myself\nto a more methodical investigation of the affair. In the first place\nI considered the manner in which the parchment had come into my\npossession. The spot where we discovered the scarabaeus was on the coast\nof the main land, about a mile eastward of the island, and but a short\ndistance above high water mark. Upon my taking hold of it, it gave me a\nsharp bite, which caused me to let it drop. Jupiter, with his accustomed\ncaution, before seizing the insect, which had flown towards him, looked\nabout him for a leaf, or something of that nature, by which to take hold\nof it. It was at this moment that his eyes, and mine also, fell upon the\nscrap of parchment, which I then supposed to be paper. It was lying half\nburied in the sand, a corner sticking up. Near the spot where we found\nit, I observed the remnants of the hull of what appeared to have been a\nship’s long boat. The wreck seemed to have been there for a very great\nwhile; for the resemblance to boat timbers could scarcely be traced.\n\n“Well, Jupiter picked up the parchment, wrapped the beetle in it, and\ngave it to me. Soon afterwards we turned to go home, and on the way met\nLieutenant G-. I showed him the insect, and he begged me to let him\ntake it to the fort. Upon my consenting, he thrust it forthwith into his\nwaistcoat pocket, without the parchment in which it had been wrapped,\nand which I had continued to hold in my hand during his inspection.\nPerhaps he dreaded my changing my mind, and thought it best to make sure\nof the prize at once--you know how enthusiastic he is on all subjects\nconnected with Natural History. At the same time, without being\nconscious of it, I must have deposited the parchment in my own pocket.\n\n“You remember that when I went to the table, for the purpose of making\na sketch of the beetle, I found no paper where it was usually kept.\nI looked in the drawer, and found none there. I searched my pockets,\nhoping to find an old letter, when my hand fell upon the parchment. I\nthus detail the precise mode in which it came into my possession; for\nthe circumstances impressed me with peculiar force.\n\n“No doubt you will think me fanciful--but I had already established a\nkind of connexion. I had put together two links of a great chain. There\nwas a boat lying upon a sea-coast, and not far from the boat was a\nparchment--not a paper--with a skull depicted upon it. You will,\nof course, ask ‘where is the connexion?’ I reply that the skull, or\ndeath’s-head, is the well-known emblem of the pirate. The flag of the\ndeath’s head is hoisted in all engagements.\n\n“I have said that the scrap was parchment, and not paper. Parchment\nis durable--almost imperishable. Matters of little moment are rarely\nconsigned to parchment; since, for the mere ordinary purposes of drawing\nor writing, it is not nearly so well adapted as paper. This reflection\nsuggested some meaning--some relevancy--in the death’s-head. I did not\nfail to observe, also, the form of the parchment. Although one of its\ncorners had been, by some accident, destroyed, it could be seen that the\noriginal form was oblong. It was just such a slip, indeed, as might\nhave been chosen for a memorandum--for a record of something to be long\nremembered and carefully preserved.”\n\n“But,” I interposed, “you say that the skull was not upon the parchment\nwhen you made the drawing of the beetle. How then do you trace any\nconnexion between the boat and the skull--since this latter, according\nto your own admission, must have been designed (God only knows how or by\nwhom) at some period subsequent to your sketching the scarabæus?”\n\n“Ah, hereupon turns the whole mystery; although the secret, at this\npoint, I had comparatively little difficulty in solving. My steps were\nsure, and could afford but a single result. I reasoned, for example,\nthus: When I drew the scarabæus, there was no skull apparent upon\nthe parchment. When I had completed the drawing I gave it to you, and\nobserved you narrowly until you returned it. You, therefore, did not\ndesign the skull, and no one else was present to do it. Then it was not\ndone by human agency. And nevertheless it was done.\n\n“At this stage of my reflections I endeavored to remember, and did\nremember, with entire distinctness, every incident which occurred about\nthe period in question. The weather was chilly (oh rare and happy\naccident!), and a fire was blazing upon the hearth. I was heated with\nexercise and sat near the table. You, however, had drawn a chair close\nto the chimney. Just as I placed the parchment in your hand, and as you\nwere in the act of inspecting it, Wolf, the Newfoundland, entered,\nand leaped upon your shoulders. With your left hand you caressed him and\nkept him off, while your right, holding the parchment, was permitted to\nfall listlessly between your knees, and in close proximity to the fire.\nAt one moment I thought the blaze had caught it, and was about to\ncaution you, but, before I could speak, you had withdrawn it, and were\nengaged in its examination. When I considered all these particulars, I\ndoubted not for a moment that heat had been the agent in bringing to\nlight, upon the parchment, the skull which I saw designed upon it. You\nare well aware that chemical preparations exist, and have existed time\nout of mind, by means of which it is possible to write upon either paper\nor vellum, so that the characters shall become visible only when\nsubjected to the action of fire. Zaffre, digested in aqua regia, and\ndiluted with four times its weight of water, is sometimes employed; a\ngreen tint results. The regulus of cobalt, dissolved in spirit of nitre,\ngives a red. These colors disappear at longer or shorter intervals after\nthe material written upon cools, but again become apparent upon the\nre-application of heat.\n\n“I now scrutinized the death’s-head with care. Its outer edges--the\nedges of the drawing nearest the edge of the vellum--were far more\ndistinct than the others. It was clear that the action of the caloric\nhad been imperfect or unequal. I immediately kindled a fire, and\nsubjected every portion of the parchment to a glowing heat. At first,\nthe only effect was the strengthening of the faint lines in the skull;\nbut, upon persevering in the experiment, there became visible, at\nthe corner of the slip, diagonally opposite to the spot in which the\ndeath’s-head was delineated, the figure of what I at first supposed to\nbe a goat. A closer scrutiny, however, satisfied me that it was intended\nfor a kid.”\n\n“Ha! ha!” said I, “to be sure I have no right to laugh at you--a million\nand a half of money is too serious a matter for mirth--but you are not\nabout to establish a third link in your chain--you will not find any\nespecial connexion between your pirates and a goat--pirates, you know,\nhave nothing to do with goats; they appertain to the farming interest.”\n\n“But I have just said that the figure was not that of a goat.”\n\n“Well, a kid then--pretty much the same thing.”\n\n“Pretty much, but not altogether,” said Legrand. “You may have heard of\none Captain Kidd. I at once looked upon the figure of the animal as a\nkind of punning or hieroglyphical signature. I say signature; because\nits position upon the vellum suggested this idea. The death’s-head at\nthe corner diagonally opposite, had, in the same manner, the air of a\nstamp, or seal. But I was sorely put out by the absence of all else--of\nthe body to my imagined instrument--of the text for my context.”\n\n“I presume you expected to find a letter between the stamp and the\nsignature.”\n\n“Something of that kind. The fact is, I felt irresistibly impressed with\na presentiment of some vast good fortune impending. I can scarcely\nsay why. Perhaps, after all, it was rather a desire than an actual\nbelief;--but do you know that Jupiter’s silly words, about the bug\nbeing of solid gold, had a remarkable effect upon my fancy? And then the\nseries of accidents and coincidences--these were so very extraordinary.\nDo you observe how mere an accident it was that these events should have\noccurred upon the sole day of all the year in which it has been, or may\nbe, sufficiently cool for fire, and that without the fire, or without\nthe intervention of the dog at the precise moment in which he appeared,\nI should never have become aware of the death’s-head, and so never the\npossessor of the treasure?”\n\n“But proceed--I am all impatience.”\n\n“Well; you have heard, of course, the many stories current--the thousand\nvague rumors afloat about money buried, somewhere upon the Atlantic\ncoast, by Kidd and his associates. These rumors must have had some\nfoundation in fact. And that the rumors have existed so long and so\ncontinuous, could have resulted, it appeared to me, only from the\ncircumstance of the buried treasure still remaining entombed. Had Kidd\nconcealed his plunder for a time, and afterwards reclaimed it, the\nrumors would scarcely have reached us in their present unvarying form.\nYou will observe that the stories told are all about money-seekers,\nnot about money-finders. Had the pirate recovered his money, there the\naffair would have dropped. It seemed to me that some accident--say the\nloss of a memorandum indicating its locality--had deprived him of the\nmeans of recovering it, and that this accident had become known to his\nfollowers, who otherwise might never have heard that treasure had been\nconcealed at all, and who, busying themselves in vain, because unguided\nattempts, to regain it, had given first birth, and then universal\ncurrency, to the reports which are now so common. Have you ever heard of\nany important treasure being unearthed along the coast?”\n\n“Never.”\n\n“But that Kidd’s accumulations were immense, is well known. I took it\nfor granted, therefore, that the earth still held them; and you will\nscarcely be surprised when I tell you that I felt a hope, nearly\namounting to certainty, that the parchment so strangely found, involved\na lost record of the place of deposit.”\n\n“But how did you proceed?”\n\n“I held the vellum again to the fire, after increasing the heat; but\nnothing appeared. I now thought it possible that the coating of dirt\nmight have something to do with the failure; so I carefully rinsed the\nparchment by pouring warm water over it, and, having done this, I\nplaced it in a tin pan, with the skull downwards, and put the pan upon\na furnace of lighted charcoal. In a few minutes, the pan having become\nthoroughly heated, I removed the slip, and, to my inexpressible joy,\nfound it spotted, in several places, with what appeared to be figures\narranged in lines. Again I placed it in the pan, and suffered it to\nremain another minute. Upon taking it off, the whole was just as you see\nit now.” Here Legrand, having re-heated the parchment, submitted it to\nmy inspection. The following characters were rudely traced, in a red\ntint, between the death’s-head and the goat:\n\n  “53‡‡†305))6*;4826)4‡)4‡);806*;48†8¶60))85;1‡);:‡\n  *8†83(88)5*†;46(;88*96*?;8)*‡(;485);5*†2:*‡(;4956*\n  2(5*--4)8¶8*;4069285);)6†8)4‡‡;1(‡9;48081;8:8‡1;4\n  8†85;4)485†528806*81(‡9;48;(88;4(‡?34;48)4‡;161;:\n  188;‡?;”\n\n“But,” said I, returning him the slip, “I am as much in the dark as\never. Were all the jewels of Golconda awaiting me upon my solution of\nthis enigma, I am quite sure that I should be unable to earn them.”\n\n“And yet,” said Legrand, “the solution is by no means so difficult as\nyou might be lead to imagine from the first hasty inspection of the\ncharacters. These characters, as any one might readily guess, form a\ncipher--that is to say, they convey a meaning; but then, from what is\nknown of Kidd, I could not suppose him capable of constructing any of\nthe more abstruse cryptographs. I made up my mind, at once, that this\nwas of a simple species--such, however, as would appear, to the crude\nintellect of the sailor, absolutely insoluble without the key.”\n\n“And you really solved it?”\n\n“Readily; I have solved others of an abstruseness ten thousand times\ngreater. Circumstances, and a certain bias of mind, have led me to\ntake interest in such riddles, and it may well be doubted whether human\ningenuity can construct an enigma of the kind which human ingenuity may\nnot, by proper application, resolve. In fact, having once established\nconnected and legible characters, I scarcely gave a thought to the mere\ndifficulty of developing their import.\n\n“In the present case--indeed in all cases of secret writing--the first\nquestion regards the language of the cipher; for the principles of\nsolution, so far, especially, as the more simple ciphers are concerned,\ndepend upon, and are varied by, the genius of the particular idiom.\nIn general, there is no alternative but experiment (directed by\nprobabilities) of every tongue known to him who attempts the solution,\nuntil the true one be attained. But, with the cipher now before us, all\ndifficulty was removed by the signature. The pun upon the word ‘Kidd’\nis appreciable in no other language than the English. But for this\nconsideration I should have begun my attempts with the Spanish and\nFrench, as the tongues in which a secret of this kind would most\nnaturally have been written by a pirate of the Spanish main. As it was,\nI assumed the cryptograph to be English.\n\n“You observe there are no divisions between the words. Had there been\ndivisions, the task would have been comparatively easy. In such case\nI should have commenced with a collation and analysis of the shorter\nwords, and, had a word of a single letter occurred, as is most likely,\n(a or I, for example,) I should have considered the solution as assured.\nBut, there being no division, my first step was to ascertain the\npredominant letters, as well as the least frequent. Counting all, I\nconstructed a table, thus:\n\nOf the character 8 there are 33.\n\n                          ;        “     26.\n                          4        “     19.\n                        ‡ )        “     16.\n                          *        “     13.\n                          5        “     12.\n                          6        “     11.\n                        † 1        “      8.\n                          0        “      6.\n                        9 2        “      5.\n                        : 3        “      4.\n                          ?        “      3.\n                          ¶        “      2.\n                         -.        “      1.\n\n“Now, in English, the letter which most frequently occurs is e.\nAfterwards, succession runs thus: _a o i d h n r s t u y c f g l m w b k\np q x z_. _E_ predominates so remarkably that an individual sentence of\nany length is rarely seen, in which it is not the prevailing character.\n\n“Here, then, we leave, in the very beginning, the groundwork for\nsomething more than a mere guess. The general use which may be made of\nthe table is obvious--but, in this particular cipher, we shall only very\npartially require its aid. As our predominant character is 8, we will\ncommence by assuming it as the _e_ of the natural alphabet. To verify\nthe supposition, let us observe if the 8 be seen often in couples--for\n_e_ is doubled with great frequency in English--in such words, for\nexample, as ‘meet,’ ‘.fleet,’ ‘speed,’ ‘seen,’ been,’ ‘agree,’ &c. In\nthe present instance we see it doubled no less than five times, although\nthe cryptograph is brief.\n\n“Let us assume 8, then, as _e_. Now, of all _words_ in the language,\n‘the’ is most usual; let us see, therefore, whether there are not\nrepetitions of any three characters, in the same order of collocation,\nthe last of them being 8. If we discover repetitions of such letters,\nso arranged, they will most probably represent the word ‘the.’ Upon\ninspection, we find no less than seven such arrangements, the characters\nbeing;48. We may, therefore, assume that; represents _t_, 4 represents\n_h_, and 8 represents _e_--the last being now well confirmed. Thus a\ngreat step has been taken.\n\n“But, having established a single word, we are enabled to establish\na vastly important point; that is to say, several commencements and\nterminations of other words. Let us refer, for example, to the last\ninstance but one, in which the combination;48 occurs--not far from\nthe end of the cipher. We know that the; immediately ensuing is the\ncommencement of a word, and, of the six characters succeeding this\n‘the,’ we are cognizant of no less than five. Let us set these\ncharacters down, thus, by the letters we know them to represent, leaving\na space for the unknown--\n\nt eeth.\n\n“Here we are enabled, at once, to discard the ‘th,’ as forming no\nportion of the word commencing with the first t; since, by experiment\nof the entire alphabet for a letter adapted to the vacancy, we perceive\nthat no word can be formed of which this _th_ can be a part. We are thus\nnarrowed into\n\nt ee,\n\nand, going through the alphabet, if necessary, as before, we arrive\nat the word ‘tree,’ as the sole possible reading. We thus gain\nanother letter, _r_, represented by (, with the words ‘the tree’ in\njuxtaposition.\n\n“Looking beyond these words, for a short distance, we again see\nthe combination;48, and employ it by way of _termination_ to what\nimmediately precedes. We have thus this arrangement:\n\nthe tree;4(‡?34 the,\n\nor, substituting the natural letters, where known, it reads thus:\n\nthe tree thr‡?3h the.\n\n“Now, if, in place of the unknown characters, we leave blank spaces, or\nsubstitute dots, we read thus:\n\nthe tree thr...h the,\n\nwhen the word ‘_through_’ makes itself evident at once. But this\ndiscovery gives us three new letters, _o_, _u_ and _g_, represented by\n‡? and 3.\n\n“Looking now, narrowly, through the cipher for combinations of known\ncharacters, we find, not very far from the beginning, this arrangement,\n\n83(88, or egree,\n\nwhich, plainly, is the conclusion of the word ‘degree,’ and gives us\nanother letter, _d_, represented by †.\n\n“Four letters beyond the word ‘degree,’ we perceive the combination\n\n;46(;88.\n\n“Translating the known characters, and representing the unknown by dots,\nas before, we read thus: th rtee. an arrangement immediately suggestive\nof the word ‘thirteen,’ and again furnishing us with two new characters,\n_i_ and _n_, represented by 6 and *.\n\n“Referring, now, to the beginning of the cryptograph, we find the\ncombination,\n\n53‡‡†.\n\n“Translating, as before, we obtain\n\ngood,\n\nwhich assures us that the first letter is _A_, and that the first two\nwords are ‘A good.’\n\n“It is now time that we arrange our key, as far as discovered, in a\ntabular form, to avoid confusion. It will stand thus:\n\n                5 represents      a\n                †       “         d\n                8       “         e\n                3       “         g\n                4       “         h\n                6       “         i\n                *       “         n\n                ‡       “         o\n                (       “         r\n                ;       “         t\n\n“We have, therefore, no less than ten of the most important letters\nrepresented, and it will be unnecessary to proceed with the details of\nthe solution. I have said enough to convince you that ciphers of this\nnature are readily soluble, and to give you some insight into the\nrationale of their development. But be assured that the specimen before\nus appertains to the very simplest species of cryptograph. It now only\nremains to give you the full translation of the characters upon the\nparchment, as unriddled. Here it is:\n\n“‘_A good glass in the bishop’s hostel in the devil’s seat forty-one\ndegrees and thirteen minutes northeast and by north main branch seventh\nlimb east side shoot from the left eye of the death’s-head a bee line\nfrom the tree through the shot fifty feet out_.’”\n\n“But,” said I, “the enigma seems still in as bad a condition as ever.\nHow is it possible to extort a meaning from all this jargon about\n‘devil’s seats,’ ‘death’s heads,’ and ‘bishop’s hotels?’”\n\n“I confess,” replied Legrand, “that the matter still wears a serious\naspect, when regarded with a casual glance. My first endeavor was\nto divide the sentence into the natural division intended by the\ncryptographist.”\n\n“You mean, to punctuate it?”\n\n“Something of that kind.”\n\n“But how was it possible to effect this?”\n\n“I reflected that it had been a point with the writer to run his words\ntogether without division, so as to increase the difficulty of solution.\nNow, a not over-acute man, in pursuing such an object would be nearly\ncertain to overdo the matter. When, in the course of his composition, he\narrived at a break in his subject which would naturally require a pause,\nor a point, he would be exceedingly apt to run his characters, at this\nplace, more than usually close together. If you will observe the MS., in\nthe present instance, you will easily detect five such cases of unusual\ncrowding. Acting upon this hint, I made the division thus: ‘A good\nglass in the Bishop’s hostel in the Devil’s seat--forty-one degrees and\nthirteen minutes--northeast and by north--main branch seventh limb east\nside--shoot from the left eye of the death’s-head--a bee-line from the\ntree through the shot fifty feet out.’”\n\n“Even this division,” said I, “leaves me still in the dark.”\n\n“It left me also in the dark,” replied Legrand, “for a few days; during\nwhich I made diligent inquiry, in the neighborhood of Sullivan’s Island,\nfor any building which went by the name of the ‘Bishop’s Hotel;’ for, of\ncourse, I dropped the obsolete word ‘hostel.’ Gaining no information on\nthe subject, I was on the point of extending my sphere of search, and\nproceeding in a more systematic manner, when, one morning, it entered\ninto my head, quite suddenly, that this ‘Bishop’s Hostel’ might have\nsome reference to an old family, of the name of Bessop, which, time out\nof mind, had held possession of an ancient manor-house, about four\nmiles to the northward of the Island. I accordingly went over to the\nplantation, and re-instituted my inquiries among the older negroes of\nthe place. At length one of the most aged of the women said that she\nhad heard of such a place as Bessop’s Castle, and thought that she could\nguide me to it, but that it was not a castle nor a tavern, but a high\nrock.\n\n“I offered to pay her well for her trouble, and, after some demur,\nshe consented to accompany me to the spot. We found it without much\ndifficulty, when, dismissing her, I proceeded to examine the place. The\n‘castle’ consisted of an irregular assemblage of cliffs and rocks--one\nof the latter being quite remarkable for its height as well as for its\ninsulated and artificial appearance I clambered to its apex, and then\nfelt much at a loss as to what should be next done.\n\n“While I was busied in reflection, my eyes fell upon a narrow ledge in\nthe eastern face of the rock, perhaps a yard below the summit upon which\nI stood. This ledge projected about eighteen inches, and was not more\nthan a foot wide, while a niche in the cliff just above it, gave it\na rude resemblance to one of the hollow-backed chairs used by our\nancestors. I made no doubt that here was the ‘devil’s seat’ alluded to\nin the MS., and now I seemed to grasp the full secret of the riddle.\n\n“The ‘good glass,’ I knew, could have reference to nothing but a\ntelescope; for the word ‘glass’ is rarely employed in any other sense\nby seamen. Now here, I at once saw, was a telescope to be used, and a\ndefinite point of view, admitting no variation, from which to use it.\nNor did I hesitate to believe that the phrases, “forty-one degrees\nand thirteen minutes,’ and ‘northeast and by north,’ were intended as\ndirections for the levelling of the glass. Greatly excited by these\ndiscoveries, I hurried home, procured a telescope, and returned to the\nrock.\n\n“I let myself down to the ledge, and found that it was impossible to\nretain a seat upon it except in one particular position. This fact\nconfirmed my preconceived idea. I proceeded to use the glass. Of course,\nthe ‘forty-one degrees and thirteen minutes’ could allude to nothing but\nelevation above the visible horizon, since the horizontal direction was\nclearly indicated by the words, ‘northeast and by north.’ This latter\ndirection I at once established by means of a pocket-compass; then,\npointing the glass as nearly at an angle of forty-one degrees of\nelevation as I could do it by guess, I moved it cautiously up or down,\nuntil my attention was arrested by a circular rift or opening in the\nfoliage of a large tree that overtopped its fellows in the distance.\nIn the centre of this rift I perceived a white spot, but could not, at\nfirst, distinguish what it was. Adjusting the focus of the telescope, I\nagain looked, and now made it out to be a human skull.\n\n“Upon this discovery I was so sanguine as to consider the enigma solved;\nfor the phrase ‘main branch, seventh limb, east side,’ could refer only\nto the position of the skull upon the tree, while ‘shoot from the left\neye of the death’s head’ admitted, also, of but one interpretation, in\nregard to a search for buried treasure. I perceived that the design was\nto drop a bullet from the left eye of the skull, and that a bee-line,\nor, in other words, a straight line, drawn from the nearest point of\nthe trunk through ‘the shot,’ (or the spot where the bullet fell,) and\nthence extended to a distance of fifty feet, would indicate a definite\npoint--and beneath this point I thought it at least possible that a\ndeposit of value lay concealed.”\n\n“All this,” I said, “is exceedingly clear, and, although ingenious,\nstill simple and explicit. When you left the Bishop’s Hotel, what then?”\n\n“Why, having carefully taken the bearings of the tree, I turned\nhomewards. The instant that I left ‘the devil’s seat,’ however, the\ncircular rift vanished; nor could I get a glimpse of it afterwards, turn\nas I would. What seems to me the chief ingenuity in this whole business,\nis the fact (for repeated experiment has convinced me it is a fact) that\nthe circular opening in question is visible from no other attainable\npoint of view than that afforded by the narrow ledge upon the face of\nthe rock.\n\n“In this expedition to the ‘Bishop’s Hotel’ I had been attended\nby Jupiter, who had, no doubt, observed, for some weeks past, the\nabstraction of my demeanor, and took especial care not to leave me\nalone. But, on the next day, getting up very early, I contrived to give\nhim the slip, and went into the hills in search of the tree. After much\ntoil I found it. When I came home at night my valet proposed to give\nme a flogging. With the rest of the adventure I believe you are as well\nacquainted as myself.”\n\n“I suppose,” said I, “you missed the spot, in the first attempt at\ndigging, through Jupiter’s stupidity in letting the bug fall through the\nright instead of through the left eye of the skull.”\n\n“Precisely. This mistake made a difference of about two inches and a\nhalf in the ‘shot’--that is to say, in the position of the peg nearest\nthe tree; and had the treasure been beneath the ‘shot,’ the error would\nhave been of little moment; but ‘the shot,’ together with the nearest\npoint of the tree, were merely two points for the establishment of\na line of direction; of course the error, however trivial in the\nbeginning, increased as we proceeded with the line, and by the time\nwe had gone fifty feet, threw us quite off the scent. But for my\ndeep-seated impressions that treasure was here somewhere actually\nburied, we might have had all our labor in vain.”\n\n“But your grandiloquence, and your conduct in swinging the beetle--how\nexcessively odd! I was sure you were mad. And why did you insist upon\nletting fall the bug, instead of a bullet, from the skull?”\n\n“Why, to be frank, I felt somewhat annoyed by your evident suspicions\ntouching my sanity, and so resolved to punish you quietly, in my own\nway, by a little bit of sober mystification. For this reason I swung\nthe beetle, and for this reason I let it fall it from the tree. An\nobservation of yours about its great weight suggested the latter idea.”\n\n“Yes, I perceive; and now there is only one point which puzzles me. What\nare we to make of the skeletons found in the hole?”\n\n“That is a question I am no more able to answer than yourself. There\nseems, however, only one plausible way of accounting for them--and yet\nit is dreadful to believe in such atrocity as my suggestion would imply.\nIt is clear that Kidd--if Kidd indeed secreted this treasure, which I\ndoubt not--it is clear that he must have had assistance in the labor.\nBut this labor concluded, he may have thought it expedient to remove\nall participants in his secret. Perhaps a couple of blows with a mattock\nwere sufficient, while his coadjutors were busy in the pit; perhaps it\nrequired a dozen--who shall tell?”\n\n\n\n\nFOUR BEASTS IN ONE--THE HOMO-CAMELEOPARD\n\n                     Chacun a ses vertus.\n                        --_Crebillon’s Xerxes._\n\nANTIOCHUS EPIPHANES is very generally looked upon as the Gog of the\nprophet Ezekiel. This honor is, however, more properly attributable to\nCambyses, the son of Cyrus. And, indeed, the character of the\nSyrian monarch does by no means stand in need of any adventitious\nembellishment. His accession to the throne, or rather his usurpation of\nthe sovereignty, a hundred and seventy-one years before the coming\nof Christ; his attempt to plunder the temple of Diana at Ephesus; his\nimplacable hostility to the Jews; his pollution of the Holy of Holies;\nand his miserable death at Taba, after a tumultuous reign of eleven\nyears, are circumstances of a prominent kind, and therefore more\ngenerally noticed by the historians of his time than the impious,\ndastardly, cruel, silly, and whimsical achievements which make up the\nsum total of his private life and reputation.\n\nLet us suppose, gentle reader, that it is now the year of the world\nthree thousand eight hundred and thirty, and let us, for a few minutes,\nimagine ourselves at that most grotesque habitation of man, the\nremarkable city of Antioch. To be sure there were, in Syria and other\ncountries, sixteen cities of that appellation, besides the one to which\nI more particularly allude. But ours is that which went by the name of\nAntiochia Epidaphne, from its vicinity to the little village of Daphne,\nwhere stood a temple to that divinity. It was built (although about this\nmatter there is some dispute) by Seleucus Nicanor, the first king of the\ncountry after Alexander the Great, in memory of his father Antiochus,\nand became immediately the residence of the Syrian monarchy. In the\nflourishing times of the Roman Empire, it was the ordinary station of\nthe prefect of the eastern provinces; and many of the emperors of the\nqueen city (among whom may be mentioned, especially, Verus and Valens)\nspent here the greater part of their time. But I perceive we have\narrived at the city itself. Let us ascend this battlement, and throw our\neyes upon the town and neighboring country.\n\n“What broad and rapid river is that which forces its way, with\ninnumerable falls, through the mountainous wilderness, and finally\nthrough the wilderness of buildings?”\n\nThat is the Orontes, and it is the only water in sight, with the\nexception of the Mediterranean, which stretches, like a broad mirror,\nabout twelve miles off to the southward. Every one has seen the\nMediterranean; but let me tell you, there are few who have had a peep at\nAntioch. By few, I mean, few who, like you and me, have had, at the same\ntime, the advantages of a modern education. Therefore cease to regard\nthat sea, and give your whole attention to the mass of houses that lie\nbeneath us. You will remember that it is now the year of the world three\nthousand eight hundred and thirty. Were it later--for example, were\nit the year of our Lord eighteen hundred and forty-five, we should be\ndeprived of this extraordinary spectacle. In the nineteenth century\nAntioch is--that is to say, Antioch will be--in a lamentable state\nof decay. It will have been, by that time, totally destroyed, at three\ndifferent periods, by three successive earthquakes. Indeed, to say the\ntruth, what little of its former self may then remain, will be found in\nso desolate and ruinous a state that the patriarch shall have removed\nhis residence to Damascus. This is well. I see you profit by my advice,\nand are making the most of your time in inspecting the premises--in\n\n-satisfying your eyes\n\nWith the memorials and the things of fame\n\nThat most renown this city.--\n\nI beg pardon; I had forgotten that Shakespeare will not flourish for\nseventeen hundred and fifty years to come. But does not the appearance\nof Epidaphne justify me in calling it grotesque?\n\n“It is well fortified; and in this respect is as much indebted to nature\nas to art.”\n\nVery true.\n\n“There are a prodigious number of stately palaces.”\n\nThere are.\n\n“And the numerous temples, sumptuous and magnificent, may bear\ncomparison with the most lauded of antiquity.”\n\nAll this I must acknowledge. Still there is an infinity of mud huts, and\nabominable hovels. We cannot help perceiving abundance of filth in\nevery kennel, and, were it not for the over-powering fumes of idolatrous\nincense, I have no doubt we should find a most intolerable stench.\nDid you ever behold streets so insufferably narrow, or houses so\nmiraculously tall? What gloom their shadows cast upon the ground! It\nis well the swinging lamps in those endless colonnades are kept burning\nthroughout the day; we should otherwise have the darkness of Egypt in\nthe time of her desolation.\n\n“It is certainly a strange place! What is the meaning of yonder singular\nbuilding? See! it towers above all others, and lies to the eastward of\nwhat I take to be the royal palace.”\n\nThat is the new Temple of the Sun, who is adored in Syria under the\ntitle of Elah Gabalah. Hereafter a very notorious Roman Emperor\nwill institute this worship in Rome, and thence derive a cognomen,\nHeliogabalus. I dare say you would like to take a peep at the divinity\nof the temple. You need not look up at the heavens; his Sunship is not\nthere--at least not the Sunship adored by the Syrians. That deity will\nbe found in the interior of yonder building. He is worshipped under the\nfigure of a large stone pillar terminating at the summit in a cone or\npyramid, whereby is denoted Fire.\n\n“Hark--behold!--who can those ridiculous beings be, half naked, with\ntheir faces painted, shouting and gesticulating to the rabble?”\n\nSome few are mountebanks. Others more particularly belong to the race\nof philosophers. The greatest portion, however--those especially who\nbelabor the populace with clubs--are the principal courtiers of the\npalace, executing as in duty bound, some laudable comicality of the\nking’s.\n\n“But what have we here? Heavens! the town is swarming with wild beasts!\nHow terrible a spectacle!--how dangerous a peculiarity!”\n\nTerrible, if you please; but not in the least degree dangerous. Each\nanimal if you will take the pains to observe, is following, very\nquietly, in the wake of its master. Some few, to be sure, are led with a\nrope about the neck, but these are chiefly the lesser or timid species.\nThe lion, the tiger, and the leopard are entirely without restraint.\nThey have been trained without difficulty to their present\nprofession, and attend upon their respective owners in the capacity of\nvalets-de-chambre. It is true, there are occasions when Nature asserts\nher violated dominions;--but then the devouring of a man-at-arms, or the\nthrottling of a consecrated bull, is a circumstance of too little moment\nto be more than hinted at in Epidaphne.\n\n“But what extraordinary tumult do I hear? Surely this is a loud noise\neven for Antioch! It argues some commotion of unusual interest.”\n\nYes--undoubtedly. The king has ordered some novel spectacle--some\ngladiatorial exhibition at the hippodrome--or perhaps the massacre of\nthe Scythian prisoners--or the conflagration of his new palace--or the\ntearing down of a handsome temple--or, indeed, a bonfire of a few Jews.\nThe uproar increases. Shouts of laughter ascend the skies. The air\nbecomes dissonant with wind instruments, and horrible with clamor of a\nmillion throats. Let us descend, for the love of fun, and see what is\ngoing on! This way--be careful! Here we are in the principal street,\nwhich is called the street of Timarchus. The sea of people is coming\nthis way, and we shall find a difficulty in stemming the tide. They are\npouring through the alley of Heraclides, which leads directly from the\npalace;--therefore the king is most probably among the rioters. Yes;--I\nhear the shouts of the herald proclaiming his approach in the pompous\nphraseology of the East. We shall have a glimpse of his person as\nhe passes by the temple of Ashimah. Let us ensconce ourselves in the\nvestibule of the sanctuary; he will be here anon. In the meantime let\nus survey this image. What is it? Oh! it is the god Ashimah in proper\nperson. You perceive, however, that he is neither a lamb, nor a\ngoat, nor a satyr, neither has he much resemblance to the Pan of the\nArcadians. Yet all these appearances have been given--I beg pardon--will\nbe given--by the learned of future ages, to the Ashimah of the Syrians.\nPut on your spectacles, and tell me what it is. What is it?\n\n“Bless me! it is an ape!”\n\nTrue--a baboon; but by no means the less a deity. His name is a\nderivation of the Greek Simia--what great fools are antiquarians! But\nsee!--see!--yonder scampers a ragged little urchin. Where is he going?\nWhat is he bawling about? What does he say? Oh! he says the king\nis coming in triumph; that he is dressed in state; that he has just\nfinished putting to death, with his own hand, a thousand chained\nIsraelitish prisoners! For this exploit the ragamuffin is lauding him to\nthe skies. Hark! here comes a troop of a similar description. They have\nmade a Latin hymn upon the valor of the king, and are singing it as they\ngo:\n\nMille, mille, mille,\n\nMille, mille, mille,\n\nDecollavimus, unus homo!\n\nMille, mille, mille, mille, decollavimus!\n\nMille, mille, mille,\n\nVivat qui mille mille occidit!\n\nTantum vini habet nemo\n\nQuantum sanguinis effudit!(*1)\n\nWhich may be thus paraphrased:\n\nA thousand, a thousand, a thousand,\n\nA thousand, a thousand, a thousand,\n\nWe, with one warrior, have slain!\n\nA thousand, a thousand, a thousand, a thousand.\n\nSing a thousand over again!\n\nSoho!--let us sing\n\nLong life to our king,\n\nWho knocked over a thousand so fine!\n\nSoho!--let us roar,\n\nHe has given us more\n\nRed gallons of gore\n\nThan all Syria can furnish of wine!\n\n“Do you hear that flourish of trumpets?”\n\nYes: the king is coming! See! the people are aghast with admiration,\nand lift up their eyes to the heavens in reverence. He comes;--he is\ncoming;--there he is!\n\n“Who?--where?--the king?--do not behold him--cannot say that I perceive\nhim.”\n\nThen you must be blind.\n\n“Very possible. Still I see nothing but a tumultuous mob of idiots\nand madmen, who are busy in prostrating themselves before a gigantic\ncameleopard, and endeavoring to obtain a kiss of the animal’s hoofs.\nSee! the beast has very justly kicked one of the rabble over--and\nanother--and another--and another. Indeed, I cannot help admiring the\nanimal for the excellent use he is making of his feet.”\n\nRabble, indeed!--why these are the noble and free citizens of Epidaphne!\nBeasts, did you say?--take care that you are not overheard. Do you not\nperceive that the animal has the visage of a man? Why, my dear sir,\nthat cameleopard is no other than Antiochus Epiphanes, Antiochus the\nIllustrious, King of Syria, and the most potent of all the autocrats\nof the East! It is true, that he is entitled, at times, Antiochus\nEpimanes--Antiochus the madman--but that is because all people have not\nthe capacity to appreciate his merits. It is also certain that he is at\npresent ensconced in the hide of a beast, and is doing his best to play\nthe part of a cameleopard; but this is done for the better sustaining\nhis dignity as king. Besides, the monarch is of gigantic stature,\nand the dress is therefore neither unbecoming nor over large. We may,\nhowever, presume he would not have adopted it but for some occasion\nof especial state. Such, you will allow, is the massacre of a thousand\nJews. With how superior a dignity the monarch perambulates on all fours!\nHis tail, you perceive, is held aloft by his two principal concubines,\nElline and Argelais; and his whole appearance would be infinitely\nprepossessing, were it not for the protuberance of his eyes, which will\ncertainly start out of his head, and the queer color of his face, which\nhas become nondescript from the quantity of wine he has swallowed. Let\nus follow him to the hippodrome, whither he is proceeding, and listen to\nthe song of triumph which he is commencing:\n\nWho is king but Epiphanes?\n\nSay--do you know?\n\nWho is king but Epiphanes?\n\nBravo!--bravo!\n\nThere is none but Epiphanes,\n\nNo--there is none:\n\nSo tear down the temples,\n\nAnd put out the sun!\n\nWell and strenuously sung! The populace are hailing him ‘Prince of\nPoets,’ as well as ‘Glory of the East,’ ‘Delight of the Universe,’ and\n‘Most Remarkable of Cameleopards.’ They have encored his effusion,\nand do you hear?--he is singing it over again. When he arrives at the\nhippodrome, he will be crowned with the poetic wreath, in anticipation\nof his victory at the approaching Olympics.\n\n“But, good Jupiter! what is the matter in the crowd behind us?”\n\nBehind us, did you say?--oh! ah!--I perceive. My friend, it is well\nthat you spoke in time. Let us get into a place of safety as soon as\npossible. Here!--let us conceal ourselves in the arch of this aqueduct,\nand I will inform you presently of the origin of the commotion. It has\nturned out as I have been anticipating. The singular appearance of the\ncameleopard and the head of a man, has, it seems, given offence to\nthe notions of propriety entertained, in general, by the wild animals\ndomesticated in the city. A mutiny has been the result; and, as is usual\nupon such occasions, all human efforts will be of no avail in quelling\nthe mob. Several of the Syrians have already been devoured; but the\ngeneral voice of the four-footed patriots seems to be for eating up the\ncameleopard. ‘The Prince of Poets,’ therefore, is upon his hinder legs,\nrunning for his life. His courtiers have left him in the lurch, and\nhis concubines have followed so excellent an example. ‘Delight of the\nUniverse,’ thou art in a sad predicament! ‘Glory of the East,’ thou art\nin danger of mastication! Therefore never regard so piteously thy tail;\nit will undoubtedly be draggled in the mud, and for this there is no\nhelp. Look not behind thee, then, at its unavoidable degradation; but\ntake courage, ply thy legs with vigor, and scud for the hippodrome!\nRemember that thou art Antiochus Epiphanes. Antiochus the\nIllustrious!--also ‘Prince of Poets,’ ‘Glory of the East,’ ‘Delight of\nthe Universe,’ and ‘Most Remarkable of Cameleopards!’ Heavens! what a\npower of speed thou art displaying! What a capacity for leg-bail\nthou art developing! Run, Prince!--Bravo, Epiphanes! Well done,\nCameleopard!--Glorious Antiochus!--He runs!--he leaps!--he flies! Like\nan arrow from a catapult he approaches the hippodrome! He leaps!--he\nshrieks!--he is there! This is well; for hadst thou, ‘Glory of\nthe East,’ been half a second longer in reaching the gates of the\nAmphitheatre, there is not a bear’s cub in Epidaphne that would not\nhave had a nibble at thy carcase. Let us be off--let us take our\ndeparture!--for we shall find our delicate modern ears unable to endure\nthe vast uproar which is about to commence in celebration of the king’s\nescape! Listen! it has already commenced. See!--the whole town is\ntopsy-turvy.\n\n“Surely this is the most populous city of the East! What a wilderness\nof people! what a jumble of all ranks and ages! what a multiplicity\nof sects and nations! what a variety of costumes! what a Babel of\nlanguages! what a screaming of beasts! what a tinkling of instruments!\nwhat a parcel of philosophers!”\n\nCome let us be off.\n\n“Stay a moment! I see a vast hubbub in the hippodrome; what is the\nmeaning of it, I beseech you?”\n\nThat?--oh, nothing! The noble and free citizens of Epidaphne being, as\nthey declare, well satisfied of the faith, valor, wisdom, and divinity\nof their king, and having, moreover, been eye-witnesses of his late\nsuperhuman agility, do think it no more than their duty to invest his\nbrows (in addition to the poetic crown) with the wreath of victory\nin the footrace--a wreath which it is evident he must obtain at the\ncelebration of the next Olympiad, and which, therefore, they now give\nhim in advance.\n\n\nFootnotes--Four Beasts\n\n(*1) Flavius Vospicus says, that the hymn here introduced was sung by\nthe rabble upon the occasion of Aurelian, in the Sarmatic war, having\nslain, with his own hand, nine hundred and fifty of the enemy.\n\n\n\n\nTHE MURDERS IN THE RUE MORGUE\n\n  What song the Syrens sang, or what name Achilles assumed when he hid\n  himself among women, although puzzling questions, are not beyond\n  _all_ conjecture.\n\n                    --_Sir Thomas Browne._\n\n\nThe mental features discoursed of as the analytical, are, in themselves,\nbut little susceptible of analysis. We appreciate them only in their\neffects. We know of them, among other things, that they are always to\ntheir possessor, when inordinately possessed, a source of the liveliest\nenjoyment. As the strong man exults in his physical ability, delighting\nin such exercises as call his muscles into action, so glories the\nanalyst in that moral activity which _disentangles._ He derives pleasure\nfrom even the most trivial occupations bringing his talent into play. He\nis fond of enigmas, of conundrums, of hieroglyphics; exhibiting in his\nsolutions of each a degree of _acumen_ which appears to the ordinary\napprehension præternatural. His results, brought about by the very soul\nand essence of method, have, in truth, the whole air of intuition.\n\nThe faculty of re-solution is possibly much invigorated by mathematical\nstudy, and especially by that highest branch of it which, unjustly, and\nmerely on account of its retrograde operations, has been called, as\nif _par excellence_, analysis. Yet to calculate is not in itself to\nanalyse. A chess-player, for example, does the one without effort at\nthe other. It follows that the game of chess, in its effects upon mental\ncharacter, is greatly misunderstood. I am not now writing a treatise,\nbut simply prefacing a somewhat peculiar narrative by observations very\nmuch at random; I will, therefore, take occasion to assert that the\nhigher powers of the reflective intellect are more decidedly and more\nusefully tasked by the unostentatious game of draughts than by all the\nelaborate frivolity of chess. In this latter, where the pieces have\ndifferent and _bizarre_ motions, with various and variable values, what\nis only complex is mistaken (a not unusual error) for what is profound.\nThe _attention_ is here called powerfully into play. If it flag for an\ninstant, an oversight is committed resulting in injury or defeat. The\npossible moves being not only manifold but involute, the chances of such\noversights are multiplied; and in nine cases out of ten it is the\nmore concentrative rather than the more acute player who conquers. In\ndraughts, on the contrary, where the moves are _unique_ and have but\nlittle variation, the probabilities of inadvertence are diminished, and\nthe mere attention being left comparatively unemployed, what advantages\nare obtained by either party are obtained by superior _acumen_. To be\nless abstract--Let us suppose a game of draughts where the pieces are\nreduced to four kings, and where, of course, no oversight is to be\nexpected. It is obvious that here the victory can be decided (the\nplayers being at all equal) only by some _recherché_ movement, the\nresult of some strong exertion of the intellect. Deprived of ordinary\nresources, the analyst throws himself into the spirit of his opponent,\nidentifies himself therewith, and not unfrequently sees thus, at a\nglance, the sole methods (sometime indeed absurdly simple ones) by which\nhe may seduce into error or hurry into miscalculation.\n\nWhist has long been noted for its influence upon what is termed the\ncalculating power; and men of the highest order of intellect have been\nknown to take an apparently unaccountable delight in it, while eschewing\nchess as frivolous. Beyond doubt there is nothing of a similar nature\nso greatly tasking the faculty of analysis. The best chess-player in\nChristendom _may_ be little more than the best player of chess; but\nproficiency in whist implies capacity for success in all those more\nimportant undertakings where mind struggles with mind. When I say\nproficiency, I mean that perfection in the game which includes a\ncomprehension of _all_ the sources whence legitimate advantage may be\nderived. These are not only manifold but multiform, and lie frequently\namong recesses of thought altogether inaccessible to the ordinary\nunderstanding. To observe attentively is to remember distinctly; and,\nso far, the concentrative chess-player will do very well at whist; while\nthe rules of Hoyle (themselves based upon the mere mechanism of the\ngame) are sufficiently and generally comprehensible. Thus to have a\nretentive memory, and to proceed by “the book,” are points commonly\nregarded as the sum total of good playing. But it is in matters beyond\nthe limits of mere rule that the skill of the analyst is evinced. He\nmakes, in silence, a host of observations and inferences. So, perhaps,\ndo his companions; and the difference in the extent of the information\nobtained, lies not so much in the validity of the inference as in the\nquality of the observation. The necessary knowledge is that of _what_ to\nobserve. Our player confines himself not at all; nor, because the game\nis the object, does he reject deductions from things external to the\ngame. He examines the countenance of his partner, comparing it carefully\nwith that of each of his opponents. He considers the mode of assorting\nthe cards in each hand; often counting trump by trump, and honor by\nhonor, through the glances bestowed by their holders upon each. He notes\nevery variation of face as the play progresses, gathering a fund\nof thought from the differences in the expression of certainty, of\nsurprise, of triumph, or of chagrin. From the manner of gathering up\na trick he judges whether the person taking it can make another in the\nsuit. He recognises what is played through feint, by the air with\nwhich it is thrown upon the table. A casual or inadvertent word; the\naccidental dropping or turning of a card, with the accompanying anxiety\nor carelessness in regard to its concealment; the counting of the\ntricks, with the order of their arrangement; embarrassment, hesitation,\neagerness or trepidation--all afford, to his apparently intuitive\nperception, indications of the true state of affairs. The first two\nor three rounds having been played, he is in full possession of the\ncontents of each hand, and thenceforward puts down his cards with as\nabsolute a precision of purpose as if the rest of the party had turned\noutward the faces of their own.\n\nThe analytical power should not be confounded with ample ingenuity; for\nwhile the analyst is necessarily ingenious, the ingenious man is often\nremarkably incapable of analysis. The constructive or combining power,\nby which ingenuity is usually manifested, and to which the phrenologists\n(I believe erroneously) have assigned a separate organ, supposing it a\nprimitive faculty, has been so frequently seen in those whose intellect\nbordered otherwise upon idiocy, as to have attracted general observation\namong writers on morals. Between ingenuity and the analytic ability\nthere exists a difference far greater, indeed, than that between the\nfancy and the imagination, but of a character very strictly analogous.\nIt will be found, in fact, that the ingenious are always fanciful, and\nthe _truly_ imaginative never otherwise than analytic.\n\nThe narrative which follows will appear to the reader somewhat in the\nlight of a commentary upon the propositions just advanced.\n\nResiding in Paris during the spring and part of the summer of 18--, I\nthere became acquainted with a Monsieur C. Auguste Dupin. This young\ngentleman was of an excellent--indeed of an illustrious family, but, by\na variety of untoward events, had been reduced to such poverty that the\nenergy of his character succumbed beneath it, and he ceased to bestir\nhimself in the world, or to care for the retrieval of his fortunes.\nBy courtesy of his creditors, there still remained in his possession a\nsmall remnant of his patrimony; and, upon the income arising from this,\nhe managed, by means of a rigorous economy, to procure the necessaries\nof life, without troubling himself about its superfluities. Books,\nindeed, were his sole luxuries, and in Paris these are easily obtained.\n\nOur first meeting was at an obscure library in the Rue Montmartre, where\nthe accident of our both being in search of the same very rare and very\nremarkable volume, brought us into closer communion. We saw each other\nagain and again. I was deeply interested in the little family history\nwhich he detailed to me with all that candor which a Frenchman indulges\nwhenever mere self is his theme. I was astonished, too, at the vast\nextent of his reading; and, above all, I felt my soul enkindled within\nme by the wild fervor, and the vivid freshness of his imagination.\nSeeking in Paris the objects I then sought, I felt that the society of\nsuch a man would be to me a treasure beyond price; and this feeling I\nfrankly confided to him. It was at length arranged that we should live\ntogether during my stay in the city; and as my worldly circumstances\nwere somewhat less embarrassed than his own, I was permitted to be\nat the expense of renting, and furnishing in a style which suited the\nrather fantastic gloom of our common temper, a time-eaten and grotesque\nmansion, long deserted through superstitions into which we did not\ninquire, and tottering to its fall in a retired and desolate portion of\nthe Faubourg St. Germain.\n\nHad the routine of our life at this place been known to the world, we\nshould have been regarded as madmen--although, perhaps, as madmen of\na harmless nature. Our seclusion was perfect. We admitted no visitors.\nIndeed the locality of our retirement had been carefully kept a secret\nfrom my own former associates; and it had been many years since Dupin\nhad ceased to know or be known in Paris. We existed within ourselves\nalone.\n\nIt was a freak of fancy in my friend (for what else shall I call it?) to\nbe enamored of the Night for her own sake; and into this _bizarrerie_,\nas into all his others, I quietly fell; giving myself up to his wild\nwhims with a perfect _abandon_. The sable divinity would not herself\ndwell with us always; but we could counterfeit her presence. At the\nfirst dawn of the morning we closed all the messy shutters of our old\nbuilding; lighting a couple of tapers which, strongly perfumed, threw\nout only the ghastliest and feeblest of rays. By the aid of these we\nthen busied our souls in dreams--reading, writing, or conversing, until\nwarned by the clock of the advent of the true Darkness. Then we sallied\nforth into the streets arm in arm, continuing the topics of the day, or\nroaming far and wide until a late hour, seeking, amid the wild lights\nand shadows of the populous city, that infinity of mental excitement\nwhich quiet observation can afford.\n\nAt such times I could not help remarking and admiring (although from\nhis rich ideality I had been prepared to expect it) a peculiar analytic\nability in Dupin. He seemed, too, to take an eager delight in its\nexercise--if not exactly in its display--and did not hesitate to confess\nthe pleasure thus derived. He boasted to me, with a low chuckling laugh,\nthat most men, in respect to himself, wore windows in their bosoms,\nand was wont to follow up such assertions by direct and very startling\nproofs of his intimate knowledge of my own. His manner at these moments\nwas frigid and abstract; his eyes were vacant in expression; while his\nvoice, usually a rich tenor, rose into a treble which would have sounded\npetulantly but for the deliberateness and entire distinctness of the\nenunciation. Observing him in these moods, I often dwelt meditatively\nupon the old philosophy of the Bi-Part Soul, and amused myself with the\nfancy of a double Dupin--the creative and the resolvent.\n\nLet it not be supposed, from what I have just said, that I am detailing\nany mystery, or penning any romance. What I have described in the\nFrenchman, was merely the result of an excited, or perhaps of a diseased\nintelligence. But of the character of his remarks at the periods in\nquestion an example will best convey the idea.\n\nWe were strolling one night down a long dirty street in the vicinity of\nthe Palais Royal. Being both, apparently, occupied with thought, neither\nof us had spoken a syllable for fifteen minutes at least. All at once\nDupin broke forth with these words:\n\n“He is a very little fellow, that’s true, and would do better for the\n_Théâtre des Variétés_.”\n\n“There can be no doubt of that,” I replied unwittingly, and not at first\nobserving (so much had I been absorbed in reflection) the extraordinary\nmanner in which the speaker had chimed in with my meditations. In\nan instant afterward I recollected myself, and my astonishment was\nprofound.\n\n“Dupin,” said I, gravely, “this is beyond my comprehension. I do not\nhesitate to say that I am amazed, and can scarcely credit my senses. How\nwas it possible you should know I was thinking of -----?” Here I paused,\nto ascertain beyond a doubt whether he really knew of whom I thought.\n\n--“of Chantilly,” said he, “why do you pause? You were remarking to\nyourself that his diminutive figure unfitted him for tragedy.”\n\nThis was precisely what had formed the subject of my reflections.\nChantilly was a _quondam_ cobbler of the Rue St. Denis, who, becoming\nstage-mad, had attempted the _rôle_ of Xerxes, in Crébillon’s tragedy so\ncalled, and been notoriously Pasquinaded for his pains.\n\n“Tell me, for Heaven’s sake,” I exclaimed, “the method--if method there\nis--by which you have been enabled to fathom my soul in this matter.” In\nfact I was even more startled than I would have been willing to express.\n\n“It was the fruiterer,” replied my friend, “who brought you to the\nconclusion that the mender of soles was not of sufficient height for\nXerxes _et id genus omne_.”\n\n“The fruiterer!--you astonish me--I know no fruiterer whomsoever.”\n\n“The man who ran up against you as we entered the street--it may have\nbeen fifteen minutes ago.”\n\nI now remembered that, in fact, a fruiterer, carrying upon his head a\nlarge basket of apples, had nearly thrown me down, by accident, as we\npassed from the Rue C ---- into the thoroughfare where we stood; but\nwhat this had to do with Chantilly I could not possibly understand.\n\nThere was not a particle of _charlatanerie_ about Dupin. “I will\nexplain,” he said, “and that you may comprehend all clearly, we will\nfirst retrace the course of your meditations, from the moment in which\nI spoke to you until that of the _rencontre_ with the fruiterer in\nquestion. The larger links of the chain run thus--Chantilly, Orion, Dr.\nNichols, Epicurus, Stereotomy, the street stones, the fruiterer.”\n\nThere are few persons who have not, at some period of their lives,\namused themselves in retracing the steps by which particular conclusions\nof their own minds have been attained. The occupation is often full of\ninterest and he who attempts it for the first time is astonished by\nthe apparently illimitable distance and incoherence between the\nstarting-point and the goal. What, then, must have been my amazement\nwhen I heard the Frenchman speak what he had just spoken, and when I\ncould not help acknowledging that he had spoken the truth. He continued:\n\n“We had been talking of horses, if I remember aright, just before\nleaving the Rue C ----. This was the last subject we discussed. As we\ncrossed into this street, a fruiterer, with a large basket upon his\nhead, brushing quickly past us, thrust you upon a pile of paving stones\ncollected at a spot where the causeway is undergoing repair. You stepped\nupon one of the loose fragments, slipped, slightly strained your ankle,\nappeared vexed or sulky, muttered a few words, turned to look at the\npile, and then proceeded in silence. I was not particularly attentive to\nwhat you did; but observation has become with me, of late, a species of\nnecessity.\n\n“You kept your eyes upon the ground--glancing, with a petulant\nexpression, at the holes and ruts in the pavement, (so that I saw you\nwere still thinking of the stones,) until we reached the little alley\ncalled Lamartine, which has been paved, by way of experiment, with the\noverlapping and riveted blocks. Here your countenance brightened up,\nand, perceiving your lips move, I could not doubt that you murmured the\nword ‘stereotomy,’ a term very affectedly applied to this species of\npavement. I knew that you could not say to yourself ‘stereotomy’ without\nbeing brought to think of atomies, and thus of the theories of Epicurus;\nand since, when we discussed this subject not very long ago, I mentioned\nto you how singularly, yet with how little notice, the vague guesses\nof that noble Greek had met with confirmation in the late nebular\ncosmogony, I felt that you could not avoid casting your eyes upward to\nthe great _nebula_ in Orion, and I certainly expected that you would do\nso. You did look up; and I was now assured that I had correctly followed\nyour steps. But in that bitter _tirade_ upon Chantilly, which appeared\nin yesterday’s ‘_Musée_,’ the satirist, making some disgraceful\nallusions to the cobbler’s change of name upon assuming the buskin,\nquoted a Latin line about which we have often conversed. I mean the line\n\n     Perdidit antiquum litera sonum.\n\n“I had told you that this was in reference to Orion, formerly written\nUrion; and, from certain pungencies connected with this explanation, I\nwas aware that you could not have forgotten it. It was clear, therefore,\nthat you would not fail to combine the two ideas of Orion and Chantilly.\nThat you did combine them I saw by the character of the smile which\npassed over your lips. You thought of the poor cobbler’s immolation. So\nfar, you had been stooping in your gait; but now I saw you draw yourself\nup to your full height. I was then sure that you reflected upon the\ndiminutive figure of Chantilly. At this point I interrupted your\nmeditations to remark that as, in fact, he was a very little\nfellow--that Chantilly--he would do better at the _Théâtre des\nVariétés_.”\n\nNot long after this, we were looking over an evening edition of the\n“Gazette des Tribunaux,” when the following paragraphs arrested our\nattention.\n\n“EXTRAORDINARY MURDERS.--This morning, about three o’clock, the\ninhabitants of the Quartier St. Roch were aroused from sleep by a\nsuccession of terrific shrieks, issuing, apparently, from the fourth\nstory of a house in the Rue Morgue, known to be in the sole occupancy of\none Madame L’Espanaye, and her daughter Mademoiselle Camille L’Espanaye.\nAfter some delay, occasioned by a fruitless attempt to procure admission\nin the usual manner, the gateway was broken in with a crowbar, and eight\nor ten of the neighbors entered accompanied by two _gendarmes_. By this\ntime the cries had ceased; but, as the party rushed up the first\nflight of stairs, two or more rough voices in angry contention were\ndistinguished and seemed to proceed from the upper part of the house.\nAs the second landing was reached, these sounds, also, had ceased and\neverything remained perfectly quiet. The party spread themselves and\nhurried from room to room. Upon arriving at a large back chamber in\nthe fourth story, (the door of which, being found locked, with the key\ninside, was forced open,) a spectacle presented itself which struck\nevery one present not less with horror than with astonishment.\n\n“The apartment was in the wildest disorder--the furniture broken and\nthrown about in all directions. There was only one bedstead; and from\nthis the bed had been removed, and thrown into the middle of the floor.\nOn a chair lay a razor, besmeared with blood. On the hearth were two or\nthree long and thick tresses of grey human hair, also dabbled in blood,\nand seeming to have been pulled out by the roots. Upon the floor were\nfound four Napoleons, an ear-ring of topaz, three large silver spoons,\nthree smaller of_ métal d’Alger_, and two bags, containing nearly four\nthousand francs in gold. The drawers of a _bureau_, which stood in\none corner were open, and had been, apparently, rifled, although many\narticles still remained in them. A small iron safe was discovered under\nthe _bed_ (not under the bedstead). It was open, with the key still in\nthe door. It had no contents beyond a few old letters, and other papers\nof little consequence.\n\n“Of Madame L’Espanaye no traces were here seen; but an unusual quantity\nof soot being observed in the fire-place, a search was made in the\nchimney, and (horrible to relate!) the corpse of the daughter, head\ndownward, was dragged therefrom; it having been thus forced up the\nnarrow aperture for a considerable distance. The body was quite warm.\nUpon examining it, many excoriations were perceived, no doubt occasioned\nby the violence with which it had been thrust up and disengaged. Upon\nthe face were many severe scratches, and, upon the throat, dark bruises,\nand deep indentations of finger nails, as if the deceased had been\nthrottled to death.\n\n“After a thorough investigation of every portion of the house, without\nfarther discovery, the party made its way into a small paved yard in\nthe rear of the building, where lay the corpse of the old lady, with her\nthroat so entirely cut that, upon an attempt to raise her, the head fell\noff. The body, as well as the head, was fearfully mutilated--the former\nso much so as scarcely to retain any semblance of humanity.\n\n“To this horrible mystery there is not as yet, we believe, the slightest\nclew.”\n\nThe next day’s paper had these additional particulars.\n\n“_The Tragedy in the Rue Morgue._ Many individuals have been examined\nin relation to this most extraordinary and frightful affair. [The word\n‘affaire’ has not yet, in France, that levity of import which it conveys\nwith us,] “but nothing whatever has transpired to throw light upon it.\nWe give below all the material testimony elicited.\n\n“_Pauline Dubourg_, laundress, deposes that she has known both the\ndeceased for three years, having washed for them during that period.\nThe old lady and her daughter seemed on good terms--very affectionate\ntowards each other. They were excellent pay. Could not speak in regard\nto their mode or means of living. Believed that Madame L. told fortunes\nfor a living. Was reputed to have money put by. Never met any persons\nin the house when she called for the clothes or took them home. Was sure\nthat they had no servant in employ. There appeared to be no furniture in\nany part of the building except in the fourth story.\n\n“_Pierre Moreau_, tobacconist, deposes that he has been in the habit of\nselling small quantities of tobacco and snuff to Madame L’Espanaye for\nnearly four years. Was born in the neighborhood, and has always resided\nthere. The deceased and her daughter had occupied the house in which the\ncorpses were found, for more than six years. It was formerly occupied by\na jeweller, who under-let the upper rooms to various persons. The house\nwas the property of Madame L. She became dissatisfied with the abuse of\nthe premises by her tenant, and moved into them herself, refusing to let\nany portion. The old lady was childish. Witness had seen the daughter\nsome five or six times during the six years. The two lived an\nexceedingly retired life--were reputed to have money. Had heard it said\namong the neighbors that Madame L. told fortunes--did not believe it.\nHad never seen any person enter the door except the old lady and her\ndaughter, a porter once or twice, and a physician some eight or ten\ntimes.\n\n“Many other persons, neighbors, gave evidence to the same effect. No one\nwas spoken of as frequenting the house. It was not known whether there\nwere any living connexions of Madame L. and her daughter. The shutters\nof the front windows were seldom opened. Those in the rear were always\nclosed, with the exception of the large back room, fourth story. The\nhouse was a good house--not very old.\n\n“_Isidore Muset_, _gendarme_, deposes that he was called to the house\nabout three o’clock in the morning, and found some twenty or thirty\npersons at the gateway, endeavoring to gain admittance. Forced it open,\nat length, with a bayonet--not with a crowbar. Had but little difficulty\nin getting it open, on account of its being a double or folding gate,\nand bolted neither at bottom not top. The shrieks were continued until\nthe gate was forced--and then suddenly ceased. They seemed to be screams\nof some person (or persons) in great agony--were loud and drawn out,\nnot short and quick. Witness led the way up stairs. Upon reaching the\nfirst landing, heard two voices in loud and angry contention--the one\na gruff voice, the other much shriller--a very strange voice. Could\ndistinguish some words of the former, which was that of a Frenchman. Was\npositive that it was not a woman’s voice. Could distinguish the words\n‘_sacré_’ and ‘_diable._’ The shrill voice was that of a foreigner.\nCould not be sure whether it was the voice of a man or of a woman. Could\nnot make out what was said, but believed the language to be Spanish. The\nstate of the room and of the bodies was described by this witness as we\ndescribed them yesterday.\n\n“_Henri Duval_, a neighbor, and by trade a silver-smith, deposes that\nhe was one of the party who first entered the house. Corroborates the\ntestimony of Muset in general. As soon as they forced an entrance, they\nreclosed the door, to keep out the crowd, which collected very fast,\nnotwithstanding the lateness of the hour. The shrill voice, this witness\nthinks, was that of an Italian. Was certain it was not French. Could not\nbe sure that it was a man’s voice. It might have been a woman’s. Was not\nacquainted with the Italian language. Could not distinguish the words,\nbut was convinced by the intonation that the speaker was an Italian.\nKnew Madame L. and her daughter. Had conversed with both frequently. Was\nsure that the shrill voice was not that of either of the deceased.\n\n“--_Odenheimer, restaurateur._ This witness volunteered his testimony.\nNot speaking French, was examined through an interpreter. Is a native of\nAmsterdam. Was passing the house at the time of the shrieks. They lasted\nfor several minutes--probably ten. They were long and loud--very awful\nand distressing. Was one of those who entered the building. Corroborated\nthe previous evidence in every respect but one. Was sure that the shrill\nvoice was that of a man--of a Frenchman. Could not distinguish the\nwords uttered. They were loud and quick--unequal--spoken apparently in\nfear as well as in anger. The voice was harsh--not so much shrill as\nharsh. Could not call it a shrill voice. The gruff voice said repeatedly\n‘_sacré_,’ ‘_diable_,’ and once ‘_mon Dieu._’\n\n“_Jules Mignaud_, banker, of the firm of Mignaud et Fils, Rue Deloraine.\nIs the elder Mignaud. Madame L’Espanaye had some property. Had opened an\naccount with his banking house in the spring of the year--(eight years\npreviously). Made frequent deposits in small sums. Had checked for\nnothing until the third day before her death, when she took out in\nperson the sum of 4000 francs. This sum was paid in gold, and a clerk\nwent home with the money.\n\n“_Adolphe Le Bon_, clerk to Mignaud et Fils, deposes that on the day in\nquestion, about noon, he accompanied Madame L’Espanaye to her residence\nwith the 4000 francs, put up in two bags. Upon the door being opened,\nMademoiselle L. appeared and took from his hands one of the bags, while\nthe old lady relieved him of the other. He then bowed and departed. Did\nnot see any person in the street at the time. It is a bye-street--very\nlonely.\n\n“_William Bird_, tailor deposes that he was one of the party who entered\nthe house. Is an Englishman. Has lived in Paris two years. Was one of\nthe first to ascend the stairs. Heard the voices in contention. The\ngruff voice was that of a Frenchman. Could make out several words, but\ncannot now remember all. Heard distinctly ‘_sacré_’ and ‘_mon Dieu._’\nThere was a sound at the moment as if of several persons struggling--a\nscraping and scuffling sound. The shrill voice was very loud--louder\nthan the gruff one. Is sure that it was not the voice of an Englishman.\nAppeared to be that of a German. Might have been a woman’s voice. Does\nnot understand German.\n\n“Four of the above-named witnesses, being recalled, deposed that the\ndoor of the chamber in which was found the body of Mademoiselle L.\nwas locked on the inside when the party reached it. Every thing was\nperfectly silent--no groans or noises of any kind. Upon forcing the door\nno person was seen. The windows, both of the back and front room, were\ndown and firmly fastened from within. A door between the two rooms was\nclosed, but not locked. The door leading from the front room into the\npassage was locked, with the key on the inside. A small room in the\nfront of the house, on the fourth story, at the head of the passage was\nopen, the door being ajar. This room was crowded with old beds, boxes,\nand so forth. These were carefully removed and searched. There was not\nan inch of any portion of the house which was not carefully searched.\nSweeps were sent up and down the chimneys. The house was a four story\none, with garrets (_mansardes._) A trap-door on the roof was nailed down\nvery securely--did not appear to have been opened for years. The\ntime elapsing between the hearing of the voices in contention and the\nbreaking open of the room door, was variously stated by the witnesses.\nSome made it as short as three minutes--some as long as five. The door\nwas opened with difficulty.\n\n“_Alfonzo Garcio_, undertaker, deposes that he resides in the Rue\nMorgue. Is a native of Spain. Was one of the party who entered the\nhouse. Did not proceed up stairs. Is nervous, and was apprehensive of\nthe consequences of agitation. Heard the voices in contention. The gruff\nvoice was that of a Frenchman. Could not distinguish what was said.\nThe shrill voice was that of an Englishman--is sure of this. Does not\nunderstand the English language, but judges by the intonation.\n\n“_Alberto Montani_, confectioner, deposes that he was among the first\nto ascend the stairs. Heard the voices in question. The gruff voice was\nthat of a Frenchman. Distinguished several words. The speaker appeared\nto be expostulating. Could not make out the words of the shrill voice.\nSpoke quick and unevenly. Thinks it the voice of a Russian. Corroborates\nthe general testimony. Is an Italian. Never conversed with a native of\nRussia.\n\n“Several witnesses, recalled, here testified that the chimneys of all\nthe rooms on the fourth story were too narrow to admit the passage of a\nhuman being. By ‘sweeps’ were meant cylindrical sweeping brushes, such\nas are employed by those who clean chimneys. These brushes were passed\nup and down every flue in the house. There is no back passage by which\nany one could have descended while the party proceeded up stairs. The\nbody of Mademoiselle L’Espanaye was so firmly wedged in the chimney that\nit could not be got down until four or five of the party united their\nstrength.\n\n“_Paul Dumas_, physician, deposes that he was called to view the\nbodies about day-break. They were both then lying on the sacking of the\nbedstead in the chamber where Mademoiselle L. was found. The corpse of\nthe young lady was much bruised and excoriated. The fact that it\nhad been thrust up the chimney would sufficiently account for these\nappearances. The throat was greatly chafed. There were several deep\nscratches just below the chin, together with a series of livid spots\nwhich were evidently the impression of fingers. The face was fearfully\ndiscolored, and the eye-balls protruded. The tongue had been partially\nbitten through. A large bruise was discovered upon the pit of the\nstomach, produced, apparently, by the pressure of a knee. In the opinion\nof M. Dumas, Mademoiselle L’Espanaye had been throttled to death by\nsome person or persons unknown. The corpse of the mother was horribly\nmutilated. All the bones of the right leg and arm were more or less\nshattered. The left _tibia_ much splintered, as well as all the ribs of\nthe left side. Whole body dreadfully bruised and discolored. It was not\npossible to say how the injuries had been inflicted. A heavy club of\nwood, or a broad bar of iron--a chair--any large, heavy, and obtuse\nweapon would have produced such results, if wielded by the hands of\na very powerful man. No woman could have inflicted the blows with any\nweapon. The head of the deceased, when seen by witness, was entirely\nseparated from the body, and was also greatly shattered. The throat\nhad evidently been cut with some very sharp instrument--probably with a\nrazor.\n\n“_Alexandre Etienne_, surgeon, was called with M. Dumas to view the\nbodies. Corroborated the testimony, and the opinions of M. Dumas.\n\n“Nothing farther of importance was elicited, although several other\npersons were examined. A murder so mysterious, and so perplexing in all\nits particulars, was never before committed in Paris--if indeed a murder\nhas been committed at all. The police are entirely at fault--an unusual\noccurrence in affairs of this nature. There is not, however, the shadow\nof a clew apparent.”\n\nThe evening edition of the paper stated that the greatest excitement\nstill continued in the Quartier St. Roch--that the premises in question\nhad been carefully re-searched, and fresh examinations of witnesses\ninstituted, but all to no purpose. A postscript, however, mentioned\nthat Adolphe Le Bon had been arrested and imprisoned--although nothing\nappeared to criminate him, beyond the facts already detailed.\n\nDupin seemed singularly interested in the progress of this affair--at\nleast so I judged from his manner, for he made no comments. It was only\nafter the announcement that Le Bon had been imprisoned, that he asked me\nmy opinion respecting the murders.\n\nI could merely agree with all Paris in considering them an insoluble\nmystery. I saw no means by which it would be possible to trace the\nmurderer.\n\n“We must not judge of the means,” said Dupin, “by this shell of an\nexamination. The Parisian police, so much extolled for _acumen_, are\ncunning, but no more. There is no method in their proceedings, beyond\nthe method of the moment. They make a vast parade of measures; but, not\nunfrequently, these are so ill adapted to the objects proposed, as\nto put us in mind of Monsieur Jourdain’s calling for his\n_robe-de-chambre--pour mieux entendre la musique._ The results attained\nby them are not unfrequently surprising, but, for the most part, are\nbrought about by simple diligence and activity. When these qualities are\nunavailing, their schemes fail. Vidocq, for example, was a good\nguesser and a persevering man. But, without educated thought, he erred\ncontinually by the very intensity of his investigations. He impaired his\nvision by holding the object too close. He might see, perhaps, one or\ntwo points with unusual clearness, but in so doing he, necessarily, lost\nsight of the matter as a whole. Thus there is such a thing as being too\nprofound. Truth is not always in a well. In fact, as regards the more\nimportant knowledge, I do believe that she is invariably superficial.\nThe depth lies in the valleys where we seek her, and not upon the\nmountain-tops where she is found. The modes and sources of this kind of\nerror are well typified in the contemplation of the heavenly bodies.\nTo look at a star by glances--to view it in a side-long way, by turning\ntoward it the exterior portions of the _retina_ (more susceptible of\nfeeble impressions of light than the interior), is to behold the star\ndistinctly--is to have the best appreciation of its lustre--a lustre\nwhich grows dim just in proportion as we turn our vision _fully_ upon\nit. A greater number of rays actually fall upon the eye in the latter\ncase, but, in the former, there is the more refined capacity for\ncomprehension. By undue profundity we perplex and enfeeble thought; and\nit is possible to make even Venus herself vanish from the firmanent by a\nscrutiny too sustained, too concentrated, or too direct.\n\n“As for these murders, let us enter into some examinations for\nourselves, before we make up an opinion respecting them. An inquiry will\nafford us amusement,” [I thought this an odd term, so applied, but said\nnothing] “and, besides, Le Bon once rendered me a service for which I\nam not ungrateful. We will go and see the premises with our own eyes.\nI know G----, the Prefect of Police, and shall have no difficulty in\nobtaining the necessary permission.”\n\nThe permission was obtained, and we proceeded at once to the Rue Morgue.\nThis is one of those miserable thoroughfares which intervene between the\nRue Richelieu and the Rue St. Roch. It was late in the afternoon when we\nreached it; as this quarter is at a great distance from that in which we\nresided. The house was readily found; for there were still many persons\ngazing up at the closed shutters, with an objectless curiosity, from\nthe opposite side of the way. It was an ordinary Parisian house, with\na gateway, on one side of which was a glazed watch-box, with a sliding\npanel in the window, indicating a _loge de concierge._ Before going in\nwe walked up the street, turned down an alley, and then, again turning,\npassed in the rear of the building--Dupin, meanwhile examining the whole\nneighborhood, as well as the house, with a minuteness of attention for\nwhich I could see no possible object.\n\nRetracing our steps, we came again to the front of the dwelling, rang,\nand, having shown our credentials, were admitted by the agents\nin charge. We went up stairs--into the chamber where the body of\nMademoiselle L’Espanaye had been found, and where both the deceased\nstill lay. The disorders of the room had, as usual, been suffered to\nexist. I saw nothing beyond what had been stated in the “Gazette des\nTribunaux.” Dupin scrutinized every thing--not excepting the bodies of\nthe victims. We then went into the other rooms, and into the yard; a\n_gendarme_ accompanying us throughout. The examination occupied us until\ndark, when we took our departure. On our way home my companion stepped\nin for a moment at the office of one of the daily papers.\n\nI have said that the whims of my friend were manifold, and that _Je les\nménageais_:--for this phrase there is no English equivalent. It was his\nhumor, now, to decline all conversation on the subject of the murder,\nuntil about noon the next day. He then asked me, suddenly, if I had\nobserved any thing _peculiar_ at the scene of the atrocity.\n\nThere was something in his manner of emphasizing the word “peculiar,”\n which caused me to shudder, without knowing why.\n\n“No, nothing _peculiar_,” I said; “nothing more, at least, than we both\nsaw stated in the paper.”\n\n“The ‘Gazette,’” he replied, “has not entered, I fear, into the unusual\nhorror of the thing. But dismiss the idle opinions of this print. It\nappears to me that this mystery is considered insoluble, for the very\nreason which should cause it to be regarded as easy of solution--I mean\nfor the _outré_ character of its features. The police are confounded by\nthe seeming absence of motive--not for the murder itself--but for\nthe atrocity of the murder. They are puzzled, too, by the seeming\nimpossibility of reconciling the voices heard in contention, with\nthe facts that no one was discovered up stairs but the assassinated\nMademoiselle L’Espanaye, and that there were no means of egress without\nthe notice of the party ascending. The wild disorder of the room; the\ncorpse thrust, with the head downward, up the chimney; the frightful\nmutilation of the body of the old lady; these considerations, with those\njust mentioned, and others which I need not mention, have sufficed\nto paralyze the powers, by putting completely at fault the boasted\n_acumen_, of the government agents. They have fallen into the gross but\ncommon error of confounding the unusual with the abstruse. But it is by\nthese deviations from the plane of the ordinary, that reason feels its\nway, if at all, in its search for the true. In investigations such as we\nare now pursuing, it should not be so much asked ‘what has occurred,’\nas ‘what has occurred that has never occurred before.’ In fact, the\nfacility with which I shall arrive, or have arrived, at the solution of\nthis mystery, is in the direct ratio of its apparent insolubility in the\neyes of the police.”\n\nI stared at the speaker in mute astonishment.\n\n“I am now awaiting,” continued he, looking toward the door of our\napartment--“I am now awaiting a person who, although perhaps not\nthe perpetrator of these butcheries, must have been in some measure\nimplicated in their perpetration. Of the worst portion of the crimes\ncommitted, it is probable that he is innocent. I hope that I am right\nin this supposition; for upon it I build my expectation of reading the\nentire riddle. I look for the man here--in this room--every moment. It\nis true that he may not arrive; but the probability is that he will.\nShould he come, it will be necessary to detain him. Here are pistols;\nand we both know how to use them when occasion demands their use.”\n\nI took the pistols, scarcely knowing what I did, or believing what\nI heard, while Dupin went on, very much as if in a soliloquy. I have\nalready spoken of his abstract manner at such times. His discourse was\naddressed to myself; but his voice, although by no means loud, had that\nintonation which is commonly employed in speaking to some one at a great\ndistance. His eyes, vacant in expression, regarded only the wall.\n\n“That the voices heard in contention,” he said, “by the party upon the\nstairs, were not the voices of the women themselves, was fully proved\nby the evidence. This relieves us of all doubt upon the question whether\nthe old lady could have first destroyed the daughter and afterward have\ncommitted suicide. I speak of this point chiefly for the sake of method;\nfor the strength of Madame L’Espanaye would have been utterly unequal\nto the task of thrusting her daughter’s corpse up the chimney as it\nwas found; and the nature of the wounds upon her own person entirely\npreclude the idea of self-destruction. Murder, then, has been committed\nby some third party; and the voices of this third party were those heard\nin contention. Let me now advert--not to the whole testimony respecting\nthese voices--but to what was _peculiar_ in that testimony. Did you\nobserve any thing peculiar about it?”\n\nI remarked that, while all the witnesses agreed in supposing the gruff\nvoice to be that of a Frenchman, there was much disagreement in regard\nto the shrill, or, as one individual termed it, the harsh voice.\n\n“That was the evidence itself,” said Dupin, “but it was not the\npeculiarity of the evidence. You have observed nothing distinctive.\nYet there _was_ something to be observed. The witnesses, as you remark,\nagreed about the gruff voice; they were here unanimous. But in regard to\nthe shrill voice, the peculiarity is--not that they disagreed--but\nthat, while an Italian, an Englishman, a Spaniard, a Hollander, and a\nFrenchman attempted to describe it, each one spoke of it as that _of\na foreigner_. Each is sure that it was not the voice of one of his own\ncountrymen. Each likens it--not to the voice of an individual of any\nnation with whose language he is conversant--but the converse.\nThe Frenchman supposes it the voice of a Spaniard, and ‘might have\ndistinguished some words _had he been acquainted with the Spanish._’ The\nDutchman maintains it to have been that of a Frenchman; but we find it\nstated that ‘_not understanding French this witness was examined through\nan interpreter._’ The Englishman thinks it the voice of a German, and\n‘_does not understand German._’ The Spaniard ‘is sure’ that it was that\nof an Englishman, but ‘judges by the intonation’ altogether, ‘_as he has\nno knowledge of the English._’ The Italian believes it the voice of a\nRussian, but ‘_has never conversed with a native of Russia._’ A second\nFrenchman differs, moreover, with the first, and is positive that the\nvoice was that of an Italian; but, _not being cognizant of that tongue_,\nis, like the Spaniard, ‘convinced by the intonation.’ Now, how strangely\nunusual must that voice have really been, about which such testimony as\nthis _could_ have been elicited!--in whose _tones_, even, denizens of\nthe five great divisions of Europe could recognise nothing familiar! You\nwill say that it might have been the voice of an Asiatic--of an African.\nNeither Asiatics nor Africans abound in Paris; but, without denying the\ninference, I will now merely call your attention to three points.\nThe voice is termed by one witness ‘harsh rather than shrill.’ It\nis represented by two others to have been ‘quick and _unequal._’ No\nwords--no sounds resembling words--were by any witness mentioned as\ndistinguishable.\n\n“I know not,” continued Dupin, “what impression I may have made, so\nfar, upon your own understanding; but I do not hesitate to say that\nlegitimate deductions even from this portion of the testimony--the\nportion respecting the gruff and shrill voices--are in themselves\nsufficient to engender a suspicion which should give direction to all\nfarther progress in the investigation of the mystery. I said ‘legitimate\ndeductions;’ but my meaning is not thus fully expressed. I designed\nto imply that the deductions are the _sole_ proper ones, and that the\nsuspicion arises _inevitably_ from them as the single result. What the\nsuspicion is, however, I will not say just yet. I merely wish you to\nbear in mind that, with myself, it was sufficiently forcible to give a\ndefinite form--a certain tendency--to my inquiries in the chamber.\n\n“Let us now transport ourselves, in fancy, to this chamber. What shall\nwe first seek here? The means of egress employed by the murderers. It is\nnot too much to say that neither of us believe in præternatural events.\nMadame and Mademoiselle L’Espanaye were not destroyed by spirits. The\ndoers of the deed were material, and escaped materially. Then how?\nFortunately, there is but one mode of reasoning upon the point, and that\nmode _must_ lead us to a definite decision.--Let us examine, each by\neach, the possible means of egress. It is clear that the assassins were\nin the room where Mademoiselle L’Espanaye was found, or at least in the\nroom adjoining, when the party ascended the stairs. It is then only from\nthese two apartments that we have to seek issues. The police have laid\nbare the floors, the ceilings, and the masonry of the walls, in every\ndirection. No _secret_ issues could have escaped their vigilance. But,\nnot trusting to _their_ eyes, I examined with my own. There were, then,\nno secret issues. Both doors leading from the rooms into the passage\nwere securely locked, with the keys inside. Let us turn to the chimneys.\nThese, although of ordinary width for some eight or ten feet above the\nhearths, will not admit, throughout their extent, the body of a large\ncat. The impossibility of egress, by means already stated, being thus\nabsolute, we are reduced to the windows. Through those of the front room\nno one could have escaped without notice from the crowd in the street.\nThe murderers _must_ have passed, then, through those of the back room.\nNow, brought to this conclusion in so unequivocal a manner as we are,\nit is not our part, as reasoners, to reject it on account of apparent\nimpossibilities. It is only left for us to prove that these apparent\n‘impossibilities’ are, in reality, not such.\n\n“There are two windows in the chamber. One of them is unobstructed by\nfurniture, and is wholly visible. The lower portion of the other is\nhidden from view by the head of the unwieldy bedstead which is thrust\nclose up against it. The former was found securely fastened from within.\nIt resisted the utmost force of those who endeavored to raise it. A\nlarge gimlet-hole had been pierced in its frame to the left, and a very\nstout nail was found fitted therein, nearly to the head. Upon examining\nthe other window, a similar nail was seen similarly fitted in it; and\na vigorous attempt to raise this sash, failed also. The police were now\nentirely satisfied that egress had not been in these directions. And,\n_therefore_, it was thought a matter of supererogation to withdraw the\nnails and open the windows.\n\n“My own examination was somewhat more particular, and was so for the\nreason I have just given--because here it was, I knew, that all apparent\nimpossibilities _must_ be proved to be not such in reality.\n\n“I proceeded to think thus--_a posteriori_. The murderers did escape\nfrom one of these windows. This being so, they could not have refastened\nthe sashes from the inside, as they were found fastened;--the\nconsideration which put a stop, through its obviousness, to the scrutiny\nof the police in this quarter. Yet the sashes _were_ fastened. They\n_must_, then, have the power of fastening themselves. There was no\nescape from this conclusion. I stepped to the unobstructed casement,\nwithdrew the nail with some difficulty and attempted to raise the sash.\nIt resisted all my efforts, as I had anticipated. A concealed spring\nmust, I now know, exist; and this corroboration of my idea convinced\nme that my premises at least, were correct, however mysterious still\nappeared the circumstances attending the nails. A careful search soon\nbrought to light the hidden spring. I pressed it, and, satisfied with\nthe discovery, forbore to upraise the sash.\n\n“I now replaced the nail and regarded it attentively. A person passing\nout through this window might have reclosed it, and the spring would\nhave caught--but the nail could not have been replaced. The conclusion\nwas plain, and again narrowed in the field of my investigations. The\nassassins _must_ have escaped through the other window. Supposing, then,\nthe springs upon each sash to be the same, as was probable, there _must_\nbe found a difference between the nails, or at least between the modes\nof their fixture. Getting upon the sacking of the bedstead, I looked\nover the head-board minutely at the second casement. Passing my hand\ndown behind the board, I readily discovered and pressed the spring,\nwhich was, as I had supposed, identical in character with its neighbor.\nI now looked at the nail. It was as stout as the other, and apparently\nfitted in the same manner--driven in nearly up to the head.\n\n“You will say that I was puzzled; but, if you think so, you must have\nmisunderstood the nature of the inductions. To use a sporting phrase,\nI had not been once ‘at fault.’ The scent had never for an instant\nbeen lost. There was no flaw in any link of the chain. I had traced the\nsecret to its ultimate result,--and that result was _the nail._ It\nhad, I say, in every respect, the appearance of its fellow in the other\nwindow; but this fact was an absolute nullity (conclusive us it might\nseem to be) when compared with the consideration that here, at this\npoint, terminated the clew. ‘There _must_ be something wrong,’ I said,\n‘about the nail.’ I touched it; and the head, with about a quarter of an\ninch of the shank, came off in my fingers. The rest of the shank was in\nthe gimlet-hole where it had been broken off. The fracture was an old\none (for its edges were incrusted with rust), and had apparently been\naccomplished by the blow of a hammer, which had partially imbedded,\nin the top of the bottom sash, the head portion of the nail. I now\ncarefully replaced this head portion in the indentation whence I had\ntaken it, and the resemblance to a perfect nail was complete--the\nfissure was invisible. Pressing the spring, I gently raised the sash\nfor a few inches; the head went up with it, remaining firm in its bed.\nI closed the window, and the semblance of the whole nail was again\nperfect.\n\n“The riddle, so far, was now unriddled. The assassin had escaped through\nthe window which looked upon the bed. Dropping of its own accord upon\nhis exit (or perhaps purposely closed), it had become fastened by the\nspring; and it was the retention of this spring which had been mistaken\nby the police for that of the nail,--farther inquiry being thus\nconsidered unnecessary.\n\n“The next question is that of the mode of descent. Upon this point I had\nbeen satisfied in my walk with you around the building. About five feet\nand a half from the casement in question there runs a lightning-rod.\nFrom this rod it would have been impossible for any one to reach the\nwindow itself, to say nothing of entering it. I observed, however, that\nthe shutters of the fourth story were of the peculiar kind called by\nParisian carpenters _ferrades_--a kind rarely employed at the present\nday, but frequently seen upon very old mansions at Lyons and Bordeaux.\nThey are in the form of an ordinary door, (a single, not a folding door)\nexcept that the lower half is latticed or worked in open trellis--thus\naffording an excellent hold for the hands. In the present instance these\nshutters are fully three feet and a half broad. When we saw them from\nthe rear of the house, they were both about half open--that is to say,\nthey stood off at right angles from the wall. It is probable that the\npolice, as well as myself, examined the back of the tenement; but, if\nso, in looking at these _ferrades_ in the line of their breadth (as they\nmust have done), they did not perceive this great breadth itself, or,\nat all events, failed to take it into due consideration. In fact, having\nonce satisfied themselves that no egress could have been made in this\nquarter, they would naturally bestow here a very cursory examination.\nIt was clear to me, however, that the shutter belonging to the window\nat the head of the bed, would, if swung fully back to the wall, reach\nto within two feet of the lightning-rod. It was also evident that, by\nexertion of a very unusual degree of activity and courage, an entrance\ninto the window, from the rod, might have been thus effected.--By\nreaching to the distance of two feet and a half (we now suppose the\nshutter open to its whole extent) a robber might have taken a firm grasp\nupon the trellis-work. Letting go, then, his hold upon the rod, placing\nhis feet securely against the wall, and springing boldly from it, he\nmight have swung the shutter so as to close it, and, if we imagine the\nwindow open at the time, might even have swung himself into the room.\n\n“I wish you to bear especially in mind that I have spoken of a _very_\nunusual degree of activity as requisite to success in so hazardous and\nso difficult a feat. It is my design to show you, first, that the thing\nmight possibly have been accomplished:--but, secondly and _chiefly_, I\nwish to impress upon your understanding the _very extraordinary_--the\nalmost præternatural character of that agility which could have\naccomplished it.\n\n“You will say, no doubt, using the language of the law, that ‘to make\nout my case,’ I should rather undervalue, than insist upon a full\nestimation of the activity required in this matter. This may be the\npractice in law, but it is not the usage of reason. My ultimate object\nis only the truth. My immediate purpose is to lead you to place in\njuxtaposition, that _very unusual_ activity of which I have just spoken\nwith that _very peculiar_ shrill (or harsh) and _unequal_ voice, about\nwhose nationality no two persons could be found to agree, and in whose\nutterance no syllabification could be detected.”\n\nAt these words a vague and half-formed conception of the meaning\nof Dupin flitted over my mind. I seemed to be upon the verge of\ncomprehension without power to comprehend--men, at times, find\nthemselves upon the brink of remembrance without being able, in the end,\nto remember. My friend went on with his discourse.\n\n“You will see,” he said, “that I have shifted the question from the mode\nof egress to that of ingress. It was my design to convey the idea that\nboth were effected in the same manner, at the same point. Let us now\nrevert to the interior of the room. Let us survey the appearances here.\nThe drawers of the bureau, it is said, had been rifled, although many\narticles of apparel still remained within them. The conclusion here is\nabsurd. It is a mere guess--a very silly one--and no more. How are\nwe to know that the articles found in the drawers were not all these\ndrawers had originally contained? Madame L’Espanaye and her daughter\nlived an exceedingly retired life--saw no company--seldom went out--had\nlittle use for numerous changes of habiliment. Those found were at least\nof as good quality as any likely to be possessed by these ladies. If a\nthief had taken any, why did he not take the best--why did he not take\nall? In a word, why did he abandon four thousand francs in gold to\nencumber himself with a bundle of linen? The gold _was _abandoned.\nNearly the whole sum mentioned by Monsieur Mignaud, the banker, was\ndiscovered, in bags, upon the floor. I wish you, therefore, to discard\nfrom your thoughts the blundering idea of _motive_, engendered in the\nbrains of the police by that portion of the evidence which speaks of\nmoney delivered at the door of the house. Coincidences ten times as\nremarkable as this (the delivery of the money, and murder committed\nwithin three days upon the party receiving it), happen to all of us\nevery hour of our lives, without attracting even momentary notice.\nCoincidences, in general, are great stumbling-blocks in the way of that\nclass of thinkers who have been educated to know nothing of the theory\nof probabilities--that theory to which the most glorious objects of\nhuman research are indebted for the most glorious of illustration. In\nthe present instance, had the gold been gone, the fact of its delivery\nthree days before would have formed something more than a coincidence.\nIt would have been corroborative of this idea of motive. But, under the\nreal circumstances of the case, if we are to suppose gold the motive\nof this outrage, we must also imagine the perpetrator so vacillating an\nidiot as to have abandoned his gold and his motive together.\n\n“Keeping now steadily in mind the points to which I have drawn your\nattention--that peculiar voice, that unusual agility, and that startling\nabsence of motive in a murder so singularly atrocious as this--let us\nglance at the butchery itself. Here is a woman strangled to death\nby manual strength, and thrust up a chimney, head downward. Ordinary\nassassins employ no such modes of murder as this. Least of all, do they\nthus dispose of the murdered. In the manner of thrusting the corpse\nup the chimney, you will admit that there was something _excessively\noutré_--something altogether irreconcilable with our common notions of\nhuman action, even when we suppose the actors the most depraved of men.\nThink, too, how great must have been that strength which could have\nthrust the body _up_ such an aperture so forcibly that the united vigor\nof several persons was found barely sufficient to drag it _down!_\n\n“Turn, now, to other indications of the employment of a vigor most\nmarvellous. On the hearth were thick tresses--very thick tresses--of\ngrey human hair. These had been torn out by the roots. You are aware of\nthe great force necessary in tearing thus from the head even twenty or\nthirty hairs together. You saw the locks in question as well as myself.\nTheir roots (a hideous sight!) were clotted with fragments of the flesh\nof the scalp--sure token of the prodigious power which had been exerted\nin uprooting perhaps half a million of hairs at a time. The throat of\nthe old lady was not merely cut, but the head absolutely severed from\nthe body: the instrument was a mere razor. I wish you also to look at\nthe _brutal_ ferocity of these deeds. Of the bruises upon the body\nof Madame L’Espanaye I do not speak. Monsieur Dumas, and his worthy\ncoadjutor Monsieur Etienne, have pronounced that they were inflicted by\nsome obtuse instrument; and so far these gentlemen are very correct. The\nobtuse instrument was clearly the stone pavement in the yard, upon which\nthe victim had fallen from the window which looked in upon the bed. This\nidea, however simple it may now seem, escaped the police for the same\nreason that the breadth of the shutters escaped them--because, by the\naffair of the nails, their perceptions had been hermetically sealed\nagainst the possibility of the windows having ever been opened at all.\n\n“If now, in addition to all these things, you have properly reflected\nupon the odd disorder of the chamber, we have gone so far as to combine\nthe ideas of an agility astounding, a strength superhuman, a ferocity\nbrutal, a butchery without motive, a _grotesquerie_ in horror absolutely\nalien from humanity, and a voice foreign in tone to the ears of men\nof many nations, and devoid of all distinct or intelligible\nsyllabification. What result, then, has ensued? What impression have I\nmade upon your fancy?”\n\nI felt a creeping of the flesh as Dupin asked me the question. “A\nmadman,” I said, “has done this deed--some raving maniac, escaped from a\nneighboring _Maison de Santé._”\n\n“In some respects,” he replied, “your idea is not irrelevant. But the\nvoices of madmen, even in their wildest paroxysms, are never found to\ntally with that peculiar voice heard upon the stairs. Madmen are of some\nnation, and their language, however incoherent in its words, has always\nthe coherence of syllabification. Besides, the hair of a madman is not\nsuch as I now hold in my hand. I disentangled this little tuft from the\nrigidly clutched fingers of Madame L’Espanaye. Tell me what you can make\nof it.”\n\n“Dupin!” I said, completely unnerved; “this hair is most unusual--this\nis no _human_ hair.”\n\n“I have not asserted that it is,” said he; “but, before we decide this\npoint, I wish you to glance at the little sketch I have here traced upon\nthis paper. It is a _fac-simile_ drawing of what has been described in\none portion of the testimony as ‘dark bruises, and deep indentations\nof finger nails,’ upon the throat of Mademoiselle L’Espanaye, and in\nanother, (by Messrs. Dumas and Etienne,) as a ‘series of livid spots,\nevidently the impression of fingers.’\n\n“You will perceive,” continued my friend, spreading out the paper upon\nthe table before us, “that this drawing gives the idea of a firm\nand fixed hold. There is no _slipping_ apparent. Each finger has\nretained--possibly until the death of the victim--the fearful grasp by\nwhich it originally imbedded itself. Attempt, now, to place all your\nfingers, at the same time, in the respective impressions as you see\nthem.”\n\nI made the attempt in vain.\n\n“We are possibly not giving this matter a fair trial,” he said. “The\npaper is spread out upon a plane surface; but the human throat is\ncylindrical. Here is a billet of wood, the circumference of which\nis about that of the throat. Wrap the drawing around it, and try the\nexperiment again.”\n\nI did so; but the difficulty was even more obvious than before. “This,”\n I said, “is the mark of no human hand.”\n\n“Read now,” replied Dupin, “this passage from Cuvier.”\n\nIt was a minute anatomical and generally descriptive account of the\nlarge fulvous Ourang-Outang of the East Indian Islands. The gigantic\nstature, the prodigious strength and activity, the wild ferocity, and\nthe imitative propensities of these mammalia are sufficiently well known\nto all. I understood the full horrors of the murder at once.\n\n“The description of the digits,” said I, as I made an end of reading,\n“is in exact accordance with this drawing. I see that no animal but an\nOurang-Outang, of the species here mentioned, could have impressed the\nindentations as you have traced them. This tuft of tawny hair, too, is\nidentical in character with that of the beast of Cuvier. But I cannot\npossibly comprehend the particulars of this frightful mystery. Besides,\nthere were _two_ voices heard in contention, and one of them was\nunquestionably the voice of a Frenchman.”\n\n“True; and you will remember an expression attributed almost\nunanimously, by the evidence, to this voice,--the expression, ‘_mon\nDieu!_’ This, under the circumstances, has been justly characterized by\none of the witnesses (Montani, the confectioner,) as an expression of\nremonstrance or expostulation. Upon these two words, therefore, I have\nmainly built my hopes of a full solution of the riddle. A Frenchman\nwas cognizant of the murder. It is possible--indeed it is far more\nthan probable--that he was innocent of all participation in the bloody\ntransactions which took place. The Ourang-Outang may have escaped from\nhim. He may have traced it to the chamber; but, under the agitating\ncircumstances which ensued, he could never have re-captured it. It is\nstill at large. I will not pursue these guesses--for I have no right to\ncall them more--since the shades of reflection upon which they are based\nare scarcely of sufficient depth to be appreciable by my own intellect,\nand since I could not pretend to make them intelligible to the\nunderstanding of another. We will call them guesses then, and speak\nof them as such. If the Frenchman in question is indeed, as I suppose,\ninnocent of this atrocity, this advertisement which I left last night,\nupon our return home, at the office of ‘Le Monde,’ (a paper devoted to\nthe shipping interest, and much sought by sailors,) will bring him to\nour residence.”\n\nHe handed me a paper, and I read thus:\n\nCAUGHT--_In the Bois de Boulogne, early in the morning of the--inst.,_\n(the morning of the murder,) _a very large, tawny Ourang-Outang of\nthe Bornese species. The owner, (who is ascertained to be a sailor,\nbelonging to a Maltese vessel,) may have the animal again, upon\nidentifying it satisfactorily, and paying a few charges arising from\nits capture and keeping. Call at No. ----, Rue ----, Faubourg St.\nGermain--au troisiême._\n\n“How was it possible,” I asked, “that you should know the man to be a\nsailor, and belonging to a Maltese vessel?”\n\n“I do _not_ know it,” said Dupin. “I am not _sure_ of it. Here, however,\nis a small piece of ribbon, which from its form, and from its greasy\nappearance, has evidently been used in tying the hair in one of those\nlong _queues_ of which sailors are so fond. Moreover, this knot is one\nwhich few besides sailors can tie, and is peculiar to the Maltese. I\npicked the ribbon up at the foot of the lightning-rod. It could not have\nbelonged to either of the deceased. Now if, after all, I am wrong in my\ninduction from this ribbon, that the Frenchman was a sailor belonging to\na Maltese vessel, still I can have done no harm in saying what I did in\nthe advertisement. If I am in error, he will merely suppose that I have\nbeen misled by some circumstance into which he will not take the trouble\nto inquire. But if I am right, a great point is gained. Cognizant\nalthough innocent of the murder, the Frenchman will naturally hesitate\nabout replying to the advertisement--about demanding the Ourang-Outang.\nHe will reason thus:--‘I am innocent; I am poor; my Ourang-Outang is of\ngreat value--to one in my circumstances a fortune of itself--why should\nI lose it through idle apprehensions of danger? Here it is, within my\ngrasp. It was found in the Bois de Boulogne--at a vast distance from the\nscene of that butchery. How can it ever be suspected that a brute beast\nshould have done the deed? The police are at fault--they have failed to\nprocure the slightest clew. Should they even trace the animal, it would\nbe impossible to prove me cognizant of the murder, or to implicate me\nin guilt on account of that cognizance. Above all, _I am known._ The\nadvertiser designates me as the possessor of the beast. I am not sure to\nwhat limit his knowledge may extend. Should I avoid claiming a property\nof so great value, which it is known that I possess, I will render the\nanimal at least, liable to suspicion. It is not my policy to attract\nattention either to myself or to the beast. I will answer the\nadvertisement, get the Ourang-Outang, and keep it close until this\nmatter has blown over.’”\n\nAt this moment we heard a step upon the stairs.\n\n“Be ready,” said Dupin, “with your pistols, but neither use them nor\nshow them until at a signal from myself.”\n\nThe front door of the house had been left open, and the visiter had\nentered, without ringing, and advanced several steps upon the staircase.\nNow, however, he seemed to hesitate. Presently we heard him descending.\nDupin was moving quickly to the door, when we again heard him coming up.\nHe did not turn back a second time, but stepped up with decision, and\nrapped at the door of our chamber.\n\n“Come in,” said Dupin, in a cheerful and hearty tone.\n\nA man entered. He was a sailor, evidently,--a tall, stout, and\nmuscular-looking person, with a certain dare-devil expression of\ncountenance, not altogether unprepossessing. His face, greatly sunburnt,\nwas more than half hidden by whisker and _mustachio._ He had with him\na huge oaken cudgel, but appeared to be otherwise unarmed. He bowed\nawkwardly, and bade us “good evening,” in French accents, which,\nalthough somewhat Neufchatelish, were still sufficiently indicative of a\nParisian origin.\n\n“Sit down, my friend,” said Dupin. “I suppose you have called about the\nOurang-Outang. Upon my word, I almost envy you the possession of him;\na remarkably fine, and no doubt a very valuable animal. How old do you\nsuppose him to be?”\n\nThe sailor drew a long breath, with the air of a man relieved of some\nintolerable burden, and then replied, in an assured tone:\n\n“I have no way of telling--but he can’t be more than four or five years\nold. Have you got him here?”\n\n“Oh no, we had no conveniences for keeping him here. He is at a livery\nstable in the Rue Dubourg, just by. You can get him in the morning. Of\ncourse you are prepared to identify the property?”\n\n“To be sure I am, sir.”\n\n“I shall be sorry to part with him,” said Dupin.\n\n“I don’t mean that you should be at all this trouble for nothing, sir,”\n said the man. “Couldn’t expect it. Am very willing to pay a reward for\nthe finding of the animal--that is to say, any thing in reason.”\n\n“Well,” replied my friend, “that is all very fair, to be sure. Let me\nthink!--what should I have? Oh! I will tell you. My reward shall be\nthis. You shall give me all the information in your power about these\nmurders in the Rue Morgue.”\n\nDupin said the last words in a very low tone, and very quietly. Just as\nquietly, too, he walked toward the door, locked it and put the key in\nhis pocket. He then drew a pistol from his bosom and placed it, without\nthe least flurry, upon the table.\n\nThe sailor’s face flushed up as if he were struggling with suffocation.\nHe started to his feet and grasped his cudgel, but the next moment he\nfell back into his seat, trembling violently, and with the countenance\nof death itself. He spoke not a word. I pitied him from the bottom of my\nheart.\n\n“My friend,” said Dupin, in a kind tone, “you are alarming yourself\nunnecessarily--you are indeed. We mean you no harm whatever. I pledge\nyou the honor of a gentleman, and of a Frenchman, that we intend you no\ninjury. I perfectly well know that you are innocent of the atrocities\nin the Rue Morgue. It will not do, however, to deny that you are in some\nmeasure implicated in them. From what I have already said, you must know\nthat I have had means of information about this matter--means of which\nyou could never have dreamed. Now the thing stands thus. You have done\nnothing which you could have avoided--nothing, certainly, which renders\nyou culpable. You were not even guilty of robbery, when you might have\nrobbed with impunity. You have nothing to conceal. You have no reason\nfor concealment. On the other hand, you are bound by every principle\nof honor to confess all you know. An innocent man is now imprisoned,\ncharged with that crime of which you can point out the perpetrator.”\n\nThe sailor had recovered his presence of mind, in a great measure, while\nDupin uttered these words; but his original boldness of bearing was all\ngone.\n\n“So help me God,” said he, after a brief pause, “I will tell you all I\nknow about this affair;--but I do not expect you to believe one half I\nsay--I would be a fool indeed if I did. Still, I am innocent, and I will\nmake a clean breast if I die for it.”\n\nWhat he stated was, in substance, this. He had lately made a voyage\nto the Indian Archipelago. A party, of which he formed one, landed\nat Borneo, and passed into the interior on an excursion of pleasure.\nHimself and a companion had captured the Ourang-Outang. This companion\ndying, the animal fell into his own exclusive possession. After great\ntrouble, occasioned by the intractable ferocity of his captive during\nthe home voyage, he at length succeeded in lodging it safely at his own\nresidence in Paris, where, not to attract toward himself the unpleasant\ncuriosity of his neighbors, he kept it carefully secluded, until such\ntime as it should recover from a wound in the foot, received from a\nsplinter on board ship. His ultimate design was to sell it.\n\nReturning home from some sailors’ frolic the night, or rather in the\nmorning of the murder, he found the beast occupying his own bed-room,\ninto which it had broken from a closet adjoining, where it had been, as\nwas thought, securely confined. Razor in hand, and fully lathered, it\nwas sitting before a looking-glass, attempting the operation of shaving,\nin which it had no doubt previously watched its master through the\nkey-hole of the closet. Terrified at the sight of so dangerous a weapon\nin the possession of an animal so ferocious, and so well able to use\nit, the man, for some moments, was at a loss what to do. He had been\naccustomed, however, to quiet the creature, even in its fiercest moods,\nby the use of a whip, and to this he now resorted. Upon sight of it, the\nOurang-Outang sprang at once through the door of the chamber, down\nthe stairs, and thence, through a window, unfortunately open, into the\nstreet.\n\nThe Frenchman followed in despair; the ape, razor still in hand,\noccasionally stopping to look back and gesticulate at its pursuer, until\nthe latter had nearly come up with it. It then again made off. In this\nmanner the chase continued for a long time. The streets were profoundly\nquiet, as it was nearly three o’clock in the morning. In passing down\nan alley in the rear of the Rue Morgue, the fugitive’s attention was\narrested by a light gleaming from the open window of Madame L’Espanaye’s\nchamber, in the fourth story of her house. Rushing to the building, it\nperceived the lightning rod, clambered up with inconceivable agility,\ngrasped the shutter, which was thrown fully back against the wall, and,\nby its means, swung itself directly upon the headboard of the bed. The\nwhole feat did not occupy a minute. The shutter was kicked open again by\nthe Ourang-Outang as it entered the room.\n\nThe sailor, in the meantime, was both rejoiced and perplexed. He had\nstrong hopes of now recapturing the brute, as it could scarcely escape\nfrom the trap into which it had ventured, except by the rod, where it\nmight be intercepted as it came down. On the other hand, there was\nmuch cause for anxiety as to what it might do in the house. This latter\nreflection urged the man still to follow the fugitive. A lightning rod\nis ascended without difficulty, especially by a sailor; but, when he had\narrived as high as the window, which lay far to his left, his career was\nstopped; the most that he could accomplish was to reach over so as to\nobtain a glimpse of the interior of the room. At this glimpse he nearly\nfell from his hold through excess of horror. Now it was that those\nhideous shrieks arose upon the night, which had startled from slumber\nthe inmates of the Rue Morgue. Madame L’Espanaye and her daughter,\nhabited in their night clothes, had apparently been occupied in\narranging some papers in the iron chest already mentioned, which had\nbeen wheeled into the middle of the room. It was open, and its contents\nlay beside it on the floor. The victims must have been sitting with\ntheir backs toward the window; and, from the time elapsing between the\ningress of the beast and the screams, it seems probable that it was not\nimmediately perceived. The flapping-to of the shutter would naturally\nhave been attributed to the wind.\n\nAs the sailor looked in, the gigantic animal had seized Madame\nL’Espanaye by the hair, (which was loose, as she had been combing\nit,) and was flourishing the razor about her face, in imitation of the\nmotions of a barber. The daughter lay prostrate and motionless; she had\nswooned. The screams and struggles of the old lady (during which the\nhair was torn from her head) had the effect of changing the probably\npacific purposes of the Ourang-Outang into those of wrath. With one\ndetermined sweep of its muscular arm it nearly severed her head from her\nbody. The sight of blood inflamed its anger into phrenzy. Gnashing its\nteeth, and flashing fire from its eyes, it flew upon the body of the\ngirl, and imbedded its fearful talons in her throat, retaining its grasp\nuntil she expired. Its wandering and wild glances fell at this moment\nupon the head of the bed, over which the face of its master, rigid with\nhorror, was just discernible. The fury of the beast, who no doubt bore\nstill in mind the dreaded whip, was instantly converted into fear.\nConscious of having deserved punishment, it seemed desirous of\nconcealing its bloody deeds, and skipped about the chamber in an agony\nof nervous agitation; throwing down and breaking the furniture as it\nmoved, and dragging the bed from the bedstead. In conclusion, it seized\nfirst the corpse of the daughter, and thrust it up the chimney, as\nit was found; then that of the old lady, which it immediately hurled\nthrough the window headlong.\n\nAs the ape approached the casement with its mutilated burden, the sailor\nshrank aghast to the rod, and, rather gliding than clambering down it,\nhurried at once home--dreading the consequences of the butchery, and\ngladly abandoning, in his terror, all solicitude about the fate of the\nOurang-Outang. The words heard by the party upon the staircase were the\nFrenchman’s exclamations of horror and affright, commingled with the\nfiendish jabberings of the brute.\n\nI have scarcely anything to add. The Ourang-Outang must have escaped\nfrom the chamber, by the rod, just before the break of the door. It\nmust have closed the window as it passed through it. It was subsequently\ncaught by the owner himself, who obtained for it a very large sum at the\n_Jardin des Plantes._ Le Don was instantly released, upon our narration\nof the circumstances (with some comments from Dupin) at the bureau of\nthe Prefect of Police. This functionary, however well disposed to my\nfriend, could not altogether conceal his chagrin at the turn which\naffairs had taken, and was fain to indulge in a sarcasm or two, about\nthe propriety of every person minding his own business.\n\n“Let him talk,” said Dupin, who had not thought it necessary to reply.\n“Let him discourse; it will ease his conscience, I am satisfied with\nhaving defeated him in his own castle. Nevertheless, that he failed\nin the solution of this mystery, is by no means that matter for wonder\nwhich he supposes it; for, in truth, our friend the Prefect is somewhat\ntoo cunning to be profound. In his wisdom is no _stamen._ It is all head\nand no body, like the pictures of the Goddess Laverna,--or, at best, all\nhead and shoulders, like a codfish. But he is a good creature after all.\nI like him especially for one master stroke of cant, by which he has\nattained his reputation for ingenuity. I mean the way he has ‘_de nier\nce qui est, et d’expliquer ce qui n’est pas._’” (*)\n\n(*) Rousseau--Nouvelle Heloise.\n\n\n\n\nTHE MYSTERY OF MARIE ROGET.(*1)\n\nA SEQUEL TO “THE MURDERS IN THE RUE MORGUE.”\n\n\n  Es giebt eine Reihe idealischer Begebenheiten, die der Wirklichkeit\n  parallel lauft. Selten fallen sie zusammen. Menschen und zufalle\n  modifieiren gewohulich die idealische Begebenheit, so dass sie\n  unvollkommen erscheint, und ihre Folgen gleichfalls unvollkommen\n  sind. So bei der Reformation; statt des Protestantismus kam das\n  Lutherthum hervor.\n\n  There are ideal series of events which run parallel with the real\n  ones. They rarely coincide. Men and circumstances generally modify\n  the ideal train of events, so that it seems imperfect, and its\n  consequences are equally imperfect. Thus with the Reformation;\n  instead of Protestantism came Lutheranism.\n\n              --Novalis. (*2) Moral Ansichten.\n\nTHERE are few persons, even among the calmest thinkers, who have not\noccasionally been startled into a vague yet thrilling half-credence in\nthe supernatural, by coincidences of so seemingly marvellous a character\nthat, as mere coincidences, the intellect has been unable to receive\nthem. Such sentiments--for the half-credences of which I speak have\nnever the full force of thought--such sentiments are seldom thoroughly\nstifled unless by reference to the doctrine of chance, or, as it is\ntechnically termed, the Calculus of Probabilities. Now this Calculus is,\nin its essence, purely mathematical; and thus we have the anomaly of the\nmost rigidly exact in science applied to the shadow and spirituality of\nthe most intangible in speculation.\n\nThe extraordinary details which I am now called upon to make public,\nwill be found to form, as regards sequence of time, the primary branch\nof a series of scarcely intelligible coincidences, whose secondary or\nconcluding branch will be recognized by all readers in the late murder\nof Mary Cecila Rogers, at New York.\n\nWhen, in an article entitled “The Murders in the Rue Morgue,” I\nendeavored, about a year ago, to depict some very remarkable features\nin the mental character of my friend, the Chevalier C. Auguste Dupin,\nit did not occur to me that I should ever resume the subject. This\ndepicting of character constituted my design; and this design was\nthoroughly fulfilled in the wild train of circumstances brought to\ninstance Dupin’s idiosyncrasy. I might have adduced other examples, but\nI should have proven no more. Late events, however, in their surprising\ndevelopment, have startled me into some farther details, which will\ncarry with them the air of extorted confession. Hearing what I have\nlately heard, it would be indeed strange should I remain silent in\nregard to what I both heard and saw so long ago.\n\nUpon the winding up of the tragedy involved in the deaths of Madame\nL’Espanaye and her daughter, the Chevalier dismissed the affair at once\nfrom his attention, and relapsed into his old habits of moody reverie.\nProne, at all times, to abstraction, I readily fell in with his humor;\nand, continuing to occupy our chambers in the Faubourg Saint Germain, we\ngave the Future to the winds, and slumbered tranquilly in the Present,\nweaving the dull world around us into dreams.\n\nBut these dreams were not altogether uninterrupted. It may readily be\nsupposed that the part played by my friend, in the drama at the Rue\nMorgue, had not failed of its impression upon the fancies of the\nParisian police. With its emissaries, the name of Dupin had grown into a\nhousehold word. The simple character of those inductions by which he\nhad disentangled the mystery never having been explained even to the\nPrefect, or to any other individual than myself, of course it is not\nsurprising that the affair was regarded as little less than miraculous,\nor that the Chevalier’s analytical abilities acquired for him the\ncredit of intuition. His frankness would have led him to disabuse every\ninquirer of such prejudice; but his indolent humor forbade all farther\nagitation of a topic whose interest to himself had long ceased. It thus\nhappened that he found himself the cynosure of the political eyes; and\nthe cases were not few in which attempt was made to engage his services\nat the Prefecture. One of the most remarkable instances was that of the\nmurder of a young girl named Marie Rogêt.\n\nThis event occurred about two years after the atrocity in the Rue\nMorgue. Marie, whose Christian and family name will at once arrest\nattention from their resemblance to those of the unfortunate\n“cigargirl,” was the only daughter of the widow Estelle Rogêt. The\nfather had died during the child’s infancy, and from the period of his\ndeath, until within eighteen months before the assassination which forms\nthe subject of our narrative, the mother and daughter had dwelt together\nin the Rue Pavée Saint Andrée; (*3) Madame there keeping a pension,\nassisted by Marie. Affairs went on thus until the latter had attained\nher twenty-second year, when her great beauty attracted the notice of a\nperfumer, who occupied one of the shops in the basement of the Palais\nRoyal, and whose custom lay chiefly among the desperate adventurers\ninfesting that neighborhood. Monsieur Le Blanc (*4) was not unaware of\nthe advantages to be derived from the attendance of the fair Marie in\nhis perfumery; and his liberal proposals were accepted eagerly by the\ngirl, although with somewhat more of hesitation by Madame.\n\nThe anticipations of the shopkeeper were realized, and his rooms soon\nbecame notorious through the charms of the sprightly grisette. She had\nbeen in his employ about a year, when her admirers were thrown info\nconfusion by her sudden disappearance from the shop. Monsieur Le Blanc\nwas unable to account for her absence, and Madame Rogêt was distracted\nwith anxiety and terror. The public papers immediately took up\nthe theme, and the police were upon the point of making serious\ninvestigations, when, one fine morning, after the lapse of a week,\nMarie, in good health, but with a somewhat saddened air, made her\nre-appearance at her usual counter in the perfumery. All inquiry, except\nthat of a private character, was of course immediately hushed. Monsieur\nLe Blanc professed total ignorance, as before. Marie, with Madame,\nreplied to all questions, that the last week had been spent at the\nhouse of a relation in the country. Thus the affair died away, and was\ngenerally forgotten; for the girl, ostensibly to relieve herself from\nthe impertinence of curiosity, soon bade a final adieu to the perfumer,\nand sought the shelter of her mother’s residence in the Rue Pavée Saint\nAndrée.\n\nIt was about five months after this return home, that her friends were\nalarmed by her sudden disappearance for the second time. Three days\nelapsed, and nothing was heard of her. On the fourth her corpse was\nfound floating in the Seine, * near the shore which is opposite the\nQuartier of the Rue Saint Andree, and at a point not very far distant\nfrom the secluded neighborhood of the Barrière du Roule. (*6)\n\nThe atrocity of this murder, (for it was at once evident that murder had\nbeen committed,) the youth and beauty of the victim, and, above all, her\nprevious notoriety, conspired to produce intense excitement in the minds\nof the sensitive Parisians. I can call to mind no similar occurrence\nproducing so general and so intense an effect. For several weeks, in\nthe discussion of this one absorbing theme, even the momentous political\ntopics of the day were forgotten. The Prefect made unusual exertions;\nand the powers of the whole Parisian police were, of course, tasked to\nthe utmost extent.\n\nUpon the first discovery of the corpse, it was not supposed that the\nmurderer would be able to elude, for more than a very brief period,\nthe inquisition which was immediately set on foot. It was not until the\nexpiration of a week that it was deemed necessary to offer a reward; and\neven then this reward was limited to a thousand francs. In the mean time\nthe investigation proceeded with vigor, if not always with judgment, and\nnumerous individuals were examined to no purpose; while, owing to the\ncontinual absence of all clue to the mystery, the popular excitement\ngreatly increased. At the end of the tenth day it was thought advisable\nto double the sum originally proposed; and, at length, the second week\nhaving elapsed without leading to any discoveries, and the prejudice\nwhich always exists in Paris against the Police having given vent to\nitself in several serious émeutes, the Prefect took it upon himself\nto offer the sum of twenty thousand francs “for the conviction of the\nassassin,” or, if more than one should prove to have been implicated,\n“for the conviction of any one of the assassins.” In the proclamation\nsetting forth this reward, a full pardon was promised to any accomplice\nwho should come forward in evidence against his fellow; and to the whole\nwas appended, wherever it appeared, the private placard of a committee\nof citizens, offering ten thousand francs, in addition to the amount\nproposed by the Prefecture. The entire reward thus stood at no less than\nthirty thousand francs, which will be regarded as an extraordinary\nsum when we consider the humble condition of the girl, and the great\nfrequency, in large cities, of such atrocities as the one described.\n\nNo one doubted now that the mystery of this murder would be immediately\nbrought to light. But although, in one or two instances, arrests were\nmade which promised elucidation, yet nothing was elicited which could\nimplicate the parties suspected; and they were discharged forthwith.\nStrange as it may appear, the third week from the discovery of the body\nhad passed, and passed without any light being thrown upon the subject,\nbefore even a rumor of the events which had so agitated the public\nmind, reached the ears of Dupin and myself. Engaged in researches which\nabsorbed our whole attention, it had been nearly a month since either of\nus had gone abroad, or received a visiter, or more than glanced at\nthe leading political articles in one of the daily papers. The first\nintelligence of the murder was brought us by G ----, in person. He\ncalled upon us early in the afternoon of the thirteenth of July, 18--,\nand remained with us until late in the night. He had been piqued by\nthe failure of all his endeavors to ferret out the assassins. His\nreputation--so he said with a peculiarly Parisian air--was at stake.\nEven his honor was concerned. The eyes of the public were upon him; and\nthere was really no sacrifice which he would not be willing to make for\nthe development of the mystery. He concluded a somewhat droll speech\nwith a compliment upon what he was pleased to term the tact of Dupin,\nand made him a direct, and certainly a liberal proposition, the precise\nnature of which I do not feel myself at liberty to disclose, but which\nhas no bearing upon the proper subject of my narrative.\n\nThe compliment my friend rebutted as best he could, but the proposition\nhe accepted at once, although its advantages were altogether\nprovisional. This point being settled, the Prefect broke forth at\nonce into explanations of his own views, interspersing them with\nlong comments upon the evidence; of which latter we were not yet in\npossession. He discoursed much, and beyond doubt, learnedly; while\nI hazarded an occasional suggestion as the night wore drowsily away.\nDupin, sitting steadily in his accustomed arm-chair, was the embodiment\nof respectful attention. He wore spectacles, during the whole interview;\nand an occasional signal glance beneath their green glasses, sufficed\nto convince me that he slept not the less soundly, because silently,\nthroughout the seven or eight leaden-footed hours which immediately\npreceded the departure of the Prefect.\n\nIn the morning, I procured, at the Prefecture, a full report of all\nthe evidence elicited, and, at the various newspaper offices, a copy\nof every paper in which, from first to last, had been published any\ndecisive information in regard to this sad affair. Freed from all that\nwas positively disproved, this mass of information stood thus:\n\nMarie Rogêt left the residence of her mother, in the Rue Pavée\nSt. Andrée, about nine o’clock in the morning of Sunday June the\ntwenty-second, 18--. In going out, she gave notice to a Monsieur Jacques\nSt. Eustache, (*7) and to him only, of her intent intention to spend the\nday with an aunt who resided in the Rue des Drômes. The Rue des Drômes\nis a short and narrow but populous thoroughfare, not far from the banks\nof the river, and at a distance of some two miles, in the most direct\ncourse possible, from the pension of Madame Rogêt. St. Eustache was the\naccepted suitor of Marie, and lodged, as well as took his meals, at\nthe pension. He was to have gone for his betrothed at dusk, and to\nhave escorted her home. In the afternoon, however, it came on to rain\nheavily; and, supposing that she would remain all night at her aunt’s,\n(as she had done under similar circumstances before,) he did not think\nit necessary to keep his promise. As night drew on, Madame Rogêt (who\nwas an infirm old lady, seventy years of age,) was heard to express\na fear “that she should never see Marie again;” but this observation\nattracted little attention at the time.\n\nOn Monday, it was ascertained that the girl had not been to the Rue des\nDrômes; and when the day elapsed without tidings of her, a tardy search\nwas instituted at several points in the city, and its environs. It was\nnot, however until the fourth day from the period of disappearance that\nany thing satisfactory was ascertained respecting her. On this day,\n(Wednesday, the twenty-fifth of June,) a Monsieur Beauvais, (*8) who,\nwith a friend, had been making inquiries for Marie near the Barrière\ndu Roule, on the shore of the Seine which is opposite the Rue Pavée St.\nAndrée, was informed that a corpse had just been towed ashore by some\nfishermen, who had found it floating in the river. Upon seeing the\nbody, Beauvais, after some hesitation, identified it as that of the\nperfumery-girl. His friend recognized it more promptly.\n\nThe face was suffused with dark blood, some of which issued from the\nmouth. No foam was seen, as in the case of the merely drowned. There was\nno discoloration in the cellular tissue. About the throat were bruises\nand impressions of fingers. The arms were bent over on the chest and\nwere rigid. The right hand was clenched; the left partially open. On\nthe left wrist were two circular excoriations, apparently the effect\nof ropes, or of a rope in more than one volution. A part of the right\nwrist, also, was much chafed, as well as the back throughout its extent,\nbut more especially at the shoulder-blades. In bringing the body to\nthe shore the fishermen had attached to it a rope; but none of the\nexcoriations had been effected by this. The flesh of the neck was much\nswollen. There were no cuts apparent, or bruises which appeared the\neffect of blows. A piece of lace was found tied so tightly around the\nneck as to be hidden from sight; it was completely buried in the flesh,\nand was fasted by a knot which lay just under the left ear. This alone\nwould have sufficed to produce death. The medical testimony spoke\nconfidently of the virtuous character of the deceased. She had been\nsubjected, it said, to brutal violence. The corpse was in such condition\nwhen found, that there could have been no difficulty in its recognition\nby friends.\n\nThe dress was much torn and otherwise disordered. In the outer garment,\na slip, about a foot wide, had been torn upward from the bottom hem to\nthe waist, but not torn off. It was wound three times around the waist,\nand secured by a sort of hitch in the back. The dress immediately\nbeneath the frock was of fine muslin; and from this a slip eighteen\ninches wide had been torn entirely out--torn very evenly and with great\ncare. It was found around her neck, fitting loosely, and secured with a\nhard knot. Over this muslin slip and the slip of lace, the strings of a\nbonnet were attached; the bonnet being appended. The knot by which the\nstrings of the bonnet were fastened, was not a lady’s, but a slip or\nsailor’s knot.\n\nAfter the recognition of the corpse, it was not, as usual, taken to the\nMorgue, (this formality being superfluous,) but hastily interred not far\nfrom the spot at which it was brought ashore. Through the exertions of\nBeauvais, the matter was industriously hushed up, as far as possible;\nand several days had elapsed before any public emotion resulted. A\nweekly paper, (*9) however, at length took up the theme; the corpse was\ndisinterred, and a re-examination instituted; but nothing was elicited\nbeyond what has been already noted. The clothes, however, were\nnow submitted to the mother and friends of the deceased, and fully\nidentified as those worn by the girl upon leaving home.\n\nMeantime, the excitement increased hourly. Several individuals were\narrested and discharged. St. Eustache fell especially under suspicion;\nand he failed, at first, to give an intelligible account of his\nwhereabouts during the Sunday on which Marie left home. Subsequently,\nhowever, he submitted to Monsieur G----, affidavits, accounting\nsatisfactorily for every hour of the day in question. As time passed and\nno discovery ensued, a thousand contradictory rumors were circulated,\nand journalists busied themselves in suggestions. Among these, the one\nwhich attracted the most notice, was the idea that Marie Rogêt still\nlived--that the corpse found in the Seine was that of some other\nunfortunate. It will be proper that I submit to the reader some passages\nwhich embody the suggestion alluded to. These passages are literal\ntranslations from L’Etoile, (*10) a paper conducted, in general, with\nmuch ability.\n\n“Mademoiselle Rogêt left her mother’s house on Sunday morning, June the\ntwenty-second, 18--, with the ostensible purpose of going to see her\naunt, or some other connexion, in the Rue des Drômes. From that hour,\nnobody is proved to have seen her. There is no trace or tidings of her\nat all.... There has no person, whatever, come forward, so far, who\nsaw her at all, on that day, after she left her mother’s door.... Now,\nthough we have no evidence that Marie Rogêt was in the land of the\nliving after nine o’clock on Sunday, June the twenty-second, we have\nproof that, up to that hour, she was alive. On Wednesday noon, at\ntwelve, a female body was discovered afloat on the shore of the Barrière\nde Roule. This was, even if we presume that Marie Rogêt was thrown into\nthe river within three hours after she left her mother’s house, only\nthree days from the time she left her home--three days to an hour. But\nit is folly to suppose that the murder, if murder was committed on\nher body, could have been consummated soon enough to have enabled her\nmurderers to throw the body into the river before midnight. Those who\nare guilty of such horrid crimes, choose darkness rather the light....\nThus we see that if the body found in the river was that of Marie Rogêt,\nit could only have been in the water two and a half days, or three at\nthe outside. All experience has shown that drowned bodies, or bodies\nthrown into the water immediately after death by violence, require from\nsix to ten days for decomposition to take place to bring them to the top\nof the water. Even where a cannon is fired over a corpse, and it rises\nbefore at least five or six days’ immersion, it sinks again, if let\nalone. Now, we ask, what was there in this case to cause a departure\nfrom the ordinary course of nature?... If the body had been kept in its\nmangled state on shore until Tuesday night, some trace would be found on\nshore of the murderers. It is a doubtful point, also, whether the body\nwould be so soon afloat, even were it thrown in after having been\ndead two days. And, furthermore, it is exceedingly improbable that any\nvillains who had committed such a murder as is here supposed, would\nhave thrown the body in without weight to sink it, when such a precaution\ncould have so easily been taken.”\n\nThe editor here proceeds to argue that the body must have been in the\nwater “not three days merely, but, at least, five times three days,”\n because it was so far decomposed that Beauvais had great difficulty\nin recognizing it. This latter point, however, was fully disproved. I\ncontinue the translation:\n\n“What, then, are the facts on which M. Beauvais says that he has no\ndoubt the body was that of Marie Rogêt? He ripped up the gown sleeve,\nand says he found marks which satisfied him of the identity. The public\ngenerally supposed those marks to have consisted of some description\nof scars. He rubbed the arm and found hair upon it--something as\nindefinite, we think, as can readily be imagined--as little conclusive\nas finding an arm in the sleeve. M. Beauvais did not return that night,\nbut sent word to Madame Rogêt, at seven o’clock, on Wednesday evening,\nthat an investigation was still in progress respecting her daughter. If\nwe allow that Madame Rogêt, from her age and grief, could not go over,\n(which is allowing a great deal,) there certainly must have been some\none who would have thought it worth while to go over and attend the\ninvestigation, if they thought the body was that of Marie. Nobody went\nover. There was nothing said or heard about the matter in the Rue Pavée\nSt. Andrée, that reached even the occupants of the same building. M. St.\nEustache, the lover and intended husband of Marie, who boarded in her\nmother’s house, deposes that he did not hear of the discovery of the\nbody of his intended until the next morning, when M. Beauvais came\ninto his chamber and told him of it. For an item of news like this, it\nstrikes us it was very coolly received.”\n\nIn this way the journal endeavored to create the impression of an apathy\non the part of the relatives of Marie, inconsistent with the supposition\nthat these relatives believed the corpse to be hers. Its insinuations\namount to this:--that Marie, with the connivance of her friends, had\nabsented herself from the city for reasons involving a charge against\nher chastity; and that these friends, upon the discovery of a corpse in\nthe Seine, somewhat resembling that of the girl, had availed themselves\nof the opportunity to impress the public with the belief of her\ndeath. But L’Etoile was again over-hasty. It was distinctly proved\nthat no apathy, such as was imagined, existed; that the old lady was\nexceedingly feeble, and so agitated as to be unable to attend to any\nduty, that St. Eustache, so far from receiving the news coolly, was\ndistracted with grief, and bore himself so frantically, that M. Beauvais\nprevailed upon a friend and relative to take charge of him, and prevent\nhis attending the examination at the disinterment. Moreover, although\nit was stated by L’Etoile, that the corpse was re-interred at the public\nexpense--that an advantageous offer of private sculpture was absolutely\ndeclined by the family--and that no member of the family attended the\nceremonial:--although, I say, all this was asserted by L’Etoile in\nfurtherance of the impression it designed to convey--yet all this\nwas satisfactorily disproved. In a subsequent number of the paper, an\nattempt was made to throw suspicion upon Beauvais himself. The editor\nsays:\n\n“Now, then, a change comes over the matter. We are told that on one\noccasion, while a Madame B---- was at Madame Rogêt’s house, M. Beauvais,\nwho was going out, told her that a gendarme was expected there, and she,\nMadame B., must not say anything to the gendarme until he returned,\nbut let the matter be for him.... In the present posture of affairs,\nM. Beauvais appears to have the whole matter locked up in his head. A\nsingle step cannot be taken without M. Beauvais; for, go which way you\nwill, you run against him.... For some reason, he determined that nobody\nshall have any thing to do with the proceedings but himself, and he\nhas elbowed the male relatives out of the way, according to their\nrepresentations, in a very singular manner. He seems to have been very\nmuch averse to permitting the relatives to see the body.”\n\nBy the following fact, some color was given to the suspicion thus thrown\nupon Beauvais. A visiter at his office, a few days prior to the girl’s\ndisappearance, and during the absence of its occupant, had observed a\nrose in the key-hole of the door, and the name “Marie” inscribed upon a\nslate which hung near at hand.\n\nThe general impression, so far as we were enabled to glean it from the\nnewspapers, seemed to be, that Marie had been the victim of a gang\nof desperadoes--that by these she had been borne across the river,\nmaltreated and murdered. Le Commerciel, (*11) however, a print of\nextensive influence, was earnest in combating this popular idea. I quote\na passage or two from its columns:\n\n“We are persuaded that pursuit has hitherto been on a false scent, so\nfar as it has been directed to the Barrière du Roule. It is impossible\nthat a person so well known to thousands as this young woman was, should\nhave passed three blocks without some one having seen her; and any one\nwho saw her would have remembered it, for she interested all who knew\nher. It was when the streets were full of people, when she went out....\nIt is impossible that she could have gone to the Barrière du Roule, or\nto the Rue des Drômes, without being recognized by a dozen persons; yet\nno one has come forward who saw her outside of her mother’s door, and\nthere is no evidence, except the testimony concerning her expressed\nintentions, that she did go out at all. Her gown was torn, bound round\nher, and tied; and by that the body was carried as a bundle. If the\nmurder had been committed at the Barrière du Roule, there would have\nbeen no necessity for any such arrangement. The fact that the body was\nfound floating near the Barrière, is no proof as to where it was thrown\ninto the water..... A piece of one of the unfortunate girl’s petticoats,\ntwo feet long and one foot wide, was torn out and tied under her chin\naround the back of her head, probably to prevent screams. This was done\nby fellows who had no pocket-handkerchief.”\n\nA day or two before the Prefect called upon us, however, some important\ninformation reached the police, which seemed to overthrow, at least,\nthe chief portion of Le Commerciel’s argument. Two small boys, sons of a\nMadame Deluc, while roaming among the woods near the Barrière du Roule,\nchanced to penetrate a close thicket, within which were three or four\nlarge stones, forming a kind of seat, with a back and footstool. On\nthe upper stone lay a white petticoat; on the second a silk scarf. A\nparasol, gloves, and a pocket-handkerchief were also here found. The\nhandkerchief bore the name “Marie Rogêt.” Fragments of dress were\ndiscovered on the brambles around. The earth was trampled, the bushes\nwere broken, and there was every evidence of a struggle. Between the\nthicket and the river, the fences were found taken down, and the ground\nbore evidence of some heavy burthen having been dragged along it.\n\nA weekly paper, Le Soleil,(*12) had the following comments upon this\ndiscovery--comments which merely echoed the sentiment of the whole\nParisian press:\n\n“The things had all evidently been there at least three or four weeks;\nthey were all mildewed down hard with the action of the rain and stuck\ntogether from mildew. The grass had grown around and over some of them.\nThe silk on the parasol was strong, but the threads of it were run\ntogether within. The upper part, where it had been doubled and folded,\nwas all mildewed and rotten, and tore on its being opened..... The\npieces of her frock torn out by the bushes were about three inches wide\nand six inches long. One part was the hem of the frock, and it had been\nmended; the other piece was part of the skirt, not the hem. They looked\nlike strips torn off, and were on the thorn bush, about a foot from\nthe ground..... There can be no doubt, therefore, that the spot of this\nappalling outrage has been discovered.”\n\nConsequent upon this discovery, new evidence appeared. Madame Deluc\ntestified that she keeps a roadside inn not far from the bank of the\nriver, opposite the Barrière du Roule. The neighborhood is\nsecluded--particularly so. It is the usual Sunday resort of blackguards\nfrom the city, who cross the river in boats. About three o’clock, in the\nafternoon of the Sunday in question, a young girl arrived at the inn,\naccompanied by a young man of dark complexion. The two remained here for\nsome time. On their departure, they took the road to some thick woods in\nthe vicinity. Madame Deluc’s attention was called to the dress worn by\nthe girl, on account of its resemblance to one worn by a deceased\nrelative. A scarf was particularly noticed. Soon after the departure of\nthe couple, a gang of miscreants made their appearance, behaved\nboisterously, ate and drank without making payment, followed in the\nroute of the young man and girl, returned to the inn about dusk, and\nre-crossed the river as if in great haste.\n\nIt was soon after dark, upon this same evening, that Madame Deluc, as\nwell as her eldest son, heard the screams of a female in the vicinity\nof the inn. The screams were violent but brief. Madame D. recognized not\nonly the scarf which was found in the thicket, but the dress which was\ndiscovered upon the corpse. An omnibus driver, Valence, (*13) now also\ntestified that he saw Marie Rogêt cross a ferry on the Seine, on the\nSunday in question, in company with a young man of dark complexion.\nHe, Valence, knew Marie, and could not be mistaken in her identity. The\narticles found in the thicket were fully identified by the relatives of\nMarie.\n\nThe items of evidence and information thus collected by myself, from\nthe newspapers, at the suggestion of Dupin, embraced only one more\npoint--but this was a point of seemingly vast consequence. It appears\nthat, immediately after the discovery of the clothes as above described,\nthe lifeless, or nearly lifeless body of St. Eustache, Marie’s\nbetrothed, was found in the vicinity of what all now supposed the scene\nof the outrage. A phial labelled “laudanum,” and emptied, was found near\nhim. His breath gave evidence of the poison. He died without speaking.\nUpon his person was found a letter, briefly stating his love for Marie,\nwith his design of self-destruction.\n\n“I need scarcely tell you,” said Dupin, as he finished the perusal of\nmy notes, “that this is a far more intricate case than that of the\nRue Morgue; from which it differs in one important respect. This is\nan ordinary, although an atrocious instance of crime. There is nothing\npeculiarly outré about it. You will observe that, for this reason, the\nmystery has been considered easy, when, for this reason, it should have\nbeen considered difficult, of solution. Thus; at first, it was thought\nunnecessary to offer a reward. The myrmidons of G---- were able at once\nto comprehend how and why such an atrocity might have been committed.\nThey could picture to their imaginations a mode--many modes--and a\nmotive--many motives; and because it was not impossible that either of\nthese numerous modes and motives could have been the actual one, they\nhave taken it for granted that one of them must. But the case with which\nthese variable fancies were entertained, and the very plausibility which\neach assumed, should have been understood as indicative rather of the\ndifficulties than of the facilities which must attend elucidation. I\nhave before observed that it is by prominences above the plane of the\nordinary, that reason feels her way, if at all, in her search for the\ntrue, and that the proper question in cases such as this, is not so\nmuch ‘what has occurred?’ as ‘what has occurred that has never occurred\nbefore?’ In the investigations at the house of Madame L’Espanaye,\n(*14) the agents of G---- were discouraged and confounded by that\nvery unusualness which, to a properly regulated intellect, would have\nafforded the surest omen of success; while this same intellect might\nhave been plunged in despair at the ordinary character of all that met\nthe eye in the case of the perfumery-girl, and yet told of nothing but\neasy triumph to the functionaries of the Prefecture.\n\n“In the case of Madame L’Espanaye and her daughter there was, even\nat the beginning of our investigation, no doubt that murder had been\ncommitted. The idea of suicide was excluded at once. Here, too, we are\nfreed, at the commencement, from all supposition of self-murder. The\nbody found at the Barrière du Roule, was found under such circumstances\nas to leave us no room for embarrassment upon this important point. But\nit has been suggested that the corpse discovered, is not that of the\nMarie Rogêt for the conviction of whose assassin, or assassins, the\nreward is offered, and respecting whom, solely, our agreement has been\narranged with the Prefect. We both know this gentleman well. It will not\ndo to trust him too far. If, dating our inquiries from the body found,\nand thence tracing a murderer, we yet discover this body to be that of\nsome other individual than Marie; or, if starting from the living Marie,\nwe find her, yet find her unassassinated--in either case we lose our\nlabor; since it is Monsieur G---- with whom we have to deal. For our\nown purpose, therefore, if not for the purpose of justice, it is\nindispensable that our first step should be the determination of the\nidentity of the corpse with the Marie Rogêt who is missing.\n\n“With the public the arguments of L’Etoile have had weight; and that the\njournal itself is convinced of their importance would appear from\nthe manner in which it commences one of its essays upon the\nsubject--‘Several of the morning papers of the day,’ it says, ‘speak of\nthe _conclusive_ article in Monday’s Etoile.’ To me, this article\nappears conclusive of little beyond the zeal of its inditer. We should\nbear in mind that, in general, it is the object of our newspapers rather\nto create a sensation--to make a point--than to further the cause of\ntruth. The latter end is only pursued when it seems coincident with the\nformer. The print which merely falls in with ordinary opinion (however\nwell founded this opinion may be) earns for itself no credit with the\nmob. The mass of the people regard as profound only him who suggests\n_pungent contradictions_ of the general idea. In ratiocination, not less\nthan in literature, it is the epigram which is the most immediately and\nthe most universally appreciated. In both, it is of the lowest order of\nmerit.\n\n“What I mean to say is, that it is the mingled epigram and melodrame\nof the idea, that Marie Rogêt still lives, rather than any true\nplausibility in this idea, which have suggested it to L’Etoile, and\nsecured it a favorable reception with the public. Let us examine the\nheads of this journal’s argument; endeavoring to avoid the incoherence\nwith which it is originally set forth.\n\n“The first aim of the writer is to show, from the brevity of the\ninterval between Marie’s disappearance and the finding of the floating\ncorpse, that this corpse cannot be that of Marie. The reduction of this\ninterval to its smallest possible dimension, becomes thus, at once, an\nobject with the reasoner. In the rash pursuit of this object, he rushes\ninto mere assumption at the outset. ‘It is folly to suppose,’ he says,\n‘that the murder, if murder was committed on her body, could have been\nconsummated soon enough to have enabled her murderers to throw the body\ninto the river before midnight.’ We demand at once, and very naturally,\nwhy? Why is it folly to suppose that the murder was committed _within\nfive minutes_ after the girl’s quitting her mother’s house? Why is it\nfolly to suppose that the murder was committed at any given period\nof the day? There have been assassinations at all hours. But, had the\nmurder taken place at any moment between nine o’clock in the morning of\nSunday, and a quarter before midnight, there would still have been\ntime enough ‘to throw the body into the river before midnight.’ This\nassumption, then, amounts precisely to this--that the murder was not\ncommitted on Sunday at all--and, if we allow L’Etoile to assume this,\nwe may permit it any liberties whatever. The paragraph beginning ‘It is\nfolly to suppose that the murder, etc.,’ however it appears as printed\nin L’Etoile, may be imagined to have existed actually thus in the brain\nof its inditer--‘It is folly to suppose that the murder, if murder was\ncommitted on the body, could have been committed soon enough to have\nenabled her murderers to throw the body into the river before midnight;\nit is folly, we say, to suppose all this, and to suppose at the same\ntime, (as we are resolved to suppose,) that the body was not thrown\nin until after midnight’--a sentence sufficiently inconsequential in\nitself, but not so utterly preposterous as the one printed.\n\n“Were it my purpose,” continued Dupin, “merely to _make out a case_\nagainst this passage of L’Etoile’s argument, I might safely leave it\nwhere it is. It is not, however, with L’Etoile that we have to do, but\nwith the truth. The sentence in question has but one meaning, as it\nstands; and this meaning I have fairly stated: but it is material\nthat we go behind the mere words, for an idea which these words have\nobviously intended, and failed to convey. It was the design of the\njournalist to say that, at whatever period of the day or night of Sunday\nthis murder was committed, it was improbable that the assassins would\nhave ventured to bear the corpse to the river before midnight. And\nherein lies, really, the assumption of which I complain. It is assumed\nthat the murder was committed at such a position, and under such\ncircumstances, that the bearing it to the river became necessary. Now,\nthe assassination might have taken place upon the river’s brink, or on\nthe river itself; and, thus, the throwing the corpse in the water might\nhave been resorted to, at any period of the day or night, as the most\nobvious and most immediate mode of disposal. You will understand that I\nsuggest nothing here as probable, or as cöincident with my own opinion.\nMy design, so far, has no reference to the facts of the case. I wish\nmerely to caution you against the whole tone of L’Etoile’s suggestion,\nby calling your attention to its ex parte character at the outset.\n\n“Having prescribed thus a limit to suit its own preconceived notions;\nhaving assumed that, if this were the body of Marie, it could have been\nin the water but a very brief time; the journal goes on to say:\n\n‘All experience has shown that drowned bodies, or bodies thrown into the\nwater immediately after death by violence, require from six to ten days\nfor sufficient decomposition to take place to bring them to the top\nof the water. Even when a cannon is fired over a corpse, and it rises\nbefore at least five or six days’ immersion, it sinks again if let\nalone.’\n\n“These assertions have been tacitly received by every paper in Paris,\nwith the exception of Le Moniteur. (*15) This latter print endeavors\nto combat that portion of the paragraph which has reference to ‘drowned\nbodies’ only, by citing some five or six instances in which the bodies\nof individuals known to be drowned were found floating after the lapse\nof less time than is insisted upon by L’Etoile. But there is something\nexcessively unphilosophical in the attempt on the part of Le Moniteur,\nto rebut the general assertion of L’Etoile, by a citation of particular\ninstances militating against that assertion. Had it been possible to\nadduce fifty instead of five examples of bodies found floating at the\nend of two or three days, these fifty examples could still have been\nproperly regarded only as exceptions to L’Etoile’s rule, until such time\nas the rule itself should be confuted. Admitting the rule, (and this\nLe Moniteur does not deny, insisting merely upon its exceptions,) the\nargument of L’Etoile is suffered to remain in full force; for this\nargument does not pretend to involve more than a question of the\nprobability of the body having risen to the surface in less than three\ndays; and this probability will be in favor of L’Etoile’s position until\nthe instances so childishly adduced shall be sufficient in number to\nestablish an antagonistical rule.\n\n“You will see at once that all argument upon this head should be urged,\nif at all, against the rule itself; and for this end we must examine the\nrationale of the rule. Now the human body, in general, is neither much\nlighter nor much heavier than the water of the Seine; that is to say,\nthe specific gravity of the human body, in its natural condition, is\nabout equal to the bulk of fresh water which it displaces. The bodies\nof fat and fleshy persons, with small bones, and of women generally,\nare lighter than those of the lean and large-boned, and of men; and the\nspecific gravity of the water of a river is somewhat influenced by the\npresence of the tide from sea. But, leaving this tide out of question,\nit may be said that very few human bodies will sink at all, even in\nfresh water, of their own accord. Almost any one, falling into a river,\nwill be enabled to float, if he suffer the specific gravity of the water\nfairly to be adduced in comparison with his own--that is to say, if\nhe suffer his whole person to be immersed, with as little exception as\npossible. The proper position for one who cannot swim, is the upright\nposition of the walker on land, with the head thrown fully back, and\nimmersed; the mouth and nostrils alone remaining above the surface.\nThus circumstanced, we shall find that we float without difficulty and\nwithout exertion. It is evident, however, that the gravities of the\nbody, and of the bulk of water displaced, are very nicely balanced, and\nthat a trifle will cause either to preponderate. An arm, for instance,\nuplifted from the water, and thus deprived of its support, is an\nadditional weight sufficient to immerse the whole head, while the\naccidental aid of the smallest piece of timber will enable us to elevate\nthe head so as to look about. Now, in the struggles of one unused to\nswimming, the arms are invariably thrown upwards, while an attempt is\nmade to keep the head in its usual perpendicular position. The result\nis the immersion of the mouth and nostrils, and the inception, during\nefforts to breathe while beneath the surface, of water into the lungs.\nMuch is also received into the stomach, and the whole body becomes\nheavier by the difference between the weight of the air originally\ndistending these cavities, and that of the fluid which now fills them.\nThis difference is sufficient to cause the body to sink, as a general\nrule; but is insufficient in the cases of individuals with small bones\nand an abnormal quantity of flaccid or fatty matter. Such individuals\nfloat even after drowning.\n\n“The corpse, being supposed at the bottom of the river, will there\nremain until, by some means, its specific gravity again becomes less\nthan that of the bulk of water which it displaces. This effect\nis brought about by decomposition, or otherwise. The result of\ndecomposition is the generation of gas, distending the cellular tissues\nand all the cavities, and giving the puffed appearance which is so\nhorrible. When this distension has so far progressed that the bulk of\nthe corpse is materially increased without a corresponding increase of\nmass or weight, its specific gravity becomes less than that of the water\ndisplaced, and it forthwith makes its appearance at the surface. But\ndecomposition is modified by innumerable circumstances--is hastened or\nretarded by innumerable agencies; for example, by the heat or cold of\nthe season, by the mineral impregnation or purity of the water, by its\ndepth or shallowness, by its currency or stagnation, by the temperament\nof the body, by its infection or freedom from disease before death.\nThus it is evident that we can assign no period, with any thing like\naccuracy, at which the corpse shall rise through decomposition. Under\ncertain conditions this result would be brought about within an hour;\nunder others, it might not take place at all. There are chemical\ninfusions by which the animal frame can be preserved forever from\ncorruption; the Bi-chloride of Mercury is one. But, apart from\ndecomposition, there may be, and very usually is, a generation of gas\nwithin the stomach, from the acetous fermentation of vegetable matter\n(or within other cavities from other causes) sufficient to induce a\ndistension which will bring the body to the surface. The effect produced\nby the firing of a cannon is that of simple vibration. This may either\nloosen the corpse from the soft mud or ooze in which it is imbedded,\nthus permitting it to rise when other agencies have already prepared\nit for so doing; or it may overcome the tenacity of some putrescent\nportions of the cellular tissue; allowing the cavities to distend under\nthe influence of the gas.\n\n“Having thus before us the whole philosophy of this subject, we can\neasily test by it the assertions of L’Etoile. ‘All experience shows,’\nsays this paper, ‘that drowned bodies, or bodies thrown into the water\nimmediately after death by violence, require from six to ten days for\nsufficient decomposition to take place to bring them to the top of the\nwater. Even when a cannon is fired over a corpse, and it rises before at\nleast five or six days’ immersion, it sinks again if let alone.’\n\n“The whole of this paragraph must now appear a tissue of inconsequence\nand incoherence. All experience does not show that ‘drowned bodies’\nrequire from six to ten days for sufficient decomposition to take place\nto bring them to the surface. Both science and experience show that the\nperiod of their rising is, and necessarily must be, indeterminate. If,\nmoreover, a body has risen to the surface through firing of cannon,\nit will not ‘sink again if let alone,’ until decomposition has so far\nprogressed as to permit the escape of the generated gas. But I wish to\ncall your attention to the distinction which is made between ‘drowned\nbodies,’ and ‘bodies thrown into the water immediately after death by\nviolence.’ Although the writer admits the distinction, he yet includes\nthem all in the same category. I have shown how it is that the body of\na drowning man becomes specifically heavier than its bulk of water,\nand that he would not sink at all, except for the struggles by which\nhe elevates his arms above the surface, and his gasps for breath while\nbeneath the surface--gasps which supply by water the place of the\noriginal air in the lungs. But these struggles and these gasps would\nnot occur in the body ‘thrown into the water immediately after death by\nviolence.’ Thus, in the latter instance, the body, as a general rule,\nwould not sink at all--a fact of which L’Etoile is evidently ignorant.\nWhen decomposition had proceeded to a very great extent--when the flesh\nhad in a great measure left the bones--then, indeed, but not till then,\nshould we lose sight of the corpse.\n\n“And now what are we to make of the argument, that the body found could\nnot be that of Marie Rogêt, because, three days only having elapsed,\nthis body was found floating? If drowned, being a woman, she might never\nhave sunk; or having sunk, might have reappeared in twenty-four hours,\nor less. But no one supposes her to have been drowned; and, dying before\nbeing thrown into the river, she might have been found floating at any\nperiod afterwards whatever.\n\n“‘But,’ says L’Etoile, ‘if the body had been kept in its mangled state\non shore until Tuesday night, some trace would be found on shore of the\nmurderers.’ Here it is at first difficult to perceive the intention\nof the reasoner. He means to anticipate what he imagines would be an\nobjection to his theory--viz: that the body was kept on shore two days,\nsuffering rapid decomposition--more rapid than if immersed in water. He\nsupposes that, had this been the case, it might have appeared at the\nsurface on the Wednesday, and thinks that only under such circumstances\nit could so have appeared. He is accordingly in haste to show that it\nwas not kept on shore; for, if so, ‘some trace would be found on shore\nof the murderers.’ I presume you smile at the sequitur. You cannot\nbe made to see how the mere duration of the corpse on the shore could\noperate to multiply traces of the assassins. Nor can I.\n\n“‘And furthermore it is exceedingly improbable,’ continues our journal,\n‘that any villains who had committed such a murder as is here supposed,\nwould have thrown the body in without weight to sink it, when such\na precaution could have so easily been taken.’ Observe, here, the\nlaughable confusion of thought! No one--not even L’Etoile--disputes\nthe murder committed _on the body found_. The marks of violence are too\nobvious. It is our reasoner’s object merely to show that this body is\nnot Marie’s. He wishes to prove that Marie is not assassinated--not that\nthe corpse was not. Yet his observation proves only the latter point.\nHere is a corpse without weight attached. Murderers, casting it in,\nwould not have failed to attach a weight. Therefore it was not thrown in\nby murderers. This is all which is proved, if any thing is. The question\nof identity is not even approached, and L’Etoile has been at great pains\nmerely to gainsay now what it has admitted only a moment before. ‘We\nare perfectly convinced,’ it says, ‘that the body found was that of a\nmurdered female.’\n\n“Nor is this the sole instance, even in this division of his subject,\nwhere our reasoner unwittingly reasons against himself. His evident\nobject, I have already said, is to reduce, as much as possible, the\ninterval between Marie’s disappearance and the finding of the corpse.\nYet we find him urging the point that no person saw the girl from the\nmoment of her leaving her mother’s house. ‘We have no evidence,’ he\nsays, ‘that Marie Rogêt was in the land of the living after nine o’clock\non Sunday, June the twenty-second.’ As his argument is obviously an ex\nparte one, he should, at least, have left this matter out of sight; for\nhad any one been known to see Marie, say on Monday, or on Tuesday,\nthe interval in question would have been much reduced, and, by his own\nratiocination, the probability much diminished of the corpse being that\nof the grisette. It is, nevertheless, amusing to observe that L’Etoile\ninsists upon its point in the full belief of its furthering its general\nargument.\n\n“Reperuse now that portion of this argument which has reference to the\nidentification of the corpse by Beauvais. In regard to the hair upon the\narm, L’Etoile has been obviously disingenuous. M. Beauvais, not being an\nidiot, could never have urged, in identification of the corpse, simply\nhair upon its arm. No arm is without hair. The generality of the\nexpression of L’Etoile is a mere perversion of the witness’ phraseology.\nHe must have spoken of some peculiarity in this hair. It must have been\na peculiarity of color, of quantity, of length, or of situation.\n\n“‘Her foot,’ says the journal, ‘was small--so are thousands of feet. Her\ngarter is no proof whatever--nor is her shoe--for shoes and garters are\nsold in packages. The same may be said of the flowers in her hat. One\nthing upon which M. Beauvais strongly insists is, that the clasp on the\ngarter found, had been set back to take it in. This amounts to nothing;\nfor most women find it proper to take a pair of garters home and fit\nthem to the size of the limbs they are to encircle, rather than to try\nthem in the store where they purchase.’ Here it is difficult to suppose\nthe reasoner in earnest. Had M. Beauvais, in his search for the body of\nMarie, discovered a corpse corresponding in general size and appearance\nto the missing girl, he would have been warranted (without reference to\nthe question of habiliment at all) in forming an opinion that his search\nhad been successful. If, in addition to the point of general size and\ncontour, he had found upon the arm a peculiar hairy appearance which he\nhad observed upon the living Marie, his opinion might have been justly\nstrengthened; and the increase of positiveness might well have been in\nthe ratio of the peculiarity, or unusualness, of the hairy mark. If,\nthe feet of Marie being small, those of the corpse were also small, the\nincrease of probability that the body was that of Marie would not be an\nincrease in a ratio merely arithmetical, but in one highly geometrical,\nor accumulative. Add to all this shoes such as she had been known to\nwear upon the day of her disappearance, and, although these shoes may be\n‘sold in packages,’ you so far augment the probability as to verge upon\nthe certain. What, of itself, would be no evidence of identity, becomes\nthrough its corroborative position, proof most sure. Give us, then,\nflowers in the hat corresponding to those worn by the missing girl, and\nwe seek for nothing farther. If only one flower, we seek for nothing\nfarther--what then if two or three, or more? Each successive one\nis multiple evidence--proof not _added_ to proof, but multiplied by\nhundreds or thousands. Let us now discover, upon the deceased, garters\nsuch as the living used, and it is almost folly to proceed. But these\ngarters are found to be tightened, by the setting back of a clasp,\nin just such a manner as her own had been tightened by Marie, shortly\nprevious to her leaving home. It is now madness or hypocrisy to doubt.\nWhat L’Etoile says in respect to this abbreviation of the garter’s being\nan usual occurrence, shows nothing beyond its own pertinacity in error.\nThe elastic nature of the clasp-garter is self-demonstration of the\nunusualness of the abbreviation. What is made to adjust itself, must of\nnecessity require foreign adjustment but rarely. It must have been by an\naccident, in its strictest sense, that these garters of Marie needed\nthe tightening described. They alone would have amply established her\nidentity. But it is not that the corpse was found to have the garters\nof the missing girl, or found to have her shoes, or her bonnet, or the\nflowers of her bonnet, or her feet, or a peculiar mark upon the arm,\nor her general size and appearance--it is that the corpse had each,\nand _all collectively_. Could it be proved that the editor of L’Etoile\n_really_ entertained a doubt, under the circumstances, there would be\nno need, in his case, of a commission de lunatico inquirendo. He has\nthought it sagacious to echo the small talk of the lawyers, who, for the\nmost part, content themselves with echoing the rectangular precepts of\nthe courts. I would here observe that very much of what is rejected as\nevidence by a court, is the best of evidence to the intellect. For\nthe court, guiding itself by the general principles of evidence--the\nrecognized and _booked_ principles--is averse from swerving at\nparticular instances. And this steadfast adherence to principle, with\nrigorous disregard of the conflicting exception, is a sure mode of\nattaining the maximum of attainable truth, in any long sequence of time.\nThe practice, in mass, is therefore philosophical; but it is not the\nless certain that it engenders vast individual error. (*16)\n\n“In respect to the insinuations levelled at Beauvais, you will be\nwilling to dismiss them in a breath. You have already fathomed the\ntrue character of this good gentleman. He is a busy-body, with much\nof romance and little of wit. Any one so constituted will readily so\nconduct himself, upon occasion of real excitement, as to render himself\nliable to suspicion on the part of the over acute, or the ill-disposed.\nM. Beauvais (as it appears from your notes) had some personal interviews\nwith the editor of L’Etoile, and offended him by venturing an opinion\nthat the corpse, notwithstanding the theory of the editor, was, in sober\nfact, that of Marie. ‘He persists,’ says the paper, ‘in asserting the\ncorpse to be that of Marie, but cannot give a circumstance, in addition\nto those which we have commented upon, to make others believe.’ Now,\nwithout re-adverting to the fact that stronger evidence ‘to make others\nbelieve,’ could never have been adduced, it may be remarked that a man\nmay very well be understood to believe, in a case of this kind, without\nthe ability to advance a single reason for the belief of a second party.\nNothing is more vague than impressions of individual identity. Each man\nrecognizes his neighbor, yet there are few instances in which any one\nis prepared to give a reason for his recognition. The editor of L’Etoile\nhad no right to be offended at M. Beauvais’ unreasoning belief.\n\n“The suspicious circumstances which invest him, will be found to tally\nmuch better with my hypothesis of romantic busy-bodyism, than with\nthe reasoner’s suggestion of guilt. Once adopting the more charitable\ninterpretation, we shall find no difficulty in comprehending the rose\nin the key-hole; the ‘Marie’ upon the slate; the ‘elbowing the male\nrelatives out of the way;’ the ‘aversion to permitting them to see\nthe body;’ the caution given to Madame B----, that she must hold no\nconversation with the gendarme until his return (Beauvais’); and,\nlastly, his apparent determination ‘that nobody should have anything to\ndo with the proceedings except himself.’ It seems to me unquestionable\nthat Beauvais was a suitor of Marie’s; that she coquetted with him; and\nthat he was ambitious of being thought to enjoy her fullest intimacy\nand confidence. I shall say nothing more upon this point; and, as the\nevidence fully rebuts the assertion of L’Etoile, touching the matter\nof apathy on the part of the mother and other relatives--an apathy\ninconsistent with the supposition of their believing the corpse to be\nthat of the perfumery-girl--we shall now proceed as if the question of\nidentity were settled to our perfect satisfaction.”\n\n“And what,” I here demanded, “do you think of the opinions of Le\nCommerciel?”\n\n“That, in spirit, they are far more worthy of attention than any which\nhave been promulgated upon the subject. The deductions from the premises\nare philosophical and acute; but the premises, in two instances, at\nleast, are founded in imperfect observation. Le Commerciel wishes to\nintimate that Marie was seized by some gang of low ruffians not far from\nher mother’s door. ‘It is impossible,’ it urges, ‘that a person so well\nknown to thousands as this young woman was, should have passed three\nblocks without some one having seen her.’ This is the idea of a man long\nresident in Paris--a public man--and one whose walks to and fro in the\ncity, have been mostly limited to the vicinity of the public offices.\nHe is aware that he seldom passes so far as a dozen blocks from his own\nbureau, without being recognized and accosted. And, knowing the extent\nof his personal acquaintance with others, and of others with him, he\ncompares his notoriety with that of the perfumery-girl, finds no great\ndifference between them, and reaches at once the conclusion that she, in\nher walks, would be equally liable to recognition with himself in\nhis. This could only be the case were her walks of the same unvarying,\nmethodical character, and within the same species of limited region\nas are his own. He passes to and fro, at regular intervals, within a\nconfined periphery, abounding in individuals who are led to observation\nof his person through interest in the kindred nature of his occupation\nwith their own. But the walks of Marie may, in general, be supposed\ndiscursive. In this particular instance, it will be understood as most\nprobable, that she proceeded upon a route of more than average diversity\nfrom her accustomed ones. The parallel which we imagine to have existed\nin the mind of Le Commerciel would only be sustained in the event of the\ntwo individuals’ traversing the whole city. In this case, granting the\npersonal acquaintances to be equal, the chances would be also equal that\nan equal number of personal rencounters would be made. For my own\npart, I should hold it not only as possible, but as very far more than\nprobable, that Marie might have proceeded, at any given period, by any\none of the many routes between her own residence and that of her aunt,\nwithout meeting a single individual whom she knew, or by whom she was\nknown. In viewing this question in its full and proper light, we must\nhold steadily in mind the great disproportion between the personal\nacquaintances of even the most noted individual in Paris, and the entire\npopulation of Paris itself.\n\n“But whatever force there may still appear to be in the suggestion of Le\nCommerciel, will be much diminished when we take into consideration the\nhour at which the girl went abroad. ‘It was when the streets were full\nof people,’ says Le Commerciel, ‘that she went out.’ But not so. It was\nat nine o’clock in the morning. Now at nine o’clock of every morning in\nthe week, _with the exception of Sunday_, the streets of the city are,\nit is true, thronged with people. At nine on Sunday, the populace are\nchiefly within doors _preparing for church_. No observing person can\nhave failed to notice the peculiarly deserted air of the town, from\nabout eight until ten on the morning of every Sabbath. Between ten and\neleven the streets are thronged, but not at so early a period as that\ndesignated.\n\n“There is another point at which there seems a deficiency of observation\non the part of Le Commerciel. ‘A piece,’ it says, ‘of one of the\nunfortunate girl’s petticoats, two feet long, and one foot wide, was\ntorn out and tied under her chin, and around the back of her head,\nprobably to prevent screams. This was done, by fellows who had no\npocket-handkerchiefs.’ Whether this idea is, or is not well founded,\nwe will endeavor to see hereafter; but by ‘fellows who have no\npocket-handkerchiefs’ the editor intends the lowest class of ruffians.\nThese, however, are the very description of people who will always be\nfound to have handkerchiefs even when destitute of shirts. You must have\nhad occasion to observe how absolutely indispensable, of late years, to\nthe thorough blackguard, has become the pocket-handkerchief.”\n\n“And what are we to think,” I asked, “of the article in Le Soleil?”\n\n“That it is a vast pity its inditer was not born a parrot--in which\ncase he would have been the most illustrious parrot of his race. He has\nmerely repeated the individual items of the already published opinion;\ncollecting them, with a laudable industry, from this paper and from\nthat. ‘The things had all evidently been there,’ he says, ‘at least,\nthree or four weeks, and there can be _no doubt_ that the spot of this\nappalling outrage has been discovered.’ The facts here re-stated by\nLe Soleil, are very far indeed from removing my own doubts upon this\nsubject, and we will examine them more particularly hereafter in\nconnexion with another division of the theme.\n\n“At present we must occupy ourselves with other investigations. You\ncannot fail to have remarked the extreme laxity of the examination of\nthe corpse. To be sure, the question of identity was readily determined,\nor should have been; but there were other points to be ascertained. Had\nthe body been in any respect despoiled? Had the deceased any articles\nof jewelry about her person upon leaving home? if so, had she any when\nfound? These are important questions utterly untouched by the evidence;\nand there are others of equal moment, which have met with no attention.\nWe must endeavor to satisfy ourselves by personal inquiry. The case of\nSt. Eustache must be re-examined. I have no suspicion of this person;\nbut let us proceed methodically. We will ascertain beyond a doubt the\nvalidity of the affidavits in regard to his whereabouts on the Sunday.\nAffidavits of this character are readily made matter of mystification.\nShould there be nothing wrong here, however, we will dismiss St.\nEustache from our investigations. His suicide, however corroborative of\nsuspicion, were there found to be deceit in the affidavits, is, without\nsuch deceit, in no respect an unaccountable circumstance, or one which\nneed cause us to deflect from the line of ordinary analysis.\n\n“In that which I now propose, we will discard the interior points of\nthis tragedy, and concentrate our attention upon its outskirts. Not the\nleast usual error, in investigations such as this, is the limiting of\ninquiry to the immediate, with total disregard of the collateral or\ncircumstantial events. It is the mal-practice of the courts to confine\nevidence and discussion to the bounds of apparent relevancy. Yet\nexperience has shown, and a true philosophy will always show, that a\nvast, perhaps the larger portion of truth, arises from the seemingly\nirrelevant. It is through the spirit of this principle, if not precisely\nthrough its letter, that modern science has resolved to calculate upon\nthe unforeseen. But perhaps you do not comprehend me. The history of\nhuman knowledge has so uninterruptedly shown that to collateral, or\nincidental, or accidental events we are indebted for the most numerous\nand most valuable discoveries, that it has at length become necessary,\nin any prospective view of improvement, to make not only large, but the\nlargest allowances for inventions that shall arise by chance, and quite\nout of the range of ordinary expectation. It is no longer philosophical\nto base, upon what has been, a vision of what is to be. Accident is\nadmitted as a portion of the substructure. We make chance a matter of\nabsolute calculation. We subject the unlooked for and unimagined, to the\nmathematical _formulae_ of the schools.\n\n“I repeat that it is no more than fact, that the larger portion of all\ntruth has sprung from the collateral; and it is but in accordance with\nthe spirit of the principle involved in this fact, that I would divert\ninquiry, in the present case, from the trodden and hitherto unfruitful\nground of the event itself, to the contemporary circumstances which\nsurround it. While you ascertain the validity of the affidavits, I will\nexamine the newspapers more generally than you have as yet done. So far,\nwe have only reconnoitred the field of investigation; but it will be\nstrange indeed if a comprehensive survey, such as I propose, of the\npublic prints, will not afford us some minute points which shall\nestablish a direction for inquiry.”\n\nIn pursuance of Dupin’s suggestion, I made scrupulous examination of\nthe affair of the affidavits. The result was a firm conviction of their\nvalidity, and of the consequent innocence of St. Eustache. In the mean\ntime my friend occupied himself, with what seemed to me a minuteness\naltogether objectless, in a scrutiny of the various newspaper files. At\nthe end of a week he placed before me the following extracts:\n\n“About three years and a half ago, a disturbance very similar to the\npresent, was caused by the disappearance of this same Marie Rogêt, from\nthe parfumerie of Monsieur Le Blanc, in the Palais Royal. At the end of\na week, however, she re-appeared at her customary comptoir, as well as\never, with the exception of a slight paleness not altogether usual. It\nwas given out by Monsieur Le Blanc and her mother, that she had merely\nbeen on a visit to some friend in the country; and the affair was\nspeedily hushed up. We presume that the present absence is a freak of\nthe same nature, and that, at the expiration of a week, or perhaps of\na month, we shall have her among us again.”--Evening Paper--Monday June\n23. (*17)\n\n“An evening journal of yesterday, refers to a former mysterious\ndisappearance of Mademoiselle Rogêt. It is well known that, during the\nweek of her absence from Le Blanc’s parfumerie, she was in the company\nof a young naval officer, much noted for his debaucheries. A quarrel, it\nis supposed, providentially led to her return home. We have the name of\nthe Lothario in question, who is, at present, stationed in Paris, but,\nfor obvious reasons, forbear to make it public.”--Le Mercurie--Tuesday\nMorning, June 24. (*18)\n\n“An outrage of the most atrocious character was perpetrated near this\ncity the day before yesterday. A gentleman, with his wife and daughter,\nengaged, about dusk, the services of six young men, who were idly rowing\na boat to and fro near the banks of the Seine, to convey him across the\nriver. Upon reaching the opposite shore, the three passengers stepped\nout, and had proceeded so far as to be beyond the view of the boat,\nwhen the daughter discovered that she had left in it her parasol. She\nreturned for it, was seized by the gang, carried out into the stream,\ngagged, brutally treated, and finally taken to the shore at a point\nnot far from that at which she had originally entered the boat with her\nparents. The villains have escaped for the time, but the police are upon\ntheir trail, and some of them will soon be taken.”--Morning Paper--June\n25. (*19)\n\n“We have received one or two communications, the object of which is to\nfasten the crime of the late atrocity upon Mennais; (*20) but as this\ngentleman has been fully exonerated by a loyal inquiry, and as the\narguments of our several correspondents appear to be more zealous than\nprofound, we do not think it advisable to make them public.”--Morning\nPaper--June 28. (*21)\n\n“We have received several forcibly written communications, apparently\nfrom various sources, and which go far to render it a matter of\ncertainty that the unfortunate Marie Rogêt has become a victim of one of\nthe numerous bands of blackguards which infest the vicinity of the city\nupon Sunday. Our own opinion is decidedly in favor of this\nsupposition. We shall endeavor to make room for some of these arguments\nhereafter.”--Evening Paper--Tuesday, June 31. (*22)\n\n“On Monday, one of the bargemen connected with the revenue service, saw\na empty boat floating down the Seine. Sails were lying in the bottom of\nthe boat. The bargeman towed it under the barge office. The next morning\nit was taken from thence, without the knowledge of any of the officers.\nThe rudder is now at the barge office.”--Le Diligence--Thursday, June\n26.\n\nUpon reading these various extracts, they not only seemed to me\nirrelevant, but I could perceive no mode in which any one of them\ncould be brought to bear upon the matter in hand. I waited for some\nexplanation from Dupin.\n\n“It is not my present design,” he said, “to dwell upon the first and\nsecond of those extracts. I have copied them chiefly to show you the\nextreme remissness of the police, who, as far as I can understand from\nthe Prefect, have not troubled themselves, in any respect, with an\nexamination of the naval officer alluded to. Yet it is mere folly to say\nthat between the first and second disappearance of Marie, there is\nno _supposable_ connection. Let us admit the first elopement to have\nresulted in a quarrel between the lovers, and the return home of the\nbetrayed. We are now prepared to view a second elopement (if we know\nthat an elopement has again taken place) as indicating a renewal of the\nbetrayer’s advances, rather than as the result of new proposals by a\nsecond individual--we are prepared to regard it as a ‘making up’ of the\nold amour, rather than as the commencement of a new one. The chances are\nten to one, that he who had once eloped with Marie, would again propose\nan elopement, rather than that she to whom proposals of elopement had\nbeen made by one individual, should have them made to her by another.\nAnd here let me call your attention to the fact, that the time elapsing\nbetween the first ascertained, and the second supposed elopement, is\na few months more than the general period of the cruises of our\nmen-of-war. Had the lover been interrupted in his first villany by the\nnecessity of departure to sea, and had he seized the first moment of his\nreturn to renew the base designs not yet altogether accomplished--or\nnot yet altogether accomplished by _him?_ Of all these things we know\nnothing.\n\n“You will say, however, that, in the second instance, there was no\nelopement as imagined. Certainly not--but are we prepared to say that\nthere was not the frustrated design? Beyond St. Eustache, and perhaps\nBeauvais, we find no recognized, no open, no honorable suitors of Marie.\nOf none other is there any thing said. Who, then, is the secret lover,\nof whom the relatives (at least most of them) know nothing, but whom\nMarie meets upon the morning of Sunday, and who is so deeply in her\nconfidence, that she hesitates not to remain with him until the shades\nof the evening descend, amid the solitary groves of the Barrière du\nRoule? Who is that secret lover, I ask, of whom, at least, most of the\nrelatives know nothing? And what means the singular prophecy of Madame\nRogêt on the morning of Marie’s departure?--‘I fear that I shall never\nsee Marie again.’\n\n“But if we cannot imagine Madame Rogêt privy to the design of elopement,\nmay we not at least suppose this design entertained by the girl? Upon\nquitting home, she gave it to be understood that she was about to visit\nher aunt in the Rue des Drômes and St. Eustache was requested to call\nfor her at dark. Now, at first glance, this fact strongly militates\nagainst my suggestion;--but let us reflect. That she did meet some\ncompanion, and proceed with him across the river, reaching the Barrière\ndu Roule at so late an hour as three o’clock in the afternoon, is\nknown. But in consenting so to accompany this individual, (_for whatever\npurpose--to her mother known or unknown,_) she must have thought of her\nexpressed intention when leaving home, and of the surprise and suspicion\naroused in the bosom of her affianced suitor, St. Eustache, when,\ncalling for her, at the hour appointed, in the Rue des Drômes, he should\nfind that she had not been there, and when, moreover, upon returning to\nthe pension with this alarming intelligence, he should become aware of\nher continued absence from home. She must have thought of these things,\nI say. She must have foreseen the chagrin of St. Eustache, the suspicion\nof all. She could not have thought of returning to brave this suspicion;\nbut the suspicion becomes a point of trivial importance to her, if we\nsuppose her not intending to return.\n\n“We may imagine her thinking thus--‘I am to meet a certain person for\nthe purpose of elopement, or for certain other purposes known only to\nmyself. It is necessary that there be no chance of interruption--there\nmust be sufficient time given us to elude pursuit--I will give it to be\nunderstood that I shall visit and spend the day with my aunt at the Rue\ndes Drômes--I well tell St. Eustache not to call for me until dark--in\nthis way, my absence from home for the longest possible period, without\ncausing suspicion or anxiety, will be accounted for, and I shall gain\nmore time than in any other manner. If I bid St. Eustache call for me\nat dark, he will be sure not to call before; but, if I wholly neglect\nto bid him call, my time for escape will be diminished, since it will\nbe expected that I return the earlier, and my absence will the sooner\nexcite anxiety. Now, if it were my design to return at all--if I had in\ncontemplation merely a stroll with the individual in question--it would\nnot be my policy to bid St. Eustache call; for, calling, he will be sure\nto ascertain that I have played him false--a fact of which I might keep\nhim for ever in ignorance, by leaving home without notifying him of my\nintention, by returning before dark, and by then stating that I had been\nto visit my aunt in the Rue des Drômes. But, as it is my design never\nto return--or not for some weeks--or not until certain concealments are\neffected--the gaining of time is the only point about which I need give\nmyself any concern.’\n\n“You have observed, in your notes, that the most general opinion in\nrelation to this sad affair is, and was from the first, that the girl\nhad been the victim of a gang of blackguards. Now, the popular opinion,\nunder certain conditions, is not to be disregarded. When arising of\nitself--when manifesting itself in a strictly spontaneous manner--we\nshould look upon it as analogous with that _intuition_ which is the\nidiosyncrasy of the individual man of genius. In ninety-nine cases from\nthe hundred I would abide by its decision. But it is important that we\nfind no palpable traces of _suggestion_. The opinion must be rigorously\n_the public’s own_; and the distinction is often exceedingly difficult\nto perceive and to maintain. In the present instance, it appears to me\nthat this ‘public opinion’ in respect to a gang, has been superinduced\nby the collateral event which is detailed in the third of my extracts.\nAll Paris is excited by the discovered corpse of Marie, a girl young,\nbeautiful and notorious. This corpse is found, bearing marks of\nviolence, and floating in the river. But it is now made known that, at\nthe very period, or about the very period, in which it is supposed that\nthe girl was assassinated, an outrage similar in nature to that endured\nby the deceased, although less in extent, was perpetuated, by a gang\nof young ruffians, upon the person of a second young female. Is it\nwonderful that the one known atrocity should influence the popular\njudgment in regard to the other unknown? This judgment awaited\ndirection, and the known outrage seemed so opportunely to afford it!\nMarie, too, was found in the river; and upon this very river was this\nknown outrage committed. The connexion of the two events had about it so\nmuch of the palpable, that the true wonder would have been a failure\nof the populace to appreciate and to seize it. But, in fact, the one\natrocity, known to be so committed, is, if any thing, evidence that the\nother, committed at a time nearly coincident, was not so committed.\nIt would have been a miracle indeed, if, while a gang of ruffians were\nperpetrating, at a given locality, a most unheard-of wrong, there should\nhave been another similar gang, in a similar locality, in the same\ncity, under the same circumstances, with the same means and appliances,\nengaged in a wrong of precisely the same aspect, at precisely the\nsame period of time! Yet in what, if not in this marvellous train of\ncoincidence, does the accidentally suggested opinion of the populace\ncall upon us to believe?\n\n“Before proceeding farther, let us consider the supposed scene of the\nassassination, in the thicket at the Barrière du Roule. This thicket,\nalthough dense, was in the close vicinity of a public road. Within\nwere three or four large stones, forming a kind of seat with a back and\nfootstool. On the upper stone was discovered a white petticoat; on the\nsecond, a silk scarf. A parasol, gloves, and a pocket-handkerchief,\nwere also here found. The handkerchief bore the name, ‘Marie Rogêt.’\nFragments of dress were seen on the branches around. The earth was\ntrampled, the bushes were broken, and there was every evidence of a\nviolent struggle.\n\n“Notwithstanding the acclamation with which the discovery of this\nthicket was received by the press, and the unanimity with which it\nwas supposed to indicate the precise scene of the outrage, it must be\nadmitted that there was some very good reason for doubt. That it was the\nscene, I may or I may not believe--but there was excellent reason for\ndoubt. Had the true scene been, as Le Commerciel suggested, in the\nneighborhood of the Rue Pavée St. Andrée, the perpetrators of the\ncrime, supposing them still resident in Paris, would naturally have been\nstricken with terror at the public attention thus acutely directed into\nthe proper channel; and, in certain classes of minds, there would have\narisen, at once, a sense of the necessity of some exertion to redivert\nthis attention. And thus, the thicket of the Barrière du Roule having\nbeen already suspected, the idea of placing the articles where they were\nfound, might have been naturally entertained. There is no real evidence,\nalthough Le Soleil so supposes, that the articles discovered had\nbeen more than a very few days in the thicket; while there is much\ncircumstantial proof that they could not have remained there, without\nattracting attention, during the twenty days elapsing between the fatal\nSunday and the afternoon upon which they were found by the boys. ‘They\nwere all _mildewed_ down hard,’ says Le Soleil, adopting the opinions of\nits predecessors, ‘with the action of the rain, and stuck together from\n_mildew_. The grass had grown around and over some of them. The silk of\nthe parasol was strong, but the threads of it were run together within.\nThe upper part, where it had been doubled and folded, was all _mildewed_\nand rotten, and tore on being opened.’ In respect to the grass having\n‘grown around and over some of them,’ it is obvious that the fact\ncould only have been ascertained from the words, and thus from the\nrecollections, of two small boys; for these boys removed the articles\nand took them home before they had been seen by a third party. But grass\nwill grow, especially in warm and damp weather, (such as was that of the\nperiod of the murder,) as much as two or three inches in a single day.\nA parasol lying upon a newly turfed ground, might, in a single week,\nbe entirely concealed from sight by the upspringing grass. And touching\nthat mildew upon which the editor of Le Soleil so pertinaciously\ninsists, that he employs the word no less than three times in the\nbrief paragraph just quoted, is he really unaware of the nature of this\nmildew? Is he to be told that it is one of the many classes of fungus,\nof which the most ordinary feature is its upspringing and decadence\nwithin twenty-four hours?\n\n“Thus we see, at a glance, that what has been most triumphantly adduced\nin support of the idea that the articles had been ‘for at least three\nor four weeks’ in the thicket, is most absurdly null as regards any\nevidence of that fact. On the other hand, it is exceedingly difficult\nto believe that these articles could have remained in the thicket\nspecified, for a longer period than a single week--for a longer period\nthan from one Sunday to the next. Those who know any thing of the\nvicinity of Paris, know the extreme difficulty of finding seclusion\nunless at a great distance from its suburbs. Such a thing as an\nunexplored, or even an unfrequently visited recess, amid its woods or\ngroves, is not for a moment to be imagined. Let any one who, being at\nheart a lover of nature, is yet chained by duty to the dust and heat\nof this great metropolis--let any such one attempt, even during the\nweekdays, to slake his thirst for solitude amid the scenes of natural\nloveliness which immediately surround us. At every second step, he will\nfind the growing charm dispelled by the voice and personal intrusion\nof some ruffian or party of carousing blackguards. He will seek privacy\namid the densest foliage, all in vain. Here are the very nooks where the\nunwashed most abound--here are the temples most desecrate. With sickness\nof the heart the wanderer will flee back to the polluted Paris as to\na less odious because less incongruous sink of pollution. But if the\nvicinity of the city is so beset during the working days of the week,\nhow much more so on the Sabbath! It is now especially that, released\nfrom the claims of labor, or deprived of the customary opportunities of\ncrime, the town blackguard seeks the precincts of the town, not through\nlove of the rural, which in his heart he despises, but by way of escape\nfrom the restraints and conventionalities of society. He desires\nless the fresh air and the green trees, than the utter license of the\ncountry. Here, at the road-side inn, or beneath the foliage of the\nwoods, he indulges, unchecked by any eye except those of his boon\ncompanions, in all the mad excess of a counterfeit hilarity--the joint\noffspring of liberty and of rum. I say nothing more than what must\nbe obvious to every dispassionate observer, when I repeat that the\ncircumstance of the articles in question having remained undiscovered,\nfor a longer period--than from one Sunday to another, in any thicket in\nthe immediate neighborhood of Paris, is to be looked upon as little less\nthan miraculous.\n\n“But there are not wanting other grounds for the suspicion that the\narticles were placed in the thicket with the view of diverting attention\nfrom the real scene of the outrage. And, first, let me direct your\nnotice to the date of the discovery of the articles. Collate this with\nthe date of the fifth extract made by myself from the newspapers. You\nwill find that the discovery followed, almost immediately, the urgent\ncommunications sent to the evening paper. These communications, although\nvarious and apparently from various sources, tended all to the same\npoint--viz., the directing of attention to a gang as the perpetrators\nof the outrage, and to the neighborhood of the Barrière du Roule as its\nscene. Now here, of course, the suspicion is not that, in consequence of\nthese communications, or of the public attention by them directed, the\narticles were found by the boys; but the suspicion might and may well\nhave been, that the articles were not before found by the boys, for the\nreason that the articles had not before been in the thicket; having\nbeen deposited there only at so late a period as at the date, or shortly\nprior to the date of the communications by the guilty authors of these\ncommunications themselves.\n\n“This thicket was a singular--an exceedingly singular one. It was\nunusually dense. Within its naturally walled enclosure were three\nextraordinary stones, forming a seat with a back and footstool. And this\nthicket, so full of a natural art, was in the immediate vicinity, within\na few rods, of the dwelling of Madame Deluc, whose boys were in the\nhabit of closely examining the shrubberies about them in search of\nthe bark of the sassafras. Would it be a rash wager--a wager of one\nthousand to one--that a day never passed over the heads of these boys\nwithout finding at least one of them ensconced in the umbrageous hall,\nand enthroned upon its natural throne? Those who would hesitate at such\na wager, have either never been boys themselves, or have forgotten the\nboyish nature. I repeat--it is exceedingly hard to comprehend how the\narticles could have remained in this thicket undiscovered, for a longer\nperiod than one or two days; and that thus there is good ground for\nsuspicion, in spite of the dogmatic ignorance of Le Soleil, that they\nwere, at a comparatively late date, deposited where found.\n\n“But there are still other and stronger reasons for believing them so\ndeposited, than any which I have as yet urged. And, now, let me beg\nyour notice to the highly artificial arrangement of the articles. On the\nupper stone lay a white petticoat; on the second a silk scarf; scattered\naround, were a parasol, gloves, and a pocket-handkerchief bearing the\nname, ‘Marie Rogêt.’ Here is just such an arrangement as would naturally\nbe made by a not over-acute person wishing to dispose the articles\nnaturally. But it is by no means a really natural arrangement. I\nshould rather have looked to see the things all lying on the ground and\ntrampled under foot. In the narrow limits of that bower, it would have\nbeen scarcely possible that the petticoat and scarf should have retained\na position upon the stones, when subjected to the brushing to and fro\nof many struggling persons. ‘There was evidence,’ it is said, ‘of a\nstruggle; and the earth was trampled, the bushes were broken,’--but the\npetticoat and the scarf are found deposited as if upon shelves. ‘The\npieces of the frock torn out by the bushes were about three inches wide\nand six inches long. One part was the hem of the frock and it had been\nmended. They looked like strips torn off.’ Here, inadvertently, Le\nSoleil has employed an exceedingly suspicious phrase. The pieces, as\ndescribed, do indeed ‘look like strips torn off;’ but purposely and by\nhand. It is one of the rarest of accidents that a piece is ‘torn off,’\nfrom any garment such as is now in question, by the agency of a thorn.\nFrom the very nature of such fabrics, a thorn or nail becoming entangled\nin them, tears them rectangularly--divides them into two longitudinal\nrents, at right angles with each other, and meeting at an apex where the\nthorn enters--but it is scarcely possible to conceive the piece ‘torn\noff.’ I never so knew it, nor did you. To tear a piece off from such\nfabric, two distinct forces, in different directions, will be, in almost\nevery case, required. If there be two edges to the fabric--if, for\nexample, it be a pocket-handkerchief, and it is desired to tear from it\na slip, then, and then only, will the one force serve the purpose. But\nin the present case the question is of a dress, presenting but one edge.\nTo tear a piece from the interior, where no edge is presented, could\nonly be effected by a miracle through the agency of thorns, and no one\nthorn could accomplish it. But, even where an edge is presented, two\nthorns will be necessary, operating, the one in two distinct directions,\nand the other in one. And this in the supposition that the edge is\nunhemmed. If hemmed, the matter is nearly out of the question. We thus\nsee the numerous and great obstacles in the way of pieces being ‘torn\noff’ through the simple agency of ‘thorns;’ yet we are required to\nbelieve not only that one piece but that many have been so torn. ‘And\none part,’ too, ‘was the hem of the frock!’ Another piece was ‘part\nof the skirt, not the hem,’--that is to say, was torn completely out\nthrough the agency of thorns, from the uncaged interior of the\ndress! These, I say, are things which one may well be pardoned for\ndisbelieving; yet, taken collectedly, they form, perhaps, less of\nreasonable ground for suspicion, than the one startling circumstance of\nthe articles’ having been left in this thicket at all, by any murderers\nwho had enough precaution to think of removing the corpse. You will not\nhave apprehended me rightly, however, if you suppose it my design to\ndeny this thicket as the scene of the outrage. There might have been a\nwrong here, or, more possibly, an accident at Madame Deluc’s. But, in\nfact, this is a point of minor importance. We are not engaged in an\nattempt to discover the scene, but to produce the perpetrators of the\nmurder. What I have adduced, notwithstanding the minuteness with which I\nhave adduced it, has been with the view, first, to show the folly of the\npositive and headlong assertions of Le Soleil, but secondly and chiefly,\nto bring you, by the most natural route, to a further contemplation of\nthe doubt whether this assassination has, or has not been, the work of a\ngang.\n\n“We will resume this question by mere allusion to the revolting details\nof the surgeon examined at the inquest. It is only necessary to say that\nhis published inferences, in regard to the number of ruffians, have been\nproperly ridiculed as unjust and totally baseless, by all the reputable\nanatomists of Paris. Not that the matter might not have been as\ninferred, but that there was no ground for the inference:--was there not\nmuch for another?\n\n“Let us reflect now upon ‘the traces of a struggle;’ and let me ask what\nthese traces have been supposed to demonstrate. A gang. But do they not\nrather demonstrate the absence of a gang? What struggle could have taken\nplace--what struggle so violent and so enduring as to have left its\n‘traces’ in all directions--between a weak and defenceless girl and the\ngang of ruffians imagined? The silent grasp of a few rough arms and all\nwould have been over. The victim must have been absolutely passive at\ntheir will. You will here bear in mind that the arguments urged against\nthe thicket as the scene, are applicable in chief part, only against it\nas the scene of an outrage committed by more than a single individual.\nIf we imagine but one violator, we can conceive, and thus only conceive,\nthe struggle of so violent and so obstinate a nature as to have left the\n‘traces’ apparent.\n\n“And again. I have already mentioned the suspicion to be excited by the\nfact that the articles in question were suffered to remain at all in\nthe thicket where discovered. It seems almost impossible that these\nevidences of guilt should have been accidentally left where found. There\nwas sufficient presence of mind (it is supposed) to remove the corpse;\nand yet a more positive evidence than the corpse itself (whose features\nmight have been quickly obliterated by decay,) is allowed to lie\nconspicuously in the scene of the outrage--I allude to the handkerchief\nwith the name of the deceased. If this was accident, it was not\nthe accident of a gang. We can imagine it only the accident of an\nindividual. Let us see. An individual has committed the murder. He\nis alone with the ghost of the departed. He is appalled by what lies\nmotionless before him. The fury of his passion is over, and there is\nabundant room in his heart for the natural awe of the deed. His is none\nof that confidence which the presence of numbers inevitably inspires.\nHe is alone with the dead. He trembles and is bewildered. Yet there is\na necessity for disposing of the corpse. He bears it to the river, but\nleaves behind him the other evidences of guilt; for it is difficult, if\nnot impossible to carry all the burthen at once, and it will be easy to\nreturn for what is left. But in his toilsome journey to the water his\nfears redouble within him. The sounds of life encompass his path. A\ndozen times he hears or fancies the step of an observer. Even the very\nlights from the city bewilder him. Yet, in time and by long and frequent\npauses of deep agony, he reaches the river’s brink, and disposes of\nhis ghastly charge--perhaps through the medium of a boat. But now what\ntreasure does the world hold--what threat of vengeance could it hold\nout--which would have power to urge the return of that lonely murderer\nover that toilsome and perilous path, to the thicket and its blood\nchilling recollections? He returns not, let the consequences be what\nthey may. He could not return if he would. His sole thought is immediate\nescape. He turns his back forever upon those dreadful shrubberies and\nflees as from the wrath to come.\n\n“But how with a gang? Their number would have inspired them with\nconfidence; if, indeed confidence is ever wanting in the breast of the\narrant blackguard; and of arrant blackguards alone are the supposed\ngangs ever constituted. Their number, I say, would have prevented the\nbewildering and unreasoning terror which I have imagined to paralyze the\nsingle man. Could we suppose an oversight in one, or two, or three, this\noversight would have been remedied by a fourth. They would have left\nnothing behind them; for their number would have enabled them to carry\nall at once. There would have been no need of return.\n\n“Consider now the circumstance that in the outer garment of the corpse\nwhen found, ‘a slip, about a foot wide had been torn upward from the\nbottom hem to the waist wound three times round the waist, and secured\nby a sort of hitch in the back.’ This was done with the obvious design\nof affording a handle by which to carry the body. But would any number\nof men have dreamed of resorting to such an expedient? To three or four,\nthe limbs of the corpse would have afforded not only a sufficient, but\nthe best possible hold. The device is that of a single individual; and\nthis brings us to the fact that ‘between the thicket and the river, the\nrails of the fences were found taken down, and the ground bore evident\ntraces of some heavy burden having been dragged along it!’ But would a\nnumber of men have put themselves to the superfluous trouble of taking\ndown a fence, for the purpose of dragging through it a corpse which they\nmight have lifted over any fence in an instant? Would a number of men\nhave so dragged a corpse at all as to have left evident traces of the\ndragging?\n\n“And here we must refer to an observation of Le Commerciel; an\nobservation upon which I have already, in some measure, commented. ‘A\npiece,’ says this journal, ‘of one of the unfortunate girl’s petticoats\nwas torn out and tied under her chin, and around the back of her\nhead, probably to prevent screams. This was done by fellows who had no\npocket-handkerchiefs.’\n\n“I have before suggested that a genuine blackguard is never without a\npocket-handkerchief. But it is not to this fact that I now especially\nadvert. That it was not through want of a handkerchief for the purpose\nimagined by Le Commerciel, that this bandage was employed, is rendered\napparent by the handkerchief left in the thicket; and that the object\nwas not ‘to prevent screams’ appears, also, from the bandage having been\nemployed in preference to what would so much better have answered\nthe purpose. But the language of the evidence speaks of the strip in\nquestion as ‘found around the neck, fitting loosely, and secured with\na hard knot.’ These words are sufficiently vague, but differ materially\nfrom those of Le Commerciel. The slip was eighteen inches wide, and\ntherefore, although of muslin, would form a strong band when folded or\nrumpled longitudinally. And thus rumpled it was discovered. My inference\nis this. The solitary murderer, having borne the corpse, for some\ndistance, (whether from the thicket or elsewhere) by means of the\nbandage hitched around its middle, found the weight, in this mode\nof procedure, too much for his strength. He resolved to drag the\nburthen--the evidence goes to show that it was dragged. With this object\nin view, it became necessary to attach something like a rope to one of\nthe extremities. It could be best attached about the neck, where the\nhead would prevent its slipping off. And, now, the murderer bethought\nhim, unquestionably, of the bandage about the loins. He would have used\nthis, but for its volution about the corpse, the hitch which embarrassed\nit, and the reflection that it had not been ‘torn off’ from the garment.\nIt was easier to tear a new slip from the petticoat. He tore it, made\nit fast about the neck, and so dragged his victim to the brink of the\nriver. That this ‘bandage,’ only attainable with trouble and delay, and\nbut imperfectly answering its purpose--that this bandage was employed\nat all, demonstrates that the necessity for its employment sprang from\ncircumstances arising at a period when the handkerchief was no longer\nattainable--that is to say, arising, as we have imagined, after quitting\nthe thicket, (if the thicket it was), and on the road between the\nthicket and the river.\n\n“But the evidence, you will say, of Madame Deluc, (!) points especially\nto the presence of a gang, in the vicinity of the thicket, at or about\nthe epoch of the murder. This I grant. I doubt if there were not a dozen\ngangs, such as described by Madame Deluc, in and about the vicinity of\nthe Barrière du Roule at or about the period of this tragedy. But the\ngang which has drawn upon itself the pointed animadversion, although the\nsomewhat tardy and very suspicious evidence of Madame Deluc, is the\nonly gang which is represented by that honest and scrupulous old lady\nas having eaten her cakes and swallowed her brandy, without putting\nthemselves to the trouble of making her payment. Et hinc illæ iræ?\n\n“But what is the precise evidence of Madame Deluc? ‘A gang of miscreants\nmade their appearance, behaved boisterously, ate and drank without\nmaking payment, followed in the route of the young man and girl,\nreturned to the inn about dusk, and recrossed the river as if in great\nhaste.’\n\n“Now this ‘great haste’ very possibly seemed greater haste in the eyes\nof Madame Deluc, since she dwelt lingeringly and lamentingly upon her\nviolated cakes and ale--cakes and ale for which she might still have\nentertained a faint hope of compensation. Why, otherwise, since it was\nabout dusk, should she make a point of the haste? It is no cause for\nwonder, surely, that even a gang of blackguards should make haste to\nget home, when a wide river is to be crossed in small boats, when storm\nimpends, and when night approaches.\n\n“I say approaches; for the night had not yet arrived. It was only about\ndusk that the indecent haste of these ‘miscreants’ offended the sober\neyes of Madame Deluc. But we are told that it was upon this very evening\nthat Madame Deluc, as well as her eldest son, ‘heard the screams of a\nfemale in the vicinity of the inn.’ And in what words does Madame Deluc\ndesignate the period of the evening at which these screams were heard?\n‘It was soon after dark,’ she says. But ‘soon after dark,’ is, at least,\ndark; and ‘about dusk’ is as certainly daylight. Thus it is abundantly\nclear that the gang quitted the Barrière du Roule prior to the screams\noverheard (?) by Madame Deluc. And although, in all the many reports of\nthe evidence, the relative expressions in question are distinctly and\ninvariably employed just as I have employed them in this conversation\nwith yourself, no notice whatever of the gross discrepancy has, as yet,\nbeen taken by any of the public journals, or by any of the Myrmidons of\npolice.\n\n“I shall add but one to the arguments against a gang; but this one has,\nto my own understanding at least, a weight altogether irresistible.\nUnder the circumstances of large reward offered, and full pardon to\nany King’s evidence, it is not to be imagined, for a moment, that some\nmember of a gang of low ruffians, or of any body of men, would not long\nago have betrayed his accomplices. Each one of a gang so placed, is not\nso much greedy of reward, or anxious for escape, as fearful of betrayal.\nHe betrays eagerly and early that he may not himself be betrayed. That\nthe secret has not been divulged, is the very best of proof that it is,\nin fact, a secret. The horrors of this dark deed are known only to one,\nor two, living human beings, and to God.\n\n“Let us sum up now the meagre yet certain fruits of our long analysis.\nWe have attained the idea either of a fatal accident under the roof of\nMadame Deluc, or of a murder perpetrated, in the thicket at the Barrière\ndu Roule, by a lover, or at least by an intimate and secret associate of\nthe deceased. This associate is of swarthy complexion. This complexion,\nthe ‘hitch’ in the bandage, and the ‘sailor’s knot,’ with which the\nbonnet-ribbon is tied, point to a seaman. His companionship with the\ndeceased, a gay, but not an abject young girl, designates him as\nabove the grade of the common sailor. Here the well written and urgent\ncommunications to the journals are much in the way of corroboration. The\ncircumstance of the first elopement, as mentioned by Le Mercurie, tends\nto blend the idea of this seaman with that of the ‘naval officer’ who is\nfirst known to have led the unfortunate into crime.\n\n“And here, most fitly, comes the consideration of the continued\nabsence of him of the dark complexion. Let me pause to observe that the\ncomplexion of this man is dark and swarthy; it was no common swarthiness\nwhich constituted the sole point of remembrance, both as regards Valence\nand Madame Deluc. But why is this man absent? Was he murdered by the\ngang? If so, why are there only traces of the assassinated girl? The\nscene of the two outrages will naturally be supposed identical. And\nwhere is his corpse? The assassins would most probably have disposed\nof both in the same way. But it may be said that this man lives, and is\ndeterred from making himself known, through dread of being charged with\nthe murder. This consideration might be supposed to operate upon him\nnow--at this late period--since it has been given in evidence that he\nwas seen with Marie--but it would have had no force at the period of the\ndeed. The first impulse of an innocent man would have been to announce\nthe outrage, and to aid in identifying the ruffians. This policy would\nhave suggested. He had been seen with the girl. He had crossed the river\nwith her in an open ferry-boat. The denouncing of the assassins would\nhave appeared, even to an idiot, the surest and sole means of relieving\nhimself from suspicion. We cannot suppose him, on the night of the fatal\nSunday, both innocent himself and incognizant of an outrage committed.\nYet only under such circumstances is it possible to imagine that he\nwould have failed, if alive, in the denouncement of the assassins.\n\n“And what means are ours, of attaining the truth? We shall find these\nmeans multiplying and gathering distinctness as we proceed. Let us sift\nto the bottom this affair of the first elopement. Let us know the\nfull history of ‘the officer,’ with his present circumstances, and\nhis whereabouts at the precise period of the murder. Let us carefully\ncompare with each other the various communications sent to the evening\npaper, in which the object was to inculpate a gang. This done, let us\ncompare these communications, both as regards style and MS., with\nthose sent to the morning paper, at a previous period, and insisting so\nvehemently upon the guilt of Mennais. And, all this done, let us again\ncompare these various communications with the known MSS. of the officer.\nLet us endeavor to ascertain, by repeated questionings of Madame Deluc\nand her boys, as well as of the omnibus driver, Valence, something more\nof the personal appearance and bearing of the ‘man of dark complexion.’\nQueries, skilfully directed, will not fail to elicit, from some of\nthese parties, information on this particular point (or upon\nothers)--information which the parties themselves may not even be aware\nof possessing. And let us now trace the boat picked up by the bargeman\non the morning of Monday the twenty-third of June, and which was\nremoved from the barge-office, without the cognizance of the officer\nin attendance, and without the rudder, at some period prior to the\ndiscovery of the corpse. With a proper caution and perseverance we shall\ninfallibly trace this boat; for not only can the bargeman who picked\nit up identify it, but the rudder is at hand. The rudder of a sail-boat\nwould not have been abandoned, without inquiry, by one altogether at\nease in heart. And here let me pause to insinuate a question. There was\nno advertisement of the picking up of this boat. It was silently\ntaken to the barge-office, and as silently removed. But its owner or\nemployer--how happened he, at so early a period as Tuesday morning, to\nbe informed, without the agency of advertisement, of the locality of\nthe boat taken up on Monday, unless we imagine some connexion with the\nnavy--some personal permanent connexion leading to cognizance of its\nminute in interests--its petty local news?\n\n“In speaking of the lonely assassin dragging his burden to the shore,\nI have already suggested the probability of his availing himself of a\nboat. Now we are to understand that Marie Rogêt was precipitated from a\nboat. This would naturally have been the case. The corpse could not have\nbeen trusted to the shallow waters of the shore. The peculiar marks on\nthe back and shoulders of the victim tell of the bottom ribs of a boat.\nThat the body was found without weight is also corroborative of the\nidea. If thrown from the shore a weight would have been attached. We can\nonly account for its absence by supposing the murderer to have neglected\nthe precaution of supplying himself with it before pushing off. In the\nact of consigning the corpse to the water, he would unquestionably have\nnoticed his oversight; but then no remedy would have been at hand.\nAny risk would have been preferred to a return to that accursed shore.\nHaving rid himself of his ghastly charge, the murderer would have\nhastened to the city. There, at some obscure wharf, he would have leaped\non land. But the boat--would he have secured it? He would have been\nin too great haste for such things as securing a boat. Moreover, in\nfastening it to the wharf, he would have felt as if securing evidence\nagainst himself. His natural thought would have been to cast from him,\nas far as possible, all that had held connection with his crime. He\nwould not only have fled from the wharf, but he would not have permitted\nthe boat to remain. Assuredly he would have cast it adrift. Let us\npursue our fancies.--In the morning, the wretch is stricken with\nunutterable horror at finding that the boat has been picked up and\ndetained at a locality which he is in the daily habit of frequenting\n--at a locality, perhaps, which his duty compels him to frequent. The\nnext night, without daring to ask for the rudder, he removes it. Now\nwhere is that rudderless boat? Let it be one of our first purposes\nto discover. With the first glimpse we obtain of it, the dawn of our\nsuccess shall begin. This boat shall guide us, with a rapidity which\nwill surprise even ourselves, to him who employed it in the midnight of\nthe fatal Sabbath. Corroboration will rise upon corroboration, and the\nmurderer will be traced.”\n\n[For reasons which we shall not specify, but which to many readers will\nappear obvious, we have taken the liberty of here omitting, from the\nMSS. placed in our hands, such portion as details the following up of\nthe apparently slight clew obtained by Dupin. We feel it advisable only\nto state, in brief, that the result desired was brought to pass; and\nthat the Prefect fulfilled punctually, although with reluctance, the\nterms of his compact with the Chevalier. Mr. Poe’s article concludes\nwith the following words.--Eds. (*23)]\n\nIt will be understood that I speak of coincidences and no more. What\nI have said above upon this topic must suffice. In my own heart there\ndwells no faith in præter-nature. That Nature and its God are two, no\nman who thinks, will deny. That the latter, creating the former, can, at\nwill, control or modify it, is also unquestionable. I say “at will;” for\nthe question is of will, and not, as the insanity of logic has assumed,\nof power. It is not that the Deity cannot modify his laws, but that we\ninsult him in imagining a possible necessity for modification. In their\norigin these laws were fashioned to embrace all contingencies which\ncould lie in the Future. With God all is Now.\n\nI repeat, then, that I speak of these things only as of coincidences.\nAnd farther: in what I relate it will be seen that between the fate of\nthe unhappy Mary Cecilia Rogers, so far as that fate is known, and the\nfate of one Marie Rogêt up to a certain epoch in her history, there has\nexisted a parallel in the contemplation of whose wonderful exactitude\nthe reason becomes embarrassed. I say all this will be seen. But let it\nnot for a moment be supposed that, in proceeding with the sad narrative\nof Marie from the epoch just mentioned, and in tracing to its dénouement\nthe mystery which enshrouded her, it is my covert design to hint at an\nextension of the parallel, or even to suggest that the measures adopted\nin Paris for the discovery of the assassin of a grisette, or measures\nfounded in any similar ratiocination, would produce any similar result.\n\nFor, in respect to the latter branch of the supposition, it should be\nconsidered that the most trifling variation in the facts of the\ntwo cases might give rise to the most important miscalculations,\nby diverting thoroughly the two courses of events; very much as,\nin arithmetic, an error which, in its own individuality, may be\ninappreciable, produces, at length, by dint of multiplication at all\npoints of the process, a result enormously at variance with truth. And,\nin regard to the former branch, we must not fail to hold in view that\nthe very Calculus of Probabilities to which I have referred, forbids all\nidea of the extension of the parallel:--forbids it with a positiveness\nstrong and decided just in proportion as this parallel has already been\nlong-drawn and exact. This is one of those anomalous propositions which,\nseemingly appealing to thought altogether apart from the mathematical,\nis yet one which only the mathematician can fully entertain. Nothing,\nfor example, is more difficult than to convince the merely general\nreader that the fact of sixes having been thrown twice in succession by\na player at dice, is sufficient cause for betting the largest odds that\nsixes will not be thrown in the third attempt. A suggestion to this\neffect is usually rejected by the intellect at once. It does not\nappear that the two throws which have been completed, and which lie now\nabsolutely in the Past, can have influence upon the throw which exists\nonly in the Future. The chance for throwing sixes seems to be precisely\nas it was at any ordinary time--that is to say, subject only to the\ninfluence of the various other throws which may be made by the dice. And\nthis is a reflection which appears so exceedingly obvious that attempts\nto controvert it are received more frequently with a derisive smile\nthan with anything like respectful attention. The error here involved--a\ngross error redolent of mischief--I cannot pretend to expose within the\nlimits assigned me at present; and with the philosophical it needs\nno exposure. It may be sufficient here to say that it forms one of an\ninfinite series of mistakes which arise in the path of Reason through\nher propensity for seeking truth in detail.\n\nFootnotes--Marie Rogêt\n\n(*1) Upon the original publication of “Marie Roget,” the foot-notes now\nappended were considered unnecessary; but the lapse of several years\nsince the tragedy upon which the tale is based, renders it expedient\nto give them, and also to say a few words in explanation of the general\ndesign. A young girl, Mary Cecilia Rogers, was murdered in the\nvicinity of New York; and, although her death occasioned an intense and\nlong-enduring excitement, the mystery attending it had remained\nunsolved at the period when the present paper was written and published\n(November, 1842). Herein, under pretence of relating the fate of\na Parisian grisette, the author has followed in minute detail, the\nessential, while merely paralleling the inessential facts of the real\nmurder of Mary Rogers. Thus all argument founded upon the fiction is\napplicable to the truth: and the investigation of the truth was the\nobject. The “Mystery of Marie Roget” was composed at a distance from the\nscene of the atrocity, and with no other means of investigation than the\nnewspapers afforded. Thus much escaped the writer of which he could have\navailed himself had he been upon the spot, and visited the localities.\nIt may not be improper to record, nevertheless, that the confessions of\ntwo persons, (one of them the Madame Deluc of the narrative) made, at\ndifferent periods, long subsequent to the publication, confirmed, in\nfull, not only the general conclusion, but absolutely all the chief\nhypothetical details by which that conclusion was attained.\n\n(*2) The nom de plume of Von Hardenburg.\n\n(*3) Nassau Street.\n\n(*4) Anderson.\n\n(*5) The Hudson.\n\n(*6) Weehawken.\n\n(*7) Payne.\n\n(*8) Crommelin.\n\n(*9) The New York “Mercury.”\n\n(*10) The New York “Brother Jonathan,” edited by H.

Signal Triumph of Mr. Monck Mason’s Flying\n Machine!--Arrival at Sullivan’s Island, near Charlestown, S.C., of\n Mr. Mason, Mr. Robert Holland, Mr. Henson, Mr. Harrison Ainsworth,\n and four others, in the Steering Balloon, “Victoria,” after a passage\n of Seventy-five Hours from Land to Land!  Full Particulars of the\n Voyage!\n\n The subjoined _jeu d’esprit_ with the preceding heading in\n magnificent capitals, well interspersed with notes of admiration, was\n originally published, as matter of fact, in the “New York Sun,” a\n daily newspaper, and therein fully subserved the purpose of creating\n indigestible aliment for the _quidnuncs_ during the few hours\n intervening between a couple of the Charleston mails.  The rush for\n the “sole paper which had the news,” was something beyond even the\n prodigious;  and, in fact, if (as some assert) the “Victoria” _did_\n not absolutely accomplish the voyage recorded, it will be difficult\n to assign a reason why she _should_ not have accomplished it.]\n\nTHE great problem is at length solved! The air, as well as the earth\nand the ocean, has been subdued by science, and will become a common and\nconvenient highway for mankind. _The Atlantic has been actually crossed\nin a Balloon!_ and this too without difficulty--without any great\napparent danger--with thorough control of the machine--and in the\ninconceivably brief period of seventy-five hours from shore to shore!\nBy the energy of an agent at Charleston, S.C., we are enabled to be\nthe first to furnish the public with a detailed account of this most\nextraordinary voyage, which was performed between Saturday, the 6th\ninstant, at 11, A.M., and 2, P.M., on Tuesday, the 9th instant, by Sir\nEverard Bringhurst; Mr. Osborne, a nephew of Lord Bentinck’s; Mr. Monck\nMason and Mr. Robert Holland, the well-known æronauts; Mr. Harrison\nAinsworth, author of “Jack Sheppard,” &c.; and Mr. Henson, the\nprojector of the late unsuccessful flying machine--with two seamen from\nWoolwich--in all, eight persons. The particulars furnished below may be\nrelied on as authentic and accurate in every respect, as, with a slight\nexception, they are copied _verbatim_ from the joint diaries of Mr.\nMonck Mason and Mr. Harrison Ainsworth, to whose politeness our agent is\nalso indebted for much verbal information respecting the balloon itself,\nits construction, and other matters of interest. The only alteration in\nthe MS. received, has been made for the purpose of throwing the hurried\naccount of our agent, Mr. Forsyth, into a connected and intelligible\nform.\n\n“THE BALLOON.\n\n“Two very decided failures, of late--those of Mr. Henson and Sir George\nCayley--had much weakened the public interest in the subject of aerial\nnavigation. Mr. Henson’s scheme (which at first was considered very\nfeasible even by men of science,) was founded upon the principle of an\ninclined plane, started from an eminence by an extrinsic force, applied\nand continued by the revolution of impinging vanes, in form and number\nresembling the vanes of a windmill. But, in all the experiments made\nwith models at the Adelaide Gallery, it was found that the operation of\nthese fans not only did not propel the machine, but actually impeded\nits flight. The only propelling force it ever exhibited, was the mere\n_impetus_ acquired from the descent of the inclined plane; and this\n_impetus_ carried the machine farther when the vanes were at rest, than\nwhen they were in motion--a fact which sufficiently demonstrates their\ninutility; and in the absence of the propelling, which was also the\n_sustaining_ power, the whole fabric would necessarily descend.\nThis consideration led Sir George Cayley to think only of adapting\na propeller to some machine having of itself an independent power of\nsupport--in a word, to a balloon; the idea, however, being novel,\nor original, with Sir George, only so far as regards the mode of its\napplication to practice. He exhibited a model of his invention at the\nPolytechnic Institution. The propelling principle, or power, was here,\nalso, applied to interrupted surfaces, or vanes, put in revolution.\nThese vanes were four in number, but were found entirely ineffectual in\nmoving the balloon, or in aiding its ascending power. The whole project\nwas thus a complete failure.\n\n“It was at this juncture that Mr. Monck Mason (whose voyage from Dover\nto Weilburg in the balloon, “Nassau,” occasioned so much excitement in\n1837,) conceived the idea of employing the principle of the Archimedean\nscrew for the purpose of propulsion through the air--rightly\nattributing the failure of Mr. Henson’s scheme, and of Sir George\nCayley’s, to the interruption of surface in the independent vanes.\nHe made the first public experiment at Willis’s Rooms, but afterward\nremoved his model to the Adelaide Gallery.\n\n“Like Sir George Cayley’s balloon, his own was an ellipsoid. Its\nlength was thirteen feet six inches--height, six feet eight inches. It\ncontained about three hundred and twenty cubic feet of gas, which, if\npure hydrogen, would support twenty-one pounds upon its first inflation,\nbefore the gas has time to deteriorate or escape. The weight of the\nwhole machine and apparatus was seventeen pounds--leaving about four\npounds to spare. Beneath the centre of the balloon, was a frame of light\nwood, about nine feet long, and rigged on to the balloon itself with\na network in the customary manner. From this framework was suspended a\nwicker basket or car.\n\n“The screw consists of an axis of hollow brass tube, eighteen inches in\nlength, through which, upon a semi-spiral inclined at fifteen degrees,\npass a series of steel wire radii, two feet long, and thus projecting a\nfoot on either side. These radii are connected at the outer extremities\nby two bands of flattened wire--the whole in this manner forming the\nframework of the screw, which is completed by a covering of oiled silk\ncut into gores, and tightened so as to present a tolerably uniform\nsurface. At each end of its axis this screw is supported by pillars of\nhollow brass tube descending from the hoop. In the lower ends of these\ntubes are holes in which the pivots of the axis revolve. From the end\nof the axis which is next the car, proceeds a shaft of steel, connecting\nthe screw with the pinion of a piece of spring machinery fixed in the\ncar. By the operation of this spring, the screw is made to revolve with\ngreat rapidity, communicating a progressive motion to the whole. By\nmeans of the rudder, the machine was readily turned in any direction.\nThe spring was of great power, compared with its dimensions, being\ncapable of raising forty-five pounds upon a barrel of four inches\ndiameter, after the first turn, and gradually increasing as it was wound\nup. It weighed, altogether, eight pounds six ounces. The rudder was\na light frame of cane covered with silk, shaped somewhat like a\nbattle-door, and was about three feet long, and at the widest, one foot.\nIts weight was about two ounces. It could be turned _flat_, and directed\nupwards or downwards, as well as to the right or left; and thus enabled\nthe æronaut to transfer the resistance of the air which in an inclined\nposition it must generate in its passage, to any side upon which he\nmight desire to act; thus determining the balloon in the opposite\ndirection.\n\n“This model (which, through want of time, we have necessarily described\nin an imperfect manner,) was put in action at the Adelaide Gallery,\nwhere it accomplished a velocity of five miles per hour; although,\nstrange to say, it excited very little interest in comparison with the\nprevious complex machine of Mr. Henson--so resolute is the world\nto despise anything which carries with it an air of simplicity. To\naccomplish the great desideratum of ærial navigation, it was very\ngenerally supposed that some exceedingly complicated application must be\nmade of some unusually profound principle in dynamics.\n\n“So well satisfied, however, was Mr. Mason of the ultimate success of\nhis invention, that he determined to construct immediately, if possible,\na balloon of sufficient capacity to test the question by a voyage of\nsome extent--the original design being to cross the British Channel, as\nbefore, in the Nassau balloon. To carry out his views, he solicited and\nobtained the patronage of Sir Everard Bringhurst and Mr. Osborne, two\ngentlemen well known for scientific acquirement, and especially for the\ninterest they have exhibited in the progress of ærostation. The project,\nat the desire of Mr. Osborne, was kept a profound secret from the\npublic--the only persons entrusted with the design being those actually\nengaged in the construction of the machine, which was built (under the\nsuperintendence of Mr. Mason, Mr. Holland, Sir Everard Bringhurst, and\nMr. Osborne,) at the seat of the latter gentleman near Penstruthal, in\nWales. Mr. Henson, accompanied by his friend Mr. Ainsworth, was admitted\nto a private view of the balloon, on Saturday last--when the two\ngentlemen made final arrangements to be included in the adventure. We\nare not informed for what reason the two seamen were also included in\nthe party--but, in the course of a day or two, we shall put our readers\nin possession of the minutest particulars respecting this extraordinary\nvoyage.\n\n“The balloon is composed of silk, varnished with the liquid gum\ncaoutchouc. It is of vast dimensions, containing more than 40,000 cubic\nfeet of gas; but as coal gas was employed in place of the more expensive\nand inconvenient hydrogen, the supporting power of the machine, when\nfully inflated, and immediately after inflation, is not more than about\n2500 pounds. The coal gas is not only much less costly, but is easily\nprocured and managed.\n\n“For its introduction into common use for purposes of aerostation, we\nare indebted to Mr. Charles Green. Up to his discovery, the process of\ninflation was not only exceedingly expensive, but uncertain. Two, and\neven three days, have frequently been wasted in futile attempts to\nprocure a sufficiency of hydrogen to fill a balloon, from which it\nhad great tendency to escape, owing to its extreme subtlety, and its\naffinity for the surrounding atmosphere. In a balloon sufficiently\nperfect to retain its contents of coal-gas unaltered, in quantity or\namount, for six months, an equal quantity of hydrogen could not be\nmaintained in equal purity for six weeks.\n\n“The supporting power being estimated at 2500 pounds, and the united\nweights of the party amounting only to about 1200, there was left a\nsurplus of 1300, of which again 1200 was exhausted by ballast, arranged\nin bags of different sizes, with their respective weights marked upon\nthem--by cordage, barometers, telescopes, barrels containing provision\nfor a fortnight, water-casks, cloaks, carpet-bags, and various other\nindispensable matters, including a coffee-warmer, contrived for warming\ncoffee by means of slack-lime, so as to dispense altogether with fire,\nif it should be judged prudent to do so. All these articles, with the\nexception of the ballast, and a few trifles, were suspended from the\nhoop overhead. The car is much smaller and lighter, in proportion, than\nthe one appended to the model. It is formed of a light wicker, and is\nwonderfully strong, for so frail looking a machine. Its rim is about\nfour feet deep. The rudder is also very much larger, in proportion, than\nthat of the model; and the screw is considerably smaller. The balloon is\nfurnished besides with a grapnel, and a guide-rope; which latter is of\nthe most indispensable importance. A few words, in explanation, will\nhere be necessary for such of our readers as are not conversant with the\ndetails of aerostation.\n\n“As soon as the balloon quits the earth, it is subjected to the\ninfluence of many circumstances tending to create a difference in its\nweight; augmenting or diminishing its ascending power. For example,\nthere may be a deposition of dew upon the silk, to the extent, even,\nof several hundred pounds; ballast has then to be thrown out, or the\nmachine may descend. This ballast being discarded, and a clear sunshine\nevaporating the dew, and at the same time expanding the gas in the silk,\nthe whole will again rapidly ascend. To check this ascent, the only\nrecourse is, (or rather _was_, until Mr. Green’s invention of the\nguide-rope,) the permission of the escape of gas from the valve; but, in\nthe loss of gas, is a proportionate general loss of ascending power; so\nthat, in a comparatively brief period, the best-constructed balloon must\nnecessarily exhaust all its resources, and come to the earth. This was\nthe great obstacle to voyages of length.\n\n“The guide-rope remedies the difficulty in the simplest manner\nconceivable. It is merely a very long rope which is suffered to trail\nfrom the car, and the effect of which is to prevent the balloon from\nchanging its level in any material degree. If, for example, there should\nbe a deposition of moisture upon the silk, and the machine begins to\ndescend in consequence, there will be no necessity for discharging\nballast to remedy the increase of weight, for it is remedied, or\ncounteracted, in an exactly just proportion, by the deposit on the\nground of just so much of the end of the rope as is necessary. If,\non the other hand, any circumstances should cause undue levity, and\nconsequent ascent, this levity is immediately counteracted by the\nadditional weight of rope upraised from the earth. Thus, the balloon\ncan neither ascend or descend, except within very narrow limits, and its\nresources, either in gas or ballast, remain comparatively unimpaired.\nWhen passing over an expanse of water, it becomes necessary to employ\nsmall kegs of copper or wood, filled with liquid ballast of a lighter\nnature than water. These float, and serve all the purposes of a mere\nrope on land. Another most important office of the guide-rope, is to\npoint out the _direction_ of the balloon. The rope _drags_, either on\nland or sea, while the balloon is free; the latter, consequently, is\nalways in advance, when any progress whatever is made: a comparison,\ntherefore, by means of the compass, of the relative positions of the two\nobjects, will always indicate the _course_. In the same way, the angle\nformed by the rope with the vertical axis of the machine, indicates\nthe _velocity_. When there is _no_ angle--in other words, when the rope\nhangs perpendicularly, the whole apparatus is stationary; but the larger\nthe angle, that is to say, the farther the balloon precedes the end of\nthe rope, the greater the velocity; and the converse.\n\n“As the original design was to cross the British Channel, and alight as\nnear Paris as possible, the voyagers had taken the precaution to prepare\nthemselves with passports directed to all parts of the Continent,\nspecifying the nature of the expedition, as in the case of the Nassau\nvoyage, and entitling the adventurers to exemption from the usual\nformalities of office: unexpected events, however, rendered these\npassports superfluous.\n\n“The inflation was commenced very quietly at daybreak, on Saturday\nmorning, the 6th instant, in the Court-Yard of Weal-Vor House, Mr.\nOsborne’s seat, about a mile from Penstruthal, in North Wales; and at 7\nminutes past 11, every thing being ready for departure, the balloon was\nset free, rising gently but steadily, in a direction nearly South; no\nuse being made, for the first half hour, of either the screw or the\nrudder. We proceed now with the journal, as transcribed by Mr. Forsyth\nfrom the joint MSS. Of Mr. Monck Mason, and Mr. Ainsworth. The body of\nthe journal, as given, is in the hand-writing of Mr. Mason, and a P.\nS. is appended, each day, by Mr. Ainsworth, who has in preparation, and\nwill shortly give the public a more minute, and no doubt, a thrillingly\ninteresting account of the voyage.\n\n“THE JOURNAL.\n\n“_Saturday, April the 6th_.--Every preparation likely to embarrass us,\nhaving been made over night, we commenced the inflation this morning at\ndaybreak; but owing to a thick fog, which encumbered the folds of the\nsilk and rendered it unmanageable, we did not get through before nearly\neleven o’clock. Cut loose, then, in high spirits, and rose gently but\nsteadily, with a light breeze at North, which bore us in the direction\nof the British Channel. Found the ascending force greater than we had\nexpected; and as we arose higher and so got clear of the cliffs, and\nmore in the sun’s rays, our ascent became very rapid. I did not wish,\nhowever, to lose gas at so early a period of the adventure, and so\nconcluded to ascend for the present. We soon ran out our guide-rope;\nbut even when we had raised it clear of the earth, we still went up very\nrapidly. The balloon was unusually steady, and looked beautifully. In\nabout ten minutes after starting, the barometer indicated an altitude\nof 15,000 feet. The weather was remarkably fine, and the view of the\nsubjacent country--a most romantic one when seen from any point,--was\nnow especially sublime. The numerous deep gorges presented the\nappearance of lakes, on account of the dense vapors with which they\nwere filled, and the pinnacles and crags to the South East, piled in\ninextricable confusion, resembling nothing so much as the giant cities\nof eastern fable. We were rapidly approaching the mountains in the\nSouth; but our elevation was more than sufficient to enable us to pass\nthem in safety. In a few minutes we soared over them in fine style; and\nMr. Ainsworth, with the seamen, was surprised at their apparent want of\naltitude when viewed from the car, the tendency of great elevation in a\nballoon being to reduce inequalities of the surface below, to nearly\na dead level. At half-past eleven still proceeding nearly South, we\nobtained our first view of the Bristol Channel; and, in fifteen minutes\nafterward, the line of breakers on the coast appeared immediately\nbeneath us, and we were fairly out at sea. We now resolved to let off\nenough gas to bring our guide-rope, with the buoys affixed, into the\nwater. This was immediately done, and we commenced a gradual descent.\nIn about twenty minutes our first buoy dipped, and at the touch of the\nsecond soon afterwards, we remained stationary as to elevation. We were\nall now anxious to test the efficiency of the rudder and screw, and we\nput them both into requisition forthwith, for the purpose of altering\nour direction more to the eastward, and in a line for Paris. By means of\nthe rudder we instantly effected the necessary change of direction, and\nour course was brought nearly at right angles to that of the wind; when\nwe set in motion the spring of the screw, and were rejoiced to find it\npropel us readily as desired. Upon this we gave nine hearty cheers, and\ndropped in the sea a bottle, enclosing a slip of parchment with a brief\naccount of the principle of the invention. Hardly, however, had we\ndone with our rejoicings, when an unforeseen accident occurred which\ndiscouraged us in no little degree. The steel rod connecting the spring\nwith the propeller was suddenly jerked out of place, at the car end, (by\na swaying of the car through some movement of one of the two seamen we\nhad taken up,) and in an instant hung dangling out of reach, from the\npivot of the axis of the screw. While we were endeavoring to regain it,\nour attention being completely absorbed, we became involved in a strong\ncurrent of wind from the East, which bore us, with rapidly increasing\nforce, towards the Atlantic. We soon found ourselves driving out to sea\nat the rate of not less, certainly, than fifty or sixty miles an hour,\nso that we came up with Cape Clear, at some forty miles to our North,\nbefore we had secured the rod, and had time to think what we were about.\nIt was now that Mr. Ainsworth made an extraordinary, but to my fancy,\na by no means unreasonable or chimerical proposition, in which he was\ninstantly seconded by Mr. Holland--viz.: that we should take advantage\nof the strong gale which bore us on, and in place of beating back to\nParis, make an attempt to reach the coast of North America. After slight\nreflection I gave a willing assent to this bold proposition, which\n(strange to say) met with objection from the two seamen only. As the\nstronger party, however, we overruled their fears, and kept resolutely\nupon our course. We steered due West; but as the trailing of the buoys\nmaterially impeded our progress, and we had the balloon abundantly at\ncommand, either for ascent or descent, we first threw out fifty pounds\nof ballast, and then wound up (by means of a windlass) so much of the\nrope as brought it quite clear of the sea. We perceived the effect of\nthis manoeuvre immediately, in a vastly increased rate of progress; and,\nas the gale freshened, we flew with a velocity nearly inconceivable; the\nguide-rope flying out behind the car, like a streamer from a vessel. It\nis needless to say that a very short time sufficed us to lose sight of\nthe coast. We passed over innumerable vessels of all kinds, a few of\nwhich were endeavoring to beat up, but the most of them lying to. We\noccasioned the greatest excitement on board all--an excitement greatly\nrelished by ourselves, and especially by our two men, who, now under the\ninfluence of a dram of Geneva, seemed resolved to give all scruple, or\nfear, to the wind. Many of the vessels fired signal guns; and in all\nwe were saluted with loud cheers (which we heard with surprising\ndistinctness) and the waving of caps and handkerchiefs. We kept on in\nthis manner throughout the day, with no material incident, and, as\nthe shades of night closed around us, we made a rough estimate of the\ndistance traversed. It could not have been less than five hundred\nmiles, and was probably much more. The propeller was kept in constant\noperation, and, no doubt, aided our progress materially. As the sun\nwent down, the gale freshened into an absolute hurricane, and the ocean\nbeneath was clearly visible on account of its phosphorescence. The wind\nwas from the East all night, and gave us the brightest omen of success.\nWe suffered no little from cold, and the dampness of the atmosphere was\nmost unpleasant; but the ample space in the car enabled us to lie down,\nand by means of cloaks and a few blankets, we did sufficiently well.\n\n“P.S. (by Mr. Ainsworth.) The last nine hours have been unquestionably\nthe most exciting of my life. I can conceive nothing more sublimating\nthan the strange peril and novelty of an adventure such as this. May\nGod grant that we succeed! I ask not success for mere safety to my\ninsignificant person, but for the sake of human knowledge and--for the\nvastness of the triumph. And yet the feat is only so evidently feasible\nthat the sole wonder is why men have scrupled to attempt it before. One\nsingle gale such as now befriends us--let such a tempest whirl forward\na balloon for four or five days (these gales often last longer) and the\nvoyager will be easily borne, in that period, from coast to coast. In\nview of such a gale the broad Atlantic becomes a mere lake. I am more\nstruck, just now, with the supreme silence which reigns in the\nsea beneath us, notwithstanding its agitation, than with any other\nphenomenon presenting itself. The waters give up no voice to\nthe heavens. The immense flaming ocean writhes and is tortured\nuncomplainingly. The mountainous surges suggest the idea of innumerable\ndumb gigantic fiends struggling in impotent agony. In a night such as is\nthis to me, a man _lives_--lives a whole century of ordinary life--nor\nwould I forego this rapturous delight for that of a whole century of\nordinary existence.\n\n“_Sunday, the seventh_. [Mr. Mason’s MS.] This morning the gale, by 10,\nhad subsided to an eight or nine--knot breeze, (for a vessel at sea,)\nand bears us, perhaps, thirty miles per hour, or more. It has veered,\nhowever, very considerably to the north; and now, at sundown, we are\nholding our course due west, principally by the screw and rudder, which\nanswer their purposes to admiration. I regard the project as thoroughly\nsuccessful, and the easy navigation of the air in any direction (not\nexactly in the teeth of a gale) as no longer problematical. We could not\nhave made head against the strong wind of yesterday; but, by ascending,\nwe might have got out of its influence, if requisite. Against a pretty\nstiff breeze, I feel convinced, we can make our way with the propeller.\nAt noon, to-day, ascended to an elevation of nearly 25,000 feet, by\ndischarging ballast. Did this to search for a more direct current, but\nfound none so favorable as the one we are now in. We have an abundance\nof gas to take us across this small pond, even should the voyage\nlast three weeks. I have not the slightest fear for the result. The\ndifficulty has been strangely exaggerated and misapprehended. I can\nchoose my current, and should I find _all_ currents against me, I can\nmake very tolerable headway with the propeller. We have had no incidents\nworth recording. The night promises fair.\n\nP.S. [By Mr. Ainsworth.] I have little to record, except the fact (to me\nquite a surprising one) that, at an elevation equal to that of Cotopaxi,\nI experienced neither very intense cold, nor headache, nor difficulty\nof breathing; neither, I find, did Mr. Mason, nor Mr. Holland, nor Sir\nEverard. Mr. Osborne complained of constriction of the chest--but this\nsoon wore off. We have flown at a great rate during the day, and we\nmust be more than half way across the Atlantic. We have passed over\nsome twenty or thirty vessels of various kinds, and all seem to be\ndelightfully astonished. Crossing the ocean in a balloon is not so\ndifficult a feat after all. _Omne ignotum pro magnifico. Mem:_ at\n25,000 feet elevation the sky appears nearly black, and the stars are\ndistinctly visible; while the sea does not seem convex (as one might\nsuppose) but absolutely and most unequivocally _concave_.(*1)\n\n“_Monday, the 8th_. [Mr. Mason’s MS.] This morning we had again some\nlittle trouble with the rod of the propeller, which must be entirely\nremodelled, for fear of serious accident--I mean the steel rod--not\nthe vanes. The latter could not be improved. The wind has been blowing\nsteadily and strongly from the north-east all day and so far fortune\nseems bent upon favoring us. Just before day, we were all somewhat\nalarmed at some odd noises and concussions in the balloon, accompanied\nwith the apparent rapid subsidence of the whole machine. These phenomena\nwere occasioned by the expansion of the gas, through increase of heat in\nthe atmosphere, and the consequent disruption of the minute particles of\nice with which the network had become encrusted during the night. Threw\ndown several bottles to the vessels below. Saw one of them picked up by\na large ship--seemingly one of the New York line packets. Endeavored to\nmake out her name, but could not be sure of it. Mr. Osborne’s telescope\nmade it out something like “Atalanta.” It is now 12, at night, and we\nare still going nearly west, at a rapid pace. The sea is peculiarly\nphosphorescent.\n\n“P.S. [By Mr. Ainsworth.] It is now 2, A.M., and nearly calm, as well as\nI can judge--but it is very difficult to determine this point, since\nwe move _with_ the air so completely. I have not slept since quitting\nWheal-Vor, but can stand it no longer, and must take a nap. We cannot be\nfar from the American coast.\n\n“_Tuesday, the _9_th_. [Mr. Ainsworth’s MS.] _One, P.M. We are in\nfull view of the low coast of South Carolina_. The great problem is\naccomplished. We have crossed the Atlantic--fairly and _easily_\ncrossed it in a balloon! God be praised! Who shall say that anything is\nimpossible hereafter?”\n\nThe Journal here ceases. Some particulars of the descent were\ncommunicated, however, by Mr. Ainsworth to Mr. Forsyth. It was nearly\ndead calm when the voyagers first came in view of the coast, which\nwas immediately recognized by both the seamen, and by Mr. Osborne.\nThe latter gentleman having acquaintances at Fort Moultrie, it was\nimmediately resolved to descend in its vicinity. The balloon was brought\nover the beach (the tide being out and the sand hard, smooth, and\nadmirably adapted for a descent,) and the grapnel let go, which took\nfirm hold at once. The inhabitants of the island, and of the fort,\nthronged out, of course, to see the balloon; but it was with the\ngreatest difficulty that any one could be made to credit the actual\nvoyage--_the crossing of the Atlantic_. The grapnel caught at 2, P.M.,\nprecisely; and thus the whole voyage was completed in seventy-five\nhours; or rather less, counting from shore to shore. No serious accident\noccurred. No real danger was at any time apprehended. The balloon was\nexhausted and secured without trouble; and when the MS.  from which this\nnarrative is compiled was despatched from Charleston, the party were\nstill at Fort Moultrie. Their farther intentions were not ascertained;\nbut we can safely promise our readers some additional information either\non Monday or in the course of the next day, at farthest.\n\nThis is unquestionably the most stupendous, the most interesting, and\nthe most important undertaking, ever accomplished or even attempted by\nman. What magnificent events may ensue, it would be useless now to think\nof determining.\n\n(*1) _Note_.--Mr. Ainsworth has not attempted to account for this\nphenomenon, which, however, is quite susceptible of explanation. A line\ndropped from an elevation of 25,000 feet, perpendicularly to the surface\nof the earth (or sea), would form the perpendicular of a right-angled\ntriangle, of which the base would extend from the right angle to the\nhorizon, and the hypothenuse from the horizon to the balloon. But the\n25,000 feet of altitude is little or nothing, in comparison with the\nextent of the prospect. In other words, the base and hypothenuse of the\nsupposed triangle would be so long when compared with the perpendicular,\nthat the two former may be regarded as nearly parallel. In this manner\nthe horizon of the æronaut would appear to be _on a level_ with the\ncar. But, as the point immediately beneath him seems, and is, at a great\ndistance below him, it seems, of course, also, at a great distance below\nthe horizon. Hence the impression of _concavity_; and this impression\nmust remain, until the elevation shall bear so great a proportion to\nthe extent of prospect, that the apparent parallelism of the base and\nhypothenuse disappears--when the earth’s real convexity must become\napparent.\n\n\n\n\nMS. FOUND IN A BOTTLE\n\n               Qui n’a plus qu’un moment a vivre\n\n               N’a plus rien a dissimuler.\n\n                            --Quinault--Atys.\n\nOF my country and of my family I have little to say. Ill usage and\nlength of years have driven me from the one, and estranged me from the\nother. Hereditary wealth afforded me an education of no common order,\nand a contemplative turn of mind enabled me to methodize the stores\nwhich early study very diligently garnered up.--Beyond all things,\nthe study of the German moralists gave me great delight; not from any\nill-advised admiration of their eloquent madness, but from the ease with\nwhich my habits of rigid thought enabled me to detect their falsities.\nI have often been reproached with the aridity of my genius; a deficiency\nof imagination has been imputed to me as a crime; and the Pyrrhonism\nof my opinions has at all times rendered me notorious. Indeed, a strong\nrelish for physical philosophy has, I fear, tinctured my mind with\na very common error of this age--I mean the habit of referring\noccurrences, even the least susceptible of such reference, to the\nprinciples of that science. Upon the whole, no person could be less\nliable than myself to be led away from the severe precincts of truth by\nthe ignes fatui of superstition. I have thought proper to premise thus\nmuch, lest the incredible tale I have to tell should be considered\nrather the raving of a crude imagination, than the positive experience\nof a mind to which the reveries of fancy have been a dead letter and a\nnullity.\n\nAfter many years spent in foreign travel, I sailed in the year 18-- ,\nfrom the port of Batavia, in the rich and populous island of Java, on\na voyage to the Archipelago of the Sunda islands. I went as\npassenger--having no other inducement than a kind of nervous\nrestlessness which haunted me as a fiend.\n\nOur vessel was a beautiful ship of about four hundred tons,\ncopper-fastened, and built at Bombay of Malabar teak. She was freighted\nwith cotton-wool and oil, from the Lachadive islands. We had also on\nboard coir, jaggeree, ghee, cocoa-nuts, and a few cases of opium. The\nstowage was clumsily done, and the vessel consequently crank.\n\nWe got under way with a mere breath of wind, and for many days stood\nalong the eastern coast of Java, without any other incident to beguile\nthe monotony of our course than the occasional meeting with some of the\nsmall grabs of the Archipelago to which we were bound.\n\nOne evening, leaning over the taffrail, I observed a very singular,\nisolated cloud, to the N.W. It was remarkable, as well for its color, as\nfrom its being the first we had seen since our departure from Batavia.\nI watched it attentively until sunset, when it spread all at once to\nthe eastward and westward, girting in the horizon with a narrow strip\nof vapor, and looking like a long line of low beach. My notice was soon\nafterwards attracted by the dusky-red appearance of the moon, and the\npeculiar character of the sea. The latter was undergoing a rapid change,\nand the water seemed more than usually transparent. Although I could\ndistinctly see the bottom, yet, heaving the lead, I found the ship in\nfifteen fathoms. The air now became intolerably hot, and was loaded with\nspiral exhalations similar to those arising from heat iron. As night\ncame on, every breath of wind died away, an more entire calm it is\nimpossible to conceive. The flame of a candle burned upon the poop\nwithout the least perceptible motion, and a long hair, held between the\nfinger and thumb, hung without the possibility of detecting a vibration.\nHowever, as the captain said he could perceive no indication of danger,\nand as we were drifting in bodily to shore, he ordered the sails to\nbe furled, and the anchor let go. No watch was set, and the crew,\nconsisting principally of Malays, stretched themselves deliberately upon\ndeck. I went below--not without a full presentiment of evil. Indeed,\nevery appearance warranted me in apprehending a Simoom. I told the\ncaptain my fears; but he paid no attention to what I said, and left me\nwithout deigning to give a reply. My uneasiness, however, prevented me\nfrom sleeping, and about midnight I went upon deck.--As I placed my foot\nupon the upper step of the companion-ladder, I was startled by a\nloud, humming noise, like that occasioned by the rapid revolution of a\nmill-wheel, and before I could ascertain its meaning, I found the ship\nquivering to its centre. In the next instant, a wilderness of foam\nhurled us upon our beam-ends, and, rushing over us fore and aft, swept\nthe entire decks from stem to stern.\n\nThe extreme fury of the blast proved, in a great measure, the salvation\nof the ship. Although completely water-logged, yet, as her masts had\ngone by the board, she rose, after a minute, heavily from the sea, and,\nstaggering awhile beneath the immense pressure of the tempest, finally\nrighted.\n\nBy what miracle I escaped destruction, it is impossible to say. Stunned\nby the shock of the water, I found myself, upon recovery, jammed in\nbetween the stern-post and rudder. With great difficulty I gained my\nfeet, and looking dizzily around, was, at first, struck with the idea of\nour being among breakers; so terrific, beyond the wildest imagination,\nwas the whirlpool of mountainous and foaming ocean within which we were\nengulfed. After a while, I heard the voice of an old Swede, who had\nshipped with us at the moment of our leaving port. I hallooed to\nhim with all my strength, and presently he came reeling aft. We soon\ndiscovered that we were the sole survivors of the accident. All on deck,\nwith the exception of ourselves, had been swept overboard;--the captain\nand mates must have perished as they slept, for the cabins were deluged\nwith water. Without assistance, we could expect to do little for the\nsecurity of the ship, and our exertions were at first paralyzed by the\nmomentary expectation of going down. Our cable had, of course, parted\nlike pack-thread, at the first breath of the hurricane, or we should\nhave been instantaneously overwhelmed. We scudded with frightful\nvelocity before the sea, and the water made clear breaches over us. The\nframe-work of our stern was shattered excessively, and, in almost every\nrespect, we had received considerable injury; but to our extreme Joy we\nfound the pumps unchoked, and that we had made no great shifting of\nour ballast. The main fury of the blast had already blown over, and we\napprehended little danger from the violence of the wind; but we looked\nforward to its total cessation with dismay; well believing, that, in our\nshattered condition, we should inevitably perish in the tremendous swell\nwhich would ensue. But this very just apprehension seemed by no means\nlikely to be soon verified. For five entire days and nights--during\nwhich our only subsistence was a small quantity of jaggeree, procured\nwith great difficulty from the forecastle--the hulk flew at a rate\ndefying computation, before rapidly succeeding flaws of wind, which,\nwithout equalling the first violence of the Simoom, were still more\nterrific than any tempest I had before encountered. Our course for the\nfirst four days was, with trifling variations, S.E. and by S.; and we\nmust have run down the coast of New Holland.--On the fifth day the cold\nbecame extreme, although the wind had hauled round a point more to the\nnorthward.--The sun arose with a sickly yellow lustre, and clambered a\nvery few degrees above the horizon--emitting no decisive light.--There\nwere no clouds apparent, yet the wind was upon the increase, and blew\nwith a fitful and unsteady fury. About noon, as nearly as we could\nguess, our attention was again arrested by the appearance of the sun.\nIt gave out no light, properly so called, but a dull and sullen glow\nwithout reflection, as if all its rays were polarized. Just before\nsinking within the turgid sea, its central fires suddenly went out, as\nif hurriedly extinguished by some unaccountable power. It was a dim,\nsliver-like rim, alone, as it rushed down the unfathomable ocean.\n\nWe waited in vain for the arrival of the sixth day--that day to me\nhas not arrived--to the Swede, never did arrive. Thenceforward we were\nenshrouded in patchy darkness, so that we could not have seen an object\nat twenty paces from the ship. Eternal night continued to envelop us,\nall unrelieved by the phosphoric sea-brilliancy to which we had been\naccustomed in the tropics. We observed too, that, although the tempest\ncontinued to rage with unabated violence, there was no longer to be\ndiscovered the usual appearance of surf, or foam, which had hitherto\nattended us. All around were horror, and thick gloom, and a black\nsweltering desert of ebony.--Superstitious terror crept by degrees into\nthe spirit of the old Swede, and my own soul was wrapped up in silent\nwonder. We neglected all care of the ship, as worse than useless, and\nsecuring ourselves, as well as possible, to the stump of the mizen-mast,\nlooked out bitterly into the world of ocean. We had no means of\ncalculating time, nor could we form any guess of our situation. We were,\nhowever, well aware of having made farther to the southward than any\nprevious navigators, and felt great amazement at not meeting with the\nusual impediments of ice. In the meantime every moment threatened to be\nour last--every mountainous billow hurried to overwhelm us. The swell\nsurpassed anything I had imagined possible, and that we were not\ninstantly buried is a miracle. My companion spoke of the lightness of\nour cargo, and reminded me of the excellent qualities of our ship; but\nI could not help feeling the utter hopelessness of hope itself, and\nprepared myself gloomily for that death which I thought nothing could\ndefer beyond an hour, as, with every knot of way the ship made,\nthe swelling of the black stupendous seas became more dismally\nappalling. At times we gasped for breath at an elevation beyond the\nalbatross--at times became dizzy with the velocity of our descent into\nsome watery hell, where the air grew stagnant, and no sound disturbed\nthe slumbers of the kraken.\n\nWe were at the bottom of one of these abysses, when a quick scream\nfrom my companion broke fearfully upon the night. “See! see!” cried he,\nshrieking in my ears, “Almighty God! see! see!” As he spoke, I became\naware of a dull, sullen glare of red light which streamed down the sides\nof the vast chasm where we lay, and threw a fitful brilliancy upon our\ndeck. Casting my eyes upwards, I beheld a spectacle which froze the\ncurrent of my blood. At a terrific height directly above us, and upon\nthe very verge of the precipitous descent, hovered a gigantic ship of,\nperhaps, four thousand tons. Although upreared upon the summit of a wave\nmore than a hundred times her own altitude, her apparent size exceeded\nthat of any ship of the line or East Indiaman in existence. Her huge\nhull was of a deep dingy black, unrelieved by any of the customary\ncarvings of a ship. A single row of brass cannon protruded from her open\nports, and dashed from their polished surfaces the fires of innumerable\nbattle-lanterns, which swung to and fro about her rigging. But what\nmainly inspired us with horror and astonishment, was that she bore up\nunder a press of sail in the very teeth of that supernatural sea, and of\nthat ungovernable hurricane. When we first discovered her, her bows\nwere alone to be seen, as she rose slowly from the dim and horrible gulf\nbeyond her. For a moment of intense terror she paused upon the giddy\npinnacle, as if in contemplation of her own sublimity, then trembled and\ntottered, and--came down.\n\nAt this instant, I know not what sudden self-possession came over my\nspirit. Staggering as far aft as I could, I awaited fearlessly the ruin\nthat was to overwhelm. Our own vessel was at length ceasing from her\nstruggles, and sinking with her head to the sea. The shock of the\ndescending mass struck her, consequently, in that portion of her frame\nwhich was already under water, and the inevitable result was to hurl me,\nwith irresistible violence, upon the rigging of the stranger.\n\nAs I fell, the ship hove in stays, and went about; and to the confusion\nensuing I attributed my escape from the notice of the crew. With little\ndifficulty I made my way unperceived to the main hatchway, which was\npartially open, and soon found an opportunity of secreting myself in the\nhold. Why I did so I can hardly tell. An indefinite sense of awe, which\nat first sight of the navigators of the ship had taken hold of my mind,\nwas perhaps the principle of my concealment. I was unwilling to trust\nmyself with a race of people who had offered, to the cursory glance I\nhad taken, so many points of vague novelty, doubt, and apprehension. I\ntherefore thought proper to contrive a hiding-place in the hold. This I\ndid by removing a small portion of the shifting-boards, in such a manner\nas to afford me a convenient retreat between the huge timbers of the\nship.\n\nI had scarcely completed my work, when a footstep in the hold forced me\nto make use of it. A man passed by my place of concealment with a feeble\nand unsteady gait. I could not see his face, but had an opportunity\nof observing his general appearance. There was about it an evidence of\ngreat age and infirmity. His knees tottered beneath a load of years, and\nhis entire frame quivered under the burthen. He muttered to himself,\nin a low broken tone, some words of a language which I could not\nunderstand, and groped in a corner among a pile of singular-looking\ninstruments, and decayed charts of navigation. His manner was a wild\nmixture of the peevishness of second childhood, and the solemn dignity\nof a God. He at length went on deck, and I saw him no more.\n\n* * * * *\n\nA feeling, for which I have no name, has taken possession of my soul\n--a sensation which will admit of no analysis, to which the lessons of\nbygone times are inadequate, and for which I fear futurity itself\nwill offer me no key. To a mind constituted like my own, the latter\nconsideration is an evil. I shall never--I know that I shall\nnever--be satisfied with regard to the nature of my conceptions. Yet it\nis not wonderful that these conceptions are indefinite, since they have\ntheir origin in sources so utterly novel. A new sense--a new entity is\nadded to my soul.\n\n* * * * *\n\nIt is long since I first trod the deck of this terrible ship, and the\nrays of my destiny are, I think, gathering to a focus. Incomprehensible\nmen! Wrapped up in meditations of a kind which I cannot divine, they\npass me by unnoticed. Concealment is utter folly on my part, for the\npeople will not see. It was but just now that I passed directly before\nthe eyes of the mate--it was no long while ago that I ventured into the\ncaptain’s own private cabin, and took thence the materials with which\nI write, and have written. I shall from time to time continue this\nJournal. It is true that I may not find an opportunity of transmitting\nit to the world, but I will not fall to make the endeavour. At the last\nmoment I will enclose the MS. in a bottle, and cast it within the sea.\n\n* * * * *\n\nAn incident has occurred which has given me new room for meditation. Are\nsuch things the operation of ungoverned Chance? I had ventured upon deck\nand thrown myself down, without attracting any notice, among a pile of\nratlin-stuff and old sails in the bottom of the yawl. While musing upon\nthe singularity of my fate, I unwittingly daubed with a tar-brush the\nedges of a neatly-folded studding-sail which lay near me on a barrel.\nThe studding-sail is now bent upon the ship, and the thoughtless touches\nof the brush are spread out into the word DISCOVERY.\n\nI have made many observations lately upon the structure of the vessel.\nAlthough well armed, she is not, I think, a ship of war. Her rigging,\nbuild, and general equipment, all negative a supposition of this\nkind. What she is not, I can easily perceive--what she is I fear it is\nimpossible to say. I know not how it is, but in scrutinizing her strange\nmodel and singular cast of spars, her huge size and overgrown suits\nof canvas, her severely simple bow and antiquated stern, there will\noccasionally flash across my mind a sensation of familiar things, and\nthere is always mixed up with such indistinct shadows of recollection,\nan unaccountable memory of old foreign chronicles and ages long ago.\n\n* * * * *\n\nI have been looking at the timbers of the ship. She is built of a\nmaterial to which I am a stranger. There is a peculiar character about\nthe wood which strikes me as rendering it unfit for the purpose to\nwhich it has been applied. I mean its extreme porousness, considered\nindependently by the worm-eaten condition which is a consequence of\nnavigation in these seas, and apart from the rottenness attendant upon\nage. It will appear perhaps an observation somewhat over-curious, but\nthis wood would have every characteristic of Spanish oak, if Spanish oak\nwere distended by any unnatural means.\n\nIn reading the above sentence a curious apothegm of an old\nweather-beaten Dutch navigator comes full upon my recollection. “It\nis as sure,” he was wont to say, when any doubt was entertained of his\nveracity, “as sure as there is a sea where the ship itself will grow in\nbulk like the living body of the seaman.”\n\n* * * * *\n\nAbout an hour ago, I made bold to thrust myself among a group of the\ncrew. They paid me no manner of attention, and, although I stood in the\nvery midst of them all, seemed utterly unconscious of my presence. Like\nthe one I had at first seen in the hold, they all bore about them the\nmarks of a hoary old age. Their knees trembled with infirmity; their\nshoulders were bent double with decrepitude; their shrivelled skins\nrattled in the wind; their voices were low, tremulous and broken; their\neyes glistened with the rheum of years; and their gray hairs streamed\nterribly in the tempest. Around them, on every part of the deck, lay\nscattered mathematical instruments of the most quaint and obsolete\nconstruction.\n\n* * * * *\n\nI mentioned some time ago the bending of a studding-sail. From that\nperiod the ship, being thrown dead off the wind, has continued her\nterrific course due south, with every rag of canvas packed upon her,\nfrom her trucks to her lower studding-sail booms, and rolling every\nmoment her top-gallant yard-arms into the most appalling hell of water\nwhich it can enter into the mind of a man to imagine. I have just left\nthe deck, where I find it impossible to maintain a footing, although the\ncrew seem to experience little inconvenience. It appears to me a miracle\nof miracles that our enormous bulk is not swallowed up at once and\nforever. We are surely doomed to hover continually upon the brink of\nEternity, without taking a final plunge into the abyss. From billows a\nthousand times more stupendous than any I have ever seen, we glide away\nwith the facility of the arrowy sea-gull; and the colossal waters rear\ntheir heads above us like demons of the deep, but like demons confined\nto simple threats and forbidden to destroy. I am led to attribute these\nfrequent escapes to the only natural cause which can account for such\neffect.--I must suppose the ship to be within the influence of some\nstrong current, or impetuous under-tow.\n\n* * * * *\n\nI have seen the captain face to face, and in his own cabin--but, as I\nexpected, he paid me no attention. Although in his appearance there is,\nto a casual observer, nothing which might bespeak him more or less than\nman--still a feeling of irrepressible reverence and awe mingled with the\nsensation of wonder with which I regarded him. In stature he is nearly\nmy own height; that is, about five feet eight inches. He is of a\nwell-knit and compact frame of body, neither robust nor remarkably\notherwise. But it is the singularity of the expression which reigns upon\nthe face--it is the intense, the wonderful, the thrilling evidence of\nold age, so utter, so extreme, which excites within my spirit a sense--a\nsentiment ineffable. His forehead, although little wrinkled, seems to\nbear upon it the stamp of a myriad of years.--His gray hairs are records\nof the past, and his grayer eyes are Sybils of the future. The cabin\nfloor was thickly strewn with strange, iron-clasped folios, and\nmouldering instruments of science, and obsolete long-forgotten charts.\nHis head was bowed down upon his hands, and he pored, with a fiery\nunquiet eye, over a paper which I took to be a commission, and which, at\nall events, bore the signature of a monarch. He muttered to himself, as\ndid the first seaman whom I saw in the hold, some low peevish syllables\nof a foreign tongue, and although the speaker was close at my elbow, his\nvoice seemed to reach my ears from the distance of a mile.\n\n* * * * *\n\nThe ship and all in it are imbued with the spirit of Eld. The crew glide\nto and fro like the ghosts of buried centuries; their eyes have an eager\nand uneasy meaning; and when their fingers fall athwart my path in the\nwild glare of the battle-lanterns, I feel as I have never felt before,\nalthough I have been all my life a dealer in antiquities, and have\nimbibed the shadows of fallen columns at Balbec, and Tadmor, and\nPersepolis, until my very soul has become a ruin.\n\n* * * * *\n\nWhen I look around me I feel ashamed of my former apprehensions. If I\ntrembled at the blast which has hitherto attended us, shall I not stand\naghast at a warring of wind and ocean, to convey any idea of which\nthe words tornado and simoom are trivial and ineffective? All in the\nimmediate vicinity of the ship is the blackness of eternal night, and a\nchaos of foamless water; but, about a league on either side of us, may\nbe seen, indistinctly and at intervals, stupendous ramparts of ice,\ntowering away into the desolate sky, and looking like the walls of the\nuniverse.\n\n* * * * *\n\nAs I imagined, the ship proves to be in a current; if that appellation\ncan properly be given to a tide which, howling and shrieking by the\nwhite ice, thunders on to the southward with a velocity like the\nheadlong dashing of a cataract.\n\n* * * * *\n\nTo conceive the horror of my sensations is, I presume, utterly\nimpossible; yet a curiosity to penetrate the mysteries of these awful\nregions, predominates even over my despair, and will reconcile me to the\nmost hideous aspect of death. It is evident that we are hurrying onwards\nto some exciting knowledge--some never-to-be-imparted secret, whose\nattainment is destruction. Perhaps this current leads us to the southern\npole itself. It must be confessed that a supposition apparently so wild\nhas every probability in its favor.\n\n* * * * *\n\nThe crew pace the deck with unquiet and tremulous step; but there is\nupon their countenances an expression more of the eagerness of hope than\nof the apathy of despair.\n\nIn the meantime the wind is still in our poop, and, as we carry a crowd\nof canvas, the ship is at times lifted bodily from out the sea--Oh,\nhorror upon horror! the ice opens suddenly to the right, and to the\nleft, and we are whirling dizzily, in immense concentric circles, round\nand round the borders of a gigantic amphitheatre, the summit of whose\nwalls is lost in the darkness and the distance. But little time will be\nleft me to ponder upon my destiny--the circles rapidly grow small--we\nare plunging madly within the grasp of the whirlpool--and amid a\nroaring, and bellowing, and thundering of ocean and of tempest, the ship\nis quivering, oh God! and--going down.\n\nNOTE.--The “MS. Found in a Bottle,” was originally published in 1831,\nand it was not until many years afterwards that I became acquainted with\nthe maps of Mercator, in which the ocean is represented as rushing, by\nfour mouths, into the (northern) Polar Gulf, to be absorbed into the\nbowels of the earth; the Pole itself being represented by a black rock,\ntowering to a prodigious height.\n\n\n\n\nTHE OVAL PORTRAIT\n\nTHE chateau into which my valet had ventured to make forcible entrance,\nrather than permit me, in my desperately wounded condition, to pass a\nnight in the open air, was one of those piles of commingled gloom and\ngrandeur which have so long frowned among the Appennines, not less in\nfact than in the fancy of Mrs. Radcliffe. To all appearance it had been\ntemporarily and very lately abandoned. We established ourselves in one\nof the smallest and least sumptuously furnished apartments. It lay in a\nremote turret of the building. Its decorations were rich, yet tattered\nand antique. Its walls were hung with tapestry and bedecked with\nmanifold and multiform armorial trophies, together with an unusually\ngreat number of very spirited modern paintings in frames of rich golden\narabesque. In these paintings, which depended from the walls not only\nin their main surfaces, but in very many nooks which the bizarre\narchitecture of the chateau rendered necessary--in these paintings my\nincipient delirium, perhaps, had caused me to take deep interest; so\nthat I bade Pedro to close the heavy shutters of the room--since it was\nalready night--to light the tongues of a tall candelabrum which stood by\nthe head of my bed--and to throw open far and wide the fringed curtains\nof black velvet which enveloped the bed itself. I wished all this done\nthat I might resign myself, if not to sleep, at least alternately to the\ncontemplation of these pictures, and the perusal of a small volume which\nhad been found upon the pillow, and which purported to criticise and\ndescribe them.\n\nLong--long I read--and devoutly, devotedly I gazed. Rapidly and\ngloriously the hours flew by and the deep midnight came. The position of\nthe candelabrum displeased me, and outreaching my hand with difficulty,\nrather than disturb my slumbering valet, I placed it so as to throw its\nrays more fully upon the book.\n\nBut the action produced an effect altogether unanticipated. The rays of\nthe numerous candles (for there were many) now fell within a niche of\nthe room which had hitherto been thrown into deep shade by one of the\nbed-posts. I thus saw in vivid light a picture all unnoticed before. It\nwas the portrait of a young girl just ripening into womanhood. I glanced\nat the painting hurriedly, and then closed my eyes. Why I did this\nwas not at first apparent even to my own perception. But while my lids\nremained thus shut, I ran over in my mind my reason for so shutting\nthem. It was an impulsive movement to gain time for thought--to make\nsure that my vision had not deceived me--to calm and subdue my fancy for\na more sober and more certain gaze. In a very few moments I again looked\nfixedly at the painting.\n\nThat I now saw aright I could not and would not doubt; for the first\nflashing of the candles upon that canvas had seemed to dissipate the\ndreamy stupor which was stealing over my senses, and to startle me at\nonce into waking life.\n\nThe portrait, I have already said, was that of a young girl. It was a\nmere head and shoulders, done in what is technically termed a vignette\nmanner; much in the style of the favorite heads of Sully. The arms, the\nbosom, and even the ends of the radiant hair melted imperceptibly into\nthe vague yet deep shadow which formed the back-ground of the whole. The\nframe was oval, richly gilded and filigreed in Moresque. As a thing of\nart nothing could be more admirable than the painting itself. But it\ncould have been neither the execution of the work, nor the immortal\nbeauty of the countenance, which had so suddenly and so vehemently moved\nme. Least of all, could it have been that my fancy, shaken from its half\nslumber, had mistaken the head for that of a living person. I saw at\nonce that the peculiarities of the design, of the vignetting, and of the\nframe, must have instantly dispelled such idea--must have prevented even\nits momentary entertainment. Thinking earnestly upon these points, I\nremained, for an hour perhaps, half sitting, half reclining, with my\nvision riveted upon the portrait. At length, satisfied with the true\nsecret of its effect, I fell back within the bed. I had found the spell\nof the picture in an absolute life-likeliness of expression, which, at\nfirst startling, finally confounded, subdued, and appalled me. With deep\nand reverent awe I replaced the candelabrum in its former position. The\ncause of my deep agitation being thus shut from view, I sought eagerly\nthe volume which discussed the paintings and their histories. Turning\nto the number which designated the oval portrait, I there read the vague\nand quaint words which follow:\n\n“She was a maiden of rarest beauty, and not more lovely than full of\nglee. And evil was the hour when she saw, and loved, and wedded the\npainter. He, passionate, studious, austere, and having already a bride\nin his Art; she a maiden of rarest beauty, and not more lovely than full\nof glee; all light and smiles, and frolicsome as the young fawn; loving\nand cherishing all things; hating only the Art which was her rival;\ndreading only the pallet and brushes and other untoward instruments\nwhich deprived her of the countenance of her lover. It was thus a\nterrible thing for this lady to hear the painter speak of his desire to\nportray even his young bride. But she was humble and obedient, and sat\nmeekly for many weeks in the dark, high turret-chamber where the light\ndripped upon the pale canvas only from overhead. But he, the painter,\ntook glory in his work, which went on from hour to hour, and from day to\nday. And he was a passionate, and wild, and moody man, who became lost\nin reveries; so that he would not see that the light which fell so\nghastly in that lone turret withered the health and the spirits of his\nbride, who pined visibly to all but him. Yet she smiled on and still on,\nuncomplainingly, because she saw that the painter (who had high renown)\ntook a fervid and burning pleasure in his task, and wrought day and\nnight to depict her who so loved him, yet who grew daily more dispirited\nand weak. And in sooth some who beheld the portrait spoke of its\nresemblance in low words, as of a mighty marvel, and a proof not less of\nthe power of the painter than of his deep love for her whom he depicted\nso surpassingly well. But at length, as the labor drew nearer to its\nconclusion, there were admitted none into the turret; for the painter\nhad grown wild with the ardor of his work, and turned his eyes from\ncanvas merely, even to regard the countenance of his wife. And he would\nnot see that the tints which he spread upon the canvas were drawn from\nthe cheeks of her who sate beside him. And when many weeks had passed,\nand but little remained to do, save one brush upon the mouth and one\ntint upon the eye, the spirit of the lady again flickered up as the\nflame within the socket of the lamp. And then the brush was given,\nand then the tint was placed; and, for one moment, the painter stood\nentranced before the work which he had wrought; but in the next, while\nhe yet gazed, he grew tremulous and very pallid, and aghast, and crying\nwith a loud voice, ‘This is indeed Life itself!’ turned suddenly to\nregard his beloved:--She was dead!”\n"
