If one awakens in a healthy body, and with a clear\nbrain rested by normal sleep and retaining memories of a normally\nagreeable yesterday, one may lie watching the housemaid building the\nfire; and after she has swept the hearth and put things in order, lie\nwatching the flames of the blazing and crackling wood catch the coals\nand set them blazing also, and dancing merrily and filling corners with\na glow; and in so lying and realizing that leaping light and warmth and\na soft bed are good things, one may turn over on one's back, stretching\narms and legs luxuriously, drawing deep breaths and smiling at a\nknowledge of the fog outside which makes half-past eight o'clock on a\nDecember morning as dark as twelve o'clock on a December night.  Under\nsuch conditions the soft, thick, yellow gloom has its picturesque and\neven humorous aspect. One feels enclosed by it at once fantastically\nand cosily, and is inclined to revel in imaginings of the picture\noutside, its Rembrandt lights and orange yellows, the halos about the\nstreet-lamps, the illumination of shop-windows, the flare of torches\nstuck up over coster barrows and coffee-stands, the shadows on the faces\nof the men and women selling and buying beside them.  Refreshed by sleep\nand comfort and surrounded by light, warmth, and good cheer, it is easy\nto face the day, to confront going out into the fog and feeling a sort\nof pleasure in its mysteries.  This is one way of looking at it, but\nonly one.\n\nThe other way is marked by enormous differences.\n\nA man--he had given his name to the people of the house as Antony Dart--\nawakened in a third-story bedroom in a lodging-house in a poor street in\nLondon, and as his consciousness returned to him, its slow and reluctant\nmovings confronted the second point of view--marked by enormous\ndifferences.  He had not slept two consecutive hours through the night,\nand when he had slept he had been tormented by dreary dreams, which were\nmore full of misery because of their elusive vagueness, which kept his\ntortured brain on a wearying strain of effort to reach some definite\nunderstanding of them.  Yet when he awakened the consciousness of being\nagain alive was an awful thing. If the dreams could have faded into\nblankness and all have passed with the passing of the night, how he\ncould have thanked whatever gods there be!  Only not to awake--only not\nto awake!  But he had awakened.\n\nThe clock struck nine as he did so, consequently he knew the hour. The\nlodging-house slavey had aroused him by coming to light the fire.  She\nhad set her candle on the hearth and done her work as stealthily as\npossible, but he had been disturbed, though he had made a desperate\neffort to struggle back into sleep.  That was no use--no use.  He was\nawake and he was in the midst of it all again. Without the sense of\nluxurious comfort he opened his eyes and turned upon his back, throwing\nout his arms flatly, so that he lay as in the form of a cross, in heavy\nweariness and anguish.  For months he had awakened each morning after\nsuch a night and had so lain like a crucified thing.\n\nAs he watched the painful flickering of the damp and smoking wood and\ncoal he remembered this and thought that there had been a lifetime of\nsuch awakenings, not knowing that the morbidness of a fagged brain\nblotted out the memory of more normal days and told him fantastic lies\nwhich were but a hundredth part truth.  He could see only the hundredth\npart truth, and it assumed proportions so huge that he could see nothing\nelse.  In such a state the human brain is an infernal machine and its\nworkings can only be conquered if the mortal thing which lives with it--\nday and night, night and day--has learned to separate its controllable\nfrom its seemingly uncontrollable atoms, and can silence its clamor on\nits way to madness.\n\nAntony Dart had not learned this thing and the clamor had had its\nhideous way with him.  Physicians would have given a name to his mental\nand physical condition.  He had heard these names often--applied to men\nthe strain of whose lives had been like the strain of his own, and had\nleft them as it had left him--jaded, joyless, breaking things.  Some of\nthem had been broken and had died or were dragging out bruised and\ntormented days in their own homes or in mad-houses.  He always shuddered\nwhen he heard their names, and rebelled with sick fear against the mere\nmention of them.  They had worked as he had worked, they had been\nstricken with the delirium of accumulation--accumulation--as he had\nbeen.  They had been caught in the rush and swirl of the great\nmaelstrom, and had been borne round and round in it, until having\ngrasped every coveted thing tossing upon its circling waters, they\nthemselves had been flung upon the shore with both hands full, the rocks\nabout them strewn with rich possessions, while they lay prostrate and\ngazed at all life had brought with dull, hopeless, anguished eyes.  He\nknew--if the worst came to the worst--what would be said of him,\nbecause he had heard it said of others.  \"He worked too hard--he worked\ntoo hard.\"  He was sick of hearing it. What was wrong with the world--\nwhat was wrong with man, as Man--if work could break him like this? If\none believed in Deity, the living creature It breathed into being must\nbe a perfect thing--not one to be wearied, sickened, tortured by the\nlife Its breathing had created.  A mere man would disdain to build a\nthing so poor and incomplete. A mere human engineer who constructed an\nengine whose workings were perpetually at fault--which went wrong when\ncalled upon to do the labor it was made for--who would not scoff at it\nand cast it aside as a piece of worthless bungling?\n\n\"Something is wrong,\" he muttered, lying flat upon his cross and staring\nat the yellow haze which had crept through crannies in window-sashes\ninto the room.  \"Someone is wrong.  Is it I--or You?\"\n\nHis thin lips drew themselves back against his teeth in a mirthless\nsmile which was like a grin.\n\n\"Yes,\" he said.  \"I am pretty far gone.  I am beginning to talk to\nmyself about God.  Bryan did it just before he was taken to Dr.\nHewletts' place and cut his throat.\"\n\nHe had not led a specially evil life; he had not broken laws, but the\nsubject of Deity was not one which his scheme of existence had included.\nWhen it had haunted him of late he had felt it an untoward and morbid\nsign.  The thing had drawn him--drawn him; he had complained against it,\nhe had argued, sometimes he knew--shuddering--that he had raved.\nSomething had seemed to stand aside and watch his being and his\nthinking. Something which filled the universe had seemed to wait, and to\nhave waited through all the eternal ages, to see what he--one man--would\ndo.  At times a great appalled wonder had swept over him at his\nrealization that he had never known or thought of it before.  It had\nbeen there always--through all the ages that had passed.  And\nsometimes--once or twice--the thought had in some unspeakable,\nuntranslatable way brought him a moment's calm.\n\nBut at other times he had said to himself--with a shivering soul\ncowering within him--that this was only part of it all and was a\nbeginning, perhaps, of religious monomania.\n\nDuring the last week he had known what he was going to do--he had made\nup his mind.  This abject horror through which others had let themselves\nbe dragged to madness or death he would not endure.  The end should come\nquickly, and no one should be smitten aghast by seeing or knowing\nhow it came. In the crowded shabbier streets of London there were\nlodging-houses where one, by taking precautions, could end his life in\nsuch a manner as would blot him out of any world where such a man as\nhimself had been known.  A pistol, properly managed, would obliterate\nresemblance to any human thing.  Months ago through chance talk he had\nheard how it could be done--and done quickly. He could leave a\nmisleading letter. He had planned what it should be--the story it should\ntell of a disheartened mediocre venturer of his poor all returning\nbankrupt and humiliated from Australia, ending existence in such\npennilessness that the parish must give him a pauper's grave.  What did\nit matter where a man lay, so that he slept--slept--slept?  Surely with\none's brains scattered one would sleep soundly anywhere.\n\nHe had come to the house the night before, dressed shabbily with the\npitiable respectability of a defeated man.  He had entered droopingly\nwith bent shoulders and hopeless hang of head.  In his own sphere he was\na man who held himself well.  He had let fall a few dispirited sentences\nwhen he had engaged his back room from the woman of the house, and she\nhad recognized him as one of the luckless. In fact, she had hesitated a\nmoment before his unreliable look until he had taken out money from his\npocket and paid his rent for a week in advance.  She would have that at\nleast for her trouble, he had said to himself.  He should not occupy the\nroom after to-morrow.  In his own home some days would pass before his\nhousehold began to make inquiries.  He had told his servants that he was\ngoing over to Paris for a change.  He would be safe and deep in his\npauper's grave a week before they asked each other why they did not hear\nfrom him.  All was in order.  One of the mocking agonies was that living\nwas done for.  He had ceased to live.  Work, pleasure, sun, moon, and\nstars had lost their meaning.  He stood and looked at the most radiant\nloveliness of land and sky and sea and felt nothing. Success brought\ngreater wealth each day without stirring a pulse of pleasure, even in\ntriumph.  There was nothing left but the awful days and awful nights to\nwhich he knew physicians could give their scientific name, but had\nno healing for.  He had gone far enough.  He would go no farther.\nTo-morrow it would have been over long hours.  And there would have been\nno public declaiming over the humiliating pitifulness of his end.  And\nwhat did it matter?\n\nHow thick the fog was outside--thick enough for a man to lose himself\nin it.  The yellow mist which had crept in under the doors and through\nthe crevices of the window-sashes gave a ghostly look to the room--a\nghastly, abnormal look, he said to himself.  The fire was smouldering\ninstead of blazing.  But what did it matter?  He was going out.  He had\nnot bought the pistol last night--like a fool.  Somehow his brain had\nbeen so tired and crowded that he had forgotten.\n\n\"Forgotten.\"  He mentally repeated the word as he got out of bed. By\nthis time to-morrow he should have forgotten everything.  THIS TIME\nTO-MORROW.  His mind repeated that also, as he began to dress himself.\nWhere should he be?  Should he be anywhere?  Suppose he awakened again--\nto something as bad as this?  How did a man get out of his body?  After\nthe crash and shock what happened?  Did one find oneself standing beside\nthe Thing and looking down at it?  It would not be a good thing to stand\nand look down on--even for that which had deserted it.  But having torn\noneself loose from it and its devilish aches and pains, one would not\ncare--one would see how little it all mattered.  Anything else must be\nbetter than this--the thing for which there was a scientific name but no\nhealing.  He had taken all the drugs, he had obeyed all the medical\norders, and here he was after that last hell of a night--dressing\nhimself in a back bedroom of a cheap lodging-house to go out and buy a\npistol in this damned fog.\n\nHe laughed at the last phrase of his thought, the laugh which was a\nmirthless grin.\n\n\"I am thinking of it as if I was afraid of taking cold,\" he said. \"And\nto-morrow--!\"\n\nThere would be no To-morrow. To-morrows were at an end.  No more\nnights--no more days--no more morrows.\n\nHe finished dressing, putting on his discriminatingly chosen\nshabby-genteel clothes with a care for the effect he intended them to\nproduce. The collar and cuffs of his shirt were frayed and yellow, and\nhe fastened his collar with a pin and tied his worn necktie carelessly.\nHis overcoat was beginning to wear a greenish shade and look threadbare,\nso was his hat. When his toilet was complete he looked at himself in the\ncracked and hazy glass, bending forward to scrutinize his unshaven face\nunder the shadow of the dingy hat.\n\n\"It is all right,\" he muttered. \"It is not far to the pawnshop where I\nsaw it.\"\n\nThe stillness of the room as he turned to go out was uncanny.  As it was\na back room, there was no street below from which could arise sounds of\npassing vehicles, and the thickness of the fog muffled such sound as\nmight have floated from the front.  He stopped half-way to the door, not\nknowing why, and listened. To what--for what?  The silence seemed to\nspread through all the house--out into the streets--through all\nLondon--through all the world, and he to stand in the midst of it, a man\non the way to Death--with no To-morrow.\n\nWhat did it mean?  It seemed to mean something.  The world withdrawn--\nlife withdrawn--sound withdrawn--breath withdrawn.  He stood and waited.\nPerhaps this was one of the symptoms of the morbid thing for which there\nwas that name.  If so he had better get away quickly and have it over,\nlest he be found wandering about not knowing--not knowing.  But now he\nknew--the Silence.  He waited--waited and tried to hear, as if\nsomething was calling him--calling without sound.  It returned to him--\nthe thought of That which had waited through all the ages to see what\nhe--one man--would do. He had never exactly pitied himself before--he\ndid not know that he pitied himself now, but he was a man going to his\ndeath, and a light, cold sweat broke out on him and it seemed as if it\nwas not he who did it, but some other--he flung out his arms and cried\naloud words he had not known he was going to speak.\n\n\"Lord!  Lord!  What shall I do to be saved?\"\n\nBut the Silence gave no answer. It was the Silence still.\n\nAnd after standing a few moments panting, his arms fell and his head\ndropped, and turning the handle of the door, he went out to buy the\npistol.\n\nII\n\nAs he went down the narrow staircase, covered with its dingy and\nthreadbare carpet, he found the house so full of dirty yellow haze that\nhe realized that the fog must be of the extraordinary ones which are\nremembered in after-years as abnormal specimens of their kind.  He\nrecalled that there had been one of the sort three years before, and\nthat traffic and business had been almost entirely stopped by it, that\naccidents had happened in the streets, and that people having lost their\nway had wandered about turning corners until they found themselves far\nfrom their intended destinations and obliged to take refuge in hotels or\nthe houses of hospitable strangers.  Curious incidents had occurred and\nodd stories were told by those who had felt themselves obliged by\ncircumstances to go out into the baffling gloom. He guessed that\nsomething of a like nature had fallen upon the town again.  The\ngas-light on the landings and in the melancholy hall burned feebly--so\nfeebly that one got but a vague view of the rickety hat-stand and the\nshabby overcoats and head-gear hanging upon it.  It was well for him\nthat he had but a corner or so to turn before he reached the pawnshop in\nwhose window he had seen the pistol he intended to buy.\n\nWhen he opened the street-door he saw that the fog was, upon the whole,\nperhaps even heavier and more obscuring, if possible, than the one so\nwell remembered.  He could not see anything three feet before him, he\ncould not see with distinctness anything two feet ahead.  The sensation\nof stepping forward was uncertain and mysterious enough to be almost\nappalling.  A man not sufficiently cautious might have fallen into any\nopen hole in his path.  Antony Dart kept as closely as possible to the\nsides of the houses.  It would have been easy to walk off the pavement\ninto the middle of the street but for the edges of the curb and the step\ndownward from its level.  Traffic had almost absolutely ceased, though\nin the more important streets link-boys were making efforts to guide\nmen or four-wheelers slowly along. The blind feeling of the thing was\nrather awful.  Though but few pedestrians were out, Dart found himself\nonce or twice brushing against or coming into forcible contact with men\nfeeling their way about like himself.\n\n\"One turn to the right,\" he repeated mentally, \"two to the left, and the\nplace is at the corner of the other side of the street.\"\n\nHe managed to reach it at last, but it had been a slow, and therefore,\nlong journey.  All the gas-jets the little shop owned were lighted, but\neven under their flare the articles in the window--the one or two once\ncheaply gaudy dresses and shawls and men's garments--hung in the haze\nlike the dreary, dangling ghosts of things recently executed. Among\nwatches and forlorn pieces of old-fashioned jewelry and odds and ends,\nthe pistol lay against the folds of a dirty gauze shawl.  There it was.\nIt would have been annoying if someone else had been beforehand and had\nbought it.\n\nInside the shop more dangling spectres hung and the place was almost\ndark.  It was a shabby pawnshop, and the man lounging behind the counter\nwas a shabby man with an unshaven, unamiable face.\n\n\"I want to look at that pistol in the right-hand corner of your window,\"\nAntony Dart said.\n\nThe pawnbroker uttered a sound something between a half-laugh and a\ngrunt.  He took the weapon from the window.\n\nAntony Dart examined it critically. He must make quite sure of it.  He\nmade no further remark. He felt he had done with speech.\n\nBeing told the price asked for the purchase, he drew out his purse and\ntook the money from it.  After making the payment he noted that he still\npossessed a five-pound note and some sovereigns.  There passed through\nhis mind a wonder as to who would spend it.  The most decent thing,\nperhaps, would be to give it away.  If it was in his room--to-morrow--\nthe parish would not bury him, and it would be safer that the parish\nshould.\n\nHe was thinking of this as he left the shop and began to cross the\nstreet.  Because his mind was wandering he was less watchful.  Suddenly\na rubber-tired hansom, moving without sound, appeared immediately in his\npath--the horse's head loomed up above his own.  He made the inevitable\ninvoluntary whirl aside to move out of the way, the hansom passed, and\nturning again, he went on.  His movement had been too swift to allow of\nhis realizing the direction in which his turn had been made.  He was\nwholly unaware that when he crossed the street he crossed backward\ninstead of forward.  He turned a corner literally feeling his way, went\non, turned another, and after walking the length of the street, suddenly\nunderstood that he was in a strange place and had lost his bearings.\n\nThis was exactly what had happened to people on the day of the memorable\nfog of three years before. He had heard them talking of such\nexperiences, and of the curious and baffling sensations they gave rise\nto in the brain.  Now he understood them.  He could not be far from his\nlodgings, but he felt like a man who was blind, and who had been turned\nout of the path he knew. He had not the resource of the people whose\nstories he had heard.  He would not stop and address anyone. There could\nbe no certainty as to whom he might find himself speaking to.  He would\nspeak to no one. He would wander about until he came upon some clew.\nEven if he came upon none, the fog would surely lift a little and become\na trifle less dense in course of time.  He drew up the collar of his\novercoat, pulled his hat down over his eyes and went on--his hand on the\nthing he had thrust into a pocket.\n\nHe did not find his clew as he had hoped, and instead of lifting the fog\ngrew heavier.  He found himself at last no longer striving for any end,\nbut rambling along mechanically, feeling like a man in a dream--a\nnightmare.  Once he recognized a weird suggestion in the mystery about\nhim.  To-morrow might one be wandering about aimlessly in some such\nhaze.  He hoped not.\n\nHis lodgings were not far from the Embankment, and he knew at last that\nhe was wandering along it, and had reached one of the bridges. His mood\nled him to turn in upon it, and when he reached an embrasure to stop\nnear it and lean upon the parapet looking down.  He could not see the\nwater, the fog was too dense, but he could hear some faint splashing\nagainst stones.  He had taken no food and was rather faint. What a\nstrange thing it was to feel faint for want of food--to stand alone, cut\noff from every other human being--everything done for. No wonder that\nsometimes, particularly on such days as these, there were plunges made\nfrom the parapet--no wonder.  He leaned farther over and strained his\neyes to see some gleam of water through the yellowness.  But it was not\nto be done.  He was thinking the inevitable thing, of course; but such a\nplunge would not do for him.  The other thing would destroy all traces.\n\nAs he drew back he heard something fall with the solid tinkling sound of\ncoin on the flag pavement. When he had been in the pawnbroker's shop he\nhad taken the gold from his purse and thrust it carelessly into his\nwaistcoat pocket, thinking that it would be easy to reach when he chose\nto give it to one beggar or another, if he should see some wretch who\nwould be the better for it.  Some movement he had made in bending had\ncaused a sovereign to slip out and it had fallen upon the stones.\n\nHe did not intend to pick it up, but in the moment in which he stood\nlooking down at it he heard close to him a shuffling movement. What he\nhad thought a bundle of rags or rubbish covered with sacking--some\ntramp's deserted or forgotten belongings--was stirring.  It was alive,\nand as he bent to look at it the sacking divided itself, and a small\nhead, covered with a shock of brilliant red hair, thrust itself out, a\nshrewd, small face turning to look up at him slyly with deep-set black\neyes.\n\nIt was a human girl creature about twelve years old.\n\n\"Are yer goin' to do it?\" she said in a hoarse, street-strained voice.\n\"Yer would be a fool if yer did--with as much as that on yer.\"\n\nShe pointed with a reddened, chapped, and dirty hand at the sovereign.\n\n\"Pick it up,\" he said.  \"You may have it.\"\n\nHer wild shuffle forward was an actual leap.  The hand made a snatching\nclutch at the coin.  She was evidently afraid that he was either not in\nearnest or would repent.  The next second she was on her feet and ready\nfor flight.\n\n\"Stop,\" he said; \"I've got more to give away.\"\n\nShe hesitated--not believing him, yet feeling it madness to lose a\nchance.\n\n\"MORE!\" she gasped.  Then she drew nearer to him, and a singular change\ncame upon her face.  It was a change which made her look oddly human.\n\n\"Gawd, mister!\" she said.  \"Yer can give away a quid like it was\nnothin'--an' yer've got more--an' yer goin' to do THAT--jes cos yer 'ad\na bit too much lars night an' there's a fog this mornin'!  You take it\nstraight from me--don't yer do it. I give yer that tip for the suvrink.\"\n\nShe was, for her years, so ugly and so ancient, and hardened in voice\nand skin and manner that she fascinated him.  Not that a man who has no\nTo-morrow in view is likely to be particularly conscious of mental\nprocesses.  He was done for, but he stood and stared at her.  What part\nof the Power moving the scheme of the universe stood near and thrust him\non in the path designed he did not know then--perhaps never did.  He was\nstill holding on to the thing in his pocket, but he spoke to her again.\n\n\"What do you mean?\" he asked glumly.\n\nShe sidled nearer, her sharp eyes on his face.\n\n\"I bin watchin' yer,\" she said. \"I sat down and pulled the sack over me\n'ead to breathe inside it an' get a bit warm.  An' I see yer come. I\nknowed wot yer was after, I did. I watched yer through a 'ole in me\nsack.  I wasn't goin' to call a copper. I shouldn't want ter be stopped\nmeself if I made up me mind.  I seed a gal dragged out las' week an'\nit'd a broke yer 'art to see 'er tear 'er clothes an' scream.  Wot\nbusiness 'ad they preventin' 'er goin' off quiet?  I wouldn't 'a'\nstopped yer--but w'en the quid fell, that made it different.\"\n\n\"I--\" he said, feeling the foolishness of the statement, but making it,\nnevertheless, \"I am ill.\"\n\n\"Course yer ill.  It's yer 'ead. Come along er me an' get a cup er\ncawfee at a stand, an' buck up.  If yer've give me that quid straight--\nwish-yer-may-die--I'll go with yer an' get a cup myself.  I ain't 'ad a\nbite since yesterday--an' 't wa'n't nothin' but a slice o' polony\nsossidge I found on a dust-'eap.  Come on, mister.\"\n\nShe pulled his coat with her cracked hand.  He glanced down at it\nmechanically, and saw that some of the fissures had bled and the\nroughened surface was smeared with the blood.  They stood together in\nthe small space in which the fog enclosed them--he and she--the man with\nno To-morrow and the girl thing who seemed as old as himself, with her\nsharp, small nose and chin, her sharp eyes and voice--and yet--perhaps\nthe fogs enclosing did it--something drew them together in an uncanny\nway. Something made him forget the lost clew to the lodging-house--\nsomething made him turn and go with her--a thing led in the dark.\n\n\"How can you find your way?\" he said.  \"I lost mine.\"\n\n\"There ain't no fog can lose me,\" she answered, shuffling along by his\nside; \"'sides, it's goin' to lift. Look at that man comin' to'ards us.\"\n\nIt was true that they could see through the orange-colored mist the\napproaching figure of a man who was at a yard's distance from them. Yes,\nit was lifting slightly--at least enough to allow of one's making a\nguess at the direction in which one moved.\n\n\"Where are you going?\" he asked.\n\n\"Apple Blossom Court,\" she answered.  \"The cawfee-stand's in a street\nnear it--and there's a shop where I can buy things.\"\n\n\"Apple Blossom Court!\" he ejaculated.  \"What a name!\"\n\n\"There ain't no apple-blossoms there,\" chuckling; \"nor no smell of 'em.\n'T ain't as nice as its nime is--Apple Blossom Court ain't.\"\n\n\"What do you want to buy?  A pair of shoes?\"  The shoes her naked feet\nwere thrust into were leprous-looking things through which nearly all\nher toes protruded.  But she chuckled when he spoke.\n\n\"No, I 'm goin' to buy a di'mond tirarer to go to the opery in,\" she\nsaid, dragging her old sack closer round her neck.  \"I ain't ad a noo un\nsince I went to the last Drorin'-room.\"\n\nIt was impudent street chaff, but there was cheerful spirit in it, and\ncheerful spirit has some occult effect upon morbidity.  Antony Dart did\nnot smile, but he felt a faint stirring of curiosity, which was, after\nall, not a bad thing for a man who had not felt an interest for a year.\n\n\"What is it you are going to buy?\"\n\n\"I'm goin' to fill me stummick fust,\" with a grin of elation.  \"Three\nthick slices o' bread an' drippin' an' a mug o' cawfee.  An' then I'm\ngoin' to get sumethin' 'earty to carry to Polly.  She ain't no good,\npore thing!\"\n\n\"Who is she?\"\n\nStopping a moment to drag up the heel of her dreadful shoe, she answered\nhim with an unprejudiced directness which might have been appalling if\nhe had been in the mood to be appalled.\n\n\"Ain't eighteen, an' tryin' to earn 'er livin' on the street.  She ain't\nmade for it.  Little country thing, allus frightened to death an' ready\nto bust out cryin'.  Gents ain't goin' to stand that.  A lot of 'em\nwants cheerin' up as much as she does. Gent as was in liquor last night\nknocked 'er down an' give 'er a black eye.  'T wan't ill feelin', but he\nlost his temper, an' give 'er a knock casual.  She can't go out\nto-night, an' she's been 'uddled up all day cryin' for 'er mother.\"\n\n\"Where is her mother?\"\n\n\"In the country--on a farm. Polly took a place in a lodgin'-'ouse an'\ngot in trouble.  The biby was dead, an' when she come out o' Queen\nCharlotte's she was took in by a woman an' kep'.  She kicked 'er out in\na week 'cos of her cryin'. The life didn't suit 'er.  I found 'er cryin'\nfit to split 'er chist one night--corner o' Apple Blossom Court--an' I\ntook care of 'er.\"\n\n\"Where?\"\n\n\"Me chambers,\" grinning; \"top loft of a 'ouse in the court.  If anyone\nelse 'd 'ave it I should be turned out.  It's an 'ole, I can tell yer--\nbut it's better than sleepin' under the bridges.\"\n\n\"Take me to see it,\" said Antony Dart.  \"I want to see the girl.\"\n\nThe words spoke themselves.  Why should he care to see either cockloft\nor girl?  He did not.  He wanted to go back to his lodgings with that\nwhich he had come out to buy. Yet he said this thing.  His companion\nlooked up at him with an expression actually relieved.\n\n\"Would yer tike up with 'er?\" with eager sharpness, as if confronting a\nsimple business proposition. \"She's pretty an' clean, an' she won't\ndrink a drop o' nothin'.  If she was treated kind she'd be cheerfler.\nShe's got a round fice an' light 'air an' eyes.  'Er 'air's curly.\nP'raps yer'd like 'er.\"\n\n\"Take me to see her.\"\n\n\"She'd look better to-morrow,\" cautiously, \"when the swellin's gone\ndown round 'er eye.\"\n\nDart started--and it was because he had for the last five minutes\nforgotten something.\n\n\"I shall not be here to-morrow,\" he said.  His grasp upon the thing in\nhis pocket had loosened, and he tightened it.\n\n\"I have some more money in my purse,\" he said deliberately.  \"I meant to\ngive it away before going. I want to give it to people who need it very\nmuch.\"\n\nShe gave him one of the sly, squinting glances.\n\n\"Deservin' cases?\"  She put it to him in brazen mockery.\n\n\"I don't care,\" he answered slowly and heavily.  \"I don't care a damn.\"\n\nHer face changed exactly as he had seen it change on the bridge when she\nhad drawn nearer to him. Its ugly hardness suddenly looked human.  And\nthat she could look human was fantastic.\n\n\"'Ow much 'ave yer?\" she asked. \"'Ow much is it?\"\n\n\"About ten pounds.\"\n\nShe stopped and stared at him with open mouth.\n\n\"Gawd!\" she broke out; \"ten pounds 'd send Apple Blossom Court to\n'eving.  Leastways, it'd take some of it out o' 'ell.\"\n\n\"Take me to it,\" he said roughly. \"Take me.\"\n\nShe began to walk quickly, breathing fast.  The fog was lighter, and it\nwas no longer a blinding thing.\n\nA question occurred to Dart.\n\n\"Why don't you ask me to give the money to you?\" he said bluntly.\n\n\"Dunno,\" she answered as bluntly. But after taking a few steps farther\nshe spoke again.\n\n\"I 'm cheerfler than most of 'em,\" she elaborated.  \"If yer born\ncheerfle yer can stand things.  When I gets a job nussin' women's bibies\nthey don't cry when I 'andles 'em. I gets many a bite an' a copper 'cos\no' that.  Folks likes yer.  I shall get on better than Polly when I'm\nold enough to go on the street.\"\n\nThe organ of whose lagging, sick pumpings Antony Dart had scarcely been\naware for months gave a sudden leap in his breast.  His blood actually\nhastened its pace, and ran through his veins instead of crawling--a\ndistinct physical effect of an actual mental condition.  It was produced\nupon him by the mere matter-of-fact ordinariness of her tone.  He had\nnever been a sentimental man, and had long ceased to be a feeling one,\nbut at that moment something emotional and normal happened to him.\n\n\"You expect to live in that way?\" he said.\n\n\"Ain't nothin' else fer me to do. Wisht I was better lookin'.  But I've\ngot a lot of 'air,\" clawing her mop, \"an' it's red.  One day,\"\nchuckling, \"a gent ses to me--he ses:  'Oh! yer'll do.  Yer an ugly\nlittle devil--but ye ARE a devil.'\"\n\nShe was leading him through a narrow, filthy back street, and she\nstopped, grinning up in his face.\n\n\"I say, mister,\" she wheedled, \"let's stop at the cawfee-stand. It's up\nthis way.\"\n\nWhen he acceded and followed her, she quickly turned a corner. They were\nin another lane thick with fog, which flared with the flame of torches\nstuck in costers' barrows which stood here and there--barrows with\nfried fish upon them, barrows with second-hand-looking vegetables and\nothers piled with more than second-hand-looking garments. Trade was not\ndriving, but near one or two of them dirty, ill-used looking women, a\nman or so, and a few children stood.  At a corner which led into a black\nhole of a court, a coffee-stand was stationed, in charge of a burly\nruffian in corduroys.\n\n\"Come along,\" said the girl. \"There it is.  It ain't strong, but it's\n'ot.\"\n\nShe sidled up to the stand, drawing Dart with her, as if glad of his\nprotection.\n\n\"'Ello, Barney,\" she said.  \"'Ere's a gent warnts a mug o' yer best.\nI've 'ad a bit o' luck, an' I wants one mesself.\"\n\n\"Garn,\" growled Barney.  \"You an' yer luck!  Gent may want a mug, but\ny'd show yer money fust.\"\n\n\"Strewth!  I've got it.  Y' aint got the chinge fer wot I 'ave in me\n'and 'ere.  'As 'e, mister?\"\n\n\"Show it,\" taunted the man, and then turning to Dart.  \"Yer wants a mug\no' cawfee?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\nThe girl held out her hand cautiously--the piece of gold lying upon its\npalm.\n\n\"Look 'ere,\" she said.\n\nThere were two or three men slouching about the stand.  Suddenly a hand\ndarted from between two of them who stood nearest, the sovereign was\nsnatched, a screamed oath from the girl rent the thick air, and a\nforlorn enough scarecrow of a young fellow sprang away.\n\nThe blood leaped in Antony Dart's veins again and he sprang after him in\na wholly normal passion of indignation.  A thousand years ago--as it\nseemed to him--he had been a good runner.  This man was not one, and\nwant of food had weakened him. Dart went after him with strides which\nastonished himself.  Up the street, into an alley and out of it, a dozen\nyards more and into a court, and the man wheeled with a hoarse, baffled\ncurse.  The place had no outlet.\n\n\"Hell!\" was all the creature said.\n\nDart took him by his greasy collar. Even the brief rush had left him\nfeeling like a living thing--which was a new sensation.\n\n\"Give it up,\" he ordered.\n\nThe thief looked at him with a half-laugh and obeyed, as if he felt the\nuselessness of a struggle.  He was not more than twenty-five years old,\nand his eyes were cavernous with want.  He had the face of a man who\nmight have belonged to a better class.  When he had uttered the\nexclamation invoking the infernal regions he had not dropped the\naspirate.\n\n\"I 'm as hungry as she is,\" he raved.\n\n\"Hungry enough to rob a child beggar?\" said Dart.\n\n\"Hungry enough to rob a starving old woman--or a baby,\" with a defiant\nsnort.  \"Wolf hungry--tiger hungry--hungry enough to cut throats.\"\n\nHe whirled himself loose and leaned his body against the wall, turning\nhis face toward it.  Suddenly he made a choking sound and began to sob.\n\n\"Hell!\" he choked.  \"I'll give it up!  I'll give it up!\"\n\nWhat a figure--what a figure, as he swung against the blackened wall,\nhis scarecrow clothes hanging on him, their once decent material making\ntheir pinning together of buttonless places, their looseness and rents\nshowing dirty linen, more abject than any other squalor could have made\nthem. Antony Dart's blood, still running warm and well, was doing its\nnormal work among the brain-cells which had stirred so evilly through\nthe night. When he had seized the fellow by the collar, his hand had\nleft his pocket.  He thrust it into another pocket and drew out some\nsilver.\n\n\"Go and get yourself some food,\" he said.  \"As much as you can eat. Then\ngo and wait for me at the place they call Apple Blossom Court.  I don't\nknow where it is, but I am going there.  I want to hear how you came to\nthis.  Will you come?\"\n\nThe thief lurched away from the wall and toward him.  He stared up into\nhis eyes through the fog.  The tears had smeared his cheekbones.\n\n\"God!\" he said.  \"Will I come? Look and see if I'll come.\"  Dart looked.\n\n\"Yes, you'll come,\" he answered, and he gave him the money.  \"I 'm\ngoing back to the coffee-stand.\"\n\nThe thief stood staring after him as he went out of the court.  Dart was\nspeaking to himself.\n\n\"I don't know why I did it,\" he said.  \"But the thing had to be done.\"\n\nIn the street he turned into he came upon the robbed girl, running,\npanting, and crying.  She uttered a shout and flung herself upon him,\nclutching his coat.\n\n\"Gawd!\" she sobbed hysterically, \"I thort I'd lost yer!  I thort I'd\nlost all of it, I did!  Strewth!  I 'm glad I've found yer--\" and she\nstopped, choking with her sobs and sniffs, rubbing her face in her sack.\n\n\"Here is your sovereign,\" Dart said, handing it to her.\n\nShe dropped the corner of the sack and looked up with a queer laugh.\n\n\"Did yer find a copper?  Did yer give him in charge?\"\n\n\"No,\" answered Dart.  \"He was worse off than you.  He was starving. I\ntook this from him; but I gave him some money and told him to meet us at\nApple Blossom Court.\"\n\nShe stopped short and drew back a pace to stare up at him.\n\n\"Well,\" she gave forth, \"y' ARE a queer one!\"\n\nAnd yet in the amazement on her face he perceived a remote dawning of an\nunderstanding of the meaning of the thing he had done.\n\nHe had spoken like a man in a dream.  He felt like a man in a dream,\nbeing led in the thick mist from place to place.  He was led back to the\ncoffee-stand, where now Barney, the proprietor, was pouring out coffee\nfor a hoarse-voiced coster girl with a draggled feather in her hat, who\ngreeted their arrival hilariously.\n\n\"Hello, Glad!\" she cried out. \"Got yer suvrink back?\"\n\nGlad--it seemed to be the creature's wild name--nodded, but held close\nto her companion's side, clutching his coat.\n\n\"Let's go in there an' change it,\" she said, nodding toward a small pork\nand ham shop near by.  \"An' then yer can take care of it for me.\"\n\n\"What did she call you?\"  Antony Dart asked her as they went.\n\n\"Glad.  Don't know as I ever 'ad a nime o' me own, but a little cove as\nwent once to the pantermine told me about a young lady as was Fairy\nQueen an' 'er name was Gladys Beverly St. John, so I called mesself\nthat. No one never said it all at onct--they don't never say nothin'\nbut Glad.  I'm glad enough this mornin',\" chuckling again, \"'avin' the\nluck to come up with you, mister. Never had luck like it 'afore.\"\n\nThey went into the pork and ham shop and changed the sovereign. There\nwas cooked food in the windows--roast pork and boiled ham and corned\nbeef.  She bought slices of pork and beef, and of suet-pudding with a\nfew currants sprinkled through it.\n\n\"Will yer 'elp me to carry it?\" she inquired.  \"I'll 'ave to get a few\npen'worth o' coal an' wood an' a screw o' tea an' sugar.  My wig, wot a\nfeed me an' Polly'll 'ave!\"\n\nAs they returned to the coffee-stand she broke more than once into a\nhop of glee.  Barney had changed his mind concerning her.  A solid\nsovereign which must be changed and a companion whose shabby gentility\nwas absolute grandeur when compared with his present surroundings made a\ndifference.\n\nShe received her mug of coffee and thick slice of bread and dripping\nwith a grin, and swallowed the hot sweet liquid down in ecstatic gulps.\n\n\"Ain't I in luck?\" she said, handing her mug back when it was empty.\n\"Gi' me another, Barney.\"\n\nAntony Dart drank coffee also and ate bread and dripping.  The coffee\nwas hot and the bread and dripping, dashed with salt, quite eatable.  He\nhad needed food and felt the better for it.\n\n\"Come on, mister,\" said Glad, when their meal was ended.  \"I want to get\nback to Polly, an' there's coal and bread and things to buy.\"\n\nShe hurried him along, breaking her pace with hops at intervals.  She\ndarted into dirty shops and brought out things screwed up in paper.  She\nwent last into a cellar and returned carrying a small sack of coal over\nher shoulders.\n\n\"Bought sack an' all,\" she said elatedly.  \"A sack's a good thing to\n'ave.\"\n\n\"Let me carry it for you,\" said Antony Dart\n\n\"Spile yer coat,\" with her sidelong upward glance.\n\n\"I don't care,\" he answered.  \"I don't care a damn.\"\n\nThe final expletive was totally unnecessary, but it meant a thing he did\nnot say.  Whatsoever was thrusting him this way and that, speaking\nthrough his speech, leading him to do things he had not dreamed of\ndoing, should have its will with him. He had been fastened to the skirts\nof this beggar imp and he would go on to the end and do what was to be\ndone this day.  It was part of the dream.\n\nThe sack of coal was over his shoulder when they turned into Apple\nBlossom Court.  It would have been a black hole on a sunny day, and now\nit was like Hades, lit grimly by a gas-jet or two, small and flickering,\nwith the orange haze about them.  Filthy flagging, murky doorways,\nbroken steps and broken windows stuffed with rags, and the smell of the\nsewers let loose had Apple Blossom Court.\n\nGlad, with the wealth of the pork and ham shop and other riches in her\narms, entered a repellent doorway in a spirit of great good cheer and\nDart followed her.  Past a room where a drunken woman lay sleeping with\nher head on a table, a child pulling at her dress and crying, up a\nstairway with broken balusters and breaking steps, through a landing,\nupstairs again, and up still farther until they reached the top.  Glad\nstopped before a door and shook the handle, crying out:\n\n\"'S only me, Polly.  You can open it.\"  She added to Dart in an\nundertone:  \"She 'as to keep it locked. No knowin' who'd want to get in.\nPolly,\" shaking the door-handle again, \"Polly's only me.\"\n\nThe door opened slowly.  On the other side of it stood a girl with a\ndimpled round face which was quite pale; under one of her childishly\nvacant blue eyes was a discoloration, and her curly fair hair was tucked\nup on the top of her head in a knot. As she took in the fact of Antony\nDart's presence her chin began to quiver.\n\n\"I ain't fit to--to see no one,\" she stammered pitifully.  \"Why did you,\nGlad--why did you?\"\n\n\"Ain't no 'arm in 'IM,\" said Glad. \"'E's one o' the friendly ones.  'E\ngive me a suvrink.  Look wot I've got,\" hopping about as she showed her\nparcels.\n\n\"You need not be afraid of me,\" Antony Dart said.  He paused a second,\nstaring at her, and suddenly added, \"Poor little wretch!\"\n\nHer look was so scared and uncertain a thing that he walked away from\nher and threw the sack of coal on the hearth.  A small grate with broken\nbars hung loosely in the fireplace, a battered tin kettle tilted\ndrunkenly near it.  A mattress, from the holes in whose ticking straw\nbulged, lay on the floor in a corner, with some old sacks thrown over\nit. Glad had, without doubt, borrowed her shoulder covering from the\ncollection.  The garret was as cold as the grave, and almost as dark;\nthe fog hung in it thickly.  There were crevices enough through which it\ncould penetrate.\n\nAntony Dart knelt down on the hearth and drew matches from his pocket.\n\n\"We ought to have brought some paper,\" he said.\n\nGlad ran forward.\n\n\"Wot a gent ye are!\" she cried. \"Y' ain't never goin' to light it?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\nShe ran back to the rickety table and collected the scraps of paper\nwhich had held her purchases. They were small, but useful.\n\n\"That wot was round the sausage an' the puddin's greasy,\" she exulted.\n\nPolly hung over the table and trembled at the sight of meat and bread.\nPlainly, she did not understand what was happening.  The greased paper\nset light to the wood, and the wood to the coal.  All three flared and\nblazed with a sound of cheerful crackling.  The blaze threw out its glow\nas finely as if it had been set alight to warm a better place. The\nwonder of a fire is like the wonder of a soul.  This one changed the\nmurk and gloom to brightness, and the deadly damp and cold to warmth.\nIt drew the girl Polly from the table despite her fears. She turned\ninvoluntarily, made two steps toward it, and stood gazing while its\nlight played on her face. Glad whirled and ran to the hearth.\n\n\"Ye've put on a lot,\" she cried; \"but, oh, my Gawd, don't it warm yer!\nCome on, Polly--come on.\"\n\nShe dragged out a wooden stool, an empty soap-box, and bundled the sacks\ninto a heap to be sat upon.  She swept the things from the table and set\nthem in their paper wrappings on the floor.\n\n\"Let's all sit down close to it--close,\" she said, \"an' get warm an'\neat, an' eat.\"\n\nShe was the leaven which leavened the lump of their humanity.  What this\nleaven is--who has found out? But she--little rat of the gutter--was\nformed of it, and her mere pure animal joy in the temporary animal\ncomfort of the moment stirred and uplifted them from their depths.\n\nIII\n\nThey drew near and sat upon the substitutes for seats in a circle--and\nthe fire threw up flame and made a glow in the fog hanging in the black\nhole of a room.\n\nIt was Glad who set the battered kettle on and when it boiled made tea.\nThe other two watched her, being under her spell.  She handed out slices\nof bread and sausage and pudding on bits of paper.  Polly fed with\ntremulous haste; Glad herself with rejoicing and exulting in flavors.\nAntony Dart ate bread and meat as he had eaten the bread and dripping at\nthe stall--accepting his normal hunger as part of the dream.\n\nSuddenly Glad paused in the midst of a huge bite.\n\n\"Mister,\" she said, \"p'raps that cove's waitin' fer yer.  Let's 'ave 'im\nin.  I'll go and fetch 'im.\"\n\nShe was getting up, but Dart was on his feet first.\n\n\"I must go,\" he said.  \"He is expecting me and--\"\n\n\"Aw,\" said Glad, \"lemme go along o' yer, mister--jest to show there's no\nill feelin'.\"\n\n\"Very well,\" he answered.\n\nIt was she who led, and he who followed.  At the door she stopped and\nlooked round with a grin.\n\n\"Keep up the fire, Polly,\" she threw back.  \"Ain't it warm and cheerful?\nIt'll do the cove good to see it.\"\n\nShe led the way down the black, unsafe stairway.  She always led.\n\nOutside the fog had thickened again, but she went through it as if she\ncould see her way.\n\nAt the entrance to the court the thief was standing, leaning against the\nwall with fevered, unhopeful waiting in his eyes.  He moved miserably\nwhen he saw the girl, and she called out to reassure him.\n\n\"I ain't up to no 'arm,\" she said; \"I on'y come with the gent.\"\n\nAntony Dart spoke to him.\n\n\"Did you get food?\"\n\nThe man shook his head.\n\n\"I turned faint after you left me, and when I came to I was afraid I\nmight miss you,\" he answered.  \"I daren't lose my chance.  I bought some\nbread and stuffed it in my pocket.  I've been eating it while I've stood\nhere.\"\n\n\"Come back with us,\" said Dart. \"We are in a place where we have some\nfood.\"\n\nHe spoke mechanically, and was aware that he did so.  He was a pawn\npushed about upon the board of this day's life.\n\n\"Come on,\" said the girl.  \"Yer can get enough to last fer three days.\"\n\nShe guided them back through the fog until they entered the murky\ndoorway again.  Then she almost ran up the staircase to the room they\nhad left.\n\nWhen the door opened the thief fell back a pace as before an\nunexpected thing.  It was the flare of firelight which struck upon his\neyes. He passed his hand over them.\n\n\"A fire!\" he said.  \"I haven't seen one for a week.  Coming out of the\nblackness it gives a man a start.\"\n\nImprovident joy gleamed in Glad's eyes.\n\n\"We'll be warm onct,\" she chuckled, \"if we ain't never warm agaen.\"\n\nShe drew her circle about the hearth again.  The thief took the place\nnext to her and she handed out food to him--a big slice of meat, bread,\na thick slice of pudding.\n\n\"Fill yerself up,\" she said.  \"Then ye'll feel like yer can talk.\"\n\nThe man tried to eat his food with decorum, some recollection of the\nhabits of better days restraining him, but starved nature was too much\nfor him.  His hands shook, his eyes filled, his teeth tore.  The rest of\nthe circle tried not to look at him. Glad and Polly occupied themselves\nwith their own food.\n\nAntony Dart gazed at the fire. Here he sat warming himself in a loft\nwith a beggar, a thief, and a helpless thing of the street.  He had come\nout to buy a pistol--its weight still hung in his overcoat pocket--and\nhe had reached this place of whose existence he had an hour ago not\ndreamed.  Each step which had led him had seemed a simple, inevitable\nthing, for which he had apparently been responsible, but which he knew--\nyes, somehow he KNEW--he had of his own volition neither planned nor\nmeant.  Yet here he sat--a part of the lives of the beggar, the thief,\nand the poor thing of the street.  What did it mean?\n\n\"Tell me,\" he said to the thief, \"how you came here.\"\n\nBy this time the young fellow had fed himself and looked less like a\nwolf.  It was to be seen now that he had blue-gray eyes which were\ndreamy and young.\n\n\"I have always been inventing things,\" he said a little huskily.  \"I did\nit when I was a child.  I always seemed to see there might be a way of\ndoing a thing better--getting more power.  When other boys were playing\ngames I was sitting in corners trying to build models out of wire and\nstring, and old boxes and tin cans.  I often thought I saw the way to\nthings, but I was always too poor to get what was needed to work them\nout.  Twice I heard of men making great names and for tunes because they\nhad been able to finish what I could have finished if I had had a few\npounds.  It used to drive me mad and break my heart.\" His hands clenched\nthemselves and his huskiness grew thicker.  \"There was a man,\" catching\nhis breath, \"who leaped to the top of the ladder and set the whole world\ntalking and writing--and I had done the thing FIRST--I swear I had!  It\nwas all clear in my brain, and I was half mad with joy over it, but I\ncould not afford to work it out.  He could, so to the end of time it\nwill be HIS.\"  He struck his fist upon his knee.\n\n\"Aw!\"  The deep little drawl was a groan from Glad.\n\n\"I got a place in an office at last. I worked hard, and they began to\ntrust me.  I--had a new idea.  It was a big one.  I needed money to work\nit out.  I--I remembered what had happened before.  I felt like a poor\nfellow running a race for his life.  I KNEW I could pay back ten times--\na hundred times--what I took.\"\n\n\"You took money?\" said Dart.\n\nThe thief's head dropped.\n\n\"No.  I was caught when I was taking it.  I wasn't sharp enough. Someone\ncame in and saw me, and there was a crazy row.  I was sent to prison.\nThere was no more trying after that.  It's nearly two years since, and\nI've been hanging about the streets and falling lower and lower.  I've\nrun miles panting after cabs with luggage in them and not had strength\nto carry in the boxes when they stopped.  I've starved and slept out of\ndoors.  But the thing I wanted to work out is in my mind all the time--\nlike some machine tearing round.  It wants to be finished.  It never\nwill be. That's all.\"\n\nGlad was leaning forward staring at him, her roughened hands with the\nsmeared cracks on them clasped round her knees.\n\n\"Things 'AS to be finished,\" she said.  \"They finish theirselves.\"\n\n\"How do you know?\"  Dart turned on her.\n\n\"Dunno 'OW I know--but I do. When things begin they finish.  It's like a\nwheel rollin' down an 'ill.\" Her sharp eyes fixed themselves on Dart's.\n\"All of us'll finish somethin'--'cos we've begun.  You will--Polly\nwill--'e will--I will.\" She stopped with a sudden sheepish chuckle and\ndropped her forehead on her knees, giggling.  \"Dunno wot I 'm talking\nabout,\" she said, \"but it's true.\"\n\nDart began to understand that it was.  And he also saw that this ragged\nthing who knew nothing whatever, looked out on the world with the eyes\nof a seer, though she was ignorant of the meaning of her own knowledge.\nIt was a weird thing.  He turned to the girl Polly.\n\n\"Tell me how you came here,\" he said.\n\nHe spoke in a low voice and gently.  He did not want to frighten her,\nbut he wanted to know how SHE had begun.  When she lifted her childish\neyes to his, her chin began to shake.  For some reason she did not\nquestion his right to ask what he would.  She answered him meekly, as\nher fingers fumbled with the stuff of her dress.\n\n\"I lived in the country with my mother,\" she said.  \"We was very happy\ntogether.  In the spring there was primroses and--and lambs.  I--can't\nabide to look at the sheep in the park these days.  They remind me so.\nThere was a girl in the village got a place in town and came back and\ntold us all about it. It made me silly.  I wanted to come here, too.\nI--I came--\" She put her arm over her face and began to sob.\n\n\"She can't tell you,\" said Glad. \"There was a swell in the 'ouse made\nlove to her.  She used to carry up coals to 'is parlor an' 'e talked to\n'er.  'E 'ad a wye with 'im--\"\n\nPolly broke into a smothered wail.\n\n\"Oh, I did love him so--I did!\" she cried.  \"I'd have let him walk over\nme.  I'd have let him kill me.\"\n\n\"'E nearly did it,\" said Glad.\n\n\"'E went away sudden an' she's never 'eard word of 'im since.\"\n\nFrom under Polly's face-hiding arm came broken words.\n\n\"I couldn't tell my mother.  I did not know how.  I was too frightened\nand ashamed.  Now it's too late.  I shall never see my mother again, and\nit seems as if all the lambs and primroses in the world was dead. Oh,\nthey're dead--they're dead--and I wish I was, too!\"\n\nGlad's eyes winked rapidly and she gave a hoarse little cough to clear\nher throat.  Her arms still clasping her knees, she hitched herself\ncloser to the girl and gave her a nudge with her elbow.\n\n\"Buck up, Polly,\" she said, \"we ain't none of us finished yet.  Look at\nus now--sittin' by our own fire with bread and puddin' inside us--an'\nthink wot we was this mornin'. Who knows wot we'll 'ave this time\nto-morrer.\"\n\nThen she stopped and looked with a wide grin at Antony Dart.\n\n\"Ow did I come 'ere?\" she said.\n\n\"Yes,\" he answered, \"how did you come here?\"\n\n\"I dunno,\" she said; \"I was 'ere first thing I remember.  I lived with a\nold woman in another 'ouse in the court.  One mornin' when I woke up she\nwas dead.  Sometimes I've begged an' sold matches.  Sometimes I've took\ncare of women's children or 'elped 'em when they 'ad to lie up. I've\nseen a lot--but I like to see a lot.  'Ope I'll see a lot more afore I'm\ndone.  I'm used to bein' 'ungry an' cold, an' all that, but--but I\nallers like to see what's comin' to-morrer.  There's allers somethin'\nelse to-morrer.  That's all about ME,\" and she chuckled again.\n\nDart picked up some fresh sticks and threw them on the fire.  There was\nsome fine crackling and a new flame leaped up.\n\n\"If you could do what you liked,\" he said, \"what would you like to do?\"\n\nHer chuckle became an outright laugh.\n\n\"If I 'ad ten pounds?\" she asked, evidently prepared to adjust herself\nin imagination to any form of un-looked-for good luck.\n\n\"If you had more?\"\n\nHis tone made the thief lift his head to look at him.\n\n\"If I 'ad a wand like the one Jem told me was in the pantermine?\"\n\n\"Yes,\" he answered.\n\nShe sat and stared at the fire a few moments, and then began to speak in\na low luxuriating voice.\n\n\"I'd get a better room,\" she said, revelling.  \"There's one in the next\n'ouse.  I'd 'ave a few sticks o' furnisher in it--a bed an' a chair or\ntwo.  I'd get some warm petticuts an' a shawl an' a 'at--with a ostrich\nfeather in it.  Polly an' me 'd live together.  We'd 'ave fire an' grub\nevery day.  I'd get drunken Bet's biby put in an 'ome. I'd 'elp the\nwomen when they 'ad to lie up.  I'd--I'd 'elp 'IM a bit,\" with a jerk of\nher elbow toward the thief.  \"If 'e was kept fed p'r'aps 'e could work\nout that thing in 'is 'ead. I'd go round the court an' 'elp them with\n'usbands that knocks 'em about. I'd--I'd put a stop to the knockin'\nabout,\" a queer fixed look showing itself in her eyes.  \"If I 'ad money\nI could do it.  'Ow much,\" with sudden prudence, \"could a body 'ave--\nwith one o' them wands?\"\n\n\"More than enough to do all you have spoken of,\" answered Dart.\n\n\"It's a shime a body couldn't 'ave it.  Apple Blossom Court 'd be a\ndifferent thing.  It'd be the sime as Miss Montaubyn says it's goin' to\nbe.\"  She laughed again, this time as if remembering something\nfantastic, but not despicable.\n\n\"Who is Miss Montaubyn?\"\n\n\"She's a' old woman as lives next floor below.  When she was young she\nwas pretty an' used to dance in the 'alls.  Drunken Bet says she was one\no' the wust.  When she got old it made 'er mad an' she got wusser. She\nwas ready to tear gals eyes out, an' when she'd get took for makin' a\nrow she'd fight like a tiger cat. About a year ago she tumbled\ndownstairs when she'd 'ad too much an' she broke both 'er legs.  You\nremember, Polly?\"\n\nPolly hid her face in her hands.\n\n\"Oh, when they took her away to the hospital!\" she shuddered.  \"Oh, when\nthey lifted her up to carry her!\"\n\n\"I thought Polly 'd 'ave a fit when she 'eard 'er screamin' an'\nswearin'. My! it was langwich!  But it was the 'orspitle did it.\"\n\n\"Did what?\"\n\n\"Dunno,\" with an uncertain, even slightly awed laugh.  \"Dunno wot it\ndid--neither does nobody else, but somethin' 'appened.  It was along of\na lidy as come in one day an' talked to 'er when she was lyin' there.\nMy eye,\" chuckling, \"it was queer talk!  But I liked it.  P'raps it was\nlies, but it was cheerfle lies that 'elps yer.  What I ses is--if THINGS\nain't cheerfle, PEOPLE's got to be--to fight it out.  The women in the\n'ouse larft fit to kill theirselves when she fust come 'ome limpin' an'\ntalked to 'em about what the lidy told 'er.  But arter a bit they liked\nto 'ear 'er--just along o' the cheerfleness.  Said it was like a\npantermine.  Drunken Bet says if she could get 'old 'f it an' believe it\nsime as Jinny Montaubyn does it'd be as cheerin' as drink an' last\nlonger.\"\n\n\"Is it a kind of religion?\" Dart asked, having a vague memory of rumors\nof fantastic new theories and half-born beliefs which had seemed to him\nweird visions floating through fagged brains wearied by old doubts and\narguments and failures.  The world was tired--the whole earth was sad--\ncenturies had wrought only to the end of this twentieth century's\ndespair.  Was the struggle waking even here--in this back water of the\nhuge city's human tide? he wondered with dull interest.\n\n\"Is it a kind of religion?\" he said.\n\n\"It's cheerfler.\"  Glad thrust out her sharp chin uncertainly again.\n\"There's no 'ell fire in it.  An' there ain't no blime laid on\nGodamighty.\"  (The word as she uttered it seemed to have no connection\nwhatever with her usual colloquial invocation of the Deity.)  \"When a\ndray run over little Billy an' crushed 'im inter a rag, an' 'is mother\nwas screamin' an' draggin' 'er 'air down, the curick 'e ses, 'It's\nGawd's will,' 'e ses--an' 'e ain't no bad sort neither, an' 'is fice was\nwhite an' wet with sweat--'Gawd done it,' 'e ses. An' me, I'd nussed the\nchild an' I clawed me 'air sime as if I was 'is mother an' I screamed\nout, 'Then damn 'im!'  An' the curick 'e dropped sittin' down on the\ncurbstone an' 'id 'is fice in 'is 'ands.\"\n\nDart hid his own face after the manner of the wretched curate.\n\n\"No wonder,\" he groaned.  His blood turned cold.\n\n\"But,\" said Glad, \"Miss Montaubyn's lidy she says Godamighty never done\nit nor never intended it, an' if we kep' sayin' an' believin' 'e's\nclose to us an' not millyuns o' miles away, we'd be took care of whilst\nwe was alive an' not 'ave to wait till we was dead.\"\n\nShe got up on her feet and threw up her arms with a sudden jerk and\ninvoluntary gesture.\n\n\"I 'm alive!  I 'm alive!\" she cried out, \"I've got ter be took care of\nNOW!  That's why I like wot she tells about it.  So does the women. We\nain't no more reason ter be sure of wot the curick says than ter be sure\no' this.  Dunno as I've got ter choose either way, but if I 'ad, I'd\nchoose the cheerflest.\"\n\nDart had sat staring at her--so had Polly--so had the thief.  Dart\nrubbed his forehead.\n\n\"I do not understand,\" he said.\n\n\"'T ain't understanding!  It's believin'.  Bless yer, SHE doesn't\nunderstand.  I say, let's go an' talk to 'er a bit.  She don't mind\nnothin', an' she'll let us in.  We can leave Polly an' 'im 'ere.  They\ncan make some more tea an' drink it.\"\n\nIt ended in their going out of the room together again and stumbling\nonce more down the stairway's crookedness.  At the bottom of the first\nshort flight they stopped in the darkness and Glad knocked at a door\nwith a summons manifestly expectant of cheerful welcome.  She used the\nformula she had used before.\n\n\"'S on'y me, Miss Montaubyn,\" she cried out.  \"'S on'y Glad.\"\n\nThe door opened in wide welcome, and confronting them as she held its\nhandle stood a small old woman with an astonishing face.  It was\nastonishing because while it was withered and wrinkled with marks of\npast years which had once stamped their reckless unsavoriness upon its\nevery line, some strange redeeming thing had happened to it and its\nexpression was that of a creature to whom the opening of a door could\nonly mean the entrance--the tumbling in as it were--of hopes realized.\nIts surface was swept clean of even the vaguest anticipation of anything\nnot to be desired.  Smiling as it did through the black doorway into the\nunrelieved shadow of the passage, it struck Antony Dart at once that it\nactually implied this--and that in this place--and indeed in any\nplace--nothing could have been more astonishing.  What could, indeed?\n\n\"Well, well,\" she said, \"come in, Glad, bless yer.\"\n\n\"I've brought a gent to 'ear yer talk a bit,\" Glad explained informally.\n\nThe small old woman raised her twinkling old face to look at him.\n\n\"Ah!\" she said, as if summing up what was before her.  \"'E thinks it's\nworse than it is, doesn't 'e, now? Come in, sir, do.\"\n\nThis time it struck Dart that her look seemed actually to anticipate the\nevolving of some wonderful and desirable thing from himself.  As if even\nhis gloom carried with it treasure as yet undisplayed.  As she knew\nnothing of the ten sovereigns, he wondered what, in God's name, she saw.\n\nThe poverty of the little square room had an odd cheer in it.  Much\nscrubbing had removed from it the objections manifest in Glad's room\nabove.  There was a small red fire in the grate, a strip of old, but gay\ncarpet before it, two chairs and a table were covered with a harlequin\npatchwork made of bright odds and ends of all sizes and shapes.  The fog\nin all its murky volume could not quite obscure the brightness of the\noften rubbed window and its harlequin curtain drawn across upon a\nstring.\n\n\"Bless yer,\" said Miss Montaubyn, \"sit down.\"\n\nDart sat and thanked her.  Glad dropped upon the floor and girdled her\nknees comfortably while Miss Montaubyn took the second chair, which was\nclose to the table, and snuffed the candle which stood near a basket of\ncolored scraps such as, without doubt, had made the harlequin curtain.\n\n\"Yer won't mind me goin' on with me bit o' work?\" she chirped.\n\n\"Tell 'im wot it is,\" Glad suggested.\n\n\"They come from a dressmaker as is in a small way,\" designating the\nscraps by a gesture.  \"I clean up for 'er an' she lets me 'ave 'em.  I\nmake 'em up into anythink I can--pin-cushions an' bags an' curtings an'\nballs.  Nobody'd think wot they run to sometimes. Now an' then I sell\nsome of 'em. Wot I can't sell I give away.\"\n\n\"Drunken Bet's biby plays with 'er ball all day,\" said Glad.\n\n\"Ah!\" said Miss Montaubyn, drawing out a long needleful of thread, \"Bet,\nSHE thinks it worse than it is.\"\n\n\"Could it be worse?\" asked Dart. \"Could anything be worse than\neverything is?\"\n\n\"Lots,\" suggested Glad; \"might 'ave broke your back, might 'ave a fever,\nmight be in jail for knifin' someone.  'E wants to 'ear you talk, Miss\nMontaubyn; tell 'im all about yerself.\"\n\n\"Me!\" her expectant eyes on him. \"'E wouldn't want to 'ear it.  I\nshouldn't want to 'ear it myself. Bein' on the 'alls when yer a pretty\ngirl ain't an 'elpful life; an' bein' took up an' dropped down till yer\ndropped in the gutter an' don't know 'ow to get out--it's wot yer\nmustn't let yer mind go back to.\"\n\n\"That's wot the lidy said,\" called out Glad.  \"Tell 'im about the lidy.\nShe doesn't even know who she was.\" The remark was tossed to Dart.\n\n\"Never even 'eard 'er name,\" with unabated cheer said Miss Montaubyn.\n\"She come an' she went an' me too low to do anything but lie an' look at\n'er and listen.  An' 'Which of us two is mad?' I ses to myself.  But I\nlay thinkin' and thinkin'--an' it was so cheerfle I couldn't get it out\nof me 'ead--nor never 'ave since.\"\n\n\"What did she say?\"\n\n\"I couldn't remember the words--it was the way they took away things a\nbody's afraid of.  It was about things never 'avin' really been like\nwot we thought they was. Godamighty now, there ain't a bit of 'arm in\n'im.\"\n\n\"What?\" he said with a start.\n\n\"'E never done the accidents and the trouble.  It was us as went out of\nthe light into the dark.  If we'd kep' in the light all the time, an'\nthought about it, an' talked about it, we'd never 'ad nothin' else.\n'Tain't punishment neither.  'T ain't nothin' but the dark--an' the dark\nain't nothin' but the light bein' away. 'Keep in the light,' she ses,\n'never think of nothin' else, an' then you'll begin an' see things.\nEverybody's been afraid.  There ain't no need. You believe THAT.'\"\n\n\"Believe?\" said Dart heavily.\n\nShe nodded.\n\n\"'Yes,' ses I to 'er, 'that's where the trouble comes in--believin'.'\nAnd she answers as cool as could be:  'Yes, it is,' she ses, 'we've all\nbeen thinkin' we've been believin', an' none of us 'as.  If we 'ad what\n'd there be to be afraid of?  If we believed a king was givin' us our\nlivin' an' takin' care of us who'd be afraid of not 'avin' enough to\neat?'\"\n\n\"Who?\" groaned Dart.  He sat hanging his head and staring at the floor.\nThis was another phase of the dream.\n\n\"'Where is 'E?' I ses.  ''Im as breaks old women's legs an' crushes\nbabies under wheels--so as they'll be resigned?'  An' all of a sudden\nshe calls out quite loud:  'Nowhere,' she ses.  'An' never was.  But 'Im\nas stretched forth the 'eavens an' laid the foundations of the earth,\n'Im as is the Life an' Love of the world, 'E's 'ERE!  Stretch out yer\n'and,' she ses, 'an' call out, \"Speak, Lord, thy servant 'eareth,\" an'\nye'll 'ear an' SEE.\n\n\"'An' never you stop sayin' it--let yer 'eart beat it an' yer breath\nbreathe it--an' yer 'll find yer goin' about laughin' soft to yerself\nan' lovin' everythin' as if it was yer own child at breast.  An' no 'arm\ncan come to yer.  Try it when yer go 'ome.'\"\n\n\"Did you?\" asked Dart.\n\nGlad answered for her with a tremulous--yes it was a TREMULOUS--giggle,\na weirdly moved little sound.\n\n\"When she wakes in the mornin' she ses to 'erself, 'Good things is goin'\nto come to-day--cheerfle things.'  When there's a knock at the door she\nses, 'Somethin' friendly's comin' in.'  An' when Drunken Bet's makin' a\nrow an' ragin' an' tearin' an' threatenin' to 'ave 'er eyes out of 'er\nfice, she ses, 'Lor, Bet, yer don't mean a word of it--yer a friend to\nevery woman in the 'ouse.'  When she don't know which way to turn, she\nstands still an' ses, 'Speak, Lord, thy servant 'eareth,' an' then she\ndoes wotever next comes into 'er mind--an' she says it's allus the\nright answer. Sometimes,\" sheepishly, \"I've tried it myself--p'raps it's\ntrue.  I did it this mornin' when I sat down an' pulled me sack over me\n'ead on the bridge.  Polly 'd been cryin' so loud all night I'd got a\nbit low in me stummick an'--\"  She stopped suddenly and turned on Dart\nas if light had flashed across her mind.  \"Dunno nothin' about it,\" she\nstammered, \"but I SAID it--just like she does--an' YOU come!\"\n\nPlainly she had uttered whatever words she had used in the form of a\nsort of incantation, and here was the result in the living body of this\nman sitting before her.  She stared hard at him, repeating her words:\n\"YOU come.  Yes, you did.\"\n\n\"It was the answer,\" said Miss Montaubyn, with entire simplicity as she\nbit off her thread, \"that's wot it was.\"\n\nAntony Dart lifted his heavy head.\n\n\"You believe it,\" he said.\n\n\"I 'm livin' on believin' it,\" she said confidingly.  \"I ain't got\nnothin' else.  An' answers keeps comin' and comin'.\"\n\n\"What answers?\"\n\n\"Bits o' work--an' things as 'elps.  Glad there, she's one.\"\n\n\"Aw,\" said Glad, \"I ain't nothin'. I likes to 'ear yer tell about it.\nShe ses,\" to Dart again, a little slowly, as she watched his face with\ncuriously questioning eyes--\"she ses 'E'S in the room--same as 'E's\neverywhere--in this 'ere room.  Sometimes she talks out loud to 'Im.\"\n\n\"What!\" cried Dart, startled again.\n\nThe strange Majestic Awful Idea--the Deity of the Ages--to be spoken of\nas a mere unfeared Reality! And even as the vaguely formed thought\nsprang in his brain he started once more, suddenly confronted by the\nmeaning his sense of shock implied.  What had all the sermons of all the\ncenturies been preaching but that it was Reality?  What had all the\ninfidels of every age contended but that it was Unreal, and the folly of\na dream?  He had never thought of himself as an infidel; perhaps it\nwould have shocked him to be called one, though he was not quite sure.\nBut that a little superannuated dancer at music-halls, battered and worn\nby an unlawful life, should sit and smile in absolute faith at such a--a\nsuperstition as this, stirred something like awe in him.\n\nFor she was smiling in entire acquiescence.\n\n\"It's what the curick ses,\" she enlarged radiantly.  \"Though 'e don t\nbelieve it, pore young man; 'e on'y thinks 'e does.  'It's for 'igh an'\nlow,' 'e ses, 'for you an' me as well as for them as is royal fambleys.\nThe Almighty 'E's EVERYWHERE!' 'Yes,' ses I, 'I've felt 'Im 'ere--as\nnear as y' are yerself, sir, I 'ave--an' I've spoke to 'Im.\"'\n\n\"What did the curate say?\" Dart asked, amazed.\n\n\"Seemed like it frightened 'im a bit.  'We mustn't be too bold, Miss\nMontaubyn, my dear,' 'e ses, for 'e's a kind young man as ever lived,\nan' often ses 'my dear' to them 'e's comfortin'.  But yer see the lidy\n'ad gave me a Bible o' me own an' I'd set 'ere an' read it, an' read it\nan' learned verses to say to meself when I was in bed--an' I'd got ter\nfeel like it was someone talkin' to me an' makin' me understand.  So I\nses, ''T ain't boldness we're warned against; it's not lovin' an'\ntrustin' enough, an' not askin' an' believin' TRUE.  Don't yer remember\nwot it ses:  \"I, even I, am 'e that comforteth yer.  Who art thou that\nthou art afraid of man that shall die an' the son of man that shall be\nmade as grass, an' forgetteth Jehovah thy Creator, that stretched forth\nthe 'eavens an' laid the foundations of the earth?\" an' \"I've covered\nthee with the shadder of me 'and,\" it ses; an' \"I will go before thee\nan' make the rough places smooth;\" an' \"'Itherto ye 'ave asked nothin'\nin my name; ask therefore that ye may receive, an' yer joy may be made\nfull.\"'  An' 'e looked down on the floor as if 'e was doin' some 'ard\nthinkin', pore young man, an' 'e ses, quite sudden an' shaky, 'Lord, I\nbelieve, 'elp thou my unbelief,' an' 'e ses it as if 'e was in trouble\nan' didn't know 'e'd spoke out loud.\"\n\n\"Where--how did you come upon your verses?\" said Dart.  \"How did you\nfind them?\"\n\n\"Ah,\" triumphantly, \"they was all answers--they was the first answers I\never 'ad.  When I first come 'ome an' it seemed as if I was goin' to be\nswep' away in the dirt o' the street--one day when I was near drove wild\nwith cold an' 'unger, I set down on the floor an' I dragged the Bible to\nme an' I ses:  'There ain't nothin' on earth or in 'ell as 'll 'elp me.\nI'm goin' to do wot the lidy said--mad or not.'  An' I 'eld the book--\nan' I 'eld my breath, too, 'cos it was like waitin' for the end o' the\nworld--an' after a bit I 'ears myself call out in a 'oller whisper,\n'Speak, Lord, thy servant 'eareth. Show me a 'ope.'  An' I was tremblin'\nall over when I opened the book.  An' there it was!  'I will go before\nthee an' make the rough places smooth, I will break in pieces the doors\nof brass and will cut in sunder the bars of iron.'  An' I knowed it was\na answer.\"\n\n\"You--knew--it--was an answer?\"\n\n\"Wot else was it?\" with a shining face.  \"I'd arst for it, an' there it\nwas.  An' in about a hour Glad come runnin' up 'ere, an' she'd 'ad a bit\no' luck--\"\n\n\"'T wasn't nothin' much,\" Glad broke in deprecatingly, \"on'y I'd got\nsomethin' to eat an' a bit o' fire.\"\n\n\"An' she made me go an' 'ave a 'earty meal, an' set an' warm meself. An'\nshe was that cheerfle an' full o' pluck, she 'elped me to forget about\nthe things that was makin' me into a madwoman.  SHE was the answer--\nsame as the book 'ad promised.  They comes in different wyes the answers\ndoes.  Bless yer, they don't come in claps of thunder an' streaks o'\nlightenin'--they just comes easy an' natural--so's sometimes yer\ndon't think for a minit or two that they're answers at all.  But it\ncomes to yer in a bit an' yer 'eart stands still for joy. An' ever since\nthen I just go to me book an' arst.  P'raps,\" her smile an illuminating\nthing, \"me bein' the low an' pore in spirit at the beginnin', an'\nsettin' 'ere all alone by me-self day in an' day out, just thinkin' it\nall over--an' arstin'--an' waitin'--p'raps light was gave me 'cos I was\nin such a little place an' in the dark.  But I ain't pore in spirit now.\nLor', no, yer can't be when yer've on'y got to believe.  'An' 'itherto\nye 'ave arst nothin' in my name; arst therefore that ye may receive an'\nyer joy be made full.'\"\n\n\"Am I sitting here listening to an old female reprobate's disquisition\non religion?\" passed through Antony Dart's mind.  \"Why am I listening? I\nam doing it because here is a creature who BELIEVES--knowing no\ndoctrine, knowing no church. She BELIEVES--she thinks she KNOWS her\nDeity is by her side.  She is not afraid.  To her simpleness the awful\nUnknown is the Known--and WITH her.\"\n\n\"Suppose it were true,\" he uttered aloud, in response to a sense of\ninward tremor, \"suppose--it--were--TRUE?\"  And he was not speaking\neither to the woman or the girl, and his forehead was damp.\n\n\"Gawd!\" said Glad, her chin almost on her knees, her eyes staring\nfearsomely.  \"S'pose it was--an' us sittin' 'ere an' not knowin' it--an'\nno one knowin' it--nor gettin' the good of it.  Sime as if--\" pondering\nhard in search of simile, \"sime as if no one 'ad never knowed about\n'lectricity, an' there wasn't no 'lectric lights nor no 'lectric\nnothin'.  Onct nobody knowed, an' all the sime it was there--jest\nwaitin'.\"\n\nHer fantastic laugh ended for her with a little choking, vaguely\nhysteric sound.\n\n\"Blimme,\" she said.  \"Ain't it queer, us not knowin'--IF IT'S TRUE.\"\n\nAntony Dart bent forward in his chair.  He looked far into the eyes of\nthe ex-dancer as if some unseen thing within them might answer him.\nMiss Montaubyn herself for the moment he did not see.\n\n\"What,\" he stammered hoarsely, his voice broken with awe, \"what of the\nhideous wrongs--the woes and horrors--and hideous wrongs?\"\n\n\"There wouldn't be none if WE was right--if we never thought nothin' but\n'Good's comin'--good 's 'ere.'  If we everyone of us thought it--every\nminit of every day.\"\n\nShe did not know she was speaking of a millennium--the end of the world.\nShe sat by her one candle, threading her needle and believing she was\nspeaking of To-day.\n\nHe laughed a hollow laugh.\n\n\"If we were right!\" he said.  \"It would take long--long--long--to make\nus all so.\"\n\n\"It would be slow p'raps.  Well, so it would--but good comes quick for\nthem as begins callin' it.  It's been quick for ME,\" drawing her thread\nthrough the needle's eye triumphantly.  \"Lor', yes, me legs is better--\nme luck's better--people's better.  Bless yer, yes!\"\n\n\"It's true,\" said Glad; \"she gets on somehow.  Things comes.  She never\nwants no drink.  Me now,\" she applied to Miss Montaubyn, \"if I took it\nup same as you--wot'd come to a gal like me?\"\n\n\"Wot ud yer want ter come?\" Dart saw that in her mind was an absolute\nlack of any premonition of obstacle.  \"Wot'd yer arst fer in yer own\nmind?\"\n\nGlad reflected profoundly.\n\n\"Polly,\" she said, \"she wants to go 'ome to 'er mother an' to the\ncountry. I ain't got no mother an' wot I 'ear of the country seems like\nI'd get tired of it.  Nothin' but quiet an' lambs an' birds an' things\ngrowin.' Me, I likes things goin' on.  I likes people an' 'and organs\nan' 'buses.  I'd stay 'ere--same as I told YOU,\" with a jerk of her hand\ntoward Dart. \"An' do things in the court--if I 'ad a bit o' money.  I\ndon't want to live no gay life when I 'm a woman. It's too 'ard.  Us\npore uns ends too bad.  Wisht I knowed I could get on some 'ow.\"\n\n\"Good 'll come,\" said Miss Montaubyn.  \"Just you say the same as me\nevery mornin'--'Good's fillin' the world, an' some of it's comin' to me.\nIt's bein' sent--an' I 'm goin' to meet it.  It's comin'--it's\ncomin'.'\"  She bent forward and touched the girl's shoulder with her\nastonishing eyes alight.  \"Bless yer, wot's in my room's in yours; Lor',\nyes.\"\n\nGlad's eyes stared into hers, they became mysteriously, almost\nawesomely, astonishing also.\n\n\"Is it?\" she breathed in a hushed voice.\n\n\"Yes, Lor', yes!  When yer get up in the mornin' you just stand still\nan' ARST it.  'Speak, Lord,' ses you; 'speak, Lord--'\"\n\n\"Thy servant 'eareth,\" ended Glad's hushed speech.  \"Blimme, but I 'm\ngoin' to try it!\"\n\nPerhaps the brain of her saw it still as an incantation, perhaps the\nsoul of her, called up strangely out of the dark and still new-born and\nblind and vague, saw it vaguely and half blindly as something else.\n\nDart was wondering which of these things were true.\n\n\"We've never been expectin' nothin' that's good,\" said Miss Montaubyn.\n\"We 're allus expectin' the other.  Who isn't?  I was allus expectin'\nrheumatiz an' 'unger an' cold an' starvin' old age.  Wot was you lookin'\nfor?\" to Dart.\n\nHe looked down on the floor and answered heavily.\n\n\"Failing brain--failing life--despair--death!\"\n\n\"None of 'em's comin'--if yer don't call 'em.  Stand still an' listen\nfor the other.  It's the other that's TRUE.\"\n\nShe was without doubt amazing. She chirped like a bird singing on a\nbough, rejoicing in token of the shining of the sun.\n\n\"It's wot yer can work on--this,\" said Glad.  \"The curick--'e's a good\nsort an' no' 'arm in 'im--but 'e ses:  'Trouble an' 'unger is ter teach\nyer ter submit.  Accidents an' coughs as tears yer lungs is sent you to\nprepare yer for 'eaven.  If yer loves 'Im as sends 'em, yer 'll go\nthere.'  ''Ave yer ever bin?' ses I. ''Ave yer ever saw anyone that's\nbin?  'Ave yer ever saw anyone that's saw anyone that's bin?' 'No,' 'e\nses.  'Don't, me girl, don't!' 'Garn,' I ses; 'tell me somethin' as 'll\ndo me some good afore I'm dead!  'Eaven's too far off.'\"\n\n\"The kingdom of 'eaven is at 'and,\" said Miss Montaubyn.  \"Bless yer,\nyes, just 'ere.\"\n\nAntony Dart glanced round the room.  It was a strange place.  But\nsomething WAS here.  Magic, was it?  Frenzy--dreams--what?\n\nHe heard from below a sudden murmur and crying out in the street.  Miss\nMontaubyn heard it and stopped in her sewing, holding her needle and\nthread extended.\n\nGlad heard it and sprang to her feet.\n\n\"Somethin's 'appened,\" she cried out.  \"Someone's 'urt.\"\n\nShe was out of the room in a breath's space.  She stood outside\nlistening a few seconds and darted back to the open door, speaking\nthrough it.  They could hear below commotion, exclamations, the wail of\na child.\n\n\"Somethin's 'appened to Bet!\" she cried out again.  \"I can 'ear the\nchild.\"\n\nShe was gone and flying down the staircase; Antony Dart and Miss\nMontaubyn rose together.  The tumult was increasing; people were running\nabout in the court, and it was plain a crowd was forming by the magic\nwhich calls up crowds as from nowhere about the door.  The child's\nscreams rose shrill above the noise.  It was no small thing which had\noccurred.\n\n\"I must go,\" said Miss Montaubyn, limping away from her table.  \"P'raps\nI can 'elp.  P'raps you can 'elp, too,\" as he followed her.\n\nThey were met by Glad at the threshold.  She had shot back to them,\npanting.\n\n\"She was blind drunk,\" she said, \"an' she went out to get more.  She\ntried to cross the street an' fell under a car.  She'll be dead in five\nminits. I'm goin' for the biby.\"\n\nDart saw Miss Montaubyn step back into her room.  He turned\ninvoluntarily to look at her.\n\nShe stood still a second--so still that it seemed as if she was not\ndrawing mortal breath.  Her astonishing, expectant eyes closed\nthemselves, and yet in closing spoke expectancy still.\n\n\"Speak, Lord,\" she said softly, but as if she spoke to Something whose\nnearness to her was such that her hand might have touched it.  \"Speak,\nLord, thy servant 'eareth.\"\n\nAntony Dart almost felt his hair rise.  He quaked as she came near, her\npoor clothes brushing against him.  He drew back to let her pass first,\nand followed her leading.\n\nThe court was filled with men, women, and children, who surged about the\ndoorway, talking, crying, and protesting against each other's crowding.\nDart caught a glimpse of a policeman fighting his way through with a\ndoctor.  A dishevelled woman with a child at her dirty, bare breast had\ngot in and was talking loudly.\n\n\"Just outside the court it was,\" she proclaimed, \"an' I saw it.  If\nshe'd bin 'erself it couldn't 'ave 'appened.  'No time for 'osspitles,'\nses I.  She's not twenty breaths to dror; let 'er die in 'er own bed,\npore thing!\"  And both she and her baby breaking into wails at one and\nthe same time, other women, some hysteric, some maudlin with gin, joined\nthem in a terrified outburst.\n\n\"Get out, you women,\" commanded the doctor, who had forced his way\nacross the threshold.  \"Send them away, officer,\" to the policeman.\n\nThere were others to turn out of the room itself, which was crowded with\nmorbid or terrified creatures, all making for confusion.  Glad had\nseized the child and was forcing her way out into such air as there was\noutside.\n\nThe bed--a strange and loathly thing--stood by the empty, rusty\nfireplace.  Drunken Bet lay on it, a bundle of clothing over which the\ndoctor bent for but a few minutes before he turned away.\n\nAntony Dart, standing near the door, heard Miss Montaubyn speak to him\nin a whisper.\n\n\"May I go to 'er?\" and the doctor nodded.\n\nShe limped lightly forward and her small face was white, but expectant\nstill.  What could she expect now--O Lord, what?\n\nAn extraordinary thing happened. An abnormal silence fell.  The owners\nof such faces as on stretched necks caught sight of her seemed in a\nflash to communicate with others in the crowd.\n\n\"Jinny Montaubyn!\" someone whispered.  And \"Jinny Montaubyn\" was passed\nalong, leaving an awed stirring in its wake.  Those whom the pressure\noutside had crushed against the wall near the window in a passionate\nhurry, breathed on and rubbed the panes that they might lay their faces\nto them.  One tore out the rags stuffed in a broken place and listened\nbreathlessly.\n\nJinny Montaubyn was kneeling down and laying her small old hand on the\nmuddied forehead.  She held it there a second or so and spoke in a voice\nwhose low clearness brought back at once to Dart the voice in which she\nhad spoken to the Something upstairs.\n\n\"Bet,\" she said, \"Bet.\"  And then more soft still and yet more clear,\n\"Bet, my dear.\"\n\nIt seemed incredible, but it was a fact.  Slowly the lids of the woman's\neyes lifted and the pupils fixed themselves on Jinny Montaubyn, who\nleaned still closer and spoke again.\n\n\"'T ain't true,\" she said.  \"Not this.  'T ain't TRUE.  There IS NO\nDEATH,\" slow and soft, but passionately distinct.  \"THERE--IS--NO--\nDEATH.\"\n\nThe muscles of the woman's face twisted it into a rueful smile.  The\nthree words she dragged out were so faint that perhaps none but Dart's\nstrained ears heard them.\n\n\"Wot--price--ME?\"\n\nThe soul of her was loosening fast and straining away, but Jinny\nMontaubyn followed it.\n\n\"THERE--IS--NO--DEATH,\" and her low voice had the tone of a slender\nsilver trumpet.  \"In a minit yer 'll know--in a minit.  Lord,\" lifting\nher expectant face, \"show her the wye.\"\n\nMysteriously the clouds were clearing from the sodden face--mysteriously.\nMiss Montaubyn watched them as they were swept away!  A minute--two\nminutes--and they were gone.  Then she rose noiselessly and stood\nlooking down, speaking quite simply as if to herself.\n\n\"Ah,\" she breathed, \"she DOES know now--fer sure an' certain.\"\n\nThen Antony Dart, turning slightly, realized that a man who had entered\nthe house and been standing near him, breathing with light quickness,\nsince the moment Miss Montaubyn had knelt, was plainly the person Glad\nhad called the \"curick,\" and that he had bowed his head and covered his\neyes with a hand which trembled.\n\nIV\n\nHe was a young man with an eager soul, and his work in Apple Blossom\nCourt and places like it had torn him many ways.  Religious conventions\nestablished through centuries of custom had not prepared him for life\namong the submerged. He had struggled and been appalled, he had wrestled\nin prayer and felt himself unanswered, and in repentance of the feeling\nhad scourged himself with thorns.  Miss Montaubyn, returning from the\nhospital, had filled him at first with horror and protest.\n\n\"But who knows--who knows?\" he said to Dart, as they stood and talked\ntogether afterward, \"Faith as a little child.  That is literally hers.\nAnd I was shocked by it--and tried to destroy it, until I suddenly saw\nwhat I was doing.  I was--in my cloddish egotism--trying to show her\nthat she was irreverent BECAUSE she could believe what in my soul I do\nnot, though I dare not admit so much even to myself.  She took from some\nstrange passing visitor to her tortured bedside what was to her a\nrevelation.  She heard it first as a child hears a story of magic.  When\nshe came out of the hospital, she told it as if it was one.  I--I--\" he\nbit his lips and moistened them, \"argued with her and reproached her.\nChrist the Merciful, forgive me!  She sat in her squalid little room\nwith her magic--sometimes in the dark--sometimes without fire, and she\nclung to it, and loved it and asked it to help her, as a child asks its\nfather for bread.  When she was answered--and God forgive me again for\ndoubting that the simple good that came to her WAS an answer--when any\nsmall help came to her, she was a radiant thing, and without a shadow of\ndoubt in her eyes told me of it as proof--proof that she had been heard.\nWhen things went wrong for a day and the fire was out again and the room\ndark, she said, 'I 'aven't kept near enough--I 'aven't trusted TRUE.  It\nwill be gave me soon,' and when once at such a time I said to her, 'We\nmust learn to say, Thy will be done,' she smiled up at me like a happy\nbaby and answered:\n\n\"'Thy will be done on earth AS IT IS IN 'EAVEN.  Lor', there's no cold\nthere, nor no 'unger nor no cryin' nor pain. That's the way the will is\ndone in 'eaven.  That's wot I arst for all day long--for it to be done\non earth as it is in 'eaven.'  What could I say?  Could I tell her that\nthe will of the Deity on the earth he created was only the will to do\nevil--to give pain--to crush the creature made in His own image.  What\nelse do we mean when we say under all horror and agony that befalls, 'It\nis God's will--God's will be done.' Base unbeliever though I am, I could\nnot speak the words.  Oh, she has something we have not.  Her poor,\nlittle misspent life has changed itself into a shining thing, though it\nshines and glows only in this hideous place. She herself does not know\nof its shining.  But Drunken Bet would stagger up to her room and ask to\nbe told what she called her 'pantermine' stories.  I have seen her there\nsitting listening--listening with strange quiet on her and dull yearning\nin her sodden eyes.  So would other and worse women go to her, and I,\nwho had struggled with them, could see that she had reached some remote\nlonging in their beings which I had never touched.  In time the seed\nwould have stirred to life--it is beginning to stir even now.  During\nthe months since she came back to the court--though they have laughed at\nher--both men and women have begun to see her as a creature weirdly set\napart.  Most of them feel something like awe of her; they half believe\nher prayers to be bewitchments, but they want them on their side. They\nhave never wanted mine.  That I have known--KNOWN.  She believes that\nher Deity is in Apple Blossom Court--in the dire holes its people live\nin, on the broken stairway, in every nook and awful cranny of it--a\ngreat Glory we will not see--only waiting to be called and to answer. Do\n_I_ believe it--do you--do any of those anointed of us who preach each\nday so glibly 'God is EVERYWHERE'? Who is the one who believes?  If\nthere were such a man he would go about as Moses did when 'He wist not\nthat his face shone.'\"\n\nThey had gone out together and were standing in the fog in the court.\nThe curate removed his hat and passed his handkerchief over his damp\nforehead, his breath coming and going almost sobbingly, his eyes staring\nstraight before him into the yellowness of the haze.\n\n\"Who,\" he said after a moment of singular silence, \"who are you?\"\n\nAntony Dart hesitated a few seconds, and at the end of his pause he put\nhis hand into his overcoat pocket.\n\n\"If you will come upstairs with me to the room where the girl Glad\nlives, I will tell you,\" he said, \"but before we go I want to hand\nsomething over to you.\"\n\nThe curate turned an amazed gaze upon him.\n\n\"What is it?\" he asked.\n\nDart withdrew his hand from his pocket, and the pistol was in it.\n\n\"I came out this morning to buy this,\" he said.  \"I intended--never mind\nwhat I intended.  A wrong turn taken in the fog brought me here.  Take\nthis thing from me and keep it.\"\n\nThe curate took the pistol and put it into his own pocket without\ncomment. In the course of his labors he had seen desperate men and\ndesperate things many times.  He had even been--at moments--a desperate\nman thinking desperate things himself, though no human being had ever\nsuspected the fact.  This man had faced some tragedy, he could see. Had\nhe been on the verge of a crime--had he looked murder in the eyes? What\nhad made him pause?  Was it possible that the dream of Jinny Montaubyn\nbeing in the air had reached his brain--his being?\n\nHe looked almost appealingly at him, but he only said aloud:\n\n\"Let us go upstairs, then.\"\n\nSo they went.\n\nAs they passed the door of the room where the dead woman lay Dart went\nin and spoke to Miss Montaubyn, who was still there.\n\n\"If there are things wanted here,\" he said, \"this will buy them.\"  And\nhe put some money into her hand.\n\nShe did not seem surprised at the incongruity of his shabbiness\nproducing money.\n\n\"Well, now,\" she said, \"I WAS wonderin' an' askin'.  I'd like 'er clean\nan' nice, an' there's milk wanted bad for the biby.\"\n\nIn the room they mounted to Glad was trying to feed the child with bread\nsoftened in tea.  Polly sat near her looking on with restless, eager\neyes.  She had never seen anything of her own baby but its limp newborn\nand dead body being carried away out of sight.  She had not even dared\nto ask what was done with such poor little carrion.  The tyranny of the\nlaw of life made her want to paw and touch this lately born thing, as\nher agony had given her no fruit of her own body to touch and paw and\nnuzzle and caress as mother creatures will whether they be women or\ntigresses or doves or female cats.\n\n\"Let me hold her, Glad,\" she half whimpered.  \"When she's fed let me\nget her to sleep.\"\n\n\"All right,\" Glad answered; \"we could look after 'er between us well\nenough.\"\n\nThe thief was still sitting on the hearth, but being full fed and\ncomfortable for the first time in many a day, he had rested his head\nagainst the wall and fallen into profound sleep.\n\n\"Wot's up?\" said Glad when the two men came in.  \"Is anythin'\n'appenin'?\"\n\n\"I have come up here to tell you something,\" Dart answered.  \"Let us sit\ndown again round the fire.  It will take a little time.\"\n\nGlad with eager eyes on him handed the child to Polly and sat down\nwithout a moment's hesitance, avid of what was to come.  She nudged the\nthief with friendly elbow and he started up awake.\n\n\"'E's got somethin' to tell us,\" she explained.  \"The curick's come\nup to 'ear it, too.  Sit 'ere, Polly,\" with elbow jerk toward the bundle\nof sacks.  \"It's got its stummick full an' it'll go to sleep fast\nenough.\"\n\nSo they sat again in the weird circle.  Neither the strangeness of the\ngroup nor the squalor of the hearth were of a nature to be new things to\nthe curate.  His eyes fixed themselves on Dart's face, as did the eyes\nof the thief, the beggar, and the young thing of the street.  No one\nglanced away from him.\n\nHis telling of his story was almost monotonous in its semi-reflective\nquietness of tone.  The strangeness to himself--though it was a\nstrangeness he accepted absolutely without protest--lay in his telling\nit at all, and in a sense of his knowledge that each of these creatures\nwould understand and mysteriously know what depths he had touched this\nday.\n\n\"Just before I left my lodgings this morning,\" he said, \"I found myself\nstanding in the middle of my room and speaking to Something aloud.  I\ndid not know I was going to speak.  I did not know what I was speaking\nto.  I heard my own voice cry out in agony, 'Lord, Lord, what shall I do\nto be saved?'\"\n\nThe curate made a sudden movement in his place and his sallow young\nface flushed.  But he said nothing.\n\nGlad's small and sharp countenance became curious.\n\n\"'Speak, Lord, thy servant 'eareth,'\" she quoted tentatively.\n\n\"No,\" answered Dart; \"it was not like that.  I had never thought of such\nthings.  I believed nothing. I was going out to buy a pistol and when I\nreturned intended to blow my brains out.\"\n\n\"Why?\" asked Glad, with passionately intent eyes; \"why?\"\n\n\"Because I was worn out and done for, and all the world seemed worn out\nand done for.  And among other things I believed I was beginning slowly\nto go mad.\"\n\nFrom the thief there burst forth a low groan and he turned his face to\nthe wall.\n\n\"I've been there,\" he said; \"I 'm near there now.\"\n\nDart took up speech again.\n\n\"There was no answer--none. As I stood waiting--God knows for what--the\ndead stillness of the room was like the dead stillness of the grave. And\nI went out saying to my soul, 'This is what happens to the fool who\ncries aloud in his pain.'\"\n\n\"I've cried aloud,\" said the thief, \"and sometimes it seemed as if an\nanswer was coming--but I always knew it never would!\" in a tortured\nvoice.\n\n\"'T ain't fair to arst that wye,\" Glad put in with shrewd logic.\n\n\"Miss Montaubyn she allers knows it WILL come--an' it does.\"\n\n\"Something--not myself--turned my feet toward this place,\" said Dart. \"I\nwas thrust from one thing to another.  I was forced to see and hear\nthings close at hand.  It has been as if I was under a spell.  The woman\nin the room below--the woman lying dead!\"  He stopped a second, and then\nwent on:  \"There is too much that is crying out aloud.  A man such as I\nam--it has FORCED itself upon me--cannot leave such things and give\nhimself to the dust.  I cannot explain clearly because I am not thinking\nas I am accustomed to think.  A change has come upon me.  I shall not\nuse the pistol--as I meant to use it.\"\n\nGlad made a friendly clutch at the sleeve of his shabby coat.\n\n\"Right O!\" she cried.  \"That's it!  You buck up sime as I told yer. Y'\nain't stony broke an' there's 'allers to-morrer.\"\n\nAntony Dart's expression was weirdly retrospective.\n\n\"I did not think so this morning,\" he answered.\n\n\"But there is,\" said the girl. \"Ain't there now, curick?  There's a lot\no' work in yer yet; yer could do all sorts o' things if y' ain't too\nproud.  I'll 'elp yer.  So 'll the curick.  Y' ain't found out yet what\na little folks can live on till luck turns.  Me, I'm goin' to try Miss\nMontaubyn's wye.  Le's both try.  Le's believe things is comin'. Le's\nget 'er to talk to us some more.\"\n\nThe curate was thinking the thing over deeply.\n\n\"Yer see,\" Glad enlarged cheerfully, \"yer look almost like a gentleman.\nP'raps yer can write a good 'and an' spell all right.  Can yer?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"I think, perhaps,\" the curate began reflectively, \"particularly if you\ncan write well, I might be able to get you some work.\"\n\n\"I do not want work,\" Dart answered slowly.  \"At least I do not want the\nkind you would be likely to offer me.\"\n\nThe curate felt a shock, as if cold water had been dashed over him.\nSomehow it had not once occurred to him that the man could be one of the\neducated degenerate vicious for whom no power to help lay in any hands--\nyet he was not the common vagrant--and he was plainly on the point of\nproducing an excuse for refusing work.\n\nThe other man, seeing his start and his amazed, troubled flush, put out\na hand and touched his arm apologetically.\n\n\"I beg your pardon,\" he said. \"One of the things I was going to tell\nyou--I had not finished--was that I AM what is called a gentleman. I am\nalso what the world knows as a rich man.  I am Sir Oliver Holt.\"\n\nEach member of the party gazed at him aghast.  It was an enormous name\nto claim.  Even the two female creatures knew what it stood for.  It was\nthe name which represented the greatest wealth and power in the world of\nfinance and schemes of business. It stood for financial influence which\ncould change the face of national fortunes and bring about crises.  It\nwas known throughout the world.  Yesterday the newspaper rumor that its\nowner had mysteriously left England had caused men on 'Change to discuss\npossibilities together with lowered voices.\n\nGlad stared at the curate.  For the first time she looked disturbed and\nalarmed.\n\n\"Blimme,\" she ejaculated, \"'e's gone off 'is nut, pore chap!--'e's\ngone off it!\"\n\n\"No,\" the man answered, \"you shall come to me\"--he hesitated a second\nwhile a shade passed over his eyes--\"TO-MORROW.  And you shall see.\"\n\nHe rose quietly to his feet and the curate rose also.  Abnormal as the\nclimax was, it was to be seen that there was no mistake about the\nrevelation.  The man was a creature of authority and used to carrying\nconviction by his unsupported word. That made itself, by some clear,\nunspoken method, plain.\n\n\"You are Sir Oliver Holt!  And a few hours ago you were on the point\nof--\"\n\n\"Ending it all--in an obscure lodging.  Afterward the earth would have\nbeen shovelled on to a work-house coffin.  It was an awful thing.\" He\nshook off a passionate shudder. \"There was no wealth on earth that could\ngive me a moment's ease--sleep--hope--life.  The whole world was full\nof things I loathed the sight and thought of.  The doctors said my\ncondition was physical.  Perhaps it was--perhaps to-day has strangely\ngiven a healthful jolt to my nerves--perhaps I have been dragged away\nfrom the agony of morbidity and plunged into new intense emotions which\nhave saved me from the last thing and the worst--SAVED me!\"\n\nHe stopped suddenly and his face flushed, and then quite slowly turned\npale.\n\n\"SAVED ME!\" he repeated the words as the curate saw the awed blood\ncreepingly recede.  \"Who knows, who knows!  How many explanations one is\nready to give before one thinks of what we say we believe. Perhaps it\nwas--the Answer!\"\n\nThe curate bowed his head reverently.\n\n\"Perhaps it was.\"\n\nThe girl Glad sat clinging to her knees, her eyes wide and awed and with\na sudden gush of hysteric tears rushing down her cheeks.\n\n\"That's the wye!  That's the wye!\" she gulped out.  \"No one won't\nnever believe--they won't, NEVER.  That's what she sees, Miss Montaubyn.\nYou don't, 'E don't,\" with a jerk toward the curate.  \"I ain't nothin'\nbut ME, but blimme if I don't--blimme!\"\n\nSir Oliver Holt grew paler still. He felt as he had done when Jinny\nMontaubyn's poor dress swept against him.  His voice shook when he\nspoke.\n\n\"So do I,\" he said with a sudden deep catch of the breath; \"it was the\nAnswer.\"\n\nIn a few moments more he went to the girl Polly and laid a hand on her\nshoulder.\n\n\"I shall take you home to your mother,\" he said.  \"I shall take you\nmyself and care for you both.  She shall know nothing you are afraid of\nher hearing.  I shall ask her to bring up the child.  You will help\nher.\"\n\nThen he touched the thief, who got up white and shaking and with eyes\nmoist with excitement.\n\n\"You shall never see another man claim your thought because you have not\ntime or money to work it out. You will go with me.  There are to-morrows\nenough for you!\"\n\nGlad still sat clinging to her knees and with tears running, but the\nugliness of her sharp, small face was a thing an angel might have paused\nto see.\n\n\"You don't want to go away from here,\" Sir Oliver said to her, and she\nshook her head.\n\n\"No, not me.  I told yer wot I wanted.  Lemme do it.\"\n\n\"You shall,\" he answered, \"and I will help you.\"\n\nThe things which developed in Apple Blossom Court later, the things\nwhich came to each of those who had sat in the weird circle round the\nfire, the revelations of new existence which came to herself, aroused no\namazement in Jinny Montaubyn's mind.  She had asked and believed all\nthings--and all this was but another of the Answers.",
