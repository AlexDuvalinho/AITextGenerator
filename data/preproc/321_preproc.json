For that reason it begins with a pink tea and among the mingled odors of many delicate perfumes and the hale, frank smell of Caroline Testout roses. There had been a great number of debutantes \u201ccoming out\u201d that season in San Francisco by means of afternoon teas, pink, lavender, and otherwise. This particular tea was intended to celebrate the fact that Josie Herrick had arrived at that time of her life when she was to wear her hair high and her gowns long, and to have a \u201cday\u201d of her own quite distinct from that of her mother."}, {"size": 804, "text": "Ross Wilbur presented himself at the Herrick house on Pacific Avenue much too early upon the afternoon of Miss Herrick's tea. As he made, his way up the canvased stairs he was aware of a terrifying array of millinery and a disquieting staccato chatter of feminine voices in the parlors and reception-rooms on either side of the hallway. A single high hat in the room that had been set apart for the men's use confirmed him in his suspicions. \u201cMight have known it would be a hen party till six, anyhow,\u201d he muttered, swinging out of his overcoat. \u201cBet I don't know one girl in twenty down there now--all mamma's friends at this hour, and papa's maiden sisters, and Jo's school-teachers and governesses and music-teachers, and I don't know what all.\u201d When he went down he found it precisely as he expected."}, {"size": 757, "text": "He went up to Miss Herrick, where she stood receiving with her mother and two of the other girls, and allowed them to chaff him on his forlornness. \u201cMaybe I seem at my ease,\u201d said Ross Wilbur to them, \u201cbut really I am very much frightened. I'm going to run away as soon as it is decently possible, even before, unless you feed me.\u201d \u201cI believe you had luncheon not two hours ago,\u201d said Miss Herrick. \u201cCome along, though, and I'll give you some chocolate, and perhaps, if you're good, a stuffed olive. I got them just because I knew you liked them. I ought to stay here and receive, so I can't look after you for long.\u201d The two fought their way through the crowded rooms to the luncheon-table, and Miss Herrick got Wilbur his chocolate and his stuffed olives."}, {"size": 646, "text": "They sat down and talked in a window recess for a moment, Wilbur toeing-in in absurd fashion as he tried to make a lap for his plate. \u201cI thought,\u201d said Miss Herrick, \u201cthat you were going on the Ridgeways' yachting party this afternoon. Mrs. Ridgeway said she was counting on you. They are going out with the 'Petrel.'\u201d \u201cShe didn't count above a hundred, though,\u201d answered Wilbur. \u201cI got your bid first, so I regretted the yachting party; and I guess I'd have regretted it anyhow,\u201d and he grinned at her over his cup. \u201cNice man,\u201d she said--adding on the instant, \u201cI must go now, Ross.\u201d \u201cWait till I eat the sugar out of my cup,\u201d complained Wilbur."}, {"size": 811, "text": "\u201cTell me,\u201d he added, scraping vigorously at the bottom of the cup with the inadequate spoon; \u201ctell me, you're going to the hoe-down to-night?\u201d \u201cIf you mean the Assembly, yes, I am.\u201d \u201cWill you give me the first and last?\u201d \u201cI'll give you the first, and you can ask for the last then.\u201d \u201cLet's put it down; I know you'll forget it.\u201d Wilbur drew a couple of cards from his case. \u201cProgrammes are not good form any more,\u201d said Miss Herrick. \u201cForgetting a dance is worse.\u201d He made out the cards, writing on the one he kept for himself, \u201cFirst waltz--Jo.\u201d \u201cI must go back now,\u201d said Miss Herrick, getting up. \u201cIn that case I shall run--I'm afraid of girls.\u201d \u201cIt's a pity about you.\u201d \u201cI am; one girl, I don't say, but girl in the aggregate like this,\u201d and he pointed his chin toward the thronged parlors. \u201cIt un-mans me.\u201d"}, {"size": 661, "text": "\u201cGood-by, until to-night, about--?\u201dRoss Wilbur made his adieu to Mrs. Herrick and the girls who were receiving, and took himself away. As he came out of the house and stood for a moment on the steps, settling his hat gingerly upon his hair so as not to disturb the parting, he was not by any means an ill-looking chap. His good height was helped out by his long coat and his high silk hat, and there was plenty of jaw in the lower part of his face. Nor was his tailor altogether answerable for his shoulders. Three years before this time Ross Wilbur had pulled at No. 5 in his varsity boat in an Eastern college that was not accustomed to athletic discomfiture."}, {"size": 440, "text": "\u201cI wonder what I'm going to do with myself until supper time,\u201d he muttered, as he came down the steps, feeling for the middle of his stick. He found no immediate answer to his question. But the afternoon was fine, and he set off to walk in the direction of the town, with a half-formed idea of looking in at his club. At his club he found a letter in his box from his particular chum, who had been spending the month shooting elk in Oregon."}, {"size": 866, "text": "\u201cDear Old Man,\u201d it said, \u201cwill be back on the afternoon you receive this. Will hit the town on the three o'clock boat. Get seats for the best show going--my treat--and arrange to assimilate nutriment at the Poodle Dog--also mine. I've got miles of talk in me that I've got to reel off before midnight. Yours. \u201cJERRY.\u201d \u201cI've got a stand of horns for you, Ross, that are Glory Hallelujah.\u201d \u201cWell, I can't go,\u201d murmured Wilbur, as he remembered the Assembly that was to come off that night and his engaged dance with Jo Herrick. He decided that it would be best to meet Jerry as he came off the boat and tell him how matters stood. Then he resolved, since no one that he knew was in the club, and the instalment of the Paris weeklies had not arrived, that it would be amusing to go down to the water-front and loaf among the shipping until it was time for Jerry's boat."}, {"size": 776, "text": "Wilbur spent an hour along the wharves, watching the great grain ships consigned to \u201cCork for orders\u201d slowly gorging themselves with whole harvests of wheat from the San Joaquin Valley; lumber vessels for Durban and South African ports settling lower and lower to the water's level as forests of pine and redwood stratified themselves along their decks and in their holds; coal barges discharging from Nanaimo; busy little tugs coughing and nuzzling at the flanks of the deep-sea tramps, while hay barges and Italian whitehalls came and went at every turn. A Stockton River boat went by, her stern wheel churning along behind, like a huge net-reel; a tiny maelstrom of activity centred about an Alaska Commercial Company's steamboat that would clear for Dawson in the morning."}, {"size": 712, "text": "No quarter of one of the most picturesque cities in the world had more interest for Wilbur than the water-front. In the mile or so of shipping that stretched from the docks where the China steamships landed, down past the ferry slips and on to Meiggs's Wharf, every maritime nation in the world was represented. More than once Wilbur had talked to the loungers of the wharves, stevedores out of work, sailors between voyages, caulkers and ship chandlers' men looking--not too earnestly--for jobs; so that on this occasion, when a little, undersized fellow in dirty brown sweater and clothes of Barbary coast cut asked him for a match to light his pipe, Wilbur offered a cigar and passed the time of day with him."}, {"size": 600, "text": "Wilbur had not forgotten that he himself was dressed for an afternoon function. But the incongruity of the business was precisely what most amused him. After a time the fellow suggested drinks. Wilbur hesitated for a moment. It would be something to tell about, however, so, \u201cAll right, I'll drink with you,\u201d he said. The brown sweater led the way to a sailors' boarding-house hard by. The rear of the place was built upon piles over the water. But in front, on the ground floor, was a barroom. \u201cRum an' gum,\u201d announced the brown sweater, as the two came in and took their places at the bar. \u201cRum an'"}, {"size": 666, "text": "gum, Tuck; wattle you have, sir?\u201d \u201cOh--I don't know,\u201d hesitated Wilbur; \u201cgive me a mild Manhattan.\u201d While the drinks were being mixed the brown sweater called Wilbur's attention to a fighting head-dress from the Marquesas that was hung on the wall over the free-lunch counter and opposite the bar. Wilbur turned about to look at it, and remained so, his back to the barkeeper, till the latter told them their drinks were ready. \u201cWell, mate, here's big blocks an' taut hawse-pipes,\u201d said the brown sweater cordially. \u201cYour very good health,\u201d returned Wilbur. The brown sweater wiped a thin mustache in the hollow of his palm, and wiped that palm upon his trouser leg."}, {"size": 605, "text": "\u201cYessir,\u201d he continued, once more facing the Marquesas head-dress. \u201cYessir, they're queer game down there.\u201d \u201cIn the Marquesas Islands, you mean?\u201d said Wilbur. \u201cYessir, they're queer game. When they ain't tattoin' theirselves with Scripture tex's they git from the missionaries, they're pullin' out the hairs all over their bodies with two clam-shells. Hair by hair, y' understan'?\u201d \u201cPull'n out 'er hair?\u201d said Wilbur, wondering what was the matter with his tongue. \u201cThey think it's clever--think the women folk like it.\u201d Wilbur had fancied that the little man had worn a brown sweater when they first met."}, {"size": 717, "text": "But now, strangely enough, he was not in the least surprised to see it iridescent like a pigeon's breast. \u201cY' ever been down that way?\u201d inquired the little man next. Wilbur heard the words distinctly enough, but somehow they refused to fit into the right places in his brain. He pulled himself together, frowning heavily. \u201cWhat--did--you--say?\u201d he asked with great deliberation, biting off his words. Then he noticed that he and his companion were no longer in the barroom, but in a little room back of it. His personality divided itself. There was one Ross Wilbur--who could not make his hands go where he wanted them, who said one word when he thought another, and whose legs below the knee were made of solid lead."}, {"size": 756, "text": "Then there was another Ross Wilbur--Ross Wilbur, the alert, who was perfectly clear-headed, and who stood off to one side and watched his twin brother making a monkey of himself, without power and without even the desire of helping him. This latter Wilbur heard the iridescent sweater say: \u201cBust me, if y' a'n't squiffy, old man. Stand by a bit an' we'll have a ball.\u201d \u201cCan't have got--return--exceptionally--and the round table--pull out hairs wi' tu clamsh'ls,\u201d gabbled Wilbur's stupefied double; and Wilbur the alert said to himself: \u201cYou're not drunk, Ross Wilbur, that's certain; what could they have put in your cocktail?\u201d The iridescent sweater stamped twice upon the floor and a trap-door fell away beneath Wilbur's feet like the drop of a gallows."}, {"size": 654, "text": "With the eyes of his undrugged self Wilbur had a glimpse of water below. His elbow struck the floor as he went down, and he fell feet first into a Whitehall boat. He had time to observe two men at the oars and to look between the piles that supported the house above him and catch a glimpse of the bay and a glint of the Contra Costa shore. He was not in the least surprised at what had happened, and made up his mind that it would be a good idea to lie down in the boat and go to sleep. Suddenly--but how long after his advent into the boat he could not tell--his wits began to return and settle themselves, like wild birds flocking again after a scare."}, {"size": 654, "text": "Swiftly he took in the scene. The blue waters of the bay around him, the deck of a schooner on which he stood, the Whitehall boat alongside, and an enormous man with a face like a setting moon wrangling with his friend in the sweater--no longer iridescent. \u201cWhat do you call it?\u201d shouted the red man. \u201cI want able seamen--I don't figger on working this boat with dancing masters, do I? We ain't exactly doing quadrilles on my quarterdeck. If we don't look out we'll step on this thing and break it. It ain't ought to be let around loose without its ma.\u201d \u201cRot that,\u201d vociferated the brown sweater. \u201cI tell you he's one of the best sailor men on the front."}, {"size": 684, "text": "If he ain't we'll forfeit the money. Come on, Captain Kitchell, we made show enough gettin' away as it was, and this daytime business ain't our line. D'you sign or not? Here's the advance note. I got to duck my nut or I'll have the patrol boat after me.\u201d \u201cI'll sign this once,\u201d growled the other, scrawling his name on the note; \u201cbut if this swab ain't up to sample, he'll come back by freight, an' I'll drop in on mee dear friend Jim when we come back and give him a reel nice time, an' you can lay to that, Billy Trim.\u201d The brown sweater pocketed the note, went over the side, and rowed off. Wilbur stood in the waist of a schooner anchored in the stream well off Fisherman's wharf."}, {"size": 776, "text": "In the forward part of the schooner a Chinaman in brown duck was mixing paint. Wilbur was conscious that he still wore his high hat and long coat, but his stick was gone and one gray glove was slit to the button. In front of him towered the enormous red-faced man. A pungent reek of some kind of rancid fat or oil assailed his nostrils. Over by Alcatraz a ferry-boat whistled for its slip as it elbowed its way through the water. Wilbur had himself fairly in hand by now. His wits were all about him; but the situation was beyond him as yet. \u201cGit for'd,\u201d commanded the big man. Wilbur drew himself up, angry in an instant. \u201cLook here,\u201d he began, \u201cwhat's the meaning of this business? I know I've been drugged and mishandled. I demand to be put ashore. Do you understand that?\u201d"}, {"size": 851, "text": "\u201cAngel child,\u201d whimpered the big man. \u201cOh, you lilee of the vallee, you bright an' mornin' star.

It gives me genuine grief, it do, to see you bein' obliged to put your lilee white feet on this here vulgar an' dirtee deck. We'll have the Wilton carpet down by to-morrer, so we will, my dear. Yah-h!\u201d he suddenly broke out, as his rage boiled over. \u201cGit for'd, d'ye hear! I'm captain of this here bathtub, an' that's all you need to know for a good while to come. I ain't generally got to tell that to a man but once; but I'll stretch the point just for love of you, angel child. Now, then, move!\u201d Wilbur stood motionless--puzzled beyond expression. No experience he had ever been through helped in this situation. \u201cLook here,\u201d he began, \u201cI--\u201d"}, {"size": 659, "text": "The captain knocked him down with a blow of one enormous fist upon the mouth, and while he was yet stretched upon the deck kicked him savagely in the stomach. Then he allowed him to rise, caught him by the neck and the slack of his overcoat, and ran him forward to where a hatchway, not two feet across, opened in the deck. Without ado, he flung him down into the darkness below; and while Wilbur, dizzied by the fall, sat on the floor at the foot of the vertical companion-ladder, gazing about him with distended eyes, there rained down upon his head, first an oilskin coat, then a sou'wester, a pair of oilskin breeches, woolen socks, and a plug of tobacco."}, {"size": 709, "text": "Above him, down the contracted square of the hatch, came the bellowing of the Captain's voice: \u201cThere's your fit-out, Mister Lilee of the Vallee, which the same our dear friend Jim makes a present of and no charge, because he loves you so. You're allowed two minutes to change, an' it is to be hoped as how you won't force me to come for to assist.\u201d It would have been interesting to have followed, step by step, the mental process that now took place in Ross Wilbur's brain. The Captain had given him two minutes in which to change. The time was short enough, but even at that Wilbur changed more than his clothes during the two minutes he was left to himself in the reekind dark of the schooner's fo'castle."}, {"size": 601, "text": "It was more than a change--it was a revolution. What he made up his mind to do--precisely what mental attitude he decided to adopt, just what new niche he elected wherein to set his feet, it is difficult to say. Only by results could the change be guessed at. He went down the forward hatch at the toe of Kitchell's boot--silk-hatted, melton-overcoated, patent-booted, and gloved in suedes. Two minutes later there emerged upon the deck a figure in oilskins and a sou'wester. There was blood upon the face of him and the grime of an unclean ship upon his bare hands. It was Wilbur, and yet not Wilbur."}, {"size": 693, "text": "In two minutes he had been, in a way, born again. The only traces of his former self were the patent-leather boots, still persistent in their gloss and shine, that showed grim incongruity below the vast compass of the oilskin breeches. As Wilbur came on deck he saw the crew of the schooner hurrying forward, six of them, Chinamen every one, in brown jeans and black felt hats. On the quarterdeck stood the Captain, barking his orders. \u201cConsider the Lilee of the Vallee,\u201d bellowed the latter, as his eye fell upon Wilbur the Transformed. \u201cClap on to that starboard windlass brake, sonny.\u201d Wilbur saw the Chinamen ranging themselves about what he guessed was the windlass in the schooner's bow."}, {"size": 268, "text": "He followed and took his place among them, grasping one of the bars. \u201cBreak down!\u201d came the next order. Wilbur and the Chinamen obeyed, bearing up and down upon the bars till the slack of the anchor-chain came home and stretched taut and dripping from the hawse-holes."}, {"size": 635, "text": "And then as Wilbur released the brake and turned about for the next order, he cast his glance out upon the bay, and there, not a hundred and fifty yards away, her spotless sails tense, her cordage humming, her immaculate flanks slipping easily through the waves, the water hissing and churning under her forefoot, clean, gleaming, dainty, and aristocratic, the Ridgeways' yacht \u201cPetrel\u201d passed like a thing of life. Wilbur saw Nat Ridgeway himself at the wheel. Girls in smart gowns and young fellows in white ducks and yachting caps--all friends of his--crowded the decks. A little orchestra of musicians were reeling off a quickstep."}, {"size": 462, "text": "The popping of a cork and a gale of talk and laughter came to his ears. Wilbur stared at the picture, his face devoid of expression. The \u201cPetrel\u201d came on--drew nearer--was not a hundred feet away from the schooner's stern. A strong swimmer, such as Wilbur, could cover the distance in a few strides. Two minutes ago Wilbur might have-- \u201cSet your mains'l,\u201d came the bellow of Captain Kitchell. \u201cClap on to your throat and peak halyards.\u201d The Chinamen hurried aft."}, {"size": 890, "text": "II. A NAUTICAL EDUCATION. In the course of the next few moments, while the little vessel was being got under way, and while the Ridgeways' \u201cPetrel\u201d gleamed off into the blue distance, Wilbur made certain observations.The name of the boat on which he found himself was the \u201cBertha Millner.\u201d She was a two-topmast, 28-ton keel schooner, 40 feet long, carrying a large spread of sail--mainsail, foresail, jib, flying-jib, two gaff-topsails, and a staysail. She was very dirty and smelt abominably of some kind of rancid oil. Her crew were Chinamen; there was no mate. But the cook--himself a Chinaman--who appeared from time to time at the door of the galley, a potato-masher in his hand, seemed to have some sort of authority over the hands. He acted in a manner as a go-between for the Captain and the crew, sometimes interpreting the former's orders, and occasionally giving one of his own."}, {"size": 646, "text": "Wilbur heard the Captain address him as Charlie. He spoke pigeon English fairly. Of the balance of the crew--the five Chinamen--Wilbur could make nothing. They never spoke, neither to Captain Kitchell, to Charlie, nor to each other; and for all the notice they took of Wilbur he might easily have been a sack of sand. Wilbur felt that his advent on the \u201cBertha Millner\u201d was by its very nature an extraordinary event; but the absolute indifference of these brown-suited Mongols, the blankness of their flat, fat faces, the dulness of their slanting, fishlike eyes that never met his own or even wandered in his direction, was uncanny, disquieting."}, {"size": 611, "text": "In what strange venture was he now to be involved, toward what unknown vortex was this new current setting, this current that had so suddenly snatched him from the solid ground of his accustomed life? He told himself grimly that he was to have a free cruise up the bay, perhaps as far as Alviso; perhaps the \u201cBertha Millner\u201d would even make the circuit of the bay before returning to San Francisco. He might be gone a week. Wilbur could already see the scare-heads of the daily papers the next morning, chronicling the disappearance of \u201cOne of Society's Most Popular Members.\u201d \u201cThat's well, y'r throat halyards."}, {"size": 896, "text": "Here, Lilee of the Vallee, give a couple of pulls on y'r peak halyard purchase.\u201d Wilbur stared at the Captain helplessly. \u201cNo can tell, hey?\u201d inquired Charlie from the galley. \u201cPullum disa lope, sabe?\u201d Wilbur tugged at the rope the cook indicated. \u201cThat's well, y'r peak halyard purchase,\u201d chanted Captain Kitchell. Wilbur made the rope fast. The mainsail was set, and hung slatting and flapping in the wind. Next the for'sail was set in much the same manner, and Wilbur was ordered to \u201clay out on the ji'boom and cast the gaskets off the jib.\u201d He \u201clay out\u201d as best he could and cast off the gaskets--he knew barely enough of yachting to understand an order here and there--and by the time he was back on the fo'c'sle head the Chinamen were at the jib halyard and hoisting away. \u201cThat's well, y'r jib halyards.\u201d The \u201cBertha Millner\u201d veered round and played off to the wind, tugging at her anchor."}, {"size": 626, "text": "Wilbur and the crew jumped once more to the brakes. \u201cBrake down, heave y'r anchor to the cathead.\u201d The anchor-chain, already taut, vibrated and then cranked through the hawse-holes as the hands rose and fell at the brakes. The anchor came home, dripping gray slime. A nor'west wind filled the schooner's sails, a strong ebb tide caught her underfoot. \u201cWe're off,\u201d muttered Wilbur, as the \u201cBertha Millner\u201d heeled to the first gust. But evidently the schooner was not bound up the bay. \u201cMust be Vallejo or Benicia, then,\u201d hazarded Wilbur, as the sails grew tenser and the water rippled ever louder under the schooner's forefoot."}, {"size": 675, "text": "\u201cMaybe they're going after hay or wheat.\u201d The schooner was tacking, headed directly for Meiggs's wharf. She came in closer and closer, so close that Wilbur could hear the talk of the fishermen sitting on the stringpieces. He had just made up his mind that they were to make a landing there, when-- \u201cStand by for stays,\u201d came the raucous bark of the Captain, who had taken on the heel. The sails slatted furiously as the schooner came about. Then the \u201cBertha Millner\u201d caught the wind again and lay over quietly and contentedly to her work. The next tack brought the schooner close under Alcatraz. The sea became heavier, the breeze grew stiff and smelled of the outside ocean."}, {"size": 648, "text": "Out beyond them to westward opened the Golden Gate, a bleak vista of gray-green water roughened with white-caps. \u201cStand by for stays.\u201d Once again as the rudder went hard over, the \u201cBertha Millner\u201d fretted and danced and shook her sails, calling impatiently for the wind, chafing at its absence like a child reft of a toy. Then again she scooped the nor'wester in the hollow palms of her tense canvases and settled quietly down on the new tack, her bowsprit pointing straight toward the Presidio. \u201cWe'll come about again soon,\u201d Wilbur told himself, \u201cand stand over toward the Contra Costa shore.\u201d A fine huge breath of wind passed over the schooner."}, {"size": 688, "text": "She heeled it on the instant, the water roaring along her quarter, but she kept her course. Wilbur fell thoughtful again, never more keenly observant. \u201cShe must come about soon,\u201d he muttered uneasily, \u201cif she's going to stand up toward Vallejo.\u201d His heart sank with a sudden apprehension. A nervousness he could not overcome seized upon him. The \u201cBertha Millner\u201d held tenaciously to the tack. Within fifty yards of the Presidio came the command again: \u201cStand by for stays.\u201d Once more, her bows dancing, her cordage rattling, her sails flapping noisily, the schooner came about. Anxiously Wilbur observed the bowsprit as it circled like a hand on a dial, watching where now it would point."}, {"size": 748, "text": "It wavered, fluctuated, rose, fell, then settled easily, pointing toward Lime Point. Wilbur felt a sudden coldness at his heart. \u201cThis isn't going to be so much fun,\u201d he muttered between his teeth. The schooner was not bound up the bay for Alviso nor to Vallejo for grain. The track toward Lime Point could mean but one thing. The wind was freshening from the nor'west, the ebb tide rushing out to meet the ocean like a mill-race, at every moment the Golden Gate opened out wider, and within two minutes after the time of the last tack the \u201cBertha Millner\u201d heeled to a great gust that had come booming in between the heads, straight from the open Pacific. \u201cStand by for stays.\u201d As before, one of the Chinese hands stood by the sail rope of the jib."}, {"size": 606, "text": "The jib filled. The schooner came about on the port tack; Lime Point fell away over the stern rail. The huge ground swells began to come in, and as she rose and bowed to the first of these it was precisely as though the \u201cBertha Millner\u201d were making her courtesy to the great gray ocean, now for the first time in full sight on her starboard quarter. The schooner was beating out to sea through the Middle Channel. Once clear of the Golden Gate, she stood over toward the Cliff House, then on the next tack cleared Point Bonita. The sea began building up in deadly earnest--they were about to cross the bar."}, {"size": 840, "text": "Everything was battened down, the scuppers were awash, and the hawse-holes spouted like fountains after every plunge. Once the Captain ordered all men aloft, just in time to escape a gigantic dull green roller that broke like a Niagara over the schooner's bows, smothering the decks knee-deep in a twinkling. The wind blew violent and cold, the spray was flying like icy small-shot. Without intermission the \u201cBertha Millner\u201d rolled and plunged and heaved and sank. Wilbur was drenched to the skin and sore in every joint, from being shunted from rail to mast and from mast to rail again.

It was impossible to resist the excitement of the situation, its novelty--the high crow's nest of the schooner, the keen salt air, the Chinamen grouped far below, the indigo of the warm ocean, and out yonder the forsaken derelict, rolling her light hull till the garboard streak flashed in the sun. \u201cWell, of course, I'm with you, Cap,\u201d exclaimed Wilbur, gripping Kitchell's hand."}, {"size": 617, "text": "\u201cWhen there's thirty thousand to be had for the asking I guess I'm a 'na'chel bawn' beach-comber myself.\u201d \u201cNow, nothing about this to the coolies.\u201d \u201cBut how will you make out with your owners, the Six Companies?

Her fore and main tops'ls and to'gallants'ls were set, as also were her lower stays'ls and royals. But the braces seemed to have parted, and the yards were swinging back and forth in their ties.

Thrice he repeated the call, and thrice the dismal thrashing of the spanker boom and the flapping of the sails was the only answer. Kitchell turned to Wilbur in triumph. \u201cI guess she's ours,\u201d he whispered. They were now close enough to make out the bark's name upon her counter, \u201cLady Letty,\u201d and Wilbur was in the act of reading it aloud, when a huge brown dorsal fin, like the triangular sail of a lugger, cut the water between the dory and the bark."}, {"size": 626, "text": "\u201cShark!\u201d said Kitchell; \u201cand there's another!\u201d he exclaimed in the next instant, \u201cand another!

The dory was now well up to the derelict, and pretty soon a prolonged and vibratory hissing noise, strident, insistent, smote upon their ears. \u201cWhat's that?\u201d exclaimed Wilbur, perplexed.

Just look at the hundreds of 'em. There's a stiff on board, sure.\u201d Wilbur steadied himself on the swaying broken deck, choking against the reek of coal-gas that hissed upward on every hand.

Now, then, cabin first,\u201d and he started aft. But it was impossible to go into the cabin. The moment the door was opened suffocating billows of gas rushed out and beat them back.

The boy--he might have been two and twenty--stared and frowned. \u201cClean loco from the gas. Get him into the dory, son.

However, Wilbur examined her with extraordinary interest as she sat in the sternsheets, sullen, half-defiant, half-bewildered, and bereft of speech. She was not pretty--she was too tall for that--quite as tall as Wilbur himself, and her skeleton was too massive. Her face was red, and the glint of blue ice was in her eyes.

From the vestibule a door opened directly into the main cabin. They entered. The cabin was some twenty feet long and unusually spacious. Fresh from his recollection of the grime and reek of the schooner, it struck Wilbur as particularly dainty. It was painted white with stripes of blue, gold and pea-green. On either side three doors opened off into staterooms and private cabins, and with each roll of the derelict these doors banged like an irregular discharge of revolvers."}, {"size": 624, "text": "In the centre was the dining-table, covered with a red cloth, very much awry.

But for one feature the sight of the \u201cLetty's\u201d cabin was charming. However, on the floor by the sliding door in the forward bulkhead lay a body, face upward. The body was that of a middle-aged, fine-looking man, his head covered with the fur, ear-lapped cap that Norwegians affect, even in the tropics. The eyes were wide open, the face discolored."}, {"size": 630, "text": "In the last gasp of suffocation the set of false teeth had been forced half-way out of his mouth, distorting the countenance with a hideous simian grin.

The body of the dead Captain was passed up through the skylight and slid out on the deck, and Wilbur and Kitchell turned their attention to what had been his stateroom. The Captain's room was the largest one of the six staterooms opening from the main cabin."}, {"size": 617, "text": "\u201cHere we are!\u201d exclaimed Kitchell as he and Wilbur entered. \u201cThe old man's room, and no mistake.\u201d Besides the bunk, the stateroom was fitted up with a lounge of red plush screwed to the bulkhead. A roll of charts leaned in one corner, an alarm clock, stopped at 1:15, stood on a shelf in the company of some dozen paper-covered novels and a drinking-glass full of cigars. Over the lounge, however, was the rack of instruments, sextant, barometer, chronometer, glass, and the like, securely screwed down, while against the wall, in front of a swivel leather chair that was ironed to the deck, was the locked secretary."}, {"size": 621, "text": "\u201cLook at 'em, just look at 'em, will you!\u201d said Kitchell, running his fingers lovingly over the polished brass of the instruments. \u201cThere's a thousand dollars of stuff right here.

What followed thrilled Wilbur with alternate excitement, curiosity, and a vivid sense of desecration and sacrilege.

It opened down to form a sort of desk, and disclosed an array of cubby-holes and two small doors, both locked. These latter Kitchell smashed in with the axe-head. Then he seated himself in the swivel chair and began to rifle their contents systematically, Wilbur leaning over his shoulder. The heat from the coal below them was almost unbearable. In the cabin the six doors kept up a continuous ear-shocking fusillade, as though half a dozen men were fighting with revolvers; from without, down the open skylight, came the sing-song talk of the Chinamen and the wash and ripple of the two vessels, now side by side."}, {"size": 690, "text": "The air, foul beyond expression, tasted of brass, their heads swam and ached to bursting, but absorbed in their work they had no thought of the lapse of time nor the discomfort of their surroundings.

Kitchell must be made aware of the situation--must be told that Moran, the daughter, the Captain's heir, was on board the schooner; that the \u201ckid\u201d found in the wheel-box was a girl. But on second thought that would never do.

Never in his life had he met with any girl like this. So accustomed had she been to the rough, give-and-take, direct associations of a seafaring life that she misinterpreted well-meant politeness--the only respect he knew how to pay her--to mean insidious advances. She was suspicious of him--distrusted him utterly, and openly ridiculed his abortive seamanship."}, {"size": 644, "text": "Pretty she was not, but she soon began to have a certain amount of attraction for Wilbur.

Her neck was thick, strong, and very white, her hands roughened and calloused. In her men's clothes she looked tall, vigorous, and unrestrained, and on more than one occasion, as Wilbur passed close to her, he was made aware that her hair, her neck, her entire personality exhaled a fine, sweet, natural redolence that savored of the ocean and great winds."}, {"size": 862, "text": "One day, as he saw her handling a huge water-barrel by the chines only, with a strength he knew to be greater than his own, her brows contracted with the effort, her hair curling about her thick neck, her large, round arms bare to the elbow, a sudden thrill of enthusiasm smote through him, and between his teeth he exclaimed to himself: \u201cBy Jove, you're a woman!\u201d The \u201cBertha Millner\u201d continued to the southward, gliding quietly over the oil-smoothness of the ocean under airs so light as hardly to ruffle the surface. Sometimes at high noon the shimmer of the ocean floor blended into the shimmer of the sky at the horizon, and then it was no longer water and blue heavens; the little craft seemed to be poised in a vast crystalline sphere, where there was neither height nor depth--poised motionless in warm, coruscating, opalescent space, alone with the sun."}, {"size": 701, "text": "At length one morning the schooner, which for the preceding twenty-four hours had been heading eastward, raised the land, and by the middle of the afternoon had come up to within a mile of a low, sandy shore, quivering with heat, and had tied up to the kelp in Magdalena Bay. Charlie now took over entire charge of operations. For two days previous the Chinese hands had been getting out the deck-tubs, tackles, gaffs, spades, and the other shark-fishing gear that had been stowed forward. The sails were lowered and gasketed, the decks cleared of all impedimenta, hogsheads and huge vats stood ready in the waist, and the lazy indolence of the previous week was replaced by an extraordinary activity."}, {"size": 652, "text": "The day after their arrival in the bay was occupied by all hands in catching bait. This bait was a kind of rock-fish, of a beautiful red gold color, and about the size of an ordinary cod. They bit readily enough, but out of every ten hooked three were taken off the lines by the sharks before they could be brought aboard. Another difficulty lay in the fact that, either because of the excessive heat in the air or the percentage of alkali in the water, they spoiled almost immediately if left in the air. Turtle were everywhere--floating gray-green disks just under the surface. Sea-birds in clouds clamored all day long about the shore and sand-pits."}, {"size": 775, "text": "At long intervals flying-fish skittered over the water like skipping-stones. Shoals of porpoises came in from outside, leaping clumsily along the edges of the kelp. Bewildered land-birds perched on the schooner's rigging, and in the early morning the whistling of quail could be heard on shore near where a little fresh-water stream ran down to meet the ocean. It was Wilbur who caught the first shark on the second morning of the \u201cBertha's\u201d advent in Magdalena Bay. A store of bait had been accumulated, split and halved into chunks for the shark-hooks, and Wilbur, baiting one of the huge lines that had been brought up on deck the evening before, flung it overboard, and watched the glimmer of the white fish-meat turning to a silvery green as it sank down among the kelp."}, {"size": 637, "text": "Almost instantly a long moving shadow, just darker than the blue-green mass of the water, identified itself at a little distance. Enormous flukes proceeded from either side, an erect dorsal fin, like an enormous cock's crest, rose from the back, while immediately over the head swam the two pilot-fish, following so closely the movement of the shark as to give the impression of actually adhering to his body. Twice and three times the great man-eater twelve feet from snout to tail-tip, circled slowly about the bait, the flukes moving fan-like through the water. Once he came up, touched the bait with his nose, and backed easily away."}, {"size": 659, "text": "He disappeared, returned, and poised himself motionless in the schooner's shadow, feeling the water with his flukes. Moran was looking over Wilbur's shoulder. \u201cHe's as good as caught,\u201d she muttered; \u201conce let them get sight of meat, and--Steady now!\u201d The shark moved forward. Suddenly, with a long, easy roll, he turned completely upon his back. His white belly flashed like silver in the water--the bait disappeared. \u201cYou've got him!\u201d shouted Moran. The rope slid through Wilbur's palms, burning the skin as the huge sea-wolf sounded. Moran laid hold. The heavy, sullen wrenching from below twitched and swayed their bodies and threw them against each other."}, {"size": 678, "text": "Her bare, cool arm was pressed close over his knuckles. \u201cHeave!\u201d she cried, laughing with the excitement of the moment. \u201cHeave all!\u201d--she began the chant of sailors hauling at the ropes. Together, and bracing their feet against the schooner's rail, they fought out the fight with the great fish. In a swirl of lather the head and shoulders came above the surface, the flukes churning the water till it boiled like the wake of a screw steamship. But as soon as these great fins were clear of the surface the shark fell quiet and helpless. Charlie came up with the cutting-in spade, and as the fish hung still over the side, cut him open from neck to belly with a single movement."}, {"size": 658, "text": "Another Chinaman stood by with a long-handled gaff, hooked out the purple-black liver, brought it over the side, and dropped it into one of the deck-tubs.

Sailor-folk are no friends of such carrion as that.\u201d Other lines were baited and dropped overboard, and the hands settled themselves to the real business of the expedition. There was no skill in the matter. The sharks bit ravenously, and soon swarmed about the schooner in hundreds."}, {"size": 718, "text": "Hardly a half minute passed that one of the four Chinamen that were fishing did not signal a catch, and Charlie and Jim were kept busy with spade and gaff. By noon the deck-tubs were full. The lines were hauled in, and the hands set the tubs in the sun to try out the oil. Under the tropical heat the shark livers almost visibly melted away, and by four o'clock in the afternoon the tubs were full of a thick, yellow oil, the reek of which instantly recalled to Wilbur's mind the rancid smell of the schooner on the day when he had first come aboard of her. The deck-tubs were emptied into the hogsheads and vats that stood in the waist of the \u201cBertha,\u201d the tubs scoured, and the lines and bent shark-hooks overhauled."}, {"size": 786, "text": "Charlie disappeared in the galley, supper was cooked, and eaten upon deck under the conflagration of the sunset; the lights were set, the Chinamen foregathered in the fo'c'stle head, smoking opium, and by eight o'clock the routine of the day was at an end. So the time passed. In a short time Wilbur could not have said whether the day was Wednesday or Sunday. He soon tired of the unsportsmanlike work of killing the sluggish brutes, and turned shoreward to relieve the monotony of the succeeding days. He and Moran were left a good deal to their own devices. Charlie was the master of the men now. \u201cMate,\u201d said Moran to Wilbur one day, after a dinner of turtle steaks and fish, eaten in the open air on the quarterdeck; \u201cmate, this is slow work, and the schooner smells terribly foul."}, {"size": 645, "text": "We'll have the dory out and go ashore.

I'd forgotten that!\u201d They went ashore and spent the afternoon in filling the water-cask from the fresh-water stream and in gathering abalones, which Moran declared were delicious eating, from the rocks left bare by the tide. But nothing could have exceeded the loneliness of that shore and backland, palpitating under the flogging of a tropical sun. Low hills of sand, covered with brush, stretched back from the shore."}, {"size": 660, "text": "On the eastern horizon, leagues distant, blue masses of mountain striated with mirages swam in the scorching air. The sand was like fire to the touch. Far out in the bay the schooner hung motionless under bare sticks, resting apparently upon her inverted shadow only. And that was all--the flat, heat-ridden land, the sheen of the open Pacific, and the lonely schooner. \u201cQuiet enough,\u201d said Wilbur, in a low voice, wondering if there was such a place as San Francisco, with its paved streets and cable cars, and if people who had been his friends there had ever had any real existence. \u201cDo you like it?\u201d asked Moran quickly, facing him, her thumbs in her belt."}, {"size": 897, "text": "\u201cIt's good fun--how about you?\u201d \u201cIt's no different than the only life I've known.

Where's that pinch-bar? We'll get a couple more abalones for supper, and then put off.\u201d That was the only talk of moment they had during the afternoon. All the rest of their conversation had been of those things that immediately occupied their attention. They regained the schooner toward five o'clock, to find the Chinamen perplexed and mystified. No explanation was forthcoming, and Charlie gave them supper in preoccupied silence. As they were eating the abalones, which Moran had fried in batter, Charlie said: \u201cShark all gone!

Still the schooner lifted; objects on deck began to slide aft; the oil in the deck-tubs washed over; then, as there came a wild scrambling of the Chinese crew up the fo'c'stle hatch, she settled again gradually at first, then, with an abrupt lurch that almost threw him from his feet, regained her level."}, {"size": 473, "text": "Moran met him in the waist.

Again he peered over the side, down into the kelp-thickened sea. Nothing--not a breath of air was stirring.

Soon the night watch was discontinued. During these days the three officers lived high.

Moran shook her head, biting her lip. \u201cIt's beyond me,\u201d she said, frowning. \u201cCan you see anything?\u201d The sky, sea, and land were unbroken reaches of solitude. There was no breath of wind. \u201cListen,\u201d said Moran. Far off to landward came the faint, sleepy clucking of a quail, and the stridulating of unnumbered crickets; a long ripple licked the slope of the beach and slid back into the ocean."}, {"size": 798, "text": "Wilbur shook his head. \u201cDon't hear anything,\u201d he whispered. \u201cSh--there--she's trembling again.\u201d Once more a prolonged but faint quivering ran through the \u201cBertha Millner\u201d from stem to stern, and from keel to masthead. There was a barely audible creaking of joints and panels. The oil in the deck-tubs trembled. The vibration was so fine and rapid that it tickled the soles of Wilbur's feet as he stood on the deck. \u201cI'd give two fingers to know what it all means,\u201d murmured Moran in a low voice. \u201cI've been to sea for--\u201d Then suddenly she cried aloud: \u201cSteady all, she's lifting again!\u201d The schooner heaved slowly under them, this time by the stern. Up she went, up and up, while Wilbur gripped at a stay to keep his place, and tried to choke down his heart, that seemed to beat against his palate."}, {"size": 653, "text": "\u201cGod!\u201d ejaculated Moran, her eyes blazing. \u201cThis thing is--\u201d The \u201cBertha\u201d came suddenly down to an easy keel, rocking in that glassy sea as if in a tide rip. The deck was awash with oil. Far out in the bay the ripples widening from the schooner blurred the reflections of the stars. The Chinamen swarmed up the hatch-way, voluble and shrill. Again the \u201cBertha Millner\u201d lifted and sank, the tubs sliding on the deck, the masts quivering like reeds, the timbers groaning aloud with the strain. In the stern something cracked and smashed. Then the trouble died away, the ripples faded into the ocean, and the schooner settled to her keel, quite motionless."}, {"size": 678, "text": "\u201cLook,\u201d said Moran, her face toward the \u201cBertha's\u201d stern. \u201cThe rudder is out of the gudgeons.\u201d It was true--the \u201cBertha Millner's\u201d helm was unshipped. There was no more sleep for any one on board that night. Wilbur tramped the quarterdeck, sick with a feeling he dared not put a name to. Moran sat by the wrecked rudder-head, a useless pistol in her hand, swearing under her breath from time to time. Charlie appeared on the quarterdeck at intervals, looked at Wilbur and Moran with wide-open eyes, and then took himself away.

I'll stay by this dough-dish as long as two planks in her hold together. Were you thinking of cutting away?\u201d She fixed him with her frown.

A fine, quivering tremble was thrilling through every beam of the schooner, vibrating each rope like a harp-string. It passed away; but before either Wilbur or Moran could comment upon it recommenced, this time much more perceptibly. Charlie dashed aft, his queue flying. \u201cW'at makum heap shake?\u201d he shouted; \u201cw'at for him shake? No savvy, no likee, pretty much heap flaid; aie-yah, aie-yah!\u201d Slowly the schooner heaved up as though upon the crest of some huge wave, slowly it settled, and again gradually lifted till Wilbur had to catch at the rail to steady his footing."}, {"size": 643, "text": "The quivering sensation increased so that their very teeth chattered with it.

And that was all. There was no sound--nothing was in sight. There was only the frightened trembling of the little schooner and that long, slow heave and lift.

He said nothing--his gravity had returned. Now in the glare of the tropical day, with the \u201cBertha Millner\u201d sitting the sea as placidly as a brooding gull, he was Talleyrand again. \u201cI tinkum yas,\u201d he said vaguely. \u201cWell, I think we had better try and fix the rudder and put back to Frisco,\u201d said Moran. \u201cYou're making no money this way.

The rudder was not so badly damaged as they had at first supposed; the break was easily mended, but it was found necessary for one of the men to go over the side. \u201cGet over the side here, Jim,\u201d commanded Moran. \u201cCharlie, tell him what's wanted; we can't work the pintle in from the deck.\u201d But Charlie shook his head. \u201cHim no likee go; him plenty much flaid.\u201d Moran ripped out an oath. \u201cWhat do I care if he's afraid!

He ran over the incidents of the cruise--Kitchell, the turtle hunt, the finding of the derelict, the dead captain, the squall, and the awful sight of the sinking bark, Moran at the wheel, the grewsome business of the shark-fishing, and last of all that inexplicable lifting and quivering of the schooner. He told himself that now he would probably never know the explanation of that mystery."}, {"size": 720, "text": "The day passed in preparations to put to sea again. The deck-tubs and hogsheads were stowed below and the tackle cleared away. By evening all was ready; they would be under way by daybreak the next morning. There was a possibility of their being forced to tow the schooner out by means of the dory, so light were the airs inside. Once beyond the heads, however, they were sure of a breeze. About ten o'clock that night, the same uncanny trembling ran through the schooner again, and about half an hour later she lifted gently once or twice. But after that she was undisturbed. Later on in the night--or rather early in the morning--Wilbur woke suddenly in his hammock without knowing why, and got up and stood listening."}, {"size": 562, "text": "The \u201cBertha Millner\u201d was absolutely quiet. The night was hot and still; the new moon, canted over like a sinking galleon, was low over the horizon. Wilbur listened intently, for now at last he heard something. Between the schooner and the shore a gentle sound of splashing came to his ears, and an occasional crack as of oars in their locks. Was it possible that a boat was there between the schooner and the land? What boat, and manned by whom? The creaking of oarlocks and the dip of paddles was unmistakable. Suddenly Wilbur raised his voice in a great shout:"}, {"size": 668, "text": "There was no answer; the noise of oars grew fainter.

Hark--there--did you hear the oars?\u201d \u201cYou're right; call the hands, get the dory over, we'll follow that boat right up. Hello, forward there, Charlie, all hands, tumble out!\u201d Then Wilbur and Moran caught themselves looking into each other's eyes. At once something--perhaps the latent silence of the schooner--told them there was to be no answer. The two ran for-ward: Moran swung herself into the fo'castle hatch, and without using the ladder dropped to the deck below."}, {"size": 730, "text": "In an instant her voice came up the hatch: \u201cThe bunks are empty--they're gone--abandoned us.\u201d She came up the ladder again. \u201cLook,\u201d said Wilbur, as she regained the deck. \u201cThe dory's gone; they've taken it. It was our only boat; we can't get ashore.\u201d \u201cCowardly, superstitious rats, I should have expected this. They would be chopped in bits before they would stay longer on board this boat--they and their-Feng shui.\u201d When morning came the deserters could be made out camped on the shore, near to the beached dory. What their intentions were could not be conjectured.

Fortunately, by eight o'clock a very light westerly breeze came up. Moran and Wilbur cast off the gaskets and set the fore and main sails. Wilbur was busy at the forward bitts preparing to cast loose from the kelp, and Moran had taken up her position at the wheel when suddenly she exclaimed: \u201cSail ho!--and in God's name what kind of a sail do you call it?\u201d In fact a strange-looking craft had just made her appearance at the entrance of Magdalena Bay."}, {"size": 805, "text": "Wilbur returned aft and joined Moran on the quarterdeck. She was already studying the stranger through the glass.\u201cThat's a new build of boat to me,\u201d she muttered, giving Wilbur the glass. Wilbur looked long and carefully. The newcomer was of the size and much the same shape as a caravel of the fifteenth century--high as to bow and stern, and to all appearances as seaworthy as a soup-tureen. Never but in the old prints had Wilbur seen such an extraordinary boat. She carried a single mast, which listed forward; her lugsail was stretched upon dozens of bamboo yards; she drew hardly any water. Two enormous red eyes were painted upon either side of her high, blunt bow, while just abaft the waist projected an enormous oar, or sweep, full forty feet in length--longer, in fact, than the vessel herself."}, {"size": 329, "text": "It acted partly as a propeller, partly as a rudder. \u201cThey're heading for us,\u201d commented Wilbur as Moran took the glass again. \u201cRight,\u201d she answered; adding upon the moment: \u201cHuh! more Chinamen; the thing is alive with coolies; she's a junk.\u201d \u201cOh!\u201d exclaimed Wilbur, recollecting some talk of Charlie's he had overheard. \u201cI know.\u201d"}, {"size": 618, "text": "\u201cYes; these are real beach-combers. I've heard of them along this coast--heard our Chinamen speak of them. They beach that junk every night and camp on shore.

Between whiles they fish for shrimp, and I've heard Kitchell tell how they make pearls by dropping bird-shot into oysters. They are Kai-gingh to a man, and, according to Kitchell, the wickedest breed of cats that ever cut teeth.\u201dThe junk bore slowly down upon the schooner."}, {"size": 606, "text": "In a few moments she had hove to alongside. But for the enormous red eyes upon her bow she was innocent of paint. She was grimed and shellacked with dirt and grease, and smelled abominably. Her crew were Chinamen; but such Chinamen! The coolies of the \u201cBertha Millner\u201d were pampered and effete in comparison. The beach-combers, thirteen in number, were a smaller class of men, their faces almost black with tan and dirt. Though they still wore the queue, their heads were not shaven, and mats and mops of stiff black hair fell over their eyes from under their broad, basket-shaped hats. They were barefoot."}, {"size": 657, "text": "None of them wore more than two garments--the jeans and the blouse. They were the lowest type of men Wilbur had ever seen. The faces were those of a higher order of anthropoid apes: the lower portion--jaws, lips, and teeth--salient; the nostrils opening at almost right angles, the eyes tiny and bright, the forehead seamed and wrinkled--unnaturally old. Their general expression was of simian cunning and a ferocity that was utterly devoid of courage. \u201cAye!\u201d exclaimed Moran between her teeth, \u201cif the devil were a shepherd, here are his sheep. You don't come aboard this schooner, my friends! I want to live as long as I can, and die when I can't help it."}, {"size": 697, "text": "Boat ahoy!\u201d she called. An answer in Cantonese sing-song came back from the junk, and the speaker gestured toward the outside ocean. Then a long parleying began. For upward of half an hour Moran and Wilbur listened to a proposition in broken pigeon English made by the beach-combers again and again and yet again, and were in no way enlightened. It was impossible to understand. Then at last they made out that there was question of a whale. Next it appeared the whale was dead; and finally, after a prolonged pantomime of gesturing and pointing, Moran guessed that the beach-combers wanted the use of the \u201cBertha Millner\u201d to trice up the dead leviathan while the oil and whalebone were extracted."}, {"size": 605, "text": "\u201cThat must be it,\u201d she said to Wilbur. \u201cThat's what they mean by pointing to our masts and tackle. You see, they couldn't manage with that stick of theirs, and they say they'll give us a third of the loot. We'll do it, mate, and I'll tell you why. The wind has fallen, and they can tow us out. If it's a sperm-whale they've found, there ought to be thirty or forty barrels of oil in him, let alone the blubber and bone. Oil is at $50 now, and spermaceti will always bring $100.

A rope was passed to the \u201cBertha Millner,\u201d the junk put out its sweeps, and to a wailing, eldrich chanting the schooner was towed out of the bay. \u201cI wonder what Charlie and our China boys will think of this?\u201d said Wilbur, looking shoreward, where the deserters could be seen gathered together in a silent, observing group. \u201cWe're well shut of them,\u201d growled Moran, her thumbs in her belt. \u201cOnly, now we'll never know what was the matter with the schooner these last few nights."}, {"size": 614, "text": "Hah!\u201d she exclaimed under her breath, her scowl thickening, \u201csometimes I don't wonder the beasts cut.\u201d The dead whale was lying four miles out of the entrance of Magdalena Bay, and as the junk and the schooner drew near seemed like a huge black boat floating bottom up. Over it and upon it swarmed and clambered thousands of sea-birds, while all around and below the water was thick with gorging sharks. A dreadful, strangling decay fouled all the air. The whale was a sperm-whale, and fully twice the length of the \u201cBertha Millner.\u201d The work of tricing him up occupied the beach-combers throughout the entire day."}, {"size": 613, "text": "It was out of the question to keep them off the schooner, and Wilbur and Moran were too wise to try. They swarmed the forward deck and rigging like a plague of unclean monkeys, climbing with an agility and nimbleness that made Wilbur sick to his stomach. They were unlike any Chinamen he had ever seen--hideous to a degree that he had imagined impossible in a human being. On two occasions a fight developed, and in an instant the little hatchets were flashing like the flash of a snake's fangs. Toward the end of the day one of them returned to the junk, screaming like a stuck pig, a bit of his chin bitten off."}, {"size": 745, "text": "Moran and Wilbur kept to the quarter-deck, always within reach of the huge cutting-in spades, but the Chinese beach-combers were too elated over their prize to pay them much attention. And indeed the dead monster proved a veritable treasure-trove. By the end of the day he had been triced up to the foremast, and all hands straining at the windlass had raised the mighty head out of the water. The Chinamen descended upon the smooth, black body, their bare feet sliding and slipping at every step. They held on by jabbing their knives into the hide as glacier-climbers do their ice-picks. The head yielded barrel after barrel of oil and a fair quantity of bone. The blubber was taken aboard the junk, minced up with hatchets, and run into casks."}, {"size": 607, "text": "Last of all, a Chinaman cut a hole through the \u201ccase,\u201d and, actually descending into the inside of the head, stripped away the spermaceti (clear as crystal), and packed it into buckets, which were hauled up on the junk's deck. The work occupied some two or three days. During this time the \u201cBertha Millner\u201d was keeled over to nearly twenty degrees by the weight of the dead monster. However, neither Wilbur nor Moran made protest. The Chinamen would do as they pleased; that was said and signed. And they did not release the schooner until the whale had been emptied of oil and blubber, spermaceti and bone."}, {"size": 842, "text": "At length, on the afternoon of the third day, the captain of the junk, whose name was Hoang, presented himself upon the quarter-deck. He was naked to the waist, and his bare brown torso was gleaming with oil and sweat. His queue was coiled like a snake around his neck, his hatchet thrust into his belt. \u201cWell?\u201d said Moran, coming up. Wilbur caught his breath as the two stood there facing each other, so sharp was the contrast. The man, the Mongolian, small, weazened, leather-colored, secretive--a strange, complex creature, steeped in all the obscure mystery of the East, nervous, ill at ease; and the girl, the Anglo-Saxon, daughter of the Northmen, huge, blond, big-boned, frank, outspoken, simple of composition, open as the day, bareheaded, her great ropes of sandy hair falling over her breast and almost to the top of her knee-boots."}, {"size": 719, "text": "As he looked at the two, Wilbur asked himself where else but in California could such abrupt contrasts occur. \u201cAll light,\u201d announced Hoang; \u201ccatchum all oil, catchum all bone, catchum all same plenty many. You help catchum, now you catchum pay. Sabe?\u201d The three principals came to a settlement with unprecedented directness. Like all Chinamen, Hoang was true to his promises, and he had already set apart three and a half barrels of spermaceti, ten barrels of oil, and some twenty pounds of bone as the schooner's share in the transaction. There was no discussion over the matter. He called their attention to the discharge of his obligations, and hurried away to summon his men aboard and get the junk under way again."}, {"size": 742, "text": "The beach-combers returned to their junk, and Wilbur and Moran set about cutting the carcass of the whale adrift. They found it would be easier to cut away the hide from around the hooks and loops of the tackle than to unfasten the tackle itself. \u201cThe knots are jammed hard as steel,\u201d declared Moran. \u201cHand up that cutting-in spade; stand by with the other and cut loose at the same time as I do, so we can ease off the strain on these lines at the same time. Ready there, cut!\u201d Moran set free the hook in the loop of black skin in a couple of strokes, but Wilbur was more clumsy; the skin resisted. He struck at it sharply with the heavy spade; the blade hit the iron hook, glanced off, and opened a large slit in the carcass below the head."}, {"size": 651, "text": "A gush of entrails started from the slit, and Moran swore under her breath. \u201cEase away, quick there! You'll have the mast out of her next--steady!

It was an aromatic smell, stronger than that of the salt ocean, stronger even than the reek of oil and blubber from the schooner's waist--sweet as incense, penetrating as attar, delicious as a summer breeze. \u201cIt smells pretty good, whatever it is,\u201d he answered."}, {"size": 682, "text": "Moran came up to where he stood, and looked at the slit he had made in the whale's carcass.

That's the biggest lump yet, I'll be bound. Is that all there is, mate?--look carefully.\u201d Her voice had dropped to a whisper. \u201cYes, yes; that's all.

Moran unleashed the hammock, and going down upon one knee examined the lump attentively. \u201cIt didn't seem possible,\u201d Wilbur heard her saying to herself; \u201cbut there can't be any mistake."}, {"size": 783, "text": "It's the stuff, right enough.

The party took stock of their weapons, and five huge cutting-in spades, a heavy knife from the galley, and a revolver of doubtful effectiveness were divided among them. The crew took the spades, Charlie the knife, and Wilbur the revolver. Moran had her own knife, a haftless dirk, such as is affected by all Norwegians, whether landsmen or sailors.

Talk to him, Charlie; see what he wants.\u201d Moran, Wilbur, and Charlie came part of the way toward Hoang and his fellow, and paused some fifteen feet distant, and a long colloquy ensued.

Near the hulk of the beached \u201cBertha Millner\u201d were grouped her crew, each armed with a long and lance-like cutting-in spade, watching and listening to the conference of the chiefs. The moon, almost down, had flushed blood-red, violently streaking the gray, smooth surface of the bay with her reflection. The tide was far out, rippling quietly along the reaches of wet sand.

In that whirl of swift action Wilbur could reconstruct but two brief pictures: the Chinaman, Hoang's companion, flying like one possessed along the shore; Hoang himself flung headlong into the arms of the \u201cBertha's\u201d coolies, and Moran, her eyes blazing, her thick braids flying, brandishing"}, {"size": 636, "text": "her fist as she shouted at the top of her deep voice, \u201cWe've got you, anyhow!\u201d They had taken Hoang prisoner, whether by treachery or not, Wilbur did not exactly know; and, even if unfair means had been used, he could not repress a feeling of delight and satisfaction as he told himself that in the very beginning of the fight that was to follow he and his mates had gained the first advantage.

Wilbur could no longer conceive of her as a woman of the days of civilization. She was lapsing back to the eighth century again--to the Vikings, the sea-wolves, the Berserkers. \u201cNow you're going to talk,\u201d she cried to Hoang, as the bound Chinaman sat upon the beach, leaning his back against the great skull."}, {"size": 768, "text": "\u201cCharlie, ask him if they saved the ambergris when the junk went down--if they've got it now?\u201d Charlie put the question in Chinese, but the beach-comber only twinkled his vicious eyes upon them and held his peace.

Hoang wiped the blood from his face upon his shoulder and set his jaws. He did not answer. \u201cYou will talk before I'm done with you, my friend; don't get any wrong notions in your head about that,\u201d Moran continued, her teeth clinched. \u201cCharlie,\u201d she added, \u201cis there a file aboard the schooner?\u201d \u201cI tink um yass, boss hab got file.\u201d \u201cIn the tool-chest, isn't it?\u201d Charlie nodded, and Moran ordered it to be fetched."}, {"size": 661, "text": "\u201cIf we're to fight that crowd,\u201d she said, speaking to herself and in a rapid voice, thick from excitement and passion, \u201cwe've got to know where they've hid the loot, and what weapons they've got. If they have a rifle or a shotgun with them, it's going to make a big difference for us. The other fellow escaped and has gone back to warn the rest. It's fight now, and no mistake.\u201d The Chinaman who had been sent aboard the schooner returned, carrying a long, rather coarse-grained file.

They had no rifle. A shotgun had been on board, but had gone down with the sinking of the junk.

The party set off down the beach. The moon had long since gone down, and the dawn was whitening over the eastern horizon. Landward, ragged blankets of morning mist lay close in the hollows here and there. It was profoundly still. The stars were still out. The surface of Magdalena Bay was smooth as a sheet of gray silk.

Fight um See Yups.\u201d Another half-hour passed. At times when they halted they began to hear the faint murmur of the creek, just beyond which was the broken and crumbling shanty, relic of an old Portuguese whaling-camp, where the beach-combers were camped. At Charlie's suggestion the party made a circuit, describing a half moon, to landward, so as to come out upon the enemy sheltered by the sand-dunes."}, {"size": 681, "text": "Twenty minutes later they crossed the creek about four hundred yards from the shore.

A few moments later Charlie held up his hand, and the men halted. The noise of the creek chattering into the tidewater of the bay was plainly audible just beyond; a ridge of sand, covered thinly with sage-brush, and a faint column of smoke rose into the air over the ridge itself."}, {"size": 603, "text": "They were close in.

The silence and absolute lack of motion on the part of these small, half-naked Chinamen, with their ape-like muzzles and twinkling eyes, was ominous.

Still foot by foot the forward movement continued.

The thing, to Wilbur's mind, should have been done suddenly if it was to be done at all. The best course now was to return to camp and try some other plan.

Wilbur's revolver was a self-cocker. He raised it again, drawing hard on the trigger as he did so. It roared and leaped in his hand, and a whiff of burned powder came to his nostrils.

It was only the thickness of his boots that saved Wilbur from being hamstrung where he stood. As it was, he felt the blade bite almost to the bone, and heard the blood squelch in the sole of his boot, as he staggered for the moment, almost tripping over the man in front of him.

He was close in when the fire began to leap from the one window; now he could go no further. He turned to run sidewise between his enemy and the burning cabin. Wilbur thrust his foot sharply forward; the beach-comber tripped, staggered, and before he had reached the ground Wilbur had driven home the knife."}, {"size": 605, "text": "Then suddenly, at the sight of his smitten enemy rolling on the ground at his feet, the primitive man, the half-brute of the stone age, leaped to life in Wilbur's breast--he felt his muscles thrilling with a strength they had not known before. His nerves, stretched tense as harp-strings, were vibrating to a new tune. His blood spun through his veins till his ears roared with the rush of it. Never had he conceived of such savage exultation as that which mastered him at that instant. The knowledge that he could kill filled him with a sense of power that was veritably royal. He felt physically larger."}, {"size": 615, "text": "It was the joy of battle, the horrid exhilaration of killing, the animal of the race, the human brute suddenly aroused and dominating every instinct and tradition of centuries of civilization.

As he turned about, knife in hand, debating what next he should do, a figure burst down upon him, shadowy and distorted through the haze. It was Moran, but Moran as Wilbur had never seen her before. Her eyes were blazing under her thick frown like fire under a bush."}, {"size": 723, "text": "Her arms were bared to the elbow, her heavy ropes of hair flying and coiling from her in all directions, while with a voice hoarse from shouting she sang, or rather chanted, in her long-forgotten Norse tongue, fragments of old sagas, words, and sentences, meaningless even to herself. The fury of battle had exalted her to a sort of frenzy. She was beside herself with excitement. Once more she had lapsed back to the Vikings and sea-rovers of the tenth century--she was Brunhilde again, a shield-maiden, a Valkyrie, a Berserker and the daughter of Berserkers, and like them she fought in a veritable frenzy, seeing nothing, hearing nothing, every sense exalted, every force doubled, insensible to pain, deaf to all reason."}, {"size": 830, "text": "Her dirk uplifted, she rushed upon Wilbur, never once pausing in her chant.

Moran!\u201d he called. \u201cWhat is it--you're wrong! It-s I. It's Wilbur--your mate, can't you see?\u201d Moran could not see--blind to friend or foe, as she was deaf to reason, she struck at him with all the strength of her arm. But there was no skill in her fighting now. Wilbur dropped his own knife and gripped her right wrist. She closed with him upon the instant, clutching at his throat with her one free hand; and as he felt her strength--doubled and tripled in the fury of her madness--Wilbur knew that, however easily he had overcome his enemy of a moment before, he was now fighting for his very life."}, {"size": 742, "text": "At first, Wilbur merely struggled to keep her from him--to prevent her using her dirk.

He ceased to see things in their proportion. His new-found strength gloried in matching itself with another strength that was its equal. He fought with Moran--not as he would fight with either woman or man, or with anything human, for the matter of that. He fought with her as against some impersonal force that it was incumbent upon him to conquer--that it was imperative he should conquer if he wished to live."}, {"size": 786, "text": "When she struck, he struck blow for blow, force for force, his strength against hers, glorying in that strange contest, though he never once forgot that this last enemy was the girl he loved.

Already she had dropped or flung away the dirk, and their battle had become an issue of sheer physical strength between them. It was a question now as to who should master the other. Twice she had fought Wilbur to his knees, the heel of her hand upon his face, his head thrust back between his shoulders, and twice he had wrenched away, rising to his feet again, panting, bleeding even, but with his teeth set and all his resolution at the sticking-point."}, {"size": 610, "text": "Once he saw his chance, and planted his knuckles squarely between her eyes where her frown was knotted hard, hoping to stun her and end the fight once and for all. But the blow did not seem to affect her in the least.

Come on, Moran.\u201d It was no longer Moran who took the initiative--who was the leader. The brief fight upon the shore had changed all that. It was Wilbur who was now the master, it was Wilbur who was aggressive. He had known what it meant to kill. He was no longer afraid of anything, no longer hesitating. He had felt a sudden quadrupling of all his strength, moral and physical.

I'm going to get one more before the show is over.\u201d The two passed out of the zone of smoke, and reached the other side of the burning cabin just in time to see the last of the struggle.

As Wilbur and Moran came around the cabin they saw the \u201cBertha Millner's\u201d Chinamen in a group, not far from the water's edge, reassembled after the fight--panting and bloody, some of them bare to the belt, their weapons still in their hands.

Just under the armpit was the mark of the bullet--a small puncture already closed, half hidden under a clot or two of blood. The coolie lay quite unconscious, his eyes wide open, drawing a faint, quick breath at irregular intervals. \u201cWhat do you think, mate?\u201d asked Moran in a low voice. \u201cI think he's got it through the lungs,\u201d answered Wilbur, frowning in distress and perplexity."}, {"size": 601, "text": "\u201cPoor old Charlie!\u201d Moran went down on a knee, and put a finger on the slim, corded wrist, yellow as old ivory. \u201cCharlie,\u201d she called--\u201cCharlie, here, don't you know me?

The moment the beach-combers had been made aware of the meditated attack, it would have been an easy matter for them to have hidden the ambergris--destroyed it even. In two strides Wilbur had reached the beach-combers' dory and was groping in the forward cuddy. Then he uttered a great shout of satisfaction.

At all events, we carried our point. We got the loot.

In accordance with Wilbur's orders, Charlie was carried aboard the dory; which, with two Chinamen at the oars, and the ambergris stowed again into the cuddy, at once set off for the schooner.

He had already been studying the schooner through his front window and had recognized her, and at once asked Wilbur news of Captain Kitchell."}, {"size": 737, "text": "Wilbur told him as much of his story as was necessary, but from the captain's talk he gathered that the news of his return had long since been wired from Coronado, and that it would be impossible to avoid a nine days' notoriety. The captain of the station (his name was Hodgson) made Wilbur royally welcome, insisted upon his dining with him, and himself called up Langley & Michaels as soon as the meal was over. It was he who offered the only plausible solution of the mystery of the lifting and shaking of the schooner and the wrecking of the junk. Though Wilbur was not satisfied with Hodgson's explanation, it was the only one he ever heard. When he had spoken of the matter, Hodgson had nodded his head. \u201cSulphur-bottoms,\u201d he said."}, {"size": 644, "text": "\u201cYes; they're a kind of right-whale; they get barnacles and a kind of marine lice on their backs, and come up and scratch them selves against a ship's keel, just like a hog under a fence.\u201d When Wilbur's business was done, and he was making ready to return to the schooner, Hodgson remarked suddenly: \u201cHear you've got a strapping fine girl aboard with you. Where did you fall in with her?\u201d and he winked and grinned.Wilbur started as though struck, and took himself hurriedly away; but the man's words had touched off in his brain a veritable mine of conjecture. Moran in Magdalena Bay was consistent, congruous, and fitted into her environment."}, {"size": 877, "text": "But how--how was Wilbur to explain her to San Francisco, and how could his behavior seem else than ridiculous to the men of his club and to the women whose dinner invitations he was wont to receive? They could not understand the change that had been wrought in him; they did not know Moran, the savage, half-tamed Valkyrie so suddenly become a woman. Hurry as he would, the schooner could not be put to sea again within a fortnight. Even though he elected to live aboard in the meanwhile, the very business of her preparation would call him to the city again and again. Moran could not be kept a secret. As it was, all the world knew of her by now. On the other hand he could easily understand her position; to her it seemed simplicity itself that they two who loved each other should sail away and pass their lives together upon the sea, as she and her father had done before."}, {"size": 659, "text": "Like most men, Wilbur had to walk when he was thinking hard. He sent the dory back to the schooner with word to Moran that he would take a walk around the beach and return in an hour or two. He set off along the shore in the direction of Fort Mason, the old red-brick fort at the entrance to the Golden Gate. At this point in the Presidio Government reservation the land is solitary. Wilbur followed the line of the beach to the old fort; and there, on the very threshold of the Western world, at the very outpost of civilization, sat down in the lee of the crumbling fortification, and scene by scene reviewed the extraordinary events of the past six months."}, {"size": 808, "text": "In front of him ran the narrow channel of the Golden Gate; to his right was the bay and the city; at his left the open Pacific. He saw himself the day of his advent aboard the \u201cBertha\u201d in his top hat and frock coat; saw himself later \u201cbraking down\u201d at the windlass, the \u201cPetrel\u201d within hailing distance. Then the pictures began to thicken fast: the derelict bark \u201cLady Letty\u201d rolling to her scuppers, abandoned and lonely; the \u201cboy\u201d in the wheel-box; Kitchell wrenching open the desk in the captain's stateroom; Captain Sternersen buried at sea, his false teeth upside down; the black fury of the squall, and Moran at the wheel; Moran lying at full length on the deck, getting the altitude of a star; Magdalena Bay; the shark-fishing; the mysterious lifting and shuddering of the schooner; the beach-combers'"}, {"size": 750, "text": "junk, with its staring red eyes; Hoang, naked to the waist, gleaming with sweat and whale-oil; the ambergris; the race to beach the sinking schooner; the never-to-be-forgotten night when he and Moran had camped together on the beach; Hoang taken prisoner, and the hideous filing of his teeth; the beach-combers, silent and watchful behind their sand breastworks; the Chinaman he had killed twitching and hic-coughing at his feet; Moran turned Berserker, bursting down upon him through a haze of smoke; Charlie dying in the hammock aboard the schooner, ordering his funeral with its \u201cfour-piecee horse\u201d; Coronado; the incongruous scene in the ballroom; and, last of all, Josie Herrick in white duck and kid shoes, giving her hand to Moran in her boots"}, {"size": 624, "text": "and belt, hatless as ever, her sleeves rolled up to above the elbows, her white, strong arm extended, her ruddy face, and pale, milk-blue eyes gravely observant, her heavy braids, yellow as ripening rye, hanging over her shoulder and breast. A sudden explosion of cold wind, striking down blanket-wise and bewildering from out the west, made Wilbur look up quickly. The gray sky seemed scudding along close overhead. The bay, the narrow channel of the Golden Gate, the outside ocean, were all whitening with crests of waves. At his feet the huge green ground-swells thundered to the attack of the fort's granite foundations."}, {"size": 387, "text": "Through the Gate, the bay seemed rushing out to the Pacific. A bewildered gull shot by, tacking and slanting against the gusts that would drive it out to sea. Evidently the storm was not far off. Wilbur rose to his feet, and saw the \u201cBertha Millner,\u201d close in, unbridled and free as a runaway horse, headed directly for the open sea, and rushing on with all the impetus of wind and tide!"}, {"size": 736, "text": "XIV. THE OCEAN IS CALLING FOR YOU A little while after Wilbur had set off for the station, while Moran was making the last entries in the log-book, seated at the table in the cabin, Jim appeared at the door. \u201cWell,\u201d she said, looking up. \u201cChina boy him want go asho' plenty big, seeum flen up Chinatown in um city.\u201d \u201cShore leave, is it?\u201d said Moran. \u201cYou deserted once before without even saying good-by; and my hand in the fire, you'll come back this time dotty with opium. Get away with you. We'll have men aboard here in a few days.\u201d \u201cCan go?\u201d inquired Jim suavely. \u201cI said so. Report our arrival to your Six Companies.\u201d Hoang rowed Jim and the coolies ashore, and then returned to the schooner with the dory and streamed her astern."}, {"size": 687, "text": "As he passed the cabin door on his way forward, Moran hailed him. \u201cI thought you went ashore?\u201d she cried. \u201cHeap flaid,\u201d he answered. \u201cHim other boy go up Chinatown; him tell Sam Yup; I tink Sam Yup alla same killee me. I no leaveum ship two, thlee day; bimeby I go Olegon. I stay topside ship. You wantum cook. I cook plenty fine; standum watch for you.\u201d Indeed, ever since leaving Coronado the ex-beach-comber had made himself very useful about the schooner; had been, in fact, obsequiousness itself, and seemed to be particularly desirous of gaining the good-will of the \u201cBertha's\u201d officers. He understood pigeon English better than Jim, and spoke it even better than Charlie had done."}, {"size": 602, "text": "He acted the part of interpreter between Wilbur and the hands; even turned to in the galley upon occasion; and of his own accord offered to give the vessel a coat of paint above the water-line. Moran turned back to her log, and Hoang went forward. Standing on the forward deck, he looked after the \u201cBertha's\u201d coolies until they disappeared behind a row of pine-trees on the Presidio Reservation, going cityward. Wilbur was nowhere in sight. For a longtime Hoang studied the Lifeboat Station narrowly, while he made a great show of coiling a length of rope. The station was just out of hailing distance."}, {"size": 612, "text": "Nobody seemed stirring. The whole shore and back land thereabout was deserted; the edge of the city was four miles distant. Hoang returned to the forecastle-hatch and went below, groping under his bunk in his ditty-box. \u201cWell, what is it?\u201d exclaimed Moran a moment later, as the beach-comber entered the cabin, and shut the door behind him. Hoang did not answer; but she did not need to repeat the question. In an instant Moran knew very well what he had come for. \u201cGod!\u201d she exclaimed under her breath, springing to her feet. \u201cWhy didn't we think of this!\u201d Hoang slipped his knife from the sleeve of his blouse."}, {"size": 639, "text": "For an instant the old imperiousness, the old savage pride and anger, leaped again in Moran's breast--then died away forever. She was no longer the same Moran of that first fight on board the schooner, when the beach-combers had plundered her of her \u201cloot.\u201d Only a few weeks ago, and she would have fought with Hoang without hesitation and without mercy; would have wrenched a leg from the table and brained him where he stood. But she had learned since to know what it meant to be dependent; to rely for protection upon some one who was stronger than she; to know her weakness; to know that she was at last a woman, and to be proud of it."}, {"size": 649, "text": "She did not fight; she had no thought of fighting. Instinctively she cried aloud, \u201cMate--mate!--Oh, mate, where are you? Help me!\u201d and Hoang's knife nailed the words within her throat. The \u201cloot\u201d was in a brass-bound chest under one of the cabin's bunks, stowed in two gunny-bags. Hoang drew them out, knotted the two together, and, slinging them over his shoulder, regained the deck. He looked carefully at the angry sky and swelling seas, noting the direction of the wind and set of the tide; then went forward and cast the anchor-chains from the windlass in such a manner that the schooner must inevitably wrench free with the first heavy strain."}, {"size": 791, "text": "The dory was still tugging at the line astern. Hoang dropped the sacks in the boat, swung himself over the side, and rowed calmly toward the station's wharf. If any notion of putting to sea with the schooner had entered the obscure, perverted cunning of his mind, he had almost instantly rejected it. Chinatown was his aim; once there and under the protection of his Tong, Hoang knew that he was safe. He knew the hiding-places that the See Yup Association provided for its members--hiding places whose very existence was unknown to the police of the White Devil. No one interrupted--no one even noticed--his passage to the station. At best, it was nothing more than a coolie carrying a couple of gunny-sacks across his shoulder. Two hours later, Hoang was lost in San Francisco's Chinatown."}, {"size": 717, "text": "At the sight of the schooner sweeping out to sea, Wilbur was for an instant smitten rigid. What had happened? Where was Moran? Why was there nobody on board? A swift, sharp sense of some unnamed calamity leaped suddenly at his throat. Then he was aware of a crattering of hoofs along the road that led to the fort. Hodgson threw himself from one of the horses that were used in handling the surf-boat, and ran to him hatless and panting. \u201cMy God!\u201d he shouted. \u201cLook, your schooner, do you see her? She broke away after I'd started to tell you--to tell you--to tell you--your girl there on board--It was horrible!\u201d \u201cIs she all right?\u201d cried Wilbur, at top voice, for the clamor of the gale was increasing every second."}, {"size": 672, "text": "\u201cAll right! No; they've killed her--somebody--the coolies, I think--knifed her! I went out to ask you people to come into the station to have supper with me--\u201d \u201cKilled her--killed her! Who? I don't believe you--\u201d \u201cWait--to have supper with me, and I found her there on the cabin floor. She was still breathing. I carried her up on deck--there was nobody else aboard. I carried her up and laid her on the deck--and she died there. Just now I came after you to tell you, and--\u201d \u201cGood God Almighty, man! who killed her? Where is she? Oh--but of course it isn't true! How did you know? Moran killed! Moran killed!\u201d \u201cAnd the schooner broke away after I started!\u201d \u201cMoran killed!"}, {"size": 612, "text": "But--but--she's not dead yet; we'll have to see--\u201d \u201cShe died on the deck; I brought her up and laid her on--\u201d \u201cHow do you know she's dead? Where is she? Come on, we'll go right back to her--to the station!\u201d \u201cShe's on board--out there!\u201d \u201cWhere--where is she? My God, man, tell me where she is!\u201d \u201cOut there aboard the schooner. I brought her up on deck--I left her on the schooner--on the deck--she was stabbed in the throat--and then came after you to tell you. Then the schooner broke away while I was coming; she's drifting out to sea now!\u201d \u201cWhere is she? Where is she?\u201d \u201cWho--the girl--the schooner--which one?"}, {"size": 813, "text": "The girl is on the schooner--and the schooner--that's her, right there--she's drifting out to sea!\u201d Wilbur put both hands to his temples, closing his eyes. \u201cI'll go back!\u201d exclaimed Hodgson. \u201cWe'll have the surf-boat out and get after her; we'll bring the body back!\u201d \u201cNo, no!\u201d cried Wilbur, \u201cit's better--this way. Leave her, let her go--she's going out to sea again!\u201d \u201cBut the schooner won't live two hours outside in this weather; she'll go down!\u201d \u201cIt's better--that way--let her go. I want it so!\u201d \u201cI can't stay!\u201d cried the other again. \u201cIf the patrol should sig-storm coming up, and I've got to be at my station.\u201d Wilbur did not answer; he was watching the schooner. \u201cI can't stay!\u201d cried the other again. \u201cIf the patrol should signal--I can't stop here, I must be on duty. Come back, you can't do anything!\u201d"}, {"size": 690, "text": "\u201cI have got to go!\u201d Hodgson ran back, swung himself on the horse, and rode away at a furious gallop, inclining his head against the gusts. And the schooner in a world of flying spray, white scud, and driving spoondrift, her cordage humming, her forefoot churning, the flag at her peak straining stiff in the gale, came up into the narrow passage of the Golden Gate, riding high upon the outgoing tide. On she came, swinging from crest to crest of the waves that kept her company and that ran to meet the ocean, shouting and calling out beyond there under the low, scudding clouds. Wilbur had climbed to the top of the old fort. Erect upon its granite ledge he stood, and watched and waited."}, {"size": 747, "text": "Not once did the \u201cBertha Millner\u201d falter in her race. Like an unbitted horse, all restraint shaken off, she ran free toward the ocean as to her pasture-land. She came nearer, nearer, rising and rolling with the seas, her bowsprit held due west, pointing like a finger out to sea, to the west--out to the world of romance. And then at last, as the little vessel drew opposite the old fort and passed not one hundred yards away, Wilbur, watching from the rampart, saw Moran lying upon the deck with outstretched arms and calm, upturned face; lying upon the deck of that lonely fleeing schooner as upon a bed of honor, still and calm, her great braids smooth upon her breast, her arms wide; alone with the sea; alone in death as she had been in life."}, {"size": 754, "text": "She passed out of his life as she had come into it--alone, upon a derelict ship, abandoned to the sea. She went out with the tide, out with the storms; out, out, out to the great gray Pacific that knew her and loved her, and that shouted and called for her, and thundered in the joy of her as she came to meet him like a bride to meet a bridegroom. \u201cGood-by, Moran!\u201d shouted Wilbur as she passed. \u201cGood-by, good-by, Moran! You were not for me--not for me! The ocean is calling for you, dear; don't you hear him? Don't you hear him? Good-by, good-by, good-by!\u201d The schooner swept by, shot like an arrow through the swirling currents of the Golden Gate, and dipped and bowed and courtesied to the Pacific that reached toward her his myriad curling fingers."}, {"size": 543, "text": "They infolded her, held her close, and drew her swiftly, swiftly out to the great heaving bosom, tumultuous and beating in its mighty joy, its savage exultation of possession. Wilbur stood watching. The little schooner lessened in the distance--became a shadow in mist and flying spray--a shadow moving upon the face of the great waste of water. Fainter and fainter she grew, vanished, reappeared, was heaved up again--a mere speck upon the western sky--a speck that dwindled and dwindled, then slowly melted away into the gray of the horizon."}]}
