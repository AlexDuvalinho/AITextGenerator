The Knight Passes A KNIGHT OF THE CUMBERLAND I. THE BLIGHT IN THE HILLS High noon of a crisp October day, sunshine flooding the earth with the warmth and light of old wine and, going single-file up through the jagged gap that the dripping of water has worn down through the Cumberland Mountains from crest to valley-level, a gray horse and two big mules, a man and two young girls."}, {"size": 624, "text": "On the gray horse, I led the tortuous way. After me came my small sister--and after her and like her, mule-back, rode the Blight--dressed as she would be for a gallop in Central Park or to ride a hunter in a horse show. I was taking them, according to promise, where the feet of other women than mountaineers had never trod--beyond the crest of the Big Black--to the waters of the Cumberland--the lair of moonshiner and feudsman, where is yet pocketed a civilization that, elsewhere, is long ago gone. This had been a pet dream of the Blight's for a long time, and now the dream was coming true. The Blight was in the hills."}, {"size": 668, "text": "Nobody ever went to her mother's house without asking to see her even when she was a little thing with black hair, merry face and black eyes. Both men and women, with children of their own, have told me that she was, perhaps, the most fascinating child that ever lived. There be some who claim that she has never changed--and I am among them. She began early, regardless of age, sex or previous condition of servitude--she continues recklessly as she began--and none makes complaint. Thus was it in her own world--thus it was when she came to mine. On the way down from the North, the conductor's voice changed from a command to a request when he asked for her ticket."}, {"size": 757, "text": "The jacketed lord of the dining-car saw her from afar and advanced to show her to a seat--that she might ride forward, sit next to a shaded window and be free from the glare of the sun on the other side. Two porters made a rush for her bag when she got off the car, and the proprietor of the little hotel in the little town where we had to wait several hours for the train into the mountains gave her the bridal chamber for an afternoon nap. From this little town to \u201cThe Gap\u201d is the worst sixty-mile ride, perhaps, in the world. She sat in a dirty day-coach; the smoke rolled in at the windows and doors; the cars shook and swayed and lumbered around curves and down and up gorges; there were about her rough men, crying children, slatternly women, tobacco"}, {"size": 649, "text": "juice, peanuts, popcorn and apple cores, but dainty, serene and as merry as ever, she sat through that ride with a radiant smile, her keen black eyes noting everything unlovely within and the glory of hill, tree and chasm without. Next morning at home, where we rise early, no one was allowed to waken her and she had breakfast in bed--for the Blight's gentle tyranny was established on sight and varied not at the Gap. When she went down the street that day everybody stared surreptitiously and with perfect respect, as her dainty black plumed figure passed; the post-office clerk could barely bring himself to say that there was no letter for her."}, {"size": 683, "text": "The soda-fountain boy nearly filled her glass with syrup before he saw that he was not strictly minding his own business; the clerk, when I bought chocolate for her, unblushingly added extra weight and, as we went back, she met them both--Marston, the young engineer from the North, crossing the street and, at the same moment, a drunken young tough with an infuriated face reeling in a run around the corner ahead of us as though he were being pursued. Now we have a volunteer police guard some forty strong at the Gap--and from habit, I started for him, but the Blight caught my arm tight. The young engineer in three strides had reached the curb-stone and all he sternly said was:"}, {"size": 687, "text": "The drunken youth wheeled and his right hand shot toward his hip pocket. The engineer was belted with a pistol, but with one lightning movement and an incredibly long reach, his right fist caught the fellow's jaw so that he pitched backward and collapsed like an empty bag. Then the engineer caught sight of the Blight's bewildered face, flushed, gripped his hands in front of him and simply stared. At last he saw me: \u201cOh,\u201d he said, \u201chow do you do?\u201d and he turned to his prisoner, but the panting sergeant and another policeman--also a volunteer--were already lifting him to his feet. I introduced the boy and the Blight then, and for the first time in my life I saw the Blight--shaken."}, {"size": 606, "text": "Round-eyed, she merely gazed at him. \u201cThat was pretty well done,\u201d I said. \u201cOh, he was drunk and I knew he would be slow.\u201d Now something curious happened. The dazed prisoner was on his feet, and his captors were starting with him to the calaboose when he seemed suddenly to come to his senses. \u201cJes wait a minute, will ye?\u201d he said quietly, and his captors, thinking perhaps that he wanted to say something to me, stopped. The mountain youth turned a strangely sobered face and fixed his blue eyes on the engineer as though he were searing every feature of that imperturbable young man in his brain forever."}, {"size": 886, "text": "It was not a bad face, but the avenging hatred in it was fearful. Then he, too, saw the Blight, his face calmed magically and he, too, stared at her, and turned away with an oath checked at his lips. We went on--the Blight thrilled, for she had heard much of our volunteer force at the Gap and had seen something already. Presently I looked back. Prisoner and captors were climbing the little hill toward the calaboose and the mountain boy just then turned his head and I could swear that his eyes sought not the engineer, whom we left at the corner, but, like the engineer, he was looking at the Blight. Whereat I did not wonder--particularly as to the engineer. He had been in the mountains for a long time and I knew what this vision from home meant to him. He turned up at the house quite early that night. \u201cI'm not on duty until eleven,\u201d he said hesitantly, \u201cand I thought I'd----\u201d"}, {"size": 630, "text": "I asked him a few questions about business and then I left him and the Blight alone. When I came back she had a Gatling gun of eager questions ranged on him and--happy withal--he was squirming no little. I followed him to the gate. \u201cAre you really going over into those God-forsaken mountains?\u201d he asked. \u201cAnd you are going to take HER?\u201d \u201cOh, I beg your pardon.\u201d He strode away. \u201cComing up by the mines?\u201d he called back. \u201cPerhaps will you show us around?\u201d \u201cI guess I will,\u201d he said emphatically, and he went on to risk his neck on a ten-mile ride along a mountain road in the dark. \u201cI LIKE a man,\u201d said the Blight. \u201cI like a MAN.\u201d"}, {"size": 707, "text": "Of course the Blight must see everything, so she insisted on going to the police court next morning for the trial of the mountain boy. The boy was in the witness chair when we got there, and the Hon. Samuel Budd was his counsel. He had volunteered to defend the prisoner, I was soon told, and then I understood. The November election was not far off and the Hon. Samuel Budd was candidate for legislature. More even, the boy's father was a warm supporter of Mr. Budd and the boy himself might perhaps render good service in the cause when the time came--as indeed he did. On one of the front chairs sat the young engineer and it was a question whether he or the prisoner saw the Blight's black plumes first."}, {"size": 630, "text": "The eyes of both flashed toward her simultaneously, the engineer colored perceptibly and the mountain boy stopped short in speech and his pallid face flushed with unmistakable shame. Then he went on: \u201cHe had liquered up,\u201d he said, \u201cand had got tight afore he knowed it and he didn't mean no harm and had never been arrested afore in his whole life.\u201d \u201cHave you ever been drunk before?\u201d asked the prosecuting attorney severely. The lad looked surprised. \u201cCo'se I have, but I ain't goin' to agin--leastwise not in this here town.\u201d There was a general laugh at this and the aged mayor rapped loudly. \u201cThat will do,\u201d said the attorney."}, {"size": 648, "text": "The lad stepped down, hitched his chair slightly so that his back was to the Blight, sank down in it until his head rested on the back of the chair and crossed his legs. The Hon. Samuel Budd arose and the Blight looked at him with wonder. His long yellow hair was parted in the middle and brushed with plaster-like precision behind two enormous ears, he wore spectacles, gold-rimmed and with great staring lenses, and his face was smooth and ageless. He caressed his chin ruminatingly and rolled his lips until they settled into a fine resultant of wisdom, patience, toleration and firmness. His manner was profound and his voice oily and soothing."}, {"size": 662, "text": "\u201cMay it please your Honor--my young friend frankly pleads guilty.\u201d He paused as though the majesty of the law could ask no more. \u201cHe is a young man of naturally high and somewhat--naturally, too, no doubt--bibulous spirits. Homoepathically--if inversely--the result was logical. In the untrammelled life of the liberty-breathing mountains, where the stern spirit of law and order, of which your Honor is the august symbol, does not prevail as it does here--thanks to your Honor's wise and just dispensations--the lad has, I may say, naturally acquired a certain recklessness of mood--indulgence which, however easily condoned there, must here be sternly rebuked."}, {"size": 631, "text": "At the same time, he knew not the conditions here, he became exhilarated without malice, prepensey or even, I may say, consciousness. He would not have done as he has, if he had known what he knows now, and, knowing, he will not repeat the offence. I need say no more. I plead simply that your Honor will temper the justice that is only yours with the mercy that is yours--only.\u201d His Honor was visibly affected and to cover it--his methods being informal--he said with sharp irrelevancy: \u201cWho bailed this young feller out last night?\u201d The sergeant spoke: \u201cWhy, Mr. Marston thar\u201d--with outstretched finger toward the young engineer."}, {"size": 620, "text": "The Blight's black eyes leaped with exultant appreciation and the engineer turned crimson. His Honor rolled his quid around in his mouth once, and peered over his glasses: \u201cI fine this young feller two dollars and costs.\u201d The young fellow had turned slowly in his chair and his blue eyes blazed at the engineer with unappeasable hatred. I doubt if he had heard his Honor's voice. \u201cI want ye to know that I'm obleeged to ye an' I ain't a-goin' to fergit it; but if I'd a known hit was you I'd a stayed in jail an' seen you in hell afore I'd a been bounden to ye.\u201d \u201cTen dollars fer contempt of couht.\u201d The boy was hot now."}, {"size": 824, "text": "\u201cOh, fine and be--\u201d The Hon. Samuel Budd had him by the shoulder, the boy swallowed his voice and his starting tears of rage, and after a whisper to his Honor, the Hon. Samuel led him out. Outside, the engineer laughed to the Blight: \u201cPretty peppery, isn't he?\u201d but the Blight said nothing, and later we saw the youth on a gray horse crossing the bridge and conducted by the Hon. Samuel Budd, who stopped and waved him toward the mountains. The boy went on and across the plateau, the gray Gap swallowed him. That night, at the post-office, the Hon. Sam plucked me aside by the sleeve. \u201cI know Marston is agin me in this race--but I'll do him a good turn just the same. You tell him to watch out for that young fellow. He's all right when he's sober, but when he's drunk--well, over in Kentucky, they call him the Wild Dog.\u201d"}, {"size": 795, "text": "Several days later we started out through that same Gap. The glum stableman looked at the Blight's girths three times, and with my own eyes starting and my heart in my mouth, I saw her pass behind her sixteen-hand-high mule and give him a friendly tap on the rump as she went by. The beast gave an appreciative flop of one ear and that was all. Had I done that, any further benefit to me or mine would be incorporated in the terms of an insurance policy. So, stating this, I believe I state the limit and can now go on to say at last that it was because she seemed to be loved by man and brute alike that a big man of her own town, whose body, big as it was, was yet too small for his heart and from whose brain things went off at queer angles, always christened her perversely as--\u201cThe Blight.\u201d"}, {"size": 707, "text": "II. ON THE WILD DOG'S TRAIL So up we went past Bee Rock, Preacher's Creek and Little Looney, past the mines where high on a \u201ctipple\u201d stood the young engineer looking down at us, and looking after the Blight as we passed on into a dim rocky avenue walled on each side with rhododendrons. I waved at him and shook my head--we would see him coming back. Beyond a deserted log-cabin we turned up a spur of the mountain. Around a clump of bushes we came on a gray-bearded mountaineer holding his horse by the bridle and from a covert high above two more men appeared with Winchesters. The Blight breathed forth an awed whisper: \u201cAre they moonshiners?\u201d I nodded sagely, \u201cMost likely,\u201d and the Blight was thrilled."}, {"size": 810, "text": "They might have been squirrel-hunters most innocent, but the Blight had heard much talk of moonshine stills and mountain feuds and the men who run them and I took the risk of denying her nothing. Up and up we went, those two mules swaying from side to side with a motion little short of elephantine and, by and by, the Blight called out: \u201cYou ride ahead and don't you DARE look back.\u201d Accustomed to obeying the Blight's orders, I rode ahead with eyes to the front. Presently, a shriek made me turn suddenly. It was nothing--my little sister's mule had gone near a steep cliff--perilously near, as its rider thought, but I saw why I must not look back; those two little girls were riding astride on side-saddles, the booted little right foot of each dangling stirrupless--a posture quite decorous but ludicrous."}, {"size": 665, "text": "\u201cLet us know if anybody comes,\u201d they cried. A mountaineer descended into sight around a loop of the path above. \u201cChange cars,\u201d I shouted. They changed and, passing, were grave, demure--then they changed again, and thus we climbed. Such a glory as was below, around and above us; the air like champagne; the sunlight rich and pouring like a flood on the gold that the beeches had strewn in the path, on the gold that the poplars still shook high above and shimmering on the royal scarlet of the maple and the sombre russet of the oak. From far below us to far above us a deep curving ravine was slashed into the mountain side as by one stroke of a gigantic scimitar."}, {"size": 602, "text": "The darkness deep down was lighted up with cool green, interfused with liquid gold. Russet and yellow splashed the mountain sides beyond and high up the maples were in a shaking blaze. The Blight's swift eyes took all in and with indrawn breath she drank it all deep down. An hour by sun we were near the top, which was bared of trees and turned into rich farm-land covered with blue-grass. Along these upland pastures, dotted with grazing cattle, and across them we rode toward the mountain wildernesses on the other side, down into which a zigzag path wriggles along the steep front of Benham's spur."}, {"size": 662, "text": "At the edge of the steep was a cabin and a bushy-bearded mountaineer, who looked like a brigand, answered my hail. He \u201cmought\u201d keep us all night, but he'd \u201cruther not, as we could git a place to stay down the spur.\u201d Could we get down before dark? The mountaineer lifted his eyes to where the sun was breaking the horizon of the west into streaks and splashes of yellow and crimson. \u201cOh, yes, you can git thar afore dark.\u201d Now I knew that the mountaineer's idea of distance is vague--but he knows how long it takes to get from one place to another. So we started down--dropping at once into thick dark woods, and as we went looping down, the deeper was the gloom."}, {"size": 624, "text": "That sun had suddenly severed all connection with the laws of gravity and sunk, and it was all the darker because the stars were not out. The path was steep and coiled downward like a wounded snake. In one place a tree had fallen across it, and to reach the next coil of the path below was dangerous. So I had the girls dismount and I led the gray horse down on his haunches. The mules refused to follow, which was rather unusual. I went back and from a safe distance in the rear I belabored them down. They cared neither for gray horse nor crooked path, but turned of their own devilish wills along the bushy mountain side."}, {"size": 624, "text": "As I ran after them the gray horse started calmly on down and those two girls shrieked with laughter--they knew no better. First one way and then the other down the mountain went those mules, with me after them, through thick bushes, over logs, stumps and bowlders and holes--crossing the path a dozen times. What that path was there for never occurred to those long-eared half asses, whole fools, and by and by, when the girls tried to shoo them down they clambered around and above them and struck the path back up the mountain. The horse had gone down one way, the mules up the other, and there was no health in anything."}, {"size": 635, "text": "The girls could not go up--so there was nothing to do but go down, which, hard as it was, was easier than going up. The path was not visible now. Once in a while I would stumble from it and crash through the bushes to the next coil below. Finally I went down, sliding one foot ahead all the time--knowing that when leaves rustled under that foot I was on the point of going astray. Sometimes I had to light a match to make sure of the way, and thus the ridiculous descent was made with those girls in high spirits behind. Indeed, the darker, rockier, steeper it got, the more they shrieked from pure joy--but I was anything than happy."}, {"size": 725, "text": "It was dangerous. I didn't know the cliffs and high rocks we might skirt and an unlucky guidance might land us in the creek-bed far down. But the blessed stars came out, the moon peered over a farther mountain and on the last spur there was the gray horse browsing in the path--and the sound of running water not far below. Fortunately on the gray horse were the saddle-bags of the chattering infants who thought the whole thing a mighty lark. We reached the running water, struck a flock of geese and knew, in consequence, that humanity was somewhere near. A few turns of the creek and a beacon light shone below. The pales of a picket fence, the cheering outlines of a log-cabin came in view and at a peaked gate I shouted:"}, {"size": 711, "text": "You enter no mountaineer's yard without that announcing cry. It was mediaeval, the Blight said, positively--two lorn damsels, a benighted knight partially stripped of his armor by bush and sharp-edged rock, a gray palfrey (she didn't mention the impatient asses that had turned homeward) and she wished I had a horn to wind. I wanted a \u201chorn\u201d badly enough--but it was not the kind men wind. By and by we got a response: \u201cHello!\u201d was the answer, as an opened door let out into the yard a broad band of light. Could we stay all night? The voice replied that the owner would see \u201cPap.\u201d \u201cPap\u201d seemed willing, and the boy opened the gate and into the house went the Blight and the little sister. Shortly, I followed."}, {"size": 756, "text": "There, all in one room, lighted by a huge wood-fire, rafters above, puncheon floor beneath--cane-bottomed chairs and two beds the only furniture-\u201cpap,\u201d barefooted, the old mother in the chimney-corner with a pipe, strings of red pepper-pods, beans and herbs hanging around and above, a married daughter with a child at her breast, two or three children with yellow hair and bare feet all looking with all their eyes at the two visitors who had dropped upon them from another world. The Blight's eyes were brighter than usual--that was the only sign she gave that she was not in her own drawing-room. Apparently she saw nothing strange or unusual even, but there was really nothing that she did not see or hear and absorb, as few others than the Blight can."}, {"size": 706, "text": "Straightway, the old woman knocked the ashes out of her pipe. \u201cI reckon you hain't had nothin' to eat,\u201d she said and disappeared. The old man asked questions, the young mother rocked her baby on her knees, the children got less shy and drew near the fireplace, the Blight and the little sister exchanged a furtive smile and the contrast of the extremes in American civilization, as shown in that little cabin, interested me mightily. \u201cYer snack's ready,\u201d said the old woman. The old man carried the chairs into the kitchen, and when I followed the girls were seated. The chairs were so low that their chins came barely over their plates, and demure and serious as they were they surely looked most comical."}, {"size": 660, "text": "There was the usual bacon and corn-bread and potatoes and sour milk, and the two girls struggled with the rude fare nobly. After supper I joined the old man and the old woman with a pipe--exchanging my tobacco for their long green with more satisfaction probably to me than to them, for the long green was good, and strong and fragrant. The old woman asked the Blight and the little sister many questions and they, in turn, showed great interest in the baby in arms, whereat the eighteen-year-old mother blushed and looked greatly pleased. \u201cYou got mighty purty black eyes,\u201d said the old woman to the Blight, and not to slight the little sister she added, \u201cAn'"}, {"size": 616, "text": "you got mighty purty teeth.\u201d The Blight showed hers in a radiant smile and the old woman turned back to her. \u201cOh, you've got both,\u201d she said and she shook her head, as though she were thinking of the damage they had done. It was my time now--to ask questions. They didn't have many amusements on that creek, I discovered--and no dances. Sometimes the boys went coon-hunting and there were corn-shuckings, house-raisings and quilting-parties. \u201cDoes anybody round here play the banjo?\u201d \u201cNone o' my boys,\u201d said the old woman, \u201cbut Tom Green's son down the creek--he follers pickin' the banjo a leetle.\u201d \u201cFollows pickin'"}, {"size": 819, "text": "\u201c--the Blight did not miss that phrase. \u201cWhat do you foller fer a livin'?\u201d the old man asked me suddenly. \u201cI write for a living.\u201d He thought a while. \u201cWell, it must be purty fine to have a good handwrite.\u201d This nearly dissolved the Blight and the little sister, but they held on heroically. \u201cIs there much fighting around here?\u201d I asked presently. \u201cNot much 'cept when one young feller up the river gets to tearin' up things. I heerd as how he was over to the Gap last week--raisin' hell. He comes by here on his way home.\u201d The Blight's eyes opened wide--apparently we were on his trail. It is not wise for a member of the police guard at the Gap to show too much curiosity about the lawless ones of the hills, and I asked no questions. \u201cThey calls him the Wild Dog over here,\u201d he added, and then he yawned cavernously."}, {"size": 640, "text": "I looked around with divining eye for the sleeping arrangements soon to come, which sometimes are embarrassing to \u201cfurriners\u201d who are unable to grasp at once the primitive unconsciousness of the mountaineers and, in consequence, accept a point of view natural to them because enforced by architectural limitations and a hospitality that turns no one seeking shelter from any door. They were, however, better prepared than I had hoped for. They had a spare room on the porch and just outside the door, and when the old woman led the two girls to it, I followed with their saddle-bags. The room was about seven feet by six and was windowless."}, {"size": 778, "text": "\u201cYou'd better leave your door open a little,\u201d I said, \u201cor you'll smother in there.\u201d \u201cWell,\u201d said the old woman, \u201chit's all right to leave the door open. Nothin's goin' ter bother ye, but one o' my sons is out a coon-huntin' and he mought come in, not knowin' you're thar. But you jes' holler an' he'll move on.\u201d She meant precisely what she said and saw no humor at all in such a possibility--but when the door closed, I could hear those girls stifling shrieks of laughter. Literally, that night, I was a member of the family. I had a bed to myself (the following night I was not so fortunate)--in one corner; behind the head of mine the old woman, the daughter-in-law and the baby had another in the other corner, and the old man with the two boys spread a pallet on the floor."}, {"size": 820, "text": "That is the invariable rule of courtesy with the mountaineer, to give his bed to the stranger and take to the floor himself, and, in passing, let me say that never, in a long experience, have I seen the slightest consciousness--much less immodesty--in a mountain cabin in my life. The same attitude on the part of the visitors is taken for granted--any other indeed holds mortal possibilities of offence--so that if the visitor has common sense, all embarrassment passes at once. The door was closed, the fire blazed on uncovered, the smothered talk and laughter of the two girls ceased, the coon-hunter came not and the night passed in peace. It must have been near daybreak that I was aroused by the old man leaving the cabin and I heard voices and the sound of horses' feet outside. When he came back he was grinning."}, {"size": 748, "text": "\u201cThe Wild Dog had 'em,\u201d he said. III. THE AURICULAR TALENT OF THE HON. SAMUEL BUDDBehind us came the Hon. Samuel Budd. Just when the sun was slitting the east with a long streak of fire, the Hon. Samuel was, with the jocund day, standing tiptoe in his stirrups on the misty mountain top and peering into the ravine down which we had slid the night before, and he grumbled no little when he saw that he, too, must get off his horse and slide down. The Hon. Samuel was ambitious, Southern, and a lawyer. Without saying, it goes that he was also a politician. He was not a native of the mountains, but he had cast his fortunes in the highlands, and he was taking the first step that he hoped would, before many years, land him in the National Capitol."}, {"size": 663, "text": "He really knew little about the mountaineers, even now, and he had never been among his constituents on Devil's Fork, where he was bound now. The campaign had so far been full of humor and full of trials--not the least of which sprang from the fact that it was sorghum time. Everybody through the mountains was making sorghum, and every mountain child was eating molasses. Now, as the world knows, the straightest way to the heart of the honest voter is through the women of the land, and the straightest way to the heart of the women is through the children of the land; and one method of winning both, with rural politicians, is to kiss the babies wide and far."}, {"size": 609, "text": "So as each infant, at sorghum time, has a circle of green-brown stickiness about his chubby lips, and as the Hon. Sam was averse to \u201clong sweetenin'\u201d even in his coffee, this particular political device just now was no small trial to the Hon. Samuel Budd. But in the language of one of his firmest supporters Uncle Tommie Hendricks: \u201cThe Hon. Sam done his duty, and he done it damn well.\u201d The issue at stake was the site of the new Court-House--two localities claiming the right undisputed, because they were the only two places in the county where there was enough level land for the Court-House to stand on."}, {"size": 625, "text": "Let no man think this a trivial issue. There had been a similar one over on the Virginia side once, and the opposing factions agreed to decide the question by the ancient wager of battle, fist and skull--two hundred men on each side--and the women of the county with difficulty prevented the fight. Just now, Mr. Budd was on his way to \u201cThe Pocket\u201d--the voting place of one faction--where he had never been, where the hostility against him was most bitter, and, that day, he knew he was \u201cup against\u201d Waterloo, the crossing of the Rubicon, holding the pass at Thermopylae, or any other historical crisis in the history of man."}, {"size": 605, "text": "I was saddling the mules when the cackling of geese in the creek announced the coming of the Hon. Samuel Budd, coming with his chin on his breast-deep in thought. Still his eyes beamed cheerily, he lifted his slouched hat gallantly to the Blight and the little sister, and he would wait for us to jog along with him. I told him of our troubles, meanwhile.

As we started back up the river the sisters started for the fields, and I thought of their stricken brother in the settlements, who must have been much like Mart. Back up the Big Black Mountain we toiled, and late in the afternoon we were on the State line that runs the crest of the Big Black.

The Guard wanted many men, but if they could have had their choice they would have picked out of the world of malefactors that same Wild Dog. Why all this should have thrown the Hon. Samuel Budd into such gloom I could not understand--except that the Wild Dog had been so loyal a henchman to him in politics, but later I learned a better reason, that threatened to cost the Hon.

And I knew no man would know that he had won the Blight until he had her at the altar and the priestly hand of benediction was above her head. Of such kind was the Blight.

Sam. \u201cI didn't do it, I swear I didn't know it. He's tricked me--he's tricked me! Don't shoot--you might hit that hoss!\u201d There was no doubt about the Hon. Sam's innocence. Instead of turning over an outlaw to the police, he had brought him into the inner shrine of law and order and he knew what a political asset for his enemies that insult would be."}, {"size": 719, "text": "And there was no doubt of the innocence of Mollie and Buck as they stood, Mollie wringing her hands and Buck with open mouth and startled face. There was no doubt about the innocence of anybody other than Dave Branham and the dare-devil Knight of the Cumberland. Marston had clutched at the Wild Dog's bridle and missed and the outlaw struck savagely at him with his spear. Nobody dared to shoot because of the scattering crowd, but every knight and every mounted policeman took out after the outlaw and the beating of hoofs pounded over the little mound and toward Poplar Hill. Marston ran to his horse at the upper end, threw his saddle on, and hesitated--there were enough after the Wild Dog and his horse was blown."}, {"size": 672, "text": "He listened to the yells and sounds of the chase encircling Poplar Hill. The outlaw was making for Lee. All at once the yells and hoof-beats seemed to sound nearer and Marston listened, astonished. The Wild Dog had wheeled and was coming back; he was going to make for the Gap, where sure safety lay. Marston buckled his girth and as he sprang on his horse, unconsciously taking his spear with him, the Wild Dog dashed from the trees at the far end of the field. As Marston started the Wild Dog saw him, pulled something that flashed from under his coat of mail, thrust it back again, and brandishing his spear, he came, full speed and yelling, up the middle of the field."}, {"size": 741, "text": "It was a strange thing to happen in these modern days, but Marston was an officer of the law and was between the Wild Dog and the Ford and liberty through the Gap, into the hills. The Wild Dog was an outlaw. It was Marston's duty to take him. The law does not prescribe with what weapon the lawless shall be subdued, and Marston's spear was the only weapon he had. Moreover, the Wild Dog's yell was a challenge that set his blood afire and the girl both loved was looking on. The crowd gathered the meaning of the joust--the knights were crashing toward each other with spears at rest. There were a few surprised oaths from men, a few low cries from women, and then dead silence in which the sound of hoofs on the hard turf was like thunder."}, {"size": 879, "text": "The Blight's face was white and the little sister was gripping my arm with both hands. A third horseman shot into view out of the woods at tight angles, to stop them, and it seemed that the three horses must crash together in a heap. With a moan the Blight buried her face on my shoulder. She shivered when the muffled thud of body against body and the splintering of wood rent the air; a chorus of shrieks arose about her, and when she lifted her frightened face Marston, the Discarded, was limp on the ground, his horse was staggering to his feet, and the Wild Dog was galloping past her, his helmet gleaming, his eyes ablaze, his teeth set, the handle of his broken spear clinched in his right hand, and blood streaming down the shoulder of the black horse. She heard the shots that were sent after him, she heard him plunge into the river, and then she saw and heard no more."}, {"size": 655, "text": "VIII. THE KNIGHT PASSES A telegram summoned the Blight a home next day. Marston was in bed with a ragged wound in the shoulder, and I took her to tell him good-by. I left the room for a few minutes, and when I came back their hands were unclasping, and for a Discarded Knight the engineer surely wore a happy though pallid face.That afternoon the train on which we left the Gap was brought to a sudden halt in Wildcat Valley by a piece of red flannel tied to the end of a stick that was planted midway the track. Across the track, farther on, lay a heavy piece of timber, and it was plain that somebody meant that, just at that place, the train must stop."}, {"size": 606, "text": "The Blight and I were seated on the rear platform and the Blight was taking a last look at her beloved hills. When the train started again, there was a cracking of twigs overhead and a shower of rhododendron leaves and flowers dropped from the air at the feet of the Blight. And when we pulled away from the high-walled cut we saw, motionless on a little mound, a black horse, and on him, motionless, the Knight of the Cumberland, the helmet on his head (that the Blight might know who he was, no doubt), and both hands clasping the broken handle of his spear, which rested across the pommel of his saddle."}, {"size": 367, "text": "Impulsively the Blight waved her hand to him and I could not help waving my hat; but he sat like a statue and, like a statue, sat on, simply looking after us as we were hurried along, until horse, broken shaft, and shoulders sank out of sight. And thus passed the Knight of the Cumberland with the last gleam that struck his helmet, spear-like, from the slanting sun."}]}
