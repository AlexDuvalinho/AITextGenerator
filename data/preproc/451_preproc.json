I don\u2019t mean the very young. No. The very young have, properly speaking, no moments. It is the privilege of early youth to live in advance of its days in all the beautiful continuity of hope which knows no pauses and no introspection. One closes behind one the little gate of mere boyishness--and enters an enchanted garden. Its very shades glow with promise."}, {"size": 705, "text": "Every turn of the path has its seduction. And it isn\u2019t because it is an undiscovered country. One knows well enough that all mankind had streamed that way. It is the charm of universal experience from which one expects an uncommon or personal sensation--a bit of one\u2019s own. One goes on recognizing the landmarks of the predecessors, excited, amused, taking the hard luck and the good luck together--the kicks and the half-pence, as the saying is--the picturesque common lot that holds so many possibilities for the deserving or perhaps for the lucky. Yes. One goes on. And the time, too, goes on--till one perceives ahead a shadow-line warning one that the region of early youth, too, must be left behind."}, {"size": 835, "text": "This is the period of life in which such moments of which I have spoken are likely to come. What moments? Why, the moments of boredom, of weariness, of dissatisfaction. Rash moments. I mean moments when the still young are inclined to commit rash actions, such as getting married suddenly or else throwing up a job for no reason. This is not a marriage story. It wasn\u2019t so bad as that with me. My action, rash as it was, had more the character of divorce--almost of desertion. For no reason on which a sensible person could put a finger I threw up my job--chucked my berth--left the ship of which the worst that could be said was that she was a steamship and therefore, perhaps, not entitled to that blind loyalty which. . . . However, it\u2019s no use trying to put a gloss on what even at the time I myself half suspected to be a caprice."}, {"size": 616, "text": "It was in an Eastern port. She was an Eastern ship, inasmuch as then she belonged to that port. She traded among dark islands on a blue reef-scarred sea, with the Red Ensign over the taffrail and at her masthead a house-flag, also red, but with a green border and with a white crescent in it. For an Arab owned her, and a Syed at that. Hence the green border on the flag. He was the head of a great House of Straits Arabs, but as loyal a subject of the complex British Empire as you could find east of the Suez Canal. World politics did not trouble him at all, but he had a great occult power amongst his own people."}, {"size": 622, "text": "It was all one to us who owned the ship. He had to employ white men in the shipping part of his business, and many of those he so employed had never set eyes on him from the first to the last day. I myself saw him but once, quite accidentally on a wharf--an old, dark little man blind in one eye, in a snowy robe and yellow slippers. He was having his hand severely kissed by a crowd of Malay pilgrims to whom he had done some favour, in the way of food and money. His alms-giving, I have heard, was most extensive, covering almost the whole Archipelago. For isn\u2019t it said that \u201cThe charitable man is the friend of Allah\u201d?"}, {"size": 674, "text": "Excellent (and picturesque) Arab owner, about whom one needed not to trouble one\u2019s head, a most excellent Scottish ship--for she was that from the keep up--excellent sea-boat, easy to keep clean, most handy in every way, and if it had not been for her internal propulsion, worthy of any man\u2019s love, I cherish to this day a profound respect for her memory. As to the kind of trade she was engaged in and the character of my shipmates, I could not have been happier if I had had the life and the men made to my order by a benevolent Enchanter. And suddenly I left all this. I left it in that, to us, inconsequential manner in which a bird flies away from a comfortable branch."}, {"size": 716, "text": "It was as though all unknowing I had heard a whisper or seen something. Well--perhaps! One day I was perfectly right and the next everything was gone--glamour, flavour, interest, contentment--everything. It was one of these moments, you know. The green sickness of late youth descended on me and carried me off. Carried me off that ship, I mean. We were only four white men on board, with a large crew of Kalashes and two Malay petty officers. The Captain stared hard as if wondering what ailed me. But he was a sailor, and he, too, had been young at one time. Presently a smile came to lurk under his thick iron-gray moustache, and he observed that, of course, if I felt I must go he couldn\u2019t keep me by main force."}, {"size": 652, "text": "And it was arranged that I should be paid off the next morning. As I was going out of his cabin he added suddenly, in a peculiar wistful tone, that he hoped I would find what I was so anxious to go and look for. A soft, cryptic utterance which seemed to reach deeper than any diamond-hard tool could have done. I do believe he understood my case. But the second engineer attacked me differently. He was a sturdy young Scot, with a smooth face and light eyes. His honest red countenance emerged out of the engine-room companion and then the whole robust man, with shirt sleeves turned up, wiping slowly the massive fore-arms with a lump of cotton-waste."}, {"size": 648, "text": "And his light eyes expressed bitter distaste, as though our friendship had turned to ashes. He said weightily: \u201cOh! Aye! I\u2019ve been thinking it was about time for you to run away home and get married to some silly girl.\u201d It was tacitly understood in the port that John Nieven was a fierce misogynist; and the absurd character of the sally convinced me that he meant to be nasty--very nasty--had meant to say the most crushing thing he could think of. My laugh sounded deprecatory. Nobody but a friend could be so angry as that. I became a little crestfallen. Our chief engineer also took a characteristic view of my action, but in a kindlier spirit."}, {"size": 613, "text": "He was young, too, but very thin, and with a mist of fluffy brown beard all round his haggard face. All day long, at sea or in harbour, he could be seen walking hastily up and down the after-deck, wearing an intense, spiritually rapt expression, which was caused by a perpetual consciousness of unpleasant physical sensations in his internal economy. For he was a confirmed dyspeptic. His view of my case was very simple. He said it was nothing but deranged liver. Of course! He suggested I should stay for another trip and meantime dose myself with a certain patent medicine in which his own belief was absolute."}, {"size": 615, "text": "\u201cI\u2019ll tell you what I\u2019ll do. I\u2019ll buy you two bottles, out of my own pocket. There. I can\u2019t say fairer than that, can I?\u201d I believe he would have perpetrated the atrocity (or generosity) at the merest sign of weakening on my part. By that time, however, I was more discontented, disgusted, and dogged than ever. The past eighteen months, so full of new and varied experience, appeared a dreary, prosaic waste of days. I felt--how shall I express it?--that there was no truth to be got out of them. What truth? I should have been hard put to it to explain. Probably, if pressed, I would have burst into tears simply."}, {"size": 642, "text": "I was young enough for that. Next day the Captain and I transacted our business in the Harbour Office. It was a lofty, big, cool, white room, where the screened light of day glowed serenely. Everybody in it--the officials, the public--were in white. Only the heavy polished desks gleamed darkly in a central avenue, and some papers lying on them were blue. Enormous punkahs sent from on high a gentle draught through that immaculate interior and upon our perspiring heads. The official behind the desk we approached grinned amiably and kept it up till, in answer to his perfunctory question, \u201cSign off and on again?\u201d my Captain answered, \u201cNo!"}, {"size": 697, "text": "Signing off for good.\u201d And then his grin vanished in sudden solemnity. He did not look at me again till he handed me my papers with a sorrowful expression, as if they had been my passports for Hades. While I was putting them away he murmured some question to the Captain, and I heard the latter answer good-humouredly: \u201cNo. He leaves us to go home.\u201d \u201cOh!\u201d the other exclaimed, nodding mournfully over my sad condition. I didn\u2019t know him outside the official building, but he leaned forward the desk to shake hands with me, compassionately, as one would with some poor devil going out to be hanged; and I am afraid I performed my part ungraciously, in the hardened manner of an impenitent criminal."}, {"size": 852, "text": "No homeward-bound mail-boat was due for three or four days. Being now a man without a ship, and having for a time broken my connection with the sea--become, in fact, a mere potential passenger--it would have been more appropriate perhaps if I had gone to stay at an hotel. There it was, too, within a stone\u2019s throw of the Harbour Office, low, but somehow palatial, displaying its white, pillared pavilions surrounded by trim grass plots. I would have felt a passenger indeed in there! I gave it a hostile glance and directed my steps toward the Officers\u2019 Sailors\u2019 Home. I walked in the sunshine, disregarding it, and in the shade of the big trees on the esplanade without enjoying it. The heat of the tropical East descended through the leafy boughs, enveloping my thinly-clad body, clinging to my rebellious discontent, as if to rob it of its freedom."}, {"size": 619, "text": "The Officers\u2019 Home was a large bungalow with a wide verandah and a curiously suburban-looking little garden of bushes and a few trees between it and the street. That institution partook somewhat of the character of a residential club, but with a slightly Governmental flavour about it, because it was administered by the Harbour Office. Its manager was officially styled Chief Steward. He was an unhappy, wizened little man, who if put into a jockey\u2019s rig would have looked the part to perfection. But it was obvious that at some time or other in his life, in some capacity or other, he had been connected with the sea."}, {"size": 626, "text": "Possibly in the comprehensive capacity of a failure. I should have thought his employment a very easy one, but he used to affirm for some reason or other that his job would be the death of him some day. It was rather mysterious. Perhaps everything naturally was too much trouble for him. He certainly seemed to hate having people in the house. On entering it I thought he must be feeling pleased. It was as still as a tomb. I could see no one in the living rooms; and the verandah, too, was empty, except for a man at the far end dozing prone in a long chair. At the noise of my footsteps he opened one horribly fish-like eye."}, {"size": 806, "text": "He was a stranger to me. I retreated from there, and crossing the dining room--a very bare apartment with a motionless punkah hanging over the centre table--I knocked at a door labelled in black letters: \u201cChief Steward.\u201d The answer to my knock being a vexed and doleful plaint: \u201cOh, dear! Oh, dear! What is it now?\u201d I went in at once. It was a strange room to find in the tropics. Twilight and stuffiness reigned in there. The fellow had hung enormously ample, dusty, cheap lace curtains over his windows, which were shut. Piles of cardboard boxes, such as milliners and dressmakers use in Europe, cumbered the corners; and by some means he had procured for himself the sort of furniture that might have come out of a respectable parlour in the East End of London--a horsehair sofa, arm-chairs of the same."}, {"size": 674, "text": "I glimpsed grimy antimacassars scattered over that horrid upholstery, which was awe-inspiring, insomuch that one could not guess what mysterious accident, need, or fancy had collected it there. Its owner had taken off his tunic, and in white trousers and a thin, short-sleeved singlet prowled behind the chair-backs nursing his meagre elbows. An exclamation of dismay escaped him when he heard that I had come for a stay; but he could not deny that there were plenty of vacant rooms. \u201cVery well. Can you give me the one I had before?\u201d He emitted a faint moan from behind a pile of cardboard boxes on the table, which might have contained gloves or handkerchiefs or neckties."}, {"size": 600, "text": "I wonder what the fellow did keep in them? There was a smell of decaying coral, or Oriental dust of zoological speciments in that den of his. I could only see the top of his head and his unhappy eyes levelled at me over the barrier. \u201cIt\u2019s only for a couple of days,\u201d I said, intending to cheer him up. \u201cPerhaps you would like to pay in advance?\u201d he suggested eagerly. \u201cCertainly not!\u201d I burst out directly I could speak. \u201cNever heard of such a thing! This is the most infernal cheek. . . .\u201d He had seized his head in both hands--a gesture of despair which checked my indignation. \u201cOh, dear! Oh, dear!"}, {"size": 674, "text": "Don\u2019t fly out like this. I am asking everybody.\u201d \u201cI don\u2019t believe it,\u201d I said bluntly. \u201cWell, I am going to. And if you gentlemen all agreed to pay in advance I could make Hamilton pay up, too. He\u2019s always turning up ashore dead broke, and even when he has some money he won\u2019t settle his bills. I don\u2019t know what to do with him. He swears at me and tells me I can\u2019t chuck a white man out into the street here. So if you only would. . . .\u201d I was amazed. Incredulous, too. I suspected the fellow of gratuitous impertinence. I told him with marked emphasis that I would see him and Hamilton hanged first, and requested him to conduct me to my room with no more of his nonsense."}, {"size": 608, "text": "He produced then a key from somewhere and led the way out of his lair, giving me a vicious sidelong look in passing. \u201cAny one I know staying here?\u201d I asked him before he left my room. He had recovered his usual pained impatient tone, and said that Captain Giles was there, back from a Solo Sea trip. Two other guests were staying also. He paused. And, of course, Hamilton, he added. \u201cOh, yes! Hamilton,\u201d I said, and the miserable creature took himself off with a final groan. His impudence still rankled when I came into the dining room at tiffin time. He was there on duty overlooking the Chinamen servants."}, {"size": 695, "text": "The tiffin was laid on one end only of the long table, and the punkah was stirring the hot air lazily--mostly above a barren waste of polished wood. We were four around the cloth. The dozing stranger from the chair was one. Both his eyes were partly opened now, but they did not seem to see anything. He was supine. The dignified person next him, with short side whiskers and a carefully scraped chin, was, of course, Hamilton. I have never seen any one so full of dignity for the station in life Providence had been pleased to place him in. I had been told that he regarded me as a rank outsider. He raised not only his eyes, but his eyebrows as well, at the sound I made pulling back my chair."}, {"size": 673, "text": "Captain Giles was at the head of the table. I exchanged a few words of greeting with him and sat down on his left. Stout and pale, with a great shiny dome of a bald forehead and prominent brown eyes, he might have been anything but a seaman. You would not have been surprised to learn that he was an architect. To me (I know how absurd it is) to me he looked like a churchwarden. He had the appearance of a man from whom you would expect sound advice, moral sentiments, with perhaps a platitude or two thrown in on occasion, not from a desire to dazzle, but from honest conviction. Though very well known and appreciated in the shipping world, he had no regular employment."}, {"size": 698, "text": "He did not want it. He had his own peculiar position. He was an expert. An expert in--how shall I say it?--in intricate navigation. He was supposed to know more about remote and imperfectly charted parts of the Archipelago than any man living. His brain must have been a perfect warehouse of reefs, positions, bearings, images of headlands, shapes of obscure coasts, aspects of innumerable islands, desert and otherwise. Any ship, for instance, bound on a trip to Palawan or somewhere that way would have Captain Giles on board, either in temporary command or \u201cto assist the master.\u201d It was said that he had a retaining fee from a wealthy firm of Chinese steamship owners, in view of such services."}, {"size": 613, "text": "Besides, he was always ready to relieve any man who wished to take a spell ashore for a time. No owner was ever known to object to an arrangement of that sort. For it seemed to be the established opinion at the port that Captain Giles was as good as the best, if not a little better. But in Hamilton\u2019s view he was an \u201coutsider.\u201d I believe that for Hamilton the generalisation \u201coutsider\u201d covered the whole lot of us; though I suppose that he made some distinctions in his mind. I didn\u2019t try to make conversation with Captain Giles, whom I had not seen more than twice in my life. But, of course, he knew who I was."}, {"size": 671, "text": "After a while, inclining his big shiny head my way, he addressed me first in his friendly fashion. He presumed from seeing me there, he said, that I had come ashore for a couple of days\u2019 leave. He was a low-voiced man. I spoke a little louder, saying that: No--I had left the ship for good. \u201cA free man for a bit,\u201d was his comment. \u201cI suppose I may call myself that--since eleven o\u2019clock,\u201d I said. Hamilton had stopped eating at the sound of our voices. He laid down his knife and fork gently, got up, and muttering something about \u201cthis infernal heat cutting one\u2019s appetite,\u201d went out of the room. Almost immediately we heard him leave the house down the verandah steps."}, {"size": 663, "text": "On this Captain Giles remarked easily that the fellow had no doubt gone off to look after my old job. The Chief Steward, who had been leaning against the wall, brought his face of an unhappy goat nearer to the table and addressed us dolefully. His object was to unburden himself of his eternal grievance against Hamilton. The man kept him in hot water with the Harbour Office as to the state of his accounts. He wished to goodness he would get my job, though in truth what would it be? Temporary relief at best. I said: \u201cYou needn\u2019t worry. He won\u2019t get my job. My successor is on board already.\u201d He was surprised, and I believe his face fell a little at the news."}, {"size": 627, "text": "Captain Giles gave a soft laugh. We got up and went out on the verandah, leaving the supine stranger to be dealt with by the Chinamen. The last thing I saw they had put a plate with a slice of pine-apple on it before him and stood back to watch what would happen. But the experiment seemed a failure. He sat insensible. It was imparted to me in a low voice by Captain Giles that this was an officer of some Rajah\u2019s yacht which had come into our port to be dry-docked. Must have been \u201cseeing life\u201d last night, he added, wrinkling his nose in an intimate, confidential way which pleased me vastly. For Captain Giles had prestige."}, {"size": 631, "text": "He was credited with wonderful adventures and with some mysterious tragedy in his life. And no man had a word to say against him. He continued: \u201cI remember him first coming ashore here some years ago. Seems only the other day. He was a nice boy. Oh! these nice boys!\u201d I could not help laughing aloud. He looked startled, then joined in the laugh. \u201cNo! No! I didn\u2019t mean that,\u201d he cried. \u201cWhat I meant is that some of them do go soft mighty quick out here.\u201d Jocularly I suggested the beastly heat as the first cause. But Captain Giles disclosed himself possessed of a deeper philosophy. Things out East were made easy for white men."}, {"size": 604, "text": "That was all right. The difficulty was to go on keeping white, and some of these nice boys did not know how. He gave me a searching look, and in a benevolent, heavy-uncle manner asked point blank: \u201cWhy did you throw up your berth?\u201d I became angry all of a sudden; for you can understand how exasperating such a question was to a man who didn\u2019t know. I said to myself that I ought to shut up that moralist; and to him aloud I said with challenging politeness: \u201cWhy . . . ? Do you disapprove?\u201d He was too disconcerted to do more than mutter confusedly: \u201cI! . . . In a general way. . .\u201d and then gave me up."}, {"size": 687, "text": "But he retired in good order, under the cover of a heavily humorous remark that he, too, was getting soft, and that this was his time for taking his little siesta--when he was on shore. \u201cVery bad habit. Very bad habit.\u201d There was a simplicity in the man which would have disarmed a touchiness even more youthful than mine. So when next day at tiffin he bent his head toward me and said that he had met my late Captain last evening, adding in an undertone: \u201cHe\u2019s very sorry you left. He had never had a mate that suited him so well,\u201d I answered him earnestly, without any affectation, that I certainly hadn\u2019t been so comfortable in any ship or with any commander in all my sea-going days."}, {"size": 686, "text": "\u201cWell--then,\u201d he murmured. \u201cHaven\u2019t you heard, Captain Giles, that I intend to go home?\u201d \u201cYes,\u201d he said benevolently. \u201cI have heard that sort of thing so often before.\u201d \u201cWhat of that?\u201d I cried. I thought he was the most dull, unimaginative man I had ever met. I don\u2019t know what more I would have said, but the much-belated Hamilton came in just then and took his usual seat. So I dropped into a mumble. \u201cAnyhow, you shall see it done this time.\u201d Hamilton, beautifully shaved, gave Captain Giles a curt nod, but didn\u2019t even condescend to raise his eyebrows at me; and when he spoke it was only to tell the Chief Steward that the food on his plate wasn\u2019t fit to be set before a gentleman."}, {"size": 635, "text": "The individual addressed seemed much too unhappy to groan. He cast his eyes up to the punkah and that was all. Captain Giles and I got up from the table, and the stranger next to Hamilton followed our example, manoeuvring himself to his feet with difficulty. He, poor fellow, not because he was hungry but I verily believe only to recover his self-respect, had tried to put some of that unworthy food into his mouth. But after dropping his fork twice and generally making a failure of it, he had sat still with an air of intense mortification combined with a ghastly glazed stare. Both Giles and I had avoided looking his way at table."}, {"size": 870, "text": "On the verandah he stopped short on purpose to address to us anxiously a long remark which I failed to understand completely. It sounded like some horrible unknown language. But when Captain Giles, after only an instant for reflection, assured him with homely friendliness, \u201cAye, to be sure. You are right there,\u201d he appeared very much gratified indeed, and went away (pretty straight, too) to seek a distant long chair. \u201cWhat was he trying to say?\u201d I asked with disgust. \u201cI don\u2019t know. Mustn\u2019t be down too much on a fellow. He\u2019s feeling pretty wretched, you may be sure; and to-morrow he\u2019ll feel worse yet.\u201d Judging by the man\u2019s appearance it seemed impossible. I wondered what sort of complicated debauch had reduced him to that unspeakable condition. Captain Giles\u2019 benevolence was spoiled by a curious air of complacency which I disliked. I said with a little laugh:"}, {"size": 665, "text": "\u201cWell, he will have you to look after him.\u201d He made a deprecatory gesture, sat down, and took up a paper. I did the same. The papers were old and uninteresting, filled up mostly with dreary stereotyped descriptions of Queen Victoria\u2019s first jubilee celebrations. Probably we should have quickly fallen into a tropical afternoon doze if it had not been for Hamilton\u2019s voice raised in the dining room. He was finishing his tiffin there. The big double doors stood wide open permanently, and he could not have had any idea how near to the doorway our chairs were placed. He was heard in a loud, supercilious tone answering some statement ventured by the Chief Steward."}, {"size": 667, "text": "\u201cI am not going to be rushed into anything. They will be glad enough to get a gentleman I imagine. There is no hurry.\u201d A loud whispering from the Steward succeeded and then again Hamilton was heard with even intenser scorn. \u201cWhat? That young ass who fancies himself for having been chief mate with Kent so long? . . . Preposterous.\u201d Giles and I looked at each other. Kent being the name of my late commander, Captain Giles\u2019 whisper, \u201cHe\u2019s talking of you,\u201d seemed to me sheer waste of breath. The Chief Steward must have stuck to his point, whatever it was, because Hamilton was heard again more supercilious if possible, and also very emphatic: \u201cRubbish, my good man!"}, {"size": 669, "text": "One doesn\u2019t _compete_ with a rank outsider like that. There\u2019s plenty of time.\u201d Then there were pushing of chairs, footsteps in the next room, and plaintive expostulations from the Steward, who was pursuing Hamilton, even out of doors through the main entrance. \u201cThat\u2019s a very insulting sort of man,\u201d remarked Captain Giles--superfluously, I thought. \u201cVery insulting. You haven\u2019t offended him in some way, have you?\u201d \u201cNever spoke to him in my life,\u201d I said grumpily. \u201cCan\u2019t imagine what he means by competing. He has been trying for my job after I left--and didn\u2019t get it. But that isn\u2019t exactly competition.\u201d Captain Giles balanced his big benevolent head thoughtfully."}, {"size": 664, "text": "\u201cHe didn\u2019t get it,\u201d he repeated very slowly. \u201cNo, not likely either, with Kent. Kent is no end sorry you left him. He gives you the name of a good seaman, too.\u201d I flung away the paper I was still holding. I sat up, I slapped the table with my open palm. I wanted to know why he would keep harping on that, my absolutely private affair. It was exasperating, really. Captain Giles silenced me by the perfect equanimity of his gaze. \u201cNothing to be annoyed about,\u201d he murmured reasonably, with an evident desire to soothe the childish irritation he had aroused. And he was really a man of an appearance so inoffensive that I tried to explain myself as much as I could."}, {"size": 746, "text": "I told him that I did not want to hear any more about what was past and gone. It had been very nice while it lasted, but now it was done with I preferred not to talk about it or even think about it. I had made up my mind to go home. He listened to the whole tirade in a particular lending-the-ear attitude, as if trying to detect a false note in it somewhere; then straightened himself up and appeared to ponder sagaciously over the matter. \u201cYes. You told me you meant to go home. Anything in view there?\u201d Instead of telling him that it was none of his business I said sullenly: \u201cNothing that I know of.\u201d I had indeed considered that rather blank side of the situation I had created for myself by leaving suddenly my very satisfactory employment."}, {"size": 640, "text": "And I was not very pleased with it. I had it on the tip of my tongue to say that common sense had nothing to do with my action, and that therefore it didn\u2019t deserve the interest Captain Giles seemed to be taking in it. But he was puffing at a short wooden pipe now, and looked so guileless, dense, and commonplace, that it seemed hardly worth while to puzzle him either with truth or sarcasm. He blew a cloud of smoke, then surprised me by a very abrupt: \u201cPaid your passage money yet?\u201d Overcome by the shameless pertinacity of a man to whom it was rather difficult to be rude, I replied with exaggerated meekness that I had not done so yet."}, {"size": 672, "text": "I thought there would be plenty of time to do that to-morrow. And I was about to turn away, withdrawing my privacy from his fatuous, objectless attempts to test what sort of stuff it was made of, when he laid down his pipe in an extremely significant manner, you know, as if a critical moment had come, and leaned sideways over the table between us. \u201cOh! You haven\u2019t yet!\u201d He dropped his voice mysteriously. \u201cWell, then I think you ought to know that there\u2019s something going on here.\u201d I had never in my life felt more detached from all earthly goings on.

I gazed at Captain Giles\u2019 animation with scorn rather than with curiosity. To his obviously preparatory question whether our Steward had spoken to me that day I said he hadn\u2019t. And what\u2019s more he would have had precious little encouragement if he had tried to. I didn\u2019t want the fellow to speak to me at all. Unrebuked by my petulance, Captain Giles, with an air of immense sagacity, began to tell me a minute tale about a Harbour Office peon. It was absolutely pointless. A peon was seen walking that morning on the verandah with a letter in his hand. It was in an official envelope."}, {"size": 663, "text": "As the habit of these fellows is, he had shown it to the first white man he came across. That man was our friend in the arm-chair.

The peon then wandered on along the verandah and came upon Captain Giles, who was there by an extraordinary chance. . . . At this point he stopped with a profound look. The letter, he continued, was addressed to the Chief Steward. Now what could Captain Ellis, the Master Attendant, want to write to the Steward for? The fellow went every morning, anyhow, to the Harbour Office with his report, for orders or what not."}, {"size": 689, "text": "He hadn\u2019t been back more than an hour before there was an office peon chasing him with a note. Now what was that for? And he began to speculate. It was not for this--and it could not be for that. As to that other thing it was unthinkable. The fatuousness of all this made me stare. If the man had not been somehow a sympathetic personality I would have resented it like an insult. As it was, I felt only sorry for him. Something remarkably earnest in his gaze prevented me from laughing in his face. Neither did I yawn at him. I just stared. His tone became a shade more mysterious. Directly the fellow (meaning the Steward) got that note he rushed for his hat and bolted out of the house."}, {"size": 722, "text": "But it wasn\u2019t because the note called him to the Harbour Office. He didn\u2019t go there. He was not absent long enough for that. He came darting back in no time, flung his hat away, and raced about the dining room moaning and slapping his forehead. All these exciting facts and manifestations had been observed by Captain Giles. He had, it seems, been meditating upon them ever since. I began to pity him profoundly. And in a tone which I tried to make as little sarcastic as possible I said that I was glad he had found something to occupy his morning hours. With his disarming simplicity he made me observe, as if it were a matter of some consequence, how strange it was that he should have spent the morning indoors at all."}, {"size": 704, "text": "He generally was out before tiffin, visiting various offices, seeing his friends in the harbour, and so on.

But do you remember every word?\u201d he insisted tactfully. \u201cI don\u2019t know. It\u2019s none of my business,\u201d I snapped out, consigning, moreover, the Steward and Hamilton aloud to eternal perdition.

This bit of self-praise, of course, fitted excellently the laborious inanity of the whole conversation.

Giles\u2019 voice was going on complacently; the very voice of the universal hollow conceit. And I was no longer angry with it.

But the sense of the absurdity was beginning at last to exercise its well-known fascination. I felt I must not let the man talk to me any more.

In a few strides I found myself in the dining room, now cleared and empty. But during that short time various thoughts occurred to me, such as: that Giles had been making fun of me, expecting some amusement at my expense; that I probably looked silly and gullible; that I knew very little of life. . . .

Wait a minute.\u201d Perhaps it was the sidelong glance he gave me; or possibly I was yet under the influence of Captain Giles\u2019 mysterious earnestness. Well, it was an impulse of some sort; an effect of that force somewhere within our lives which shapes them this way or that.

He took refuge in a silly, muttering sulkiness. It was nothing to me, he mumbled. I had told him I was going home. And since I was going home he didn\u2019t see why he should. . . . That was the line of his argument, and it was irrelevant enough to be almost insulting. Insulting to one\u2019s intelligence, I mean.

I don\u2019t mean to say that he made a great outcry. It was a cynical shrieking confession, only faint--piteously faint. It wasn\u2019t very coherent either, but sufficiently so to strike me dumb at first.

All I could remember was being mystified and bored by his conversation for a solid hour after tiffin. And he called that taking a lot of trouble. He was looking at me with a self-complacency which would have been odious in any other man.

But the head Shipping-Master hopped down from his elevation and hurried along on the thick mats to meet me in the broad central passage.

A distressed cur. He looked as though his throat were too dry for him to bark. I regret to say I stopped before going in. There had been a revolution in my moral nature. He waited open-mouthed, breathless, while I looked at him for half a minute. \u201cAnd you thought you could keep me out of it,\u201d I said scathingly. \u201cYou said you were going home,\u201d he squeaked miserably."}, {"size": 624, "text": "\u201cYou said so.

It was the first instance of harm being attempted to be done to me--at any rate, the first I had ever found out.

He stood before me in the doorway in all the commonplace solidity of his wisdom. The gold chain glittered on his breast. He clutched a smouldering pipe.

He murmured complacently that there were but few things done in the town that he could not see the inside of. And as to this house, he had been using it off and on for nearly ten years. Nothing that went on in it could escape his great experience. It had been no trouble to him. No trouble at all.

There was something reluctant and at the same time attentive in his bearing. His name was Burns. We left the cabin and went round the ship together. His face in the full light of day appeared very pale, meagre, even haggard. Somehow I had a delicacy as to looking too often at him; his eyes, on the contrary, remained fairly glued on my face. They were greenish and had an expectant expression."}, {"size": 750, "text": "He answered all my questions readily enough, but my ear seemed to catch a tone of unwillingness. The second officer, with three or four hands, was busy forward. The mate mentioned his name and I nodded to him in passing. He was very young. He struck me as rather a cub. When we returned below, I sat down on one end of a deep, semi-circular, or, rather, semi-oval settee, upholstered in red plush. It extended right across the whole after-end of the cabin. Mr. Burns motioned to sit down, dropped into one of the swivel-chairs round the table, and kept his eyes on me as persistently as ever, and with that strange air as if all this were make-believe and he expected me to get up, burst into a laugh, slap him on the back, and vanish from the cabin."}, {"size": 654, "text": "There was an odd stress in the situation which began to make me uncomfortable. I tried to react against this vague feeling. \u201cIt\u2019s only my inexperience,\u201d I thought. In the face of that man, several years, I judged, older than myself, I became aware of what I had left already behind me--my youth. And that was indeed poor comfort. Youth is a fine thing, a mighty power--as long as one does not think of it. I felt I was becoming self-conscious. Almost against my will I assumed a moody gravity. I said: \u201cI see you have kept her in very good order, Mr. Burns.\u201d Directly I had uttered these words I asked myself angrily why the deuce did I want to say that?"}, {"size": 669, "text": "Mr. Burns in answer had only blinked at me. What on earth did he mean? I fell back on a question which had been in my thoughts for a long time--the most natural question on the lips of any seaman whatever joining a ship. I voiced it (confound this self-consciousness) in a degaged cheerful tone: \u201cI suppose she can travel--what?\u201d Now a question like this might have been answered normally, either in accents of apologetic sorrow or with a visibly suppressed pride, in a \u201cI don\u2019t want to boast, but you shall see,\u201d sort of tone. There are sailors, too, who would have been roughly outspoken: \u201cLazy brute,\u201d or openly delighted: \u201cShe\u2019s a flyer.\u201d Two ways, if four manners."}, {"size": 718, "text": "But Mr. Burns found another way, a way of his own which had, at all events, the merit of saving his breath, if no other.

Can\u2019t you tell after being nearly two years in the ship?\u201d I addressed him sharply. He looked as startled for a moment as though he had discovered my presence only that very moment. But this passed off almost at once. He put on an air of indifference. But I suppose he thought it better to say something. He said that a ship needed, just like a man, the chance to show the best she could do, and that this ship had never had a chance since he had been on board of her."}, {"size": 473, "text": "Not that he could remember. The last captain. . . . He paused. \u201cHas he been so very unlucky?\u201d I asked with frank incredulity. Mr. Burns turned his eyes away from me. No, the late captain was not an unlucky man. One couldn\u2019t say that. But he had not seemed to want to make use of his luck. Mr. Burns--man of enigmatic moods--made this statement with an inanimate face and staring wilfully at the rudder casing. The statement itself was obscurely suggestive. I asked quietly:"}, {"size": 630, "text": "\u201cIn this saloon. Just where you are sitting now,\u201d answered Mr. Burns. I repressed a silly impulse to jump up; but upon the whole I was relieved to hear that he had not died in the bed which was now to be mine. I pointed out to the chief mate that what I really wanted to know was where he had buried his late captain. Mr. Burns said that it was at the entrance to the gulf. A roomy grave; a sufficient answer. But the mate, overcoming visibly something within him--something like a curious reluctance to believe in my advent (as an irrevocable fact, at any rate), did not stop at that--though, indeed, he may have wished to do so."}, {"size": 761, "text": "As a compromise with his feelings, I believe, he addressed himself persistently to the rudder-casing, so that to me he had the appearance of a man talking in solitude, a little unconsciously, however. His tale was that at seven bells in the forenoon watch he had all hands mustered on the quarterdeck and told them they had better go down to say good-bye to the captain. Those words, as if grudged to an intruding personage, were enough for me to evoke vividly that strange ceremony: The bare-footed, bare-headed seamen crowding shyly into that cabin, a small mob pressed against that sideboard, uncomfortable rather than moved, shirts open on sunburnt chests, weather-beaten faces, and all staring at the dying man with the same grave and expectant expression."}, {"size": 601, "text": "\u201cWas he conscious?\u201d I asked. \u201cHe didn\u2019t speak, but he moved his eyes to look at them,\u201d said the mate.

Mr. Burns dealt with him at some length. He was a peculiar man--of sixty-five about--iron gray, hard-faced, obstinate, and uncommunicative. He used to keep the ship loafing at sea for inscrutable reasons. Would come on deck at night sometimes, take some sail off her, God only knows why or wherefore, then go below, shut himself up in his cabin, and play on the violin for hours--till daybreak perhaps."}, {"size": 637, "text": "In fact, he spent most of his time day or night playing the violin.

Neither he nor the second mate could get a wink of sleep in their watches below for the noise. . . . And how could they be expected to keep awake while on duty? He pleaded. The answer of that stern man was that if he and the second mate didn\u2019t like the noise, they were welcome to pack up their traps and walk over the side. When this alternative was offered the ship happened to be 600 miles from the nearest land."}, {"size": 719, "text": "Mr. Burns at this point looked at me with an air of curiosity. I began to think that my predecessor was a remarkably peculiar old man. But I had to hear stranger things yet. It came out that this stern, grim, wind-tanned, rough, sea-salted, taciturn sailor of sixty-five was not only an artist, but a lover as well. In Haiphong, when they got there after a course of most unprofitable peregrinations (during which the ship was nearly lost twice), he got himself, in Mr. Burns\u2019 own words, \u201cmixed up\u201d with some woman. Mr. Burns had had no personal knowledge of that affair, but positive evidence of it existed in the shape of a photograph taken in Haiphong. Mr. Burns found it in one of the drawers in the captain\u2019s room."}, {"size": 788, "text": "In due course I, too, saw that amazing human document (I even threw it overboard later). There he sat, with his hands reposing on his knees, bald, squat, gray, bristly, recalling a wild boar somehow; and by his side towered an awful mature, white female with rapacious nostrils and a cheaply ill-omened stare in her enormous eyes. She was disguised in some semi-oriental, vulgar, fancy costume. She resembled a low-class medium or one of those women who tell fortunes by cards for half a crown. And yet she was striking. A professional sorceress from the slums. It was incomprehensible. There was something awful in the thought that she was the last reflection of the world of passion for the fierce soul which seemed to look at one out of the sardonically savage face of that old seaman."}, {"size": 633, "text": "However, I noticed that she was holding some musical instrument--guitar or mandoline--in her hand. Perhaps that was the secret of her sortilege. For Mr. Burns that photograph explained why the unloaded ship had kept sweltering at anchor for three weeks in a pestilential hot harbour without air. They lay there and gasped. The captain, appearing now and then on short visits, mumbled to Mr. Burns unlikely tales about some letters he was waiting for. Suddenly, after vanishing for a week, he came on board in the middle of the night and took the ship out to sea with the first break of dawn. Daylight showed him looking wild and ill."}, {"size": 792, "text": "The mere getting clear of the land took two days, and somehow or other they bumped slightly on a reef. However, no leak developed, and the captain, growling \u201cno matter,\u201d informed Mr. Burns that he had made up his mind to take the ship to Hong-Kong and drydock her there. At this Mr. Burns was plunged into despair. For indeed, to beat up to Hong-Kong against a fierce monsoon, with a ship not sufficiently ballasted and with her supply of water not completed, was an insane project. But the captain growled peremptorily, \u201cStick her at it,\u201d and Mr. Burns, dismayed and enraged, stuck her at it, and kept her at it, blowing away sails, straining the spars, exhausting the crew--nearly maddened by the absolute conviction that the attempt was impossible and was bound to end in some catastrophe."}, {"size": 763, "text": "Meantime the captain, shut up in his cabin and wedged in a corner of his settee against the crazy bounding of the ship, played the violin--or, at any rate, made continuous noise on it. When he appeared on deck he would not speak and not always answer when spoken to. It was obvious that he was ill in some mysterious manner, and beginning to break up. As the days went by the sounds of the violin became less and less loud, till at last only a feeble scratching would meet Mr. Burns\u2019 ear as he stood in the saloon listening outside the door of the captain\u2019s state-room.

But I can\u2019t wait till you are dead before I put the helm up. You must do it yourself. You must do it now!\u201d The man on the couch snarled in contempt. \u201cSo I am going out of the world--am I?\u201d \u201cYes, sir--you haven\u2019t many days left in it,\u201d said Mr. Burns calming down."}, {"size": 648, "text": "\u201cOne can see it by your face.\u201d \u201cMy face, eh? . . .

No connected sentence passed his lips afterward. That night he used the last of his strength to throw his fiddle over the side.

He never meant her to see home again. He wouldn\u2019t write to his owners, he never wrote to his old wife, either--he wasn\u2019t going to. He had made up his mind to cut adrift from everything. That\u2019s what it was. He didn\u2019t care for business, or freights, or for making a passage--or anything.

I might have smiled if I had not been busy with my own sensations, which were not those of Mr. Burns. I was already the man in command.

Yet the end of his life was a complete act of treason, the betrayal of a tradition which seemed to me as imperative as any guide on earth could be.

He shook his head. He had written to nobody. In a moment he became sombre. He never thought of writing. It took him all his time to watch incessantly the loading of the ship by a rascally Chinese stevedore. In this Mr. Burns gave me the first glimpse of the real chief mate\u2019s soul which dwelt uneasily in his body. He mused, then hastened on with gloomy force. \u201cYes! The captain died as near noon as possible. I looked through his papers in the afternoon. I read the service over him at sunset and then I stuck the ship\u2019s head north and brought her in here. I--brought--her--in.\u201d He struck the table with his fist. \u201cShe would hardly have come in by herself,\u201d I observed. \u201cBut why didn\u2019t you make for Singapore instead?\u201d His eyes wavered. \u201cThe nearest port,\u201d he muttered sullenly."}, {"size": 620, "text": "I had framed the question in perfect innocence, but his answer (the difference in distance was insignificant) and his manner offered me a clue to the simple truth.

Whereas Singapore, he surmised justly, would be full of qualified men. But his naive reasoning forgot to take into account the telegraph cable reposing on the bottom of the very Gulf up which he had turned that ship which he imagined himself to have saved from destruction. Hence the bitter flavour of our interview."}, {"size": 682, "text": "I tasted it more and more distinctly--and it was less and less to my taste. \u201cLook here, Mr. Burns,\u201d I began very firmly. \u201cYou may as well understand that I did not run after this command. It was pushed in my way. I\u2019ve accepted it. I am here to take the ship home first of all, and you may be sure that I shall see to it that every one of you on board here does his duty to that end. This is all I have to say--for the present.\u201d He was on his feet by this time, but instead of taking his dismissal he remained with trembling, indignant lips, and looking at me hard as though, really, after this, there was nothing for me to do in common decency but to vanish from his outraged sight."}, {"size": 769, "text": "Like all very simple emotional states this was moving.

You have signed the ship\u2019s articles as chief officer, and till they are terminated at the final port of discharge I shall expect you to attend to your duty and give me the benefit of your experience to the best of your ability.\u201d Stony incredulity lingered in his eyes: but it broke down before my friendly attitude."}, {"size": 669, "text": "With a slight upward toss of his arms (I got to know that gesture well afterward) he bolted out of the cabin.

Before many days had elapsed it was Mr. Burns who was pleading with me anxiously not to leave him behind; while I could only return him but doubtful answers. The whole thing took on a somewhat tragic complexion.

Mr. Burns, to whom I imparted my fears, chose to take great umbrage at them. He looked at me with that usual incredulous stare, and said bitterly: \u201cI suppose, sir, you want to make out I\u2019ve acted like a fool?\u201d I told him, with my systematic kindliness which always seemed to augment his surprise, that I did not want to make out anything."}, {"size": 646, "text": "I would leave that to the future.

The word \u201cDelay\u201d entered the secret chamber of my brain, resounded there like a tolling bell which maddens the ear, affected all my senses, took on a black colouring, a bitter taste, a deadly meaning. \u201cI am really sorry to see you worried like this.

In the saloon the doctor\u2019s voice greeted me, and his large form followed his voice, issuing out of the starboard spare cabin where the ship\u2019s medicine chest was kept securely lashed in the bed-place. Finding that I was not on board he had gone in there, he said, to inspect the supply of drugs, bandages, and so on. Everything was completed and in order. I thanked him; I had just been thinking of asking him to do that very thing, as in a couple of days, as he knew, we were going to sea, where all our troubles of every sort would be over at last."}, {"size": 631, "text": "He listened gravely and made no answer. But when I opened to him my mind as to Mr. Burns he sat down by my side, and, laying his hand on my knee amicably, begged me to think what it was I was exposing myself to. The man was just strong enough to bear being moved and no more. But he couldn\u2019t stand a return of the fever. I had before me a passage of sixty days perhaps, beginning with intricate navigation and ending probably with a lot of bad weather. Could I run the risk of having to go through it single-handed, with no chief officer and with a second quite a youth? . . . He might have added that it was my first command, too."}, {"size": 631, "text": "He did probably think of that fact, for he checked himself. It was very present to my mind. He advised me earnestly to cable to Singapore for a chief officer, even if I had to delay my sailing for a week. \u201cNever,\u201d I said. The very thought gave me the shivers. The hands seemed fairly fit, all of them, and this was the time to get them away. Once at sea I was not afraid of facing anything. The sea was now the only remedy for all my troubles. The doctor\u2019s glasses were directed at me like two lamps searching the genuineness of my resolution. He opened his lips as if to argue further, but shut them again without saying anything."}, {"size": 603, "text": "I had a vision so vivid of poor Burns in his exhaustion, helplessness, and anguish, that it moved me more than the reality I had come away from only an hour before.

The programme had been altered in so far that this transportation had been left to the last moment, on the very morning of our departure. It was barely an hour after sunrise.

But when the ship\u2019s head swung down the river away from that town, Oriental and squalid, I missed the expected elation of that striven-for moment. What there was, undoubtedly, was a relaxation of tension which translated itself into a sense of weariness after an inglorious fight."}, {"size": 623, "text": "About midday we anchored a mile outside the bar.

I judged that the second officer--a callow youth with an unpromising face--was not, to put it mildly, of that invaluable stuff from which a commander\u2019s right hand is made.

He alone of all the crew had not had a day\u2019s illness in port.

After sunset I came out on deck again to meet only a still void. The thin, featureless crust of the coast could not be distinguished. The darkness had risen around the ship like a mysterious emanation from the dumb and lonely waters. I leaned on the rail and turned my ear to the shadows of the night. Not a sound. My command might have been a planet flying vertiginously on its appointed path in a space of infinite silence. I clung to the rail as if my sense of balance were leaving me for good. How absurd.

The man was so wasted that, in this white cabin, under a white sheet, and with his diminished head sunk in the white pillow, his red moustaches captured their eyes exclusively, like something artificial--a pair of moustaches from a shop exhibited there in the harsh light of the bulkhead-lamp without a shade.

As to the matter, I seemed to make out that it was the fault of the \u201cold man\u201d--the late captain--ambushed down there under the sea with some evil intention. It was a weird story. I listened to the end; then stepping into the cabin I laid my hand on the mate\u2019s forehead. It was cool. He was light-headed only from extreme weakness. Suddenly he seemed to become aware of me, and in his own voice--of course, very feeble--he asked regretfully: \u201cIs there no chance at all to get under way, sir?\u201d \u201cWhat\u2019s the good of letting go our hold of the ground only to drift, Mr."}, {"size": 635, "text": "Burns?\u201d I answered.

I went into my cabin to seek relief in a few hours\u2019 sleep, but almost before I closed my eyes the man on deck came down reporting a light breeze. Enough to get under way with, he said. And it was no more than just enough. I ordered the windlass manned, the sails loosed, and the topsails set. But by the time I had cast the ship I could hardly feel any breath of wind.

He turned his head, and something in his eyes checked my modest elation. Instinctively I asked: \u201cWhat is it now?\u201d not expecting in the least the answer I got.

If only that breath had been a little stronger. However, there was the quinine against the fever. I went into the spare cabin where the medicine chest was kept to prepare two doses.

The other four remained still wrapped up in paper and sealed. But I did not expect to see an envelope lying on top of them. A square envelope, belonging, in fact, to the ship\u2019s stationery.

The writer was the doctor. The date was that of the day on which, returning from my visit to Mr. Burns in the hospital, I had found the excellent doctor waiting for me in the cabin; and when he told me that he had been putting in time inspecting the medicine chest for me. How bizarre! While expecting me to come in at any moment he had been amusing himself by writing me a letter, and then as I came in had hastened to stuff it into the medicine-chest drawer.

Ransome carried off two big doses to the men forward. As to myself, I did not go on deck as yet. I went instead to the door of Mr. Burns\u2019 room, and gave him that news, too. It was impossible to say the effect it had on him. At first I thought that he was speechless. His head lay sunk in the pillow. He moved his lips enough, however, to assure me that he was getting much stronger; a statement shockingly untrue on the face of it. That afternoon I took my watch as a matter of course.

Yet it would have been hard to say that the others were not. The last few days had been for us like the ordeal of the fiery furnace.

No, it was no use remonstrating with them. But I fully believed that quinine was of very great use indeed. I believed in it. I pinned my faith to it. It would save the men, the ship, break the spell by its medicinal virtue, make time of no account, the weather but a passing worry and, like a magic powder working against mysterious malefices, secure the first passage of my first command against the evil powers of calms and pestilence.

But why record all the swift steps of the appalling discovery? You have guessed the truth already. There was the wrapper, the bottle, and the white powder inside, some sort of powder!

One after another they fell, breaking at my feet, not because I threw them down in my dismay, but slipping through my fingers as if this disclosure were too much for my strength.

It is quite possible that I appeared to be in a hurry because I was instinctively hastening up on deck. An example this of training become instinct. The difficulties, the dangers, the problems of a ship at sea must be met on deck.

He flourished, in his trembling hand, on the end of a forearm no thicker than a walking-stick, a shining pair of scissors which he tried before my very eyes to jab at his throat.

He turned to me his face grotesque beyond the fantasies of mad dreams, one cheek all bushy as if with a swollen flame, the other denuded and sunken, with the untouched long moustache on that side asserting itself, lonely and fierce.

The sails hung motionless and slack, the very folds of their sagging surfaces moved no more than carved granite. The impetuosity of my advent made the man at the helm start slightly. A block aloft squeaked incomprehensibly, for what on earth could have made it do so? It was a whistling note like a bird\u2019s.

He was alone, I was alone, every man was alone where he stood. And every form was gone too, spar, sail, fittings, rails; everything was blotted out in the dreadful smoothness of that absolute night.

When we had done all we could do to make things safe, he disappeared into his galley. Some time afterward, going forward for a look round, I caught sight of him through the open door.

And then I remained all alone aft, steering my ship, which ran before the wind with a buoyant lift now and then, and even rolling a little. Presently Ransome appeared before me with a tray.

He sat on the skylight looking desperately ill at first, but that strong breeze, before which the last remnant of my crew had wilted down, seemed to blow a fresh stock of vigour into his frame with every gust."}, {"size": 601, "text": "One could almost see the process. By way of sanity test I alluded on purpose to the late captain. I was delighted to find that Mr. Burns did not display undue interest in the subject.

We can neither furl it nor set it. I only wish the old thing would thrash itself to pieces and be done with it. That beastly racket confuses me.\u201d Mr. Burns wrung his hands, and cried out suddenly: \u201cHow will you get the ship into harbour, sir, without men to handle her?\u201d And I couldn\u2019t tell him."}, {"size": 683, "text": "Well--it did get done about forty hours afterward.

Mr. Burns, after having obtained from me a solemn promise to give him a kick if anything happened, went frankly to sleep on the deck close to the binnacle. Convalescents need sleep.

And I steered, too tired for anxiety, too tired for connected thought. I had moments of grim exultation and then my heart would sink awfully at the thought of that forecastle at the other end of the dark deck, full of fever-stricken men--some of them dying. By my fault.

We dashed next up on to the forecastle head. The perspiration of labour and sheer nervousness simply poured off our heads as we toiled to get the anchors cock-billed. I dared not look at Ransome as we worked side by side.

She took the best part of them both before she brought up. The loose sails coming aback ceased their maddening racket above my head. A perfect stillness reigned in the ship.

He was carried past me insensible, his comic face horribly flushed and as if swollen, breathing stertorously. He looked more like Mr. Punch than ever; a disgracefully intoxicated Mr. Punch.
