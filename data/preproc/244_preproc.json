WATSON, M.D., _late of the Army Medical Department._) [2] CHAPTER I. MR. SHERLOCK HOLMES.IN the year 1878 I took my degree of Doctor of Medicine of the University of London, and proceeded to Netley to go through the course prescribed for surgeons in the army. Having completed my studies there, I was duly attached to the Fifth Northumberland Fusiliers as Assistant Surgeon. The regiment was stationed in India at the time, and before I could join it, the second Afghan war had broken out. On landing at Bombay, I learned that my corps had advanced through the passes, and was already deep in the enemy\u2019s country."}, {"size": 760, "text": "I followed, however, with many other officers who were in the same situation as myself, and succeeded in reaching Candahar in safety, where I found my regiment, and at once entered upon my new duties. The campaign brought honours and promotion to many, but for me it had nothing but misfortune and disaster. I was removed from my brigade and attached to the Berkshires, with whom I served at the fatal battle of Maiwand. There I was struck on the shoulder by a Jezail bullet, which shattered the bone and grazed the subclavian artery. I should have fallen into the hands of the murderous Ghazis had it not been for the devotion and courage shown by Murray, my orderly, who threw me across a pack-horse, and succeeded in bringing me safely to the British lines."}, {"size": 842, "text": "Worn with pain, and weak from the prolonged hardships which I had undergone, I was removed, with a great train of wounded sufferers, to the base hospital at Peshawar. Here I rallied, and had already improved so far as to be able to walk about the wards, and even to bask a little upon the verandah, when I was struck down by enteric fever, that curse of our Indian possessions. For months my life was despaired of, and when at last I came to myself and became convalescent, I was so weak and emaciated that a medical board determined that not a day should be lost in sending me back to England. I was dispatched, accordingly, in the troopship \u201cOrontes,\u201d and landed a month later on Portsmouth jetty, with my health irretrievably ruined, but with permission from a paternal government to spend the next nine months in attempting to improve it."}, {"size": 716, "text": "I had neither kith nor kin in England, and was therefore as free as air--or as free as an income of eleven shillings and sixpence a day will permit a man to be. Under such circumstances, I naturally gravitated to London, that great cesspool into which all the loungers and idlers of the Empire are irresistibly drained. There I stayed for some time at a private hotel in the Strand, leading a comfortless, meaningless existence, and spending such money as I had, considerably more freely than I ought. So alarming did the state of my finances become, that I soon realized that I must either leave the metropolis and rusticate somewhere in the country, or that I must make a complete alteration in my style of living."}, {"size": 647, "text": "Choosing the latter alternative, I began by making up my mind to leave the hotel, and to take up my quarters in some less pretentious and less expensive domicile. On the very day that I had come to this conclusion, I was standing at the Criterion Bar, when some one tapped me on the shoulder, and turning round I recognized young Stamford, who had been a dresser under me at Barts. The sight of a friendly face in the great wilderness of London is a pleasant thing indeed to a lonely man. In old days Stamford had never been a particular crony of mine, but now I hailed him with enthusiasm, and he, in his turn, appeared to be delighted to see me."}, {"size": 824, "text": "In the exuberance of my joy, I asked him to lunch with me at the Holborn, and we started off together in a hansom. \u201cWhatever have you been doing with yourself, Watson?\u201d he asked in undisguised wonder, as we rattled through the crowded London streets. \u201cYou are as thin as a lath and as brown as a nut.\u201d I gave him a short sketch of my adventures, and had hardly concluded it by the time that we reached our destination. \u201cPoor devil!\u201d he said, commiseratingly, after he had listened to my misfortunes. \u201cWhat are you up to now?\u201d \u201cLooking for lodgings.\u201d [3] I answered. \u201cTrying to solve the problem as to whether it is possible to get comfortable rooms at a reasonable price.\u201d \u201cThat\u2019s a strange thing,\u201d remarked my companion; \u201cyou are the second man to-day that has used that expression to me.\u201d \u201cAnd who was the first?\u201d I asked."}, {"size": 663, "text": "\u201cA fellow who is working at the chemical laboratory up at the hospital.

I believe he is well up in anatomy, and he is a first-class chemist; but, as far as I know, he has never taken out any systematic medical classes. His studies are very desultory and eccentric, but he has amassed a lot of out-of-the way knowledge which would astonish his professors.\u201d \u201cDid you never ask him what he was going in for?\u201d I asked. \u201cNo; he is not a man that it is easy to draw out, though he can be communicative enough when the fancy seizes him.\u201d \u201cI should like to meet him,\u201d I said."}, {"size": 726, "text": "\u201cIf I am to lodge with anyone, I should prefer a man of studious and quiet habits.

If you like, we shall drive round together after luncheon.\u201d \u201cCertainly,\u201d I answered, and the conversation drifted away into other channels.

Don\u2019t be mealy-mouthed about it.\u201d \u201cIt is not easy to express the inexpressible,\u201d he answered with a laugh. \u201cHolmes is a little too scientific for my tastes--it approaches to cold-bloodedness."}, {"size": 358, "text": "I could imagine his giving a friend a little pinch of the latest vegetable alkaloid, not out of malevolence, you understand, but simply out of a spirit of inquiry in order to have an accurate idea of the effects.

I saw him at it with my own eyes.\u201d \u201cAnd yet you say he is not a medical student?\u201d \u201cNo. Heaven knows what the objects of his studies are. But here we are, and you must form your own impressions about him.\u201d As he spoke, we turned down a narrow lane and passed through a small side-door, which opened into a wing of the great hospital. It was familiar ground to me, and I needed no guiding as we ascended the bleak stone staircase and made our way down the long corridor with its vista of whitewashed wall and dun-coloured doors. Near the further end a low arched passage branched away from it and led to the chemical laboratory."}, {"size": 683, "text": "This was a lofty chamber, lined and littered with countless bottles. Broad, low tables were scattered about, which bristled with retorts, test-tubes, and little Bunsen lamps, with their blue flickering flames.

At the sound of our steps he glanced round and sprang to his feet with a cry of pleasure. \u201cI\u2019ve found it! I\u2019ve found it,\u201d he shouted to my companion, running towards us with a test-tube in his hand. \u201cI have found a re-agent which is precipitated by hoemoglobin, [4] and by nothing else.\u201d Had he discovered a gold mine, greater delight could not have shone upon his features."}, {"size": 646, "text": "\u201cDr. Watson, Mr. Sherlock Holmes,\u201d said Stamford, introducing us. \u201cHow are you?\u201d he said cordially, gripping my hand with a strength for which I should hardly have given him credit. \u201cYou have been in Afghanistan, I perceive.\u201d \u201cHow on earth did you know that?\u201d I asked in astonishment. \u201cNever mind,\u201d said he, chuckling to himself. \u201cThe question now is about hoemoglobin.

You perceive that the resulting mixture has the appearance of pure water. The proportion of blood cannot be more than one in a million. I have no doubt, however, that we shall be able to obtain the characteristic reaction.\u201d As he spoke, he threw into the vessel a few white crystals, and then added some drops of a transparent fluid."}, {"size": 713, "text": "In an instant the contents assumed a dull mahogany colour, and a brownish dust was precipitated to the bottom of the glass jar. \u201cHa! ha!\u201d he cried, clapping his hands, and looking as delighted as a child with a new toy. \u201cWhat do you think of that?\u201d \u201cIt seems to be a very delicate test,\u201d I remarked. \u201cBeautiful! beautiful! The old Guiacum test was very clumsy and uncertain. So is the microscopic examination for blood corpuscles. The latter is valueless if the stains are a few hours old. Now, this appears to act as well whether the blood is old or new.

THE SCIENCE OF DEDUCTION.WE met next day as he had arranged, and inspected the rooms at No. 221B, [5] Baker Street, of which he had spoken at our meeting. They consisted of a couple of comfortable bed-rooms and a single large airy sitting-room, cheerfully furnished, and illuminated by two broad windows. So desirable in every way were the apartments, and so moderate did the terms seem when divided between us, that the bargain was concluded upon the spot, and we at once entered into possession. That very evening I moved my things round from the hotel, and on the following morning Sherlock Holmes followed me with several boxes and portmanteaus. For a day or two we were busily employed in unpacking and laying out our property to the best advantage. That done, we gradually began to settle down and to accommodate ourselves to our new surroundings."}, {"size": 668, "text": "Holmes was certainly not a difficult man to live with. He was quiet in his ways, and his habits were regular. It was rare for him to be up after ten at night, and he had invariably breakfasted and gone out before I rose in the morning. Sometimes he spent his day at the chemical laboratory, sometimes in the dissecting-rooms, and occasionally in long walks, which appeared to take him into the lowest portions of the City. Nothing could exceed his energy when the working fit was upon him; but now and again a reaction would seize him, and for days on end he would lie upon the sofa in the sitting-room, hardly uttering a word or moving a muscle from morning to night."}, {"size": 744, "text": "On these occasions I have noticed such a dreamy, vacant expression in his eyes, that I might have suspected him of being addicted to the use of some narcotic, had not the temperance and cleanliness of his whole life forbidden such a notion.

His very person and appearance were such as to strike the attention of the most casual observer. In height he was rather over six feet, and so excessively lean that he seemed to be considerably taller. His eyes were sharp and piercing, save during those intervals of torpor to which I have alluded; and his thin, hawk-like nose gave his whole expression an air of alertness and decision."}, {"size": 672, "text": "His chin, too, had the prominence and squareness which mark the man of determination.

He had himself, in reply to a question, confirmed Stamford\u2019s opinion upon that point.

No man burdens his mind with small matters unless he has some very good reason for doing so. His ignorance was as remarkable as his knowledge.

I still retain in my scrap-book numerous clippings and extracts bearing upon the case. Here is a condensation of a few of them:--The _Daily Telegraph_ remarked that in the history of crime there had seldom been a tragedy which presented stranger features. The German name of the victim, the absence of all other motive, and the sinister inscription on the wall, all pointed to its perpetration by political refugees and revolutionists."}, {"size": 659, "text": "The Socialists had many branches in America, and the deceased had, no doubt, infringed their unwritten laws, and been tracked down by them.

Nothing is known of the whereabouts of Stangerson. We are glad to learn that Mr. Lestrade and Mr. Gregson, of Scotland Yard, are both engaged upon the case, and it is confidently anticipated that these well-known officers will speedily throw light upon the matter. The _Daily News_ observed that there was no doubt as to the crime being a political one. The despotism and hatred of Liberalism which animated the Continental Governments had had the effect of driving to our shores a number of men who might have made excellent citizens were they not soured by the recollection of all that they had undergone."}, {"size": 714, "text": "Among these men there was a stringent code of honour, any infringement of which was punished by death.

This fresh development has shown me that I was completely mistaken. Full of the one idea, I set myself to find out what had become of the Secretary. They had been seen together at Euston Station about half-past eight on the evening of the third. At two in the morning Drebber had been found in the Brixton Road. The question which confronted me was to find out how Stangerson had been employed between 8.30 and the time of the crime, and what had become of him afterwards."}, {"size": 616, "text": "I telegraphed to Liverpool, giving a description of the man, and warning them to keep a watch upon the American boats. I then set to work calling upon all the hotels and lodging-houses in the vicinity of Euston. You see, I argued that if Drebber and his companion had become separated, the natural course for the latter would be to put up somewhere in the vicinity for the night, and then to hang about the station again next morning.\u201d \u201cThey would be likely to agree on some meeting-place beforehand,\u201d remarked Holmes. \u201cSo it proved. I spent the whole of yesterday evening in making enquiries entirely without avail."}, {"size": 701, "text": "This morning I began very early, and at eight o\u2019clock I reached Halliday\u2019s Private Hotel, in Little George Street. On my enquiry as to whether a Mr. Stangerson was living there, they at once answered me in the affirmative. \u201c\u2018No doubt you are the gentleman whom he was expecting,\u2019 they said. \u2018He has been waiting for a gentleman for two days.\u2019 \u201c\u2018Where is he now?\u2019 I asked. \u201c\u2018He is upstairs in bed. He wished to be called at nine.\u2019 \u201c\u2018I will go up and see him at once,\u2019 I said. \u201cIt seemed to me that my sudden appearance might shake his nerves and lead him to say something unguarded. The Boots volunteered to show me the room: it was on the second floor, and there was a small corridor leading up to it."}, {"size": 605, "text": "The Boots pointed out the door to me, and was about to go downstairs again when I saw something that made me feel sickish, in spite of my twenty years\u2019 experience. From under the door there curled a little red ribbon of blood, which had meandered across the passage and formed a little pool along the skirting at the other side. I gave a cry, which brought the Boots back. He nearly fainted when he saw it. The door was locked on the inside, but we put our shoulders to it, and knocked it in. The window of the room was open, and beside the window, all huddled up, lay the body of a man in his nightdress."}, {"size": 670, "text": "He was quite dead, and had been for some time, for his limbs were rigid and cold. When we turned him over, the Boots recognized him at once as being the same gentleman who had engaged the room under the name of Joseph Stangerson. The cause of death was a deep stab in the left side, which must have penetrated the heart. And now comes the strangest part of the affair. What do you suppose was above the murdered man?\u201d I felt a creeping of the flesh, and a presentiment of coming horror, even before Sherlock Holmes answered. \u201cThe word RACHE, written in letters of blood,\u201d he said. \u201cThat was it,\u201d said Lestrade, in an awe-struck voice; and we were all silent for a while."}, {"size": 602, "text": "There was something so methodical and so incomprehensible about the deeds of this unknown assassin, that it imparted a fresh ghastliness to his crimes. My nerves, which were steady enough on the field of battle tingled as I thought of it. \u201cThe man was seen,\u201d continued Lestrade. \u201cA milk boy, passing on his way to the dairy, happened to walk down the lane which leads from the mews at the back of the hotel. He noticed that a ladder, which usually lay there, was raised against one of the windows of the second floor, which was wide open. After passing, he looked back and saw a man descend the ladder."}, {"size": 645, "text": "He came down so quietly and openly that the boy imagined him to be some carpenter or joiner at work in the hotel. He took no particular notice of him, beyond thinking in his own mind that it was early for him to be at work. He has an impression that the man was tall, had a reddish face, and was dressed in a long, brownish coat. He must have stayed in the room some little time after the murder, for we found blood-stained water in the basin, where he had washed his hands, and marks on the sheets where he had deliberately wiped his knife.\u201d I glanced at Holmes on hearing the description of the murderer, which tallied so exactly with his own."}, {"size": 698, "text": "There was, however, no trace of exultation or satisfaction upon his face. \u201cDid you find nothing in the room which could furnish a clue to the murderer?\u201d he asked. \u201cNothing. Stangerson had Drebber\u2019s purse in his pocket, but it seems that this was usual, as he did all the paying. There was eighty odd pounds in it, but nothing had been taken. Whatever the motives of these extraordinary crimes, robbery is certainly not one of them. There were no papers or memoranda in the murdered man\u2019s pocket, except a single telegram, dated from Cleveland about a month ago, and containing the words, \u2018J. H. is in Europe.\u2019 There was no name appended to this message.\u201d \u201cAnd there was nothing else?\u201d Holmes asked."}, {"size": 799, "text": "\u201cNothing of any importance.

There are, of course, details to be filled in, but I am as certain of all the main facts, from the time that Drebber parted from Stangerson at the station, up to the discovery of the body of the latter, as if I had seen them with my own eyes."}, {"size": 681, "text": "I will give you a proof of my knowledge. Could you lay your hand upon those pills?\u201d \u201cI have them,\u201d said Lestrade, producing a small white box; \u201cI took them and the purse and the telegram, intending to have them put in a place of safety at the Police Station. It was the merest chance my taking these pills, for I am bound to say that I do not attach any importance to them.\u201d \u201cGive them here,\u201d said Holmes. \u201cNow, Doctor,\u201d turning to me, \u201care those ordinary pills?\u201d They certainly were not.

It\u2019s laboured breathing and glazing eye showed that it was not far from its end. Indeed, its snow-white muzzle proclaimed that it had already exceeded the usual term of canine existence.

You will find in time that it has everything to do with it. I shall now add a little milk to make the mixture palatable, and on presenting it to the dog we find that he laps it up readily enough.\u201d As he spoke he turned the contents of the wine glass into a saucer and placed it in front of the terrier, who speedily licked it dry."}, {"size": 764, "text": "Sherlock Holmes\u2019 earnest demeanour had so far convinced us that we all sat in silence, watching the animal intently, and expecting some startling effect.

Holmes had taken out his watch, and as minute followed minute without result, an expression of the utmost chagrin and disappointment appeared upon his features. He gnawed his lip, drummed his fingers upon the table, and showed every other symptom of acute impatience. So great was his emotion, that I felt sincerely sorry for him, while the two detectives smiled derisively, by no means displeased at this check which he had met."}, {"size": 605, "text": "\u201cIt can\u2019t be a coincidence,\u201d he cried, at last springing from his chair and pacing wildly up and down the room; \u201cit is impossible that it should be a mere coincidence.

Surely my whole chain of reasoning cannot have been false. It is impossible! And yet this wretched dog is none the worse. Ah, I have it!

Of the two pills in that box one was of the most deadly poison, and the other was entirely harmless.

This I expect very shortly to do. I have good hopes of managing it through my own arrangements; but it is a thing which needs delicate handling, for we have a shrewd and desperate man to deal with, who is supported, as I have had occasion to prove, by another who is as clever as himself.

ON THE GREAT ALKALI PLAIN.IN the central portion of the great North American Continent there lies an arid and repulsive desert, which for many a long year served as a barrier against the advance of civilisation. From the Sierra Nevada to Nebraska, and from the Yellowstone River in the north to the Colorado upon the south, is a region of desolation and silence. Nor is Nature always in one mood throughout this grim district. It comprises snow-capped and lofty mountains, and dark and gloomy valleys. There are swift-flowing rivers which dash through jagged ca\u00f1ons; and there are enormous plains, which in winter are white with snow, and in summer are grey with the saline alkali dust."}, {"size": 628, "text": "They all preserve, however, the common characteristics of barrenness, inhospitality, and misery.

In this great stretch of country there is no sign of life, nor of anything appertaining to life. There is no bird in the steel-blue heaven, no movement upon the dull, grey earth--above all, there is absolute silence. Listen as one may, there is no shadow of a sound in all that mighty wilderness; nothing but silence--complete and heart-subduing silence."}, {"size": 729, "text": "It has been said there is nothing appertaining to life upon the broad plain.

His face was lean and haggard, and the brown parchment-like skin was drawn tightly over the projecting bones; his long, brown hair and beard were all flecked and dashed with white; his eyes were sunken in his head, and burned with an unnatural lustre; while the hand which grasped his rifle was hardly more fleshy than that of a skeleton."}, {"size": 682, "text": "As he stood, he leaned upon his weapon for support, and yet his tall figure and the massive framework of his bones suggested a wiry and vigorous constitution.

The savage man, and the savage beast, hunger, thirst, fatigue, and disease--every impediment which Nature could place in the way, had all been overcome with Anglo-Saxon tenacity. Yet the long journey and the accumulated terrors had shaken the hearts of the stoutest among them. There was not one who did not sink upon his knees in heartfelt prayer when they saw the broad valley of Utah bathed in the sunlight beneath them, and learned from the lips of their leader that this was the promised land, and that these virgin acres were to be theirs for evermore."}, {"size": 687, "text": "Young speedily proved himself to be a skilful administrator as well as a resolute chief.

In the country there was draining and hedging, planting and clearing, until the next summer saw the whole country golden with the wheat crop. Everything prospered in the strange settlement. Above all, the great temple which they had erected in the centre of the city grew ever taller and larger."}, {"size": 603, "text": "From the first blush of dawn until the closing of the twilight, the clatter of the hammer and the rasp of the saw was never absent from the monument which the immigrants erected to Him who had led them safe through many dangers.

So rapidly did he gain the esteem of his new companions, that when they reached the end of their wanderings, it was unanimously agreed that he should be provided with as large and as fertile a tract of land as any of the settlers, with the exception of Young himself, and of Stangerson, Kemball, Johnston, and Drebber, who were the four principal Elders."}, {"size": 762, "text": "On the farm thus acquired John Ferrier built himself a substantial log-house, which received so many additions in succeeding years that it grew into a roomy villa.

Hence it came about that his farm and all that belonged to him prospered exceedingly. In three years he was better off than his neighbours, in six he was well-to-do, in nine he was rich, and in twelve there were not half a dozen men in the whole of Salt Lake City who could compare with him.

There were some who accused him of lukewarmness in his adopted religion, and others who put it down to greed of wealth and reluctance to incur expense. Others, again, spoke of some early love affair, and of a fair-haired girl who had pined away on the shores of the Atlantic. Whatever the reason, Ferrier remained strictly celibate. In every other respect he conformed to the religion of the young settlement, and gained the name of being an orthodox and straight-walking man."}, {"size": 827, "text": "Lucy Ferrier grew up within the log-house, and assisted her adopted father in all his undertakings.

Many a wayfarer upon the high road which ran by Ferrier\u2019s farm felt long-forgotten thoughts revive in their mind as they watched her lithe girlish figure tripping through the wheatfields, or met her mounted upon her father\u2019s mustang, and managing it with all the ease and grace of a true child of the West.

Unfortunately the horns of one of the creatures, either by accident or design, came in violent contact with the flank of the mustang, and excited it to madness.

Unaccustomed to sudden emergencies, her head began to swim, and her grip upon the bridle to relax.

To this day, in the lonely ranches of the West, the name of the Danite Band, or the Avenging Angels, is a sinister and an ill-omened one.

A FLIGHT FOR LIFE.

Having done thus he felt easier in his mind, and returned home with a lighter heart. As he approached his farm, he was surprised to see a horse hitched to each of the posts of the gate.

My father has now given over his mills to me, and I am the richer man.\u201d \u201cBut my prospects are better,\u201d said the other, warmly. \u201cWhen the Lord removes my father, I shall have his tanning yard and his leather factory."}, {"size": 660, "text": "Then I am your elder, and am higher in the Church.\u201d \u201cIt will be for the maiden to decide,\u201d rejoined young Drebber, smirking at his own reflection in the glass. \u201cWe will leave it all to her decision.\u201d During this dialogue, John Ferrier had stood fuming in the doorway, hardly able to keep his riding-whip from the backs of his two visitors. \u201cLook here,\u201d he said at last, striding up to them, \u201cwhen my daughter summons you, you can come, but until then I don\u2019t want to see your faces again.\u201d The two young Mormons stared at him in amazement.

If minor errors were punished so sternly, what would be the fate of this arch rebel. Ferrier knew that his wealth and position would be of no avail to him. Others as well known and as rich as himself had been spirited away before now, and their goods given over to the Church. He was a brave man, but he trembled at the vague, shadowy terrors which hung over him. Any known danger he could face with a firm lip, but this suspense was unnerving. He concealed his fears from his daughter, however, and affected to make light of the whole matter, though she, with the keen eye of love, saw plainly that he was ill at ease."}, {"size": 621, "text": "He expected that he would receive some message or remonstrance from Young as to his conduct, and he was not mistaken, though it came in an unlooked-for manner.

On it was printed, in bold straggling letters:-- \u201cTwenty-nine days are given you for amendment, and then----\u201d The dash was more fear-inspiring than any threat could have been. How this warning came into his room puzzled John Ferrier sorely, for his servants slept in an outhouse, and the doors and windows had all been secured."}, {"size": 854, "text": "He crumpled the paper up and said nothing to his daughter, but the incident struck a chill into his heart. The twenty-nine days were evidently the balance of the month which Young had promised. What strength or courage could avail against an enemy armed with such mysterious powers? The hand which fastened that pin might have struck him to the heart, and he could never have known who had slain him. Still more shaken was he next morning. They had sat down to their breakfast when Lucy with a cry of surprise pointed upwards. In the centre of the ceiling was scrawled, with a burned stick apparently, the number 28. To his daughter it was unintelligible, and he did not enlighten her. That night he sat up with his gun and kept watch and ward. He saw and he heard nothing, and yet in the morning a great 27 had been painted upon the outside of his door."}, {"size": 741, "text": "Thus day followed day; and as sure as morning came he found that his unseen enemies had kept their register, and had marked up in some conspicuous position how many days were still left to him out of the month of grace. Sometimes the fatal numbers appeared upon the walls, sometimes upon the floors, occasionally they were on small placards stuck upon the garden gate or the railings. With all his vigilance John Ferrier could not discover whence these daily warnings proceeded. A horror which was almost superstitious came upon him at the sight of them. He became haggard and restless, and his eyes had the troubled look of some hunted creature. He had but one hope in life now, and that was for the arrival of the young hunter from Nevada."}, {"size": 687, "text": "Twenty had changed to fifteen and fifteen to ten, but there was no news of the absentee. One by one the numbers dwindled down, and still there came no sign of him. Whenever a horseman clattered down the road, or a driver shouted at his team, the old farmer hurried to the gate thinking that help had arrived at last. At last, when he saw five give way to four and that again to three, he lost heart, and abandoned all hope of escape. Single-handed, and with his limited knowledge of the mountains which surrounded the settlement, he knew that he was powerless. The more-frequented roads were strictly watched and guarded, and none could pass along them without an order from the Council."}, {"size": 778, "text": "Turn which way he would, there appeared to be no avoiding the blow which hung over him. Yet the old man never wavered in his resolution to part with life itself before he consented to what he regarded as his daughter\u2019s dishonour.

That morning had shown the figure 2 upon the wall of his house, and the next day would be the last of the allotted time. What was to happen then? All manner of vague and terrible fancies filled his imagination. And his daughter--what was to become of her after he was gone? Was there no escape from the invisible network which was drawn all round them. He sank his head upon the table and sobbed at the thought of his own impotence."}, {"size": 662, "text": "What was that? In the silence he heard a gentle scratching sound--low, but very distinct in the quiet of the night. It came from the door of the house. Ferrier crept into the hall and listened intently. There was a pause for a few moments, and then the low insidious sound was repeated. Someone was evidently tapping very gently upon one of the panels of the door. Was it some midnight assassin who had come to carry out the murderous orders of the secret tribunal? Or was it some agent who was marking up that the last day of grace had arrived. John Ferrier felt that instant death would be better than the suspense which shook his nerves and chilled his heart."}, {"size": 666, "text": "Springing forward he drew the bolt and threw the door open. Outside all was calm and quiet. The night was fine, and the stars were twinkling brightly overhead. The little front garden lay before the farmer\u2019s eyes bounded by the fence and gate, but neither there nor on the road was any human being to be seen. With a sigh of relief, Ferrier looked to right and to left, until happening to glance straight down at his own feet he saw to his astonishment a man lying flat upon his face upon the ground, with arms and legs all asprawl. So unnerved was he at the sight that he leaned up against the wall with his hand to his throat to stifle his inclination to call out."}, {"size": 712, "text": "His first thought was that the prostrate figure was that of some wounded or dying man, but as he watched it he saw it writhe along the ground and into the hall with the rapidity and noiselessness of a serpent.

Whatever made you come in like that.\u201d \u201cGive me food,\u201d the other said, hoarsely. \u201cI have had no time for bite or sup for eight-and-forty hours.\u201d He flung himself upon the [21] cold meat and bread which were still lying upon the table from his host\u2019s supper, and devoured it voraciously."}, {"size": 872, "text": "\u201cDoes Lucy bear up well?\u201d he asked, when he had satisfied his hunger. \u201cYes.

They may be darned sharp, but they\u2019re not quite sharp enough to catch a Washoe hunter.\u201d John Ferrier felt a different man now that he realized that he had a devoted ally. He seized the young man\u2019s leathery hand and wrung it cordially. \u201cYou\u2019re a man to be proud of,\u201d he said. \u201cThere are not many who would come to share our danger and our troubles.\u201d \u201cYou\u2019ve hit it there, pard,\u201d the young hunter answered. \u201cI have a respect for you, but if you were alone in this business I\u2019d think twice before I put my head into such a hornet\u2019s nest.

Once on the road we are only two miles from the Ravine where the horses are waiting. By daybreak we should be half-way through the mountains.\u201d \u201cWhat if we are stopped,\u201d asked Ferrier.

All looked so peaceful and happy, the rustling trees and the broad silent stretch of grain-land, that it was difficult to realize that the spirit of murder lurked through it all.

With unerring instinct Jefferson Hope picked his way among the great boulders and along the bed of a dried-up watercourse, until he came to the retired corner, screened with rocks, where the faithful animals had been picketed.

Between the two ran the irregular track, so narrow in places that they had to travel in Indian file, and so rough that only practised riders could have traversed it at all.

When morning broke, a scene of marvellous though savage beauty lay before them. In every direction the great snow-capped peaks hemmed them in, peeping over each other\u2019s shoulders to the far horizon.

He little knew how far that iron grasp could reach, or how soon it was to close upon them and crush them. About the middle of the second day of their flight their scanty store of provisions began to run out. This gave the hunter little uneasiness, however, for there was game to be had among the mountains, and he had frequently before had to depend upon his rifle for the needs of life. Choosing a sheltered nook, he piled together a few dried branches and made a blazing fire, at which his companions might warm themselves, for they were now nearly five thousand feet above the sea level, and the air was bitter and keen."}, {"size": 751, "text": "Having tethered the horses, and bade Lucy adieu, he threw his gun over his shoulder, and set out in search of whatever chance might throw in his way.

He walked for a couple of miles through one ravine after another without success, though from the marks upon the bark of the trees, and other indications, he judged that there were numerous bears in the vicinity. At last, after two or three hours\u2019 fruitless search, he was thinking of turning back in despair, when casting his eyes upwards he saw a sight which sent a thrill of pleasure through his heart."}, {"size": 634, "text": "On the edge of a jutting pinnacle, three or four hundred feet above him, there stood a creature somewhat resembling a sheep in appearance, but armed with a pair of gigantic horns. The big-horn--for so it is called--was acting, probably, as a guardian over a flock which were invisible to the hunter; but fortunately it was heading in the opposite direction, and had not perceived him. Lying on his face, he rested his rifle upon a rock, and took a long and steady aim before drawing the trigger. The animal sprang into the air, tottered for a moment upon the edge of the precipice, and then came crashing down into the valley beneath."}, {"size": 628, "text": "The creature was too unwieldy to lift, so the hunter contented himself with cutting away one haunch and part of the flank.

In his eagerness he had wandered far past the ravines which were known to him, and it was no easy matter to pick out the path which he had taken. The valley in which he found himself divided and sub-divided into many gorges, which were so like each other that it was impossible to distinguish one from the other."}, {"size": 745, "text": "He followed one for a mile or more until he came to a mountain torrent which he was sure that he had never seen before. Convinced that he had taken the wrong turn, he tried another, but with the same result. Night was coming on rapidly, and it was almost dark before he at last found himself in a defile which was familiar to him. Even then it was no easy matter to keep to the right track, for the moon had not yet risen, and the high cliffs on either side made the obscurity more profound. Weighed down with his burden, and weary from his exertions, he stumbled along, keeping up his heart by the reflection that every step brought him nearer to Lucy, and that he carried with him enough to ensure them food for the remainder of their journey."}, {"size": 686, "text": "He had now come to the mouth of the very defile in which he had left them. Even in the darkness he could recognize the outline of the cliffs which bounded it. They must, he reflected, be awaiting him anxiously, for he had been absent nearly five hours. In the gladness of his heart he put his hands to his mouth and made the glen re-echo to a loud halloo as a signal that he was coming. He paused and listened for an answer. None came save his own cry, which clattered up the dreary silent ravines, and was borne back to his ears in countless repetitions. Again he shouted, even louder than before, and again no whisper came back from the friends whom he had left such a short time ago."}, {"size": 692, "text": "A vague, nameless dread came over him, and he hurried onwards frantically, dropping the precious food in his agitation. When he turned the corner, he came full in sight of the spot where the fire had been lit. There was still a glowing pile of wood ashes there, but it had evidently not been tended since his departure. The same dead silence still reigned all round. With his fears all changed to convictions, he hurried on. There was no living creature near the remains of the fire: animals, man, maiden, all were gone. It was only too clear that some sudden and terrible disaster had occurred during his absence--a disaster which had embraced them all, and yet had left no traces behind it."}, {"size": 605, "text": "Bewildered and stunned by this blow, Jefferson Hope felt his head spin round, and had to lean upon his rifle to save himself from falling. He was essentially a man of action, however, and speedily recovered from his temporary impotence.

Jefferson Hope had almost persuaded himself that they must have done so, when his eye fell upon an object which made every nerve of his body tingle within him. A little way on one side of the camp was a low-lying heap of reddish soil, which had assuredly not been there before. There was no mistaking it for anything but a newly-dug grave. As the young hunter approached it, he perceived that a stick had been planted on it, with a sheet of paper stuck in the cleft fork of it. The inscription upon the paper was brief, but to the point: JOHN FERRIER, FORMERLY OF SALT LAKE CITY, [22] Died August 4th, 1860."}, {"size": 612, "text": "The sturdy old man, whom he had left so short a time before, was gone, then, and this was all his epitaph.

As the young fellow realized the certainty of her fate, and his own powerlessness to prevent it, he wished that he, too, was lying with the old farmer in his last silent resting-place. Again, however, his active spirit shook off the lethargy which springs from despair."}, {"size": 846, "text": "If there was nothing else left to him, he could at least devote his life to revenge. With indomitable patience and perseverance, Jefferson Hope possessed also a power of sustained vindictiveness, which he may have learned from the Indians amongst whom he had lived. As he stood by the desolate fire, he felt that the only one thing which could assuage his grief would be thorough and complete retribution, brought by his own hand upon his enemies. His strong will and untiring energy should, he determined, be devoted to that one end. With a grim, white face, he retraced his steps to where he had dropped the food, and having stirred up the smouldering fire, he cooked enough to last him for a few days. This he made up into a bundle, and, tired as he was, he set himself to walk back through the mountains upon the track of the avenging angels."}, {"size": 636, "text": "For five days he toiled footsore and weary through the defiles which he had already traversed on horseback.

There is a warrant against you from the Holy Four for assisting the Ferriers away.\u201d \u201cI don\u2019t fear them, or their warrant,\u201d Hope said, earnestly. \u201cYou must know something of this matter, Cowper.

There was some words between young Drebber and young Stangerson as to which was to have her. They\u2019d both been in the party that followed them, and Stangerson had shot her father, which seemed to give him the best claim; but when they argued it out in council, Drebber\u2019s party was the stronger, so the Prophet gave her over to him."}, {"size": 603, "text": "No one won\u2019t have her very long though, for I saw death in her face yesterday.

So strange and so brief was the episode, that the watchers might have found it hard to believe it themselves or persuade other people of it, had it not been for the undeniable fact that the circlet of gold which marked her as having been a bride had disappeared."}, {"size": 797, "text": "For some months Jefferson Hope lingered among the mountains, leading a strange wild life, and nursing in his heart the fierce desire for vengeance which possessed him.

On another occasion, as Drebber passed under a cliff a great boulder crashed down on him, and he only escaped a terrible death by throwing himself upon his face.

After a time they were able to relax these measures, for nothing was either heard or seen of their opponent, and they hoped that time had cooled his vindictiveness. Far from doing so, it had, if anything, augmented it. The hunter\u2019s mind was of a hard, unyielding nature, and the predominant idea of revenge had taken such complete possession of it that there was no room for any other emotion. He was, however, above all things practical. He soon realized that even his iron constitution could not stand the incessant strain which he was putting upon it."}, {"size": 737, "text": "Exposure and want of wholesome food were wearing him out.

His intention had been to be absent a year at the most, but a combination of unforeseen circumstances prevented his leaving the mines for nearly five.

Among these had been Drebber and Stangerson; and no one knew whither they had gone. Rumour reported that Drebber had managed to convert a large part of his property into money, and that he had departed a wealthy man, while his companion, Stangerson, was comparatively poor.

Year passed into year, his black hair turned grizzled, but still he wandered on, a human bloodhound, with his mind wholly set upon the one object upon which he had devoted his life. At last his perseverance was rewarded.

Among the many billets which I have filled in America during my wandering life, I was once janitor and sweeper out of the laboratory at York College.

THE CONCLUSION. WE had all been warned to appear before the magistrates upon the Thursday; but when the Thursday came there was no occasion for our testimony.

On the very night after his capture the aneurism burst, and he was found in the morning stretched upon the floor of the cell, with a placid smile upon his face, as though he had been able in his dying moments to look back upon a useful life, and on work well done. \u201cGregson and Lestrade will be wild about his death,\u201d Holmes remarked, as we chatted it over next evening."}, {"size": 650, "text": "\u201cWhere will their grand advertisement be now?\u201d \u201cI don\u2019t see that they had very much to do with his capture,\u201d I answered. \u201cWhat you do in this world is a matter of no consequence,\u201d returned my companion, bitterly. \u201cThe question is, what can you make people believe that you have done. Never mind,\u201d he continued, more brightly, after a pause. \u201cI would not have missed the investigation for anything. There has been no better case within my recollection. Simple as it was, there were several most instructive points about it.\u201d \u201cSimple!\u201d I ejaculated. \u201cWell, really, it can hardly be described as otherwise,\u201d said Sherlock Holmes, smiling at my surprise."}, {"size": 761, "text": "\u201cThe proof of its intrinsic simplicity is, that without any help save a few very ordinary deductions I was able to lay my hand upon the criminal within three days.\u201d \u201cThat is true,\u201d said I. \u201cI have already explained to you that what is out of the common is usually a guide rather than a hindrance. In solving a problem of this sort, the grand thing is to be able to reason backwards. That is a very useful accomplishment, and a very easy one, but people do not practise it much. In the every-day affairs of life it is more useful to reason forwards, and so the other comes to be neglected. There are fifty who can reason synthetically for one who can reason analytically.\u201d \u201cI confess,\u201d said I, \u201cthat I do not quite follow you.\u201d \u201cI hardly expected that you would."}, {"size": 614, "text": "Let me see if I can make it clearer. Most people, if you describe a train of events to them, will tell you what the result would be. They can put those events together in their minds, and argue from them that something will come to pass. There are few people, however, who, if you told them a result, would be able to evolve from their own inner consciousness what the steps were which led up to that result. This power is what I mean when I talk of reasoning backwards, or analytically.\u201d \u201cI understand,\u201d said I. \u201cNow this was a case in which you were given the result and had to find everything else for yourself."}, {"size": 608, "text": "Now let me endeavour to show you the different steps in my reasoning. To begin at the beginning. I approached the house, as you know, on foot, and with my mind entirely free from all impressions. I naturally began by examining the roadway, and there, as I have already explained to you, I saw clearly the marks of a cab, which, I ascertained by inquiry, must have been there during the night. I satisfied myself that it was a cab and not a private carriage by the narrow gauge of the wheels. The ordinary London growler is considerably less wide than a gentleman\u2019s brougham. \u201cThis was the first point gained."}, {"size": 607, "text": "I then walked slowly down the garden path, which happened to be composed of a clay soil, peculiarly suitable for taking impressions. No doubt it appeared to you to be a mere trampled line of slush, but to my trained eyes every mark upon its surface had a meaning. There is no branch of detective science which is so important and so much neglected as the art of tracing footsteps. Happily, I have always laid great stress upon it, and much practice has made it second nature to me. I saw the heavy footmarks of the constables, but I saw also the track of the two men who had first passed through the garden."}, {"size": 750, "text": "It was easy to tell that they had been before the others, because in places their marks had been entirely obliterated by the others coming upon the top of them. In this way my second link was formed, which told me that the nocturnal visitors were two in number, one remarkable for his height (as I calculated from the length of his stride), and the other fashionably dressed, to judge from the small and elegant impression left by his boots. \u201cOn entering the house this last inference was confirmed. My well-booted man lay before me. The tall one, then, had done the murder, if murder there was. There was no wound upon the dead man\u2019s person, but the agitated expression upon his face assured me that he had foreseen his fate before it came upon him."}, {"size": 699, "text": "Men who die from heart disease, or any sudden natural cause, never by any chance exhibit agitation upon their features. Having sniffed the dead man\u2019s lips I detected a slightly sour smell, and I came to the conclusion that he had had poison forced upon him. Again, I argued that it had been forced upon him from the hatred and fear expressed upon his face. By the method of exclusion, I had arrived at this result, for no other hypothesis would meet the facts. Do not imagine that it was a very unheard of idea. The forcible administration of poison is by no means a new thing in criminal annals. The cases of Dolsky in Odessa, and of Leturier in Montpellier, will occur at once to any toxicologist."}, {"size": 604, "text": "\u201cAnd now came the great question as to the reason why. Robbery had not been the object of the murder, for nothing was taken. Was it politics, then, or was it a woman? That was the question which confronted me. I was inclined from the first to the latter supposition. Political assassins are only too glad to do their work and to fly. This murder had, on the contrary, been done most deliberately, and the perpetrator had left his tracks all over the room, showing that he had been there all the time. It must have been a private wrong, and not a political one, which called for such a methodical revenge."}, {"size": 698, "text": "When the inscription was discovered upon the wall I was more inclined than ever to my opinion. The thing was too evidently a blind. When the ring was found, however, it settled the question. Clearly the murderer had used it to remind his victim of some dead or absent woman. It was at this point that I asked Gregson whether he had enquired in his telegram to Cleveland as to any particular point in Mr. Drebber\u2019s former career. He answered, you remember, in the negative. \u201cI then proceeded to make a careful examination of the room, which confirmed me in my opinion as to the murderer\u2019s height, and furnished me with the additional details as to the Trichinopoly cigar and the length of his nails."}, {"size": 690, "text": "I had already come to the conclusion, since there were no signs of a struggle, that the blood which covered the floor had burst from the murderer\u2019s nose in his excitement. I could perceive that the track of blood coincided with the track of his feet. It is seldom that any man, unless he is very full-blooded, breaks out in this way through emotion, so I hazarded the opinion that the criminal was probably a robust and ruddy-faced man. Events proved that I had judged correctly. \u201cHaving left the house, I proceeded to do what Gregson had neglected. I telegraphed to the head of the police at Cleveland, limiting my enquiry to the circumstances connected with the marriage of Enoch Drebber."}, {"size": 605, "text": "The answer was conclusive. It told me that Drebber had already applied for the protection of the law against an old rival in love, named Jefferson Hope, and that this same Hope was at present in Europe. I knew now that I held the clue to the mystery in my hand, and all that remained was to secure the murderer. \u201cI had already determined in my own mind that the man who had walked into the house with Drebber, was none other than the man who had driven the cab. The marks in the road showed me that the horse had wandered on in a way which would have been impossible had there been anyone in charge of it."}, {"size": 669, "text": "Where, then, could the driver be, unless he were inside the house? Again, it is absurd to suppose that any sane man would carry out a deliberate crime under the very eyes, as it were, of a third person, who was sure to betray him. Lastly, supposing one man wished to dog another through London, what better means could he adopt than to turn cabdriver. All these considerations led me to the irresistible conclusion that Jefferson Hope was to be found among the jarveys of the Metropolis. \u201cIf he had been one there was no reason to believe that he had ceased to be. On the contrary, from his point of view, any sudden change would be likely to draw attention to himself."}, {"size": 618, "text": "He would, probably, for a time at least, continue to perform his duties. There was no reason to suppose that he was going under an assumed name. Why should he change his name in a country where no one knew his original one? I therefore organized my Street Arab detective corps, and sent them systematically to every cab proprietor in London until they ferreted out the man that I wanted.
