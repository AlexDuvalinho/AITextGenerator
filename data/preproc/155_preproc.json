The reserve which I have hitherto maintained in this matter has been misinterpreted by members of my family whose good opinion I cannot consent to forfeit.

Partly from its peculiar colour, partly from a superstition which represented it as feeling the influence of the deity whom it adorned, and growing and lessening in lustre with the waxing and waning of the moon, it first gained the name by which it continues to be known in India to this day\u2014the name of THE MOONSTONE.

At that date, the Mohammedan conqueror, Mahmoud of Ghizni, crossed India; seized on the holy city of Somnauth; and stripped of its treasures the famous temple, which had stood for centuries\u2014the shrine of Hindoo pilgrimage, and the wonder of the Eastern world. Of all the deities worshipped in the temple, the moon-god alone escaped the rapacity of the conquering Mohammedans."}, {"size": 605, "text": "Preserved by three Brahmins, the inviolate deity, bearing the Yellow Diamond in its forehead, was removed by night, and was transported to the second of the sacred cities of India\u2014the city of Benares. Here, in a new shrine\u2014in a hall inlaid with precious stones, under a roof supported by pillars of gold\u2014the moon-god was set up and worshipped. Here, on the night when the shrine was completed, Vishnu the Preserver appeared to the three Brahmins in a dream. The deity breathed the breath of his divinity on the Diamond in the forehead of the god. And the Brahmins knelt and hid their faces in their robes."}, {"size": 619, "text": "The deity commanded that the Moonstone should be watched, from that time forth, by three priests in turn, night and day, to the end of the generations of men.

At his command havoc and rapine were let loose once more among the temples of the worship of Brahmah. The shrine of the four-handed god was polluted by the slaughter of sacred animals; the images of the deities were broken in pieces; and the Moonstone was seized by an officer of rank in the army of Aurungzebe.

Time rolled on from the first to the last years of the eighteenth Christian century. The Diamond fell into the possession of Tippoo, Sultan of Seringapatam, who caused it to be placed as an ornament in the handle of a dagger, and who commanded it to be kept among the choicest treasures of his armoury. Even then\u2014in the palace of the Sultan himself\u2014the three guardian priests still kept their watch in secret.

A foolish wrangle followed; and Herncastle\u2019s unlucky temper got the better of him. He declared, in his boastful way, that we should see the Diamond on his finger, if the English army took Seringapatam. The sally was saluted by a roar of laughter, and there, as we all thought that night, the thing ended."}, {"size": 772, "text": "Let me now take you on to the day of the assault. My cousin and I were separated at the outset. I never saw him when we forded the river; when we planted the English flag in the first breach; when we crossed the ditch beyond; and, fighting every inch of our way, entered the town. It was only at dusk, when the place was ours, and after General Baird himself had found the dead body of Tippoo under a heap of the slain, that Herncastle and I met. We were each attached to a party sent out by the general\u2019s orders to prevent the plunder and confusion which followed our conquest. The camp-followers committed deplorable excesses; and, worse still, the soldiers found their way, by a guarded door, into the treasury of the Palace, and loaded themselves with gold and jewels."}, {"size": 680, "text": "It was in the court outside the treasury that my cousin and I met, to enforce the laws of discipline on our own soldiers. Herncastle\u2019s fiery temper had been, as I could plainly see, exasperated to a kind of frenzy by the terrible slaughter through which we had passed. He was very unfit, in my opinion, to perform the duty that had been entrusted to him. There was riot and confusion enough in the treasury, but no violence that I saw. The men (if I may use such an expression) disgraced themselves good-humouredly. All sorts of rough jests and catchwords were bandied about among them; and the story of the Diamond turned up again unexpectedly, in the form of a mischievous joke."}, {"size": 691, "text": "\u201cWho\u2019s got the Moonstone?\u201d was the rallying cry which perpetually caused the plundering, as soon as it was stopped in one place, to break out in another.

I got to an open door, and saw the bodies of two Indians (by their dress, as I guessed, officers of the palace) lying across the entrance, dead. A cry inside hurried me into a room, which appeared to serve as an armoury. A third Indian, mortally wounded, was sinking at the feet of a man whose back was towards me."}, {"size": 644, "text": "The man turned at the instant when I came in, and I saw John Herncastle, with a torch in one hand, and a dagger dripping with blood in the other. A stone, set like a pommel, in the end of the dagger\u2019s handle, flashed in the torchlight, as he turned on me, like a gleam of fire. The dying Indian sank to his knees, pointed to the dagger in Herncastle\u2019s hand, and said, in his native language\u2014\u201cThe Moonstone will have its vengeance yet on you and yours!\u201d He spoke those words, and fell dead on the floor.

I put two sentinels of my own company, on whom I could rely, to keep the door. Through the remainder of the night, I saw no more of my cousin. Early in the morning, the plunder still going on, General Baird announced publicly by beat of drum, that any thief detected in the fact, be he whom he might, should be hung. The provost-marshal was in attendance, to prove that the General was in earnest; and in the throng that followed the proclamation, Herncastle and I met again."}, {"size": 632, "text": "He held out his hand, as usual, and said, \u201cGood morning.\u201d I waited before I gave him my hand in return. \u201cTell me first,\u201d I said, \u201chow the Indian in the armoury met his death, and what those last words meant, when he pointed to the dagger in your hand.\u201d \u201cThe Indian met his death, as I suppose, by a mortal wound,\u201d said Herncastle. \u201cWhat his last words meant I know no more than you do.\u201d I looked at him narrowly. His frenzy of the previous day had all calmed down. I determined to give him another chance. \u201cIs that all you have to tell me?\u201d I asked.

Herncastle has said nothing that can justify me in speaking to our commanding officer. He has been taunted more than once about the Diamond, by those who recollect his angry outbreak before the assault; but, as may easily be imagined, his own remembrance of the circumstances under which I surprised him in the armoury has been enough to keep him silent. It is reported that he means to exchange into another regiment, avowedly for the purpose of separating himself from _me_."}, {"size": 732, "text": "Whether this be true or not, I cannot prevail upon myself to become his accuser\u2014and I think with good reason.

It is true that I heard the dying Indian\u2019s words; but if those words were pronounced to be the ravings of delirium, how could I contradict the assertion from my own knowledge?

I had not seen Mr. Franklin since he was a boy, living along with us in this house. He was, out of all sight (as I remember him), the nicest boy that ever spun a top or broke a window.

I answer, because his father had the misfortune to be next heir to a Dukedom, and not to be able to prove it. In two words, this was how the thing happened: My lady\u2019s eldest sister married the celebrated Mr. Blake\u2014equally famous for his great riches, and his great suit at law."}, {"size": 741, "text": "How many years he went on worrying the tribunals of his country to turn out the Duke in possession, and to put himself in the Duke\u2019s place\u2014how many lawyer\u2019s purses he filled to bursting, and how many otherwise harmless people he set by the ears together disputing whether he was right or wrong\u2014is more by a great deal than I can reckon up. His wife died, and two of his three children died, before the tribunals could make up their minds to show him the door and take no more of his money.

They made him among them a sort of universal genius, as well as I could understand it. He wrote a little; he painted a little; he sang and played and composed a little\u2014borrowing, as I suspect, in all these cases, just as he had borrowed from me.

Going round to the terrace, I found three mahogany-coloured Indians, in white linen frocks and trousers, looking up at the house. The Indians, as I saw on looking closer, had small hand-drums slung in front of them. Behind them stood a little delicate-looking light-haired English boy carrying a bag.

I was roused up by my daughter Penelope running out at me as if the house was on fire. What do you think she wanted? She wanted to have the three Indian jugglers instantly taken up; for this reason, namely, that they knew who was coming from London to visit us, and that they meant some mischief to Mr. Franklin Blake.

This, it seems, ended the difficulty. The little chap unwillingly held out his hand. Upon that, the Indian took a bottle from his bosom, and poured out of it some black stuff, like ink, into the palm of the boy\u2019s hand. The Indian\u2014first touching the boy\u2019s head, and making signs over it in the air\u2014then said, \u201cLook.\u201d The boy became quite stiff, and stood like a statue, looking into the ink in the hollow of his hand."}, {"size": 639, "text": "(So far, it seemed to me to be juggling, accompanied by a foolish waste of ink.

The boy said, \u201cI am tired. The mist rises in my head, and puzzles me. I can see no more today.\u201d With that the catechism ended. The chief Indian said something in his own language to the other two, pointing to the boy, and pointing towards the town, in which (as we afterwards discovered) they were lodged. He then, after making more signs on the boy\u2019s head, blew on his forehead, and so woke him up with a start.

Second, that he and his men and boy (with a view to making the said money) meant to hang about till they saw my lady drive home, and then to come back, and foretell Mr. Franklin\u2019s arrival by magic. Third, that Penelope had heard them rehearsing their hocus-pocus, like actors rehearsing a play. Fourth, that I should do well to have an eye, that evening, on the plate-basket.

Rosanna (to put the Person before the Thing, which is but common politeness) was the only new servant in our house.

The upshot of it was, that Rosanna Spearman had been a thief, and not being of the sort that get up Companies in the City, and rob from thousands, instead of only robbing from one, the law laid hold of her, and the prison and the reformatory followed the lead of the law. The matron\u2019s opinion of Rosanna was (in spite of what she had done) that the girl was one in a thousand, and that she only wanted a chance to prove herself worthy of any Christian woman\u2019s interest in her."}, {"size": 626, "text": "My lady (being a Christian woman, if ever there was one yet) said to the matron, upon that, \u201cRosanna Spearman shall have her chance, in my service.\u201d In a week afterwards, Rosanna Spearman entered this establishment as our second housemaid. Not a soul was told the girl\u2019s story, excepting Miss Rachel and me. My lady, doing me the honour to consult me about most things, consulted me about Rosanna. Having fallen a good deal latterly into the late Sir John\u2019s way of always agreeing with my lady, I agreed with her heartily about Rosanna Spearman.

Though far from strong, and troubled occasionally with those fainting-fits already mentioned, she went about her work modestly and uncomplainingly, doing it carefully, and doing it well. But, somehow, she failed to make friends among the other women servants, excepting my daughter Penelope, who was always kind to Rosanna, though never intimate with her."}, {"size": 648, "text": "I hardly know what the girl did to offend them. There was certainly no beauty about her to make the others envious; she was the plainest woman in the house, with the additional misfortune of having one shoulder bigger than the other. What the servants chiefly resented, I think, was her silent tongue and her solitary ways. She read or worked in leisure hours when the rest gossiped. And when it came to her turn to go out, nine times out of ten she quietly put on her bonnet, and had her turn by herself. She never quarrelled, she never took offence; she only kept a certain distance, obstinately and civilly, between the rest of them and herself."}, {"size": 891, "text": "Add to this that, plain as she was, there was just a dash of something that wasn\u2019t like a housemaid, and that _was_ like a lady, about her.

All I can say is, that the other women pounced on it like lightning the first day she came into the house, and said (which was most unjust) that Rosanna Spearman gave herself airs. Having now told the story of Rosanna, I have only to notice one of the many queer ways of this strange girl to get on next to the story of the sands. Our house is high up on the Yorkshire coast, and close by the sea. We have got beautiful walks all round us, in every direction but one. That one I acknowledge to be a horrid walk. It leads, for a quarter of a mile, through a melancholy plantation of firs, and brings you out between low cliffs on the loneliest and ugliest little bay on all our coast."}, {"size": 718, "text": "The sandhills here run down to the sea, and end in two spits of rock jutting out opposite each other, till you lose sight of them in the water. One is called the North Spit, and one the South. Between the two, shifting backwards and forwards at certain seasons of the year, lies the most horrible quicksand on the shores of Yorkshire. At the turn of the tide, something goes on in the unknown deeps below, which sets the whole face of the quicksand shivering and trembling in a manner most remarkable to see, and which has given to it, among the people in our parts, the name of the Shivering Sand. A great bank, half a mile out, nigh the mouth of the bay, breaks the force of the main ocean coming in from the offing."}, {"size": 689, "text": "Winter and summer, when the tide flows over the quicksand, the sea seems to leave the waves behind it on the bank, and rolls its waters in smoothly with a heave, and covers the sand in silence. A lonesome and a horrid retreat, I can tell you! No boat ever ventures into this bay. No children from our fishing-village, called Cobb\u2019s Hole, ever come here to play. The very birds of the air, as it seems to me, give the Shivering Sand a wide berth. That a young woman, with dozens of nice walks to choose from, and company to go with her, if she only said \u201cCome!\u201d, should prefer this place, and should sit and work or read in it, all alone, when it\u2019s her turn out, I grant you, passes belief."}, {"size": 727, "text": "It\u2019s true, nevertheless, account for it as you may, that this was Rosanna Spearman\u2019s favourite walk, except when she went once or twice to Cobb\u2019s Hole, to see the only friend she had in our neighbourhood, of whom more anon. It\u2019s also true that I was now setting out for this same place, to fetch the girl in to dinner, which brings us round happily to our former point, and starts us fair again on our way to the sands. I saw no sign of the girl in the plantation. When I got out, through the sandhills, on to the beach, there she was, in her little straw bonnet, and her plain grey cloak that she always wore to hide her deformed shoulder as much as might be\u2014there she was, all alone, looking out on the quicksand and the sea."}, {"size": 694, "text": "She started when I came up with her, and turned her head away from me.

The day before, Rosanna had taken out a spot for me on the lappet of my coat, with a new composition, warranted to remove anything. The grease was gone, but there was a little dull place left on the nap of the cloth where the grease had been.

He had deposited the Moonstone in the bank\u2014describing it merely as a valuable of great price\u2014and he had got the receipt for it safe in his pocket. I went downstairs, feeling that this was rather a flat ending, after all our excitement about the Diamond earlier in the day. How the meeting between Mr. Franklin and his aunt and cousin went off, is more than I can tell you."}, {"size": 608, "text": "I would have given something to have waited at table that day. But, in my position in the household, waiting at dinner (except on high family festivals) was letting down my dignity in the eyes of the other servants\u2014a thing which my lady considered me quite prone enough to do already, without seeking occasions for it. The news brought to me from the upper regions, that evening, came from Penelope and the footman.

Later in the evening, we heard them singing and playing duets, Mr. Franklin piping high, Miss Rachel piping higher, and my lady, on the piano, following them as it were over hedge and ditch, and seeing them safe through it in a manner most wonderful and pleasant to hear through the open windows, on the terrace at night."}, {"size": 640, "text": "Later still, I went to Mr. Franklin in the smoking-room, with the soda water and brandy, and found that Miss Rachel had put the Diamond clean out of his head. \u201cShe\u2019s the most charming girl I have seen since I came back to England!\u201d was all I could extract from him, when I endeavoured to lead the conversation to more serious things. Towards midnight, I went round the house to lock up, accompanied by my second in command (Samuel, the footman), as usual. When all the doors were made fast, except the side door that opened on the terrace, I sent Samuel to bed, and stepped out for a breath of fresh air before I too went to bed in my turn."}, {"size": 687, "text": "The night was still and close, and the moon was at the full in the heavens. It was so silent out of doors, that I heard from time to time, very faint and low, the fall of the sea, as the ground-swell heaved it in on the sand-bank near the mouth of our little bay. As the house stood, the terrace side was the dark side; but the broad moonlight showed fair on the gravel walk that ran along the next side to the terrace. Looking this way, after looking up at the sky, I saw the shadow of a person in the moonlight thrown forward from behind the corner of the house. Being old and sly, I forbore to call out; but being also, unfortunately, old and heavy, my feet betrayed me on the gravel."}, {"size": 655, "text": "Before I could steal suddenly round the corner, as I had proposed, I heard lighter feet than mine\u2014and more than one pair of them as I thought\u2014retreating in a hurry. By the time I had got to the corner, the trespassers, whoever they were, had run into the shrubbery at the off side of the walk, and were hidden from sight among the thick trees and bushes in that part of the grounds. From the shrubbery, they could easily make their way, over our fence into the road. If I had been forty years younger, I might have had a chance of catching them before they got clear of our premises. As it was, I went back to set a-going a younger pair of legs than mine."}, {"size": 839, "text": "Without disturbing anybody, Samuel and I got a couple of guns, and went all round the house and through the shrubbery. Having made sure that no persons were lurking about anywhere in our grounds, we turned back.

Picking the object up, I discovered it was a small bottle, containing a thick sweet-smelling liquor, as black as ink. I said nothing to Samuel. But, remembering what Penelope had told me about the jugglers, and the pouring of the little pool of ink into the palm of the boy\u2019s hand, I instantly suspected that I had disturbed the three Indians, lurking about the house, and bent, in their heathenish way, on discovering the whereabouts of the Diamond that night."}, {"size": 794, "text": "Here, for one moment, I find it necessary to call a halt.On summoning up my own recollections\u2014and on getting Penelope to help me, by consulting her journal\u2014I find that we may pass pretty rapidly over the interval between Mr. Franklin Blake\u2019s arrival and Miss Rachel\u2019s birthday. For the greater part of that time the days passed, and brought nothing with them worth recording. With your good leave, then, and with Penelope\u2019s help, I shall notice certain dates only in this place; reserving to myself to tell the story day by day, once more, as soon as we get to the time when the business of the Moonstone became the chief business of everybody in our house. This said, we may now go on again\u2014beginning, of course, with the bottle of sweet-smelling ink which I found on the gravel walk at night."}, {"size": 715, "text": "On the next morning (the morning of the twenty-sixth) I showed Mr. Franklin this article of jugglery, and told him what I have already told you. His opinion was, not only that the Indians had been lurking about after the Diamond, but also that they were actually foolish enough to believe in their own magic\u2014meaning thereby the making of signs on a boy\u2019s head, and the pouring of ink into a boy\u2019s hand, and then expecting him to see persons and things beyond the reach of human vision.

On the twenty-ninth of the month, Miss Rachel and Mr. Franklin hit on a new method of working their way together through the time which might otherwise have hung heavy on their hands. There are reasons for taking particular notice here of the occupation that amused them. You will find it has a bearing on something that is still to come. Gentlefolks in general have a very awkward rock ahead in life\u2014the rock ahead of their own idleness. Their lives being, for the most part, passed in looking about them for something to do, it is curious to see\u2014especially when their tastes are of what is called the intellectual sort\u2014how often they drift blindfold into some nasty pursuit."}, {"size": 837, "text": "Nine times out of ten they take to torturing something, or to spoiling something\u2014and they firmly believe they are improving their minds, when the plain truth is, they are only making a mess in the house.

You see my young master, or my young mistress, poring over one of their spiders\u2019 insides with a magnifying-glass; or you meet one of their frogs walking downstairs without his head\u2014and when you wonder what this cruel nastiness means, you are told that it means a taste in my young master or my young mistress for natural history."}, {"size": 659, "text": "Sometimes, again, you see them occupied for hours together in spoiling a pretty flower with pointed instruments, out of a stupid curiosity to know what the flower is made of. Is its colour any prettier, or its scent any sweeter, when you _do_ know? But there! the poor souls must get through the time, you see\u2014they must get through the time. You dabbled in nasty mud, and made pies, when you were a child; and you dabble in nasty science, and dissect spiders, and spoil flowers, when you grow up. In the one case and in the other, the secret of it is, that you have got nothing to think of in your poor empty head, and nothing to do with your poor idle hands."}, {"size": 642, "text": "And so it ends in your spoiling canvas with paints, and making a smell in the house; or in keeping tadpoles in a glass box full of dirty water, and turning everybody\u2019s stomach in the house; or in chipping off bits of stone here, there, and everywhere, and dropping grit into all the victuals in the house; or in staining your fingers in the pursuit of photography, and doing justice without mercy on everybody\u2019s face in the house.

As for Mr. Franklin and Miss Rachel, they tortured nothing, I am glad to say. They simply confined themselves to making a mess; and all they spoilt, to do them justice, was the panelling of a door. Mr. Franklin\u2019s universal genius, dabbling in everything, dabbled in what he called \u201cdecorative painting.\u201d He had invented, he informed us, a new mixture to moisten paint with, which he described as a \u201cvehicle.\u201d What it was made of, I don\u2019t know."}, {"size": 757, "text": "What it did, I can tell you in two words\u2014it stank.

When they were not riding, or seeing company, or taking their meals, or piping their songs, there they were with their heads together, as busy as bees, spoiling the door.

Seeing the pleasure which Mr. Franklin and Miss Rachel took in each other\u2019s society, and noting what a pretty match they were in all personal respects, we naturally speculated on the chance of their putting their heads together with other objects in view besides the ornamenting of a door."}, {"size": 619, "text": "Some of us said there would be a wedding in the house before the summer was over. Others (led by me) admitted it was likely enough Miss Rachel might be married; but we doubted (for reasons which will presently appear) whether her bridegroom would be Mr. Franklin Blake.

To see her sit down, to see her get up, and specially to see her walk, was enough to satisfy any man in his senses that the graces of her figure (if you will pardon me the expression) were in her flesh and not in her clothes. Her hair was the blackest I ever saw. Her eyes matched her hair."}, {"size": 765, "text": "Her nose was not quite large enough, I admit. Her mouth and chin were (to quote Mr. Franklin) morsels for the gods; and her complexion (on the same undeniable authority) was as warm as the sun itself, with this great advantage over the sun, that it was always in nice order to look at. Add to the foregoing that she carried her head as upright as a dart, in a dashing, spirited, thoroughbred way\u2014that she had a clear voice, with a ring of the right metal in it, and a smile that began very prettily in her eyes before it got to her lips\u2014and there behold the portrait of her, to the best of my painting, as large as life!

She was unlike most other girls of her age, in this\u2014that she had ideas of her own, and was stiff-necked enough to set the fashions themselves at defiance, if the fashions didn\u2019t suit her views. In trifles, this independence of hers was all well enough; but in matters of importance, it carried her (as my lady thought, and as I thought) too far. She judged for herself, as few women of twice her age judge in general; never asked your advice; never told you beforehand what she was going to do; never came with secrets and confidences to anybody, from her mother downwards."}, {"size": 773, "text": "In little things and great, with people she loved, and people she hated (and she did both with equal heartiness), Miss Rachel always went on a way of her own, sufficient for herself in the joys and sorrows of her life.

With all her secrecy, and self-will, there was not so much as the shadow of anything false in her. I never remember her breaking her word; I never remember her saying No, and meaning Yes.

On June the twelfth, an invitation from my mistress was sent to a gentleman in London, to come and help to keep Miss Rachel\u2019s birthday. This was the fortunate individual on whom I believed her heart to be privately set! Like Mr. Franklin, he was a cousin of hers.

There was terrible work in the family when the Honourable Caroline insisted on marrying plain Mr. Ablewhite, the banker at Frizinghall. He was very rich and very respectable, and he begot a prodigious large family\u2014all in his favour, so far.

That\u2019s the modern way of looking at it\u2014and I keep up with the modern way. The Ablewhites lived in a fine house and grounds, a little out of Frizinghall. Very worthy people, and greatly respected in the neighbourhood. We shall not be much troubled with them in these pages\u2014excepting Mr. Godfrey, who was Mr. Ablewhite\u2019s second son, and who must take his proper place here, if you please, for Miss Rachel\u2019s sake.

But why do I try to give you this personal description of him? If you ever subscribed to a Ladies\u2019 Charity in London, you know Mr. Godfrey Ablewhite as well as I do.

The gentleman did it, with a handkerchief and a glass of water. Crowds at the performance with the legs. Ditto at the performance with the tongue. And with all this, the sweetest tempered person (I allude to Mr. Godfrey)\u2014the simplest and pleasantest and easiest to please\u2014you ever met with. He loved everybody.

My girl was sure (from signs and tokens which I need not trouble you with) that her young mistress had fought Mr. Franklin off by declining to believe that he was in earnest, and had then secretly regretted treating him in that way afterwards. Though Penelope was admitted to more familiarity with her young mistress than maids generally are\u2014for the two had been almost brought up together as children\u2014still I knew Miss Rachel\u2019s reserved character too well to believe that she would show her mind to anybody in this way."}, {"size": 827, "text": "What my daughter told me, on the present occasion, was, as I suspected, more what she wished than what she really knew.

This poor girl\u2014who had puzzled me, as you know already, at the Shivering Sand\u2014puzzled me more than once again, in the interval time of which I am now writing. Penelope\u2019s notion that her fellow-servant was in love with Mr. Franklin (which my daughter, by my orders, kept strictly secret) seemed to be just as absurd as ever.

The poor thing\u2019s appetite, never much, fell away dreadfully; and her eyes in the morning showed plain signs of waking and crying at night. One day Penelope made an awkward discovery, which we hushed up on the spot. She caught Rosanna at Mr. Franklin\u2019s dressing-table, secretly removing a rose which Miss Rachel had given him to wear in his button-hole, and putting another rose like it, of her own picking, in its place. She was, after that, once or twice impudent to me, when I gave her a well-meant general hint to be careful in her conduct; and, worse still, she was not over-respectful now, on the few occasions when Miss Rachel accidentally spoke to her."}, {"size": 606, "text": "My lady noticed the change, and asked me what I thought about it.

Before it is delivered, my speech (like the Queen\u2019s) is looked for as eagerly as if nothing of the kind had ever been heard before.

That was my view of the matter; and, twist and turn it as he might, he was forced in the end to make it his view too. We arranged that he was to ride over, after lunch, to Frizinghall, and bring the Diamond back, with Mr. Godfrey and the two young ladies, in all probability, to keep him company on the way home again.

If I add that Penelope ended her part of the morning\u2019s work by being sick in the back-kitchen, it is in no unfriendly spirit towards the vehicle. No! no!

A whiff of\u2014you know what, and a turn at a certain book which I have had occasion to mention in these pages, composed me, body and mind. I was aroused from what I am inclined to think must have been, not a nap, but a reverie, by the clatter of horses\u2019 hoofs outside; and, going to the door, received a cavalcade comprising Mr. Franklin and his three cousins, escorted by one of old Mr. Ablewhite\u2019s grooms."}, {"size": 716, "text": "Mr. Godfrey struck me, strangely enough, as being like Mr. Franklin in this respect\u2014that he did not seem to be in his customary spirits.

Crossing the hall, about half an hour afterwards, I was brought to a sudden standstill by an outbreak of screams from the small drawing-room.

It was plain enough that she was posed by the same difficulty which had posed Mr. Franklin and me in our conference at the Shivering Sand.

Lord bless us! it _was_ a Diamond! As large, or nearly, as a plover\u2019s egg! The light that streamed from it was like the light of the harvest moon.

It was without any setting when it had been placed in her hands; but that universal genius, Mr. Franklin, had contrived, with the help of his neat fingers and a little bit of silver wire, to fix it as a brooch in the bosom of her white dress.

In his medical practice he was a more prudent man; picking up his discretion (as his enemies said) by a kind of instinct, and proving to be generally right where more carefully conducted doctors turned out to be wrong.

Reaching these conclusions, I looked in on them, casually as it might be, in the servants\u2019 hall, and, finding tea going forward, instantly invited myself to that meal.

She bought nothing whatever at any of the other drapers\u2019 shops, or at any milliners\u2019 or tailors\u2019 shops; and she bought nothing at Maltby\u2019s but a piece of long cloth. She was very particular in choosing a certain quality. As to quantity, she bought enough to make a nightgown.\u201d \u201cWhose nightgown?\u201d I asked. \u201cHer own, to be sure.

Still keeping silence, he looked again at me; and then he looked out at the waters before us, heaving in deeper and deeper over the quicksand.

I thought this curious\u2014but I attributed it mainly to some clumsiness on the Superintendent\u2019s part which might have offended the young lady.

My sacred regard for truth is (thank God) far above my respect for persons. It will be easy for Mr. Blake to suppress what may not prove to be sufficiently flattering in these pages to the person chiefly concerned in them. He has purchased my time, but not even _his_ wealth can purchase my conscience too.*"}, {"size": 618, "text": "[*Note. _Added by Franklin Blake._\u2014Miss Clack may make her mind quite easy on this point.

The person who answered the door, informed me that my aunt and her daughter (I really cannot call her my cousin!) had arrived from the country a week since, and meditated making some stay in London. I sent up a message at once, declining to disturb them, and only begging to know whether I could be of any use.The person who answered the door, took my message in insolent silence, and left me standing in the hall."}, {"size": 804, "text": "She is the daughter of a heathen old man named Betteredge\u2014long, too long, tolerated in my aunt\u2019s family.

The hall was dirty, and the chair was hard; but the blessed consciousness of returning good for evil raised me quite above any trifling considerations of that kind. The tract was one of a series addressed to young women on the sinfulness of dress. In style it was devoutly familiar. Its title was, \u201cA Word With You On Your Cap-Ribbons.\u201d \u201cMy lady is much obliged, and begs you will come and lunch tomorrow at two.\u201d I passed over the manner in which she gave her message, and the dreadful boldness of her look."}, {"size": 643, "text": "I thanked this young castaway; and I said, in a tone of Christian interest, \u201cWill you favour me by accepting a tract?\u201d She looked at the title. \u201cIs it written by a man or a woman, Miss? If it\u2019s written by a woman, I had rather not read it on that account. If it\u2019s written by a man, I beg to inform him that he knows nothing about it.\u201d She handed me back the tract, and opened the door. We must sow the good seed somehow.

On the previous Friday, two gentlemen\u2014occupying widely-different positions in society\u2014had been the victims of an outrage which had startled all London. One of the gentlemen was Mr. Septimus Luker, of Lambeth.

What does matter is a circumstance that occurred when Mr. Godfrey had transacted his business. On gaining the door, he encountered a gentleman\u2014a perfect stranger to him\u2014who was accidentally leaving the office exactly at the same time as himself. A momentary contest of politeness ensued between them as to who should be the first to pass through the door of the bank."}, {"size": 604, "text": "The stranger insisted on making Mr. Godfrey precede him; Mr. Godfrey said a few civil words; they bowed, and parted in the street.

Merely premising that the polite stranger was Mr. Luker, of Lambeth, we will now follow Mr. Godfrey home to his residence at Kilburn. He found waiting for him, in the hall, a poorly clad but delicate and interesting-looking little boy. The boy handed him a letter, merely mentioning that he had been entrusted with it by an old lady whom he did not know, and who had given him no instructions to wait for an answer. Such incidents as these were not uncommon in Mr. Godfrey\u2019s large experience as a promoter of public charities. He let the boy go, and opened the letter."}, {"size": 665, "text": "The handwriting was entirely unfamiliar to him. It requested his attendance, within an hour\u2019s time, at a house in Northumberland Street, Strand, which he had never had occasion to enter before. The object sought was to obtain from the worthy manager certain details on the subject of the Mothers\u2019-Small-Clothes-Conversion-Society, and the information was wanted by an elderly lady who proposed adding largely to the resources of the charity, if her questions were met by satisfactory replies. She mentioned her name, and she added that the shortness of her stay in London prevented her from giving any longer notice to the eminent philanthropist whom she addressed."}, {"size": 702, "text": "Ordinary people might have hesitated before setting aside their own engagements to suit the convenience of a stranger. The Christian Hero never hesitates where good is to be done. Mr. Godfrey instantly turned back, and proceeded to the house in Northumberland Street. A most respectable though somewhat corpulent man answered the door, and, on hearing Mr. Godfrey\u2019s name, immediately conducted him into an empty apartment at the back, on the drawing-room floor. He noticed two unusual things on entering the room. One of them was a faint odour of musk and camphor. The other was an ancient Oriental manuscript, richly illuminated with Indian figures and devices, that lay open to inspection on a table."}, {"size": 640, "text": "He was looking at the book, the position of which caused him to stand with his back turned towards the closed folding doors communicating with the front room, when, without the slightest previous noise to warn him, he felt himself suddenly seized round the neck from behind. He had just time to notice that the arm round his neck was naked and of a tawny-brown colour, before his eyes were bandaged, his mouth was gagged, and he was thrown helpless on the floor by (as he judged) two men. A third rifled his pockets, and\u2014if, as a lady, I may venture to use such an expression\u2014searched him, without ceremony, through and through to his skin."}, {"size": 758, "text": "Here I should greatly enjoy saying a few cheering words on the devout confidence which could alone have sustained Mr. Godfrey in an emergency so terrible as this. Perhaps, however, the position and appearance of my admirable friend at the culminating period of the outrage (as above described) are hardly within the proper limits of female discussion. Let me pass over the next few moments, and return to Mr. Godfrey at the time when the odious search of his person had been completed. The outrage had been perpetrated throughout in dead silence. At the end of it some words were exchanged, among the invisible wretches, in a language which he did not understand, but in tones which were plainly expressive (to his cultivated ear) of disappointment and rage."}, {"size": 788, "text": "He was suddenly lifted from the ground, placed in a chair, and bound there hand and foot. The next moment he felt the air flowing in from the open door, listened, and concluded that he was alone again in the room.

A man\u2019s voice below exclaimed \u201cHullo!\u201d A man\u2019s feet ascended the stairs. Mr. Godfrey felt Christian fingers unfastening his bandage, and extracting his gag. He looked in amazement at two respectable strangers, and faintly articulated, \u201cWhat does it mean?\u201d The two respectable strangers looked back, and said, \u201cExactly the question we were going to ask _you_.\u201d The inevitable explanation followed."}, {"size": 694, "text": "No! Let me be scrupulously particular. Sal volatile and water followed, to compose dear Mr. Godfrey\u2019s nerves. The explanation came next. It appeared from the statement of the landlord and landlady of the house (persons of good repute in the neighbourhood), that their first and second floor apartments had been engaged, on the previous day, for a week certain, by a most respectable-looking gentleman\u2014the same who has been already described as answering the door to Mr. Godfrey\u2019s knock. The gentleman had paid the week\u2019s rent and all the week\u2019s extras in advance, stating that the apartments were wanted for three Oriental noblemen, friends of his, who were visiting England for the first time."}, {"size": 722, "text": "Early on the morning of the outrage, two of the Oriental strangers, accompanied by their respectable English friend, took possession of the apartments. The third was expected to join them shortly; and the luggage (reported as very bulky) was announced to follow when it had passed through the Custom-house, late in the afternoon. Not more than ten minutes previous to Mr. Godfrey\u2019s visit, the third foreigner had arrived. Nothing out of the common had happened, to the knowledge of the landlord and landlady downstairs, until within the last five minutes\u2014when they had seen the three foreigners, accompanied by their respectable English friend, all leave the house together, walking quietly in the direction of the Strand."}, {"size": 800, "text": "Remembering that a visitor had called, and not having seen the visitor also leave the house, the landlady had thought it rather strange that the gentleman should be left by himself upstairs. After a short discussion with her husband, she had considered it advisable to ascertain whether anything was wrong. The result had followed, as I have already attempted to describe it; and there the explanation of the landlord and the landlady came to an end. An investigation was next made in the room. Dear Mr. Godfrey\u2019s property was found scattered in all directions. When the articles were collected, however, nothing was missing; his watch, chain, purse, keys, pocket-handkerchief, note-book, and all his loose papers had been closely examined, and had then been left unharmed to be resumed by the owner."}, {"size": 702, "text": "In the same way, not the smallest morsel of property belonging to the proprietors of the house had been abstracted. The Oriental noblemen had removed their own illuminated manuscript, and had removed nothing else. What did it mean? Taking the worldly point of view, it appeared to mean that Mr. Godfrey had been the victim of some incomprehensible error, committed by certain unknown men. A dark conspiracy was on foot in the midst of us; and our beloved and innocent friend had been entangled in its meshes. When the Christian hero of a hundred charitable victories plunges into a pitfall that has been dug for him by mistake, oh, what a warning it is to the rest of us to be unceasingly on our guard!"}, {"size": 726, "text": "How soon may our own evil passions prove to be Oriental noblemen who pounce on us unawares!

We must leave Mr. Godfrey to recover in Northumberland Street, and must follow the proceedings of Mr. Luker at a later period of the day. After leaving the bank, Mr. Luker had visited various parts of London on business errands. Returning to his own residence, he found a letter waiting for him, which was described as having been left a short time previously by a boy."}, {"size": 746, "text": "In this case, as in Mr. Godfrey\u2019s case, the handwriting was strange; but the name mentioned was the name of one of Mr. Luker\u2019s customers. His correspondent announced (writing in the third person\u2014apparently by the hand of a deputy) that he had been unexpectedly summoned to London. He had just established himself in lodgings in Alfred Place, Tottenham Court Road; and he desired to see Mr. Luker immediately, on the subject of a purchase which he contemplated making. The gentleman was an enthusiastic collector of Oriental antiquities, and had been for many years a liberal patron of the establishment in Lambeth. Oh, when shall we wean ourselves from the worship of Mammon! Mr. Luker called a cab, and drove off instantly to his liberal patron."}, {"size": 654, "text": "Exactly what had happened to Mr. Godfrey in Northumberland Street now happened to Mr. Luker in Alfred Place. Once more the respectable man answered the door, and showed the visitor upstairs into the back drawing-room. There, again, lay the illuminated manuscript on a table. Mr. Luker\u2019s attention was absorbed, as Mr. Godfrey\u2019s attention had been absorbed, by this beautiful work of Indian art. He too was aroused from his studies by a tawny naked arm round his throat, by a bandage over his eyes, and by a gag in his mouth. He too was thrown prostrate and searched to the skin. A longer interval had then elapsed than had passed in the experience of Mr."}, {"size": 612, "text": "Godfrey; but it had ended as before, in the persons of the house suspecting something wrong, and going upstairs to see what had happened. Precisely the same explanation which the landlord in Northumberland Street had given to Mr. Godfrey, the landlord in Alfred Place now gave to Mr. Luker. Both had been imposed on in the same way by the plausible address and well-filled purse of the respectable stranger, who introduced himself as acting for his foreign friends. The one point of difference between the two cases occurred when the scattered contents of Mr. Luker\u2019s pockets were being collected from the floor."}, {"size": 607, "text": "His watch and purse were safe, but (less fortunate than Mr. Godfrey) one of the loose papers that he carried about him had been taken away. The paper in question acknowledged the receipt of a valuable of great price which Mr. Luker had that day left in the care of his bankers. This document would be useless for purposes of fraud, inasmuch as it provided that the valuable should only be given up on the personal application of the owner. As soon as he recovered himself, Mr. Luker hurried to the bank, on the chance that the thieves who had robbed him might ignorantly present themselves with the receipt."}, {"size": 690, "text": "Nothing had been seen of them when he arrived at the establishment, and nothing was seen of them afterwards. Their respectable English friend had (in the opinion of the bankers) looked the receipt over before they attempted to make use of it, and had given them the necessary warning in good time. Information of both outrages was communicated to the police, and the needful investigations were pursued, I believe, with great energy. The authorities held that a robbery had been planned, on insufficient information received by the thieves. They had been plainly not sure whether Mr. Luker had, or had not, trusted the transmission of his precious gem to another person; and poor polite Mr."}, {"size": 642, "text": "Godfrey had paid the penalty of having been seen accidentally speaking to him. Add to this, that Mr. Godfrey\u2019s absence from our Monday evening meeting had been occasioned by a consultation of the authorities, at which he was requested to assist\u2014and all the explanations required being now given, I may proceed with the simpler story of my own little personal experiences in Montagu Square. I was punctual to the luncheon hour on Tuesday. Reference to my diary shows this to have been a chequered day\u2014much in it to be devoutly regretted, much in it to be devoutly thankful for. Dear Aunt Verinder received me with her usual grace and kindness."}, {"size": 671, "text": "But I noticed, after a little while, that something was wrong.

On this occasion, however, she not only disappointed\u2014she really shocked me. There was an absence of all lady-like restraint in her language and manner most painful to see. She was possessed by some feverish excitement which made her distressingly loud when she laughed, and sinfully wasteful and capricious in what she ate and drank at lunch."}, {"size": 618, "text": "I felt deeply for her poor mother, even before the true state of the case had been confidentially made known to me.

I am dying for more news of him, after his adventure in Northumberland Street.\u201d She kissed her mother on the forehead, and looked my way. \u201cGood-bye, Clack,\u201d she said, carelessly.

For my own part, knowing Rachel\u2019s spirit to have been essentially unregenerate from her childhood upwards, I was prepared for whatever my aunt could tell me on the subject of her daughter. It might have gone on from bad to worse till it ended in Murder; and I should still have said to myself, The natural result! oh, dear, dear, the natural result!

There was a morning concert advertised for tomorrow, and Samuel was ordered to take places for a large party, including a place for Mr. Ablewhite. \u201cAll the tickets may be gone, Miss,\u201d said this innocent youth, \u201cif I don\u2019t run and get them at once!\u201d He ran as he said the words\u2014and I found myself alone again, with some anxious thoughts to occupy me."}, {"size": 870, "text": "We had a special meeting of the Mothers\u2019-Small-Clothes-Conversion Society that night, summoned expressly with a view to obtaining Mr. Godfrey\u2019s advice and assistance.

The afternoon of the next day had been selected for the Festival of the British-Ladies\u2019-Servants\u2019-Sunday-Sweetheart-Supervision Society. Instead of being present, the life and soul of that struggling Institution, he had engaged to make one of a party of worldlings at a morning concert! I asked myself what did it mean?

Once self-supported by conscience, once embarked on a career of manifest usefulness, the true Christian never yields. Neither public nor private influences produce the slightest effect on us, when we have once got our mission.

The true story of the broken marriage engagement comes first in point of time, and must therefore take the first place in the present narrative.

Lady Verinder exerted her influence to rouse him to a sense of duty in this matter; and I exerted my influence. He admitted the justice of our views\u2014but he went no further than that, until he found himself afflicted with the illness which ultimately brought him to his grave.

Property in land (I purposely abstain from using technical language), and property in money. In the majority of cases, I am afraid I should have felt it my duty to my client to ask him to reconsider his Will. In the case of Sir John, I knew Lady Verinder to be, not only worthy of the unreserved trust which her husband had placed in her (all good wives are worthy of"}, {"size": 652, "text": "that)\u2014but to be also capable of properly administering a trust (which, in my experience of the fair sex, not one in a thousand of them is competent to do).

Lady Verinder amply justified the confidence which her husband had placed in her. In the first days of her widowhood, she sent for me, and made her Will.

My responsibility began and ended with shaping her instructions into the proper legal form."}, {"size": 624, "text": "Before Sir John had been a fortnight in his grave, the future of his daughter had been most wisely and most affectionately provided for.

At the date I have mentioned, the doctors pronounced the sentence on poor Lady Verinder, which was literally a sentence of death.

On Lady Verinder\u2019s death, the Will was placed in the hands of my proctor to be \u201cproved\u201d (as the phrase is) in the usual way.

Lady Verinder\u2019s Will has been asked for, and examined, already!\u201d This was news indeed!

My name was unfortunately too well known on such documents: he failed to negotiate it.

She knew me better of course than to take the Frenchman\u2019s view of the transaction.

He has failed to do that; and the purpose of the experiment is defeated accordingly. I can\u2019t assert that I am not disappointed at the result\u2014but I can honestly say that I am not surprised by it.

We all went upstairs, at once, to the top story."}, {"size": 626, "text": "I noticed that the Sergeant was unusually grave, even for _him_. It also struck me as odd that he told the boy (after having previously encouraged him to follow us), to wait in the room below till we came down again. The carpenter\u2019s hammer and chisel disposed of the resistance of the door in a few minutes. But some article of furniture had been placed against it inside, as a barricade. By pushing at the door, we thrust this obstacle aside, and so got admission to the room. The landlord entered first; the Sergeant second; and I third. The other persons present followed us. We all looked towards the bed, and all started."}, {"size": 625, "text": "The man had not left the room. He lay, dressed, on the bed\u2014with a white pillow over his face, which completely hid it from view. \u201cWhat does that mean?\u201d said the landlord, pointing to the pillow. Sergeant Cuff led the way to the bed, without answering, and removed the pillow. The man\u2019s swarthy face was placid and still; his black hair and beard were slightly, very slightly, discomposed. His eyes stared wide-open, glassy and vacant, at the ceiling. The filmy look and the fixed expression of them horrified me. I turned away, and went to the open window.

Some strange fascination seemed to hold Sergeant Cuff to the bed. Some strange curiosity seemed to keep the rest of them waiting, to see what the Sergeant would do next. I turned again to the window. The moment afterwards, I felt a soft pull at my coat-tails, and a small voice whispered, \u201cLook here, sir!\u201d Gooseberry had followed us into the room. His loose eyes rolled frightfully\u2014not in terror, but in exultation. He had made a detective-discovery on his own account."}, {"size": 630, "text": "\u201cLook here, sir,\u201d he repeated\u2014and led me to a table in the corner of the room. On the table stood a little wooden box, open, and empty. On one side of the box lay some jewellers\u2019 cotton. On the other side, was a torn sheet of white paper, with a seal on it, partly destroyed, and with an inscription in writing, which was still perfectly legible. The inscription was in these words: \u201cDeposited with Messrs. Bushe, Lysaught, and Bushe, by Mr. Septimus Luker, of Middlesex Place, Lambeth, a small wooden box, sealed up in this envelope, and containing a valuable of great price.

Gooseberry had not done with me yet. \u201cRobbery!\u201d whispered the boy, pointing, in high delight, to the empty box. \u201cYou were told to wait downstairs,\u201d I said. \u201cGo away!\u201d \u201cAnd Murder!\u201d added Gooseberry, pointing, with a keener relish still, to the man on the bed.

To Franklin Blake, Esq. Sir,\u2014I beg to apologise for the delay that has occurred in the production of the Report, with which I engaged to furnish you. I have waited to make it a complete Report; and I have been met, here and there, by obstacles which it was only possible to remove by some little expenditure of patience and time."}, {"size": 772, "text": "The object which I proposed to myself has now, I hope, been attained. You will find, in these pages, answers to the greater part\u2014if not all\u2014of the questions, concerning the late Mr. Godfrey Ablewhite, which occurred to your mind when I last had the honour of seeing you. I propose to tell you\u2014in the first place\u2014what is known of the manner in which your cousin met his death; appending to the statement such inferences and conclusions as we are justified (according to my opinion) in drawing from the facts. I shall then endeavour\u2014in the second place\u2014to put you in possession of such discoveries as I have made, respecting the proceedings of Mr. Godfrey Ablewhite, before, during and after the time, when you and he met as guests at the late Lady Verinder\u2019s country house."}, {"size": 700, "text": "As to your cousin\u2019s death, then, first. It appears to be established, beyond any reasonable doubt, that he was killed (while he was asleep, or immediately on his waking) by being smothered with a pillow from his bed\u2014that the persons guilty of murdering him are the three Indians\u2014and that the object contemplated (and achieved) by the crime, was to obtain possession of the diamond, called the Moonstone. The facts from which this conclusion is drawn, are derived partly from an examination of the room at the tavern; and partly from the evidence obtained at the Coroner\u2019s Inquest. On forcing the door of the room, the deceased gentleman was discovered, dead, with the pillow of the bed over his face."}, {"size": 604, "text": "The medical man who examined him, being informed of this circumstance, considered the post-mortem appearances as being perfectly compatible with murder by smothering\u2014that is to say, with murder committed by some person, or persons, pressing the pillow over the nose and mouth of the deceased, until death resulted from congestion of the lungs. Next, as to the motive for the crime. A small box, with a sealed paper torn off from it (the paper containing an inscription) was found open, and empty, on a table in the room. Mr. Luker has himself personally identified the box, the seal, and the inscription."}, {"size": 759, "text": "He has declared that the box did actually contain the diamond, called the Moonstone; and he has admitted having given the box (thus sealed up) to Mr. Godfrey Ablewhite (then concealed under a disguise), on the afternoon of the twenty-sixth of June last. The fair inference from all this is, that the stealing of the Moonstone was the motive of the crime. Next, as to the manner in which the crime was committed. On examination of the room (which is only seven feet high), a trap-door in the ceiling, leading out on to the roof of the house, was discovered open. The short ladder, used for obtaining access to the trap-door (and kept under the bed), was found placed at the opening, so as to enable any person or persons, in the room, to leave it again easily."}, {"size": 752, "text": "In the trap-door itself was found a square aperture cut in the wood, apparently with some exceedingly sharp instrument, just behind the bolt which fastened the door on the inner side. In this way, any person from the outside could have drawn back the bolt, and opened the door, and have dropped (or have been noiselessly lowered by an accomplice) into the room\u2014its height, as already observed, being only seven feet. That some person, or persons, must have got admission in this way, appears evident from the fact of the aperture being there. As to the manner in which he (or they) obtained access to the roof of the tavern, it is to be remarked that the third house, lower down in the street, was empty, and under repair\u2014that a long ladder was left by"}, {"size": 681, "text": "the workmen, leading from the pavement to the top of the house\u2014and that, on returning to their work, on the morning of the 27th, the men found the plank which they had tied to the ladder, to prevent anyone from using it in their absence, removed, and lying on the ground. As to the possibility of ascending by this ladder, passing over the roofs of the houses, passing back, and descending again, unobserved\u2014it is discovered, on the evidence of the night policeman, that he only passes through Shore Lane twice in an hour, when out on his beat. The testimony of the inhabitants also declares, that Shore Lane, after midnight, is one of the quietest and loneliest streets in London."}, {"size": 614, "text": "Here again, therefore, it seems fair to infer that\u2014with ordinary caution, and presence of mind\u2014any man, or men, might have ascended by the ladder, and might have descended again, unobserved. Once on the roof of the tavern, it has been proved, by experiment, that a man might cut through the trap-door, while lying down on it, and that in such a position, the parapet in front of the house would conceal him from the view of anyone passing in the street. Lastly, as to the person, or persons, by whom the crime was committed. It is known (1) that the Indians had an interest in possessing themselves of the Diamond."}, {"size": 691, "text": "(2) It is at least probable that the man looking like an Indian, whom Octavius Guy saw at the window of the cab, speaking to the man dressed like a mechanic, was one of the three Hindoo conspirators. (3) It is certain that this same man dressed like a mechanic, was seen keeping Mr. Godfrey Ablewhite in view, all through the evening of the 26th, and was found in the bedroom (before Mr. Ablewhite was shown into it) under circumstances which lead to the suspicion that he was examining the room. (4) A morsel of torn gold thread was picked up in the bedroom, which persons expert in such matters, declare to be of Indian manufacture, and to be a species of gold thread not known in England."}, {"size": 683, "text": "(5) On the morning of the 27th, three men, answering to the description of the three Indians, were observed in Lower Thames Street, were traced to the Tower Wharf, and were seen to leave London by the steamer bound for Rotterdam. There is here, moral, if not legal, evidence, that the murder was committed by the Indians. Whether the man personating a mechanic was, or was not, an accomplice in the crime, it is impossible to say. That he could have committed the murder alone, seems beyond the limits of probability. Acting by himself, he could hardly have smothered Mr. Ablewhite\u2014who was the taller and stronger man of the two\u2014without a struggle taking place, or a cry being heard."}, {"size": 627, "text": "A servant girl, sleeping in the next room, heard nothing. The landlord, sleeping in the room below, heard nothing. The whole evidence points to the inference that more than one man was concerned in this crime\u2014and the circumstances, I repeat, morally justify the conclusion that the Indians committed it. I have only to add, that the verdict at the Coroner\u2019s Inquest was Wilful Murder against some person, or persons, unknown. Mr. Ablewhite\u2019s family have offered a reward, and no effort has been left untried to discover the guilty persons. The man dressed like a mechanic has eluded all inquiries. The Indians have been traced."}, {"size": 395, "text": "As to the prospect of ultimately capturing these last, I shall have a word to say to you on that head, when I reach the end of the present Report. In the meanwhile, having now written all that is needful on the subject of Mr. Godfrey Ablewhite\u2019s death, I may pass next to the narrative of his proceedings before, during, and after the time, when you and he met at the late Lady Verinder\u2019s house."}, {"size": 681, "text": "With regard to the subject now in hand, I may state, at the outset, that Mr. Godfrey Ablewhite\u2019s life had two sides to it. The side turned up to the public view, presented the spectacle of a gentleman, possessed of considerable reputation as a speaker at charitable meetings, and endowed with administrative abilities, which he placed at the disposal of various Benevolent Societies, mostly of the female sort. The side kept hidden from the general notice, exhibited this same gentleman in the totally different character of a man of pleasure, with a villa in the suburbs which was not taken in his own name, and with a lady in the villa, who was not taken in his own name, either."}, {"size": 689, "text": "My investigations in the villa have shown me several fine pictures and statues; furniture tastefully selected, and admirably made; and a conservatory of the rarest flowers, the match of which it would not be easy to find in all London. My investigation of the lady has resulted in the discovery of jewels which are worthy to take rank with the flowers, and of carriages and horses which have (deservedly) produced a sensation in the Park, among persons well qualified to judge of the build of the one, and the breed of the others. All this is, so far, common enough. The villa and the lady are such familiar objects in London life, that I ought to apologise for introducing them to notice."}, {"size": 615, "text": "But what is not common and not familiar (in my experience), is that all these fine things were not only ordered, but paid for. The pictures, the statues, the flowers, the jewels, the carriages, and the horses\u2014inquiry proved, to my indescribable astonishment, that not a sixpence of debt was owing on any of them. As to the villa, it had been bought, out and out, and settled on the lady. I might have tried to find the right reading of this riddle, and tried in vain\u2014but for Mr. Godfrey Ablewhite\u2019s death, which caused an inquiry to be made into the state of his affairs. The inquiry elicited these facts:\u2014 That Mr."}, {"size": 604, "text": "Godfrey Ablewhite was entrusted with the care of a sum of twenty thousand pounds\u2014as one of two Trustees for a young gentleman, who was still a minor in the year eighteen hundred and forty-eight.

We may now advance to the date of Miss Verinder\u2019s birthday (in the year eighteen hundred and forty-eight)\u2014the twenty-first of June. On the day before, Mr. Godfrey Ablewhite arrived at his father\u2019s house, and asked (as I know from Mr. Ablewhite, senior, himself) for a loan of three hundred pounds. Mark the sum; and remember at the same time, that the half-yearly payment to the young gentleman was due on the twenty-fourth of the month."}, {"size": 648, "text": "Also, that the whole of the young gentleman\u2019s fortune had been spent by his Trustee, by the end of the year \u2019forty-seven.

A few hours afterwards, Mr. Godfrey (as you yourself have told me) made a proposal of marriage to Miss Verinder. Here, he saw his way no doubt\u2014if accepted\u2014to the end of all his money anxieties, present and future. But, as events actually turned out, what happened? Miss Verinder refused him. On the night of the birthday, therefore, Mr. Godfrey Ablewhite\u2019s pecuniary position was this."}, {"size": 623, "text": "He had three hundred pounds to find on the twenty-fourth of the month, and twenty thousand pounds to find in February eighteen hundred and fifty. Failing to raise these sums, at these times, he was a ruined man. Under those circumstances, what takes place next?

He was more than surprised, when Mr. Godfrey produced the Moonstone. No such Diamond (according to Mr. Luker\u2019s experience) was in the possession of any private person in Europe. Mr. Godfrey Ablewhite had two modest proposals to make, in relation to this magnificent gem. First, Would Mr. Luker be so good as to buy it? Secondly, Would Mr. Luker (in default of seeing his way to the purchase) undertake to sell it on commission, and to pay a sum down, on the anticipated result?"}, {"size": 631, "text": "Mr. Luker tested the Diamond, weighed the Diamond and estimated the value of the Diamond, before he answered a word. _His_ estimate (allowing for the flaw in the stone) was thirty thousand pounds.

Mr. Godfrey Ablewhite began a story. Mr. Luker opened his lips again, and only said three words, this time. \u201cThat won\u2019t do!\u201d Mr. Godfrey Ablewhite began another story.

He got up, and rang the bell for the servant to show the gentleman out."}, {"size": 716, "text": "Upon this compulsion, Mr. Godfrey made an effort, and came out with a new and amended version of the affair, to the following effect. After privately slipping the laudanum into your brandy and water, he wished you good-night, and went into his own room. It was the next room to yours; and the two had a door of communication between them. On entering his own room Mr. Godfrey (as he supposed) closed his door. His money troubles kept him awake. He sat, in his dressing-gown and slippers, for nearly an hour, thinking over his position. Just as he was preparing to get into bed, he heard you, talking to yourself, in your own room, and going to the door of communication, found that he had not shut it as he supposed."}, {"size": 628, "text": "He looked into your room to see what was the matter.

At the same time, Miss Verinder\u2019s language and conduct showed that she was resolved to say nothing (in mercy to you) on her side.

He put the Moonstone into his pocket."}, {"size": 632, "text": "This was the story told by your cousin (under pressure of necessity) to Mr. Luker. Mr. Luker believed the story to be, as to all main essentials, true\u2014on this ground, that Mr. Godfrey Ablewhite was too great a fool to have invented it. Mr. Bruff and I agree with Mr. Luker, in considering this test of the truth of the story to be a perfectly reliable one. The next question, was the question of what Mr. Luker would do in the matter of the Moonstone. He proposed the following terms, as the only terms on which he would consent to mix himself up with, what was (even in _his_ line of business) a doubtful and dangerous transaction."}, {"size": 664, "text": "Mr. Luker would consent to lend Mr. Godfrey Ablewhite the sum of two thousand pounds, on condition that the Moonstone was to be deposited with him as a pledge. If, at the expiration of one year from that date, Mr. Godfrey Ablewhite paid three thousand pounds to Mr. Luker, he was to receive back the Diamond, as a pledge redeemed. If he failed to produce the money at the expiration of the year, the pledge (otherwise the Moonstone) was to be considered as forfeited to Mr. Luker\u2014who would, in this latter case, generously make Mr. Godfrey a present of certain promissory notes of his (relating to former dealings) which were then in the money-lender\u2019s possession."}, {"size": 726, "text": "It is needless to say, that Mr. Godfrey indignantly refused to listen to these monstrous terms. Mr. Luker thereupon, handed him back the Diamond, and wished him good-night. Your cousin went to the door, and came back again. How was he to be sure that the conversation of that evening would be kept strictly secret between his friend and himself? Mr. Luker didn\u2019t profess to know how. If Mr. Godfrey had accepted his terms, Mr. Godfrey would have made him an accomplice, and might have counted on his silence as on a certainty. As things were, Mr. Luker must be guided by his own interests.

He looked about him in a state of helpless despair. The day of the month, recorded on a neat little card in a box on the money-lender\u2019s chimney-piece, happened to attract his eye. It was the twenty-third of June. On the twenty-fourth he had three hundred pounds to pay to the young gentleman for whom he was trustee, and no chance of raising the money, except the chance that Mr. Luker had offered to him. But for this miserable obstacle, he might have taken the Diamond to Amsterdam, and have made a marketable commodity of it, by having it cut up into separate stones."}, {"size": 663, "text": "As matters stood, he had no choice but to accept Mr. Luker\u2019s terms. After all, he had a year at his disposal, in which to raise the three thousand pounds\u2014and a year is a long time. Mr. Luker drew out the necessary documents on the spot. When they were signed, he gave Mr. Godfrey Ablewhite two cheques. One, dated June 23rd, for three hundred pounds. Another, dated a week on, for the remaining balance seventeen hundred pounds. How the Moonstone was trusted to the keeping of Mr Luker\u2019s bankers, and how the Indians treated Mr. Luker and Mr. Godfrey (after that had been done) you know already.

One of his reasons for making this concession has been penetrated by Mr. Bruff.

That legacy (as the event has proved) led him to his death. I have ascertained that when he went abroad, on getting his five thousand pounds, he went to Amsterdam.

They were all willing (he said) to sacrifice their passage money, if the commander of the steamer would only put them ashore. Commiserating their position, as foreigners in a strange land, and knowing no reason for detaining them, the commander signalled for a shore boat, and the three men left the vessel. This proceeding of the Indians having been plainly resolved on beforehand, as a means of preventing their being traced, I lost no time in returning to England."}, {"size": 631, "text": "I left the steamer at Gravesend, and discovered that the Indians had gone from that place to London.

On receiving this intelligence, Sergeant Cuff caused the authorities at Bombay to be communicated with, overland\u2014so that the vessel might be boarded by the police immediately on her entering the port.

The Hindoos joined us at Plymouth. On the passage out I heard no complaint of their conduct. They were berthed in the forward part of the vessel. I had but few occasions myself of personally noticing them. In the latter part of the voyage, we had the misfortune to be becalmed for three days and nights, off the coast of India. I have not got the ship\u2019s journal to refer to, and I cannot now call to mind the latitude and longitude.

Permit me to remind you that the person\u2019s name was Murthwaite, and that you and he had a long conversation together after dinner. The talk related to an Indian Diamond, called the Moonstone, and to a conspiracy then in existence to get possession of the gem. Since that time, I have been wandering in Central Asia. Thence I have drifted back to the scene of some of my past adventures in the north and north-west of India.

The few Mahometan families, thinly scattered about the villages in the interior, are afraid to taste meat of any kind. A Mahometan even suspected of killing that sacred animal, the cow, is, as a matter of course, put to death without mercy in these parts by the pious Hindoo neighbours who surround him. To strengthen the religious enthusiasm of the people, two of the most famous shrines of Hindoo pilgrimage are contained within the boundaries of Kattiawar."}, {"size": 670, "text": "One of them is Dwarka, the birthplace of the god Krishna.

At the place where I planned to do this, I was (as nearly as I could calculate it) some three days distant, journeying on foot, from the sacred city. I had not been long on the road, before I noticed that other people\u2014by twos and threes\u2014appeared to be travelling in the same direction as myself."}, {"size": 620, "text": "To such of these as spoke to me, I gave myself out as a Hindoo-Boodhist, from a distant province, bound on a pilgrimage.

A trifling service which I was able to render to one of my fellow-pilgrims, during the third day\u2019s journey, proved the means of introducing me to certain Hindoos of the higher caste. From these men I learnt that the multitude was on its way to a great religious ceremony, which was to take place on a hill at a little distance from Somnauth. The ceremony was in honour of the god of the Moon; and it was to be held at night. The crowd detained us as we drew near to the place of celebration."}, {"size": 609, "text": "By the time we reached the hill the moon was high in the heaven. My Hindoo friends possessed some special privileges which enabled them to gain access to the shrine. They kindly allowed me to accompany them.

Beneath the trees a flat projection of rock jutted out, and formed a species of natural platform. Below this, I stood, in company with my Hindoo friends. Looking back down the hill, the view presented the grandest spectacle of Nature and Man, in combination, that I have ever seen."}, {"size": 667, "text": "The lower slopes of the eminence melted imperceptibly into a grassy plain, the place of the meeting of three rivers. On one side, the graceful winding of the waters stretched away, now visible, now hidden by trees, as far as the eye could see. On the other, the waveless ocean slept in the calm of the night. People this lovely scene with tens of thousands of human creatures, all dressed in white, stretching down the sides of the hill, overflowing into the plain, and fringing the nearer banks of the winding rivers.

In the central figure of the three I recognised the man to whom I had spoken in England, when the Indians appeared on the terrace at Lady Verinder\u2019s house.

In a whisper, he explained to me the apparition of the three figures on the platform of rock. They were Brahmins (he said) who had forfeited their caste in the service of the god. The god had commanded that their purification should be the purification by pilgrimage. On that night, the three men were to part. In three separate directions, they were to set forth as pilgrims to the shrines of India. Never more were they to look on each other\u2019s faces. Never more were they to rest on their wanderings, from the day which witnessed their separation, to the day which witnessed their death."}, {"size": 625, "text": "As those words were whispered to me, the plaintive music ceased.

A new strain of music, loud and jubilant, rose from the hidden shrine."}, {"size": 656, "text": "The crowd around me shuddered, and pressed together.
