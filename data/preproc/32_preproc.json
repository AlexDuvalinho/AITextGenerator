A Not Unnatural Enterprise This is written from memory, unfortunately. If I could have brought with me the material I so carefully prepared, this would be a very different story. Whole books full of notes, carefully copied records, firsthand descriptions, and the pictures--that\u2019s the worst loss. We had some bird\u2019s-eyes of the cities and parks; a lot of lovely views of streets, of buildings, outside and in, and some of those gorgeous gardens, and, most important of all, of the women themselves. Nobody will ever believe how they looked. Descriptions aren\u2019t any good when it comes to women, and I never was good at descriptions anyhow."}, {"size": 624, "text": "But it\u2019s got to be done somehow; the rest of the world needs to know about that country. I haven\u2019t said where it was for fear some self-appointed missionaries, or traders, or land-greedy expansionists, will take it upon themselves to push in. They will not be wanted, I can tell them that, and will fare worse than we did if they do find it. It began this way. There were three of us, classmates and friends--Terry O. Nicholson (we used to call him the Old Nick, with good reason), Jeff Margrave, and I, Vandyck Jennings. We had known each other years and years, and in spite of our differences we had a good deal in common."}, {"size": 706, "text": "All of us were interested in science. Terry was rich enough to do as he pleased. His great aim was exploration. He used to make all kinds of a row because there was nothing left to explore now, only patchwork and filling in, he said. He filled in well enough--he had a lot of talents--great on mechanics and electricity. Had all kinds of boats and motorcars, and was one of the best of our airmen. We never could have done the thing at all without Terry. Jeff Margrave was born to be a poet, a botanist--or both--but his folks persuaded him to be a doctor instead. He was a good one, for his age, but his real interest was in what he loved to call \u201cthe wonders of science.\u201d As for me, sociology\u2019s my major."}, {"size": 797, "text": "You have to back that up with a lot of other sciences, of course. I\u2019m interested in them all. Terry was strong on facts--geography and meteorology and those; Jeff could beat him any time on biology, and I didn\u2019t care what it was they talked about, so long as it connected with human life, somehow. There are few things that don\u2019t. We three had a chance to join a big scientific expedition. They needed a doctor, and that gave Jeff an excuse for dropping his just opening practice; they needed Terry\u2019s experience, his machine, and his money; and as for me, I got in through Terry\u2019s influence. The expedition was up among the thousand tributaries and enormous hinterland of a great river, up where the maps had to be made, savage dialects studied, and all manner of strange flora and fauna expected."}, {"size": 660, "text": "But this story is not about that expedition. That was only the merest starter for ours. My interest was first roused by talk among our guides. I\u2019m quick at languages, know a good many, and pick them up readily. What with that and a really good interpreter we took with us, I made out quite a few legends and folk myths of these scattered tribes. And as we got farther and farther upstream, in a dark tangle of rivers, lakes, morasses, and dense forests, with here and there an unexpected long spur running out from the big mountains beyond, I noticed that more and more of these savages had a story about a strange and terrible Woman Land in the high distance."}, {"size": 612, "text": "\u201cUp yonder,\u201d \u201cOver there,\u201d \u201cWay up\u201d--was all the direction they could offer, but their legends all agreed on the main point--that there was this strange country where no men lived--only women and girl children. None of them had ever seen it. It was dangerous, deadly, they said, for any man to go there. But there were tales of long ago, when some brave investigator had seen it--a Big Country, Big Houses, Plenty People--All Women. Had no one else gone? Yes--a good many--but they never came back. It was no place for men--of that they seemed sure. I told the boys about these stories, and they laughed at them."}, {"size": 780, "text": "Naturally I did myself. I knew the stuff that savage dreams are made of. But when we had reached our farthest point, just the day before we all had to turn around and start for home again, as the best of expeditions must in time, we three made a discovery. The main encampment was on a spit of land running out into the main stream, or what we thought was the main stream. It had the same muddy color we had been seeing for weeks past, the same taste. I happened to speak of that river to our last guide, a rather superior fellow with quick, bright eyes. He told me that there was another river--\u201cover there, short river, sweet water, red and blue.\u201d I was interested in this and anxious to see if I had understood, so I showed him a red and blue pencil I carried, and asked again."}, {"size": 180, "text": "Yes, he pointed to the river, and then to the southwestward. \u201cRiver--good water--red and blue.\u201d Terry was close by and interested in the fellow\u2019s pointing. \u201cWhat does he say, Van?\u201d"}, {"size": 614, "text": "Terry blazed up at once. \u201cAsk him how far it is.\u201d The man indicated a short journey; I judged about two hours, maybe three. \u201cLet\u2019s go,\u201d urged Terry. \u201cJust us three. Maybe we can really find something. May be cinnabar in it.\u201d \u201cMay be indigo,\u201d Jeff suggested, with his lazy smile. It was early yet; we had just breakfasted; and leaving word that we\u2019d be back before night, we got away quietly, not wishing to be thought too gullible if we failed, and secretly hoping to have some nice little discovery all to ourselves. It was a long two hours, nearer three. I fancy the savage could have done it alone much quicker."}, {"size": 764, "text": "There was a desperate tangle of wood and water and a swampy patch we never should have found our way across alone. But there was one, and I could see Terry, with compass and notebook, marking directions and trying to place landmarks. We came after a while to a sort of marshy lake, very big, so that the circling forest looked quite low and dim across it. Our guide told us that boats could go from there to our camp--but \u201clong way--all day.\u201d This water was somewhat clearer than that we had left, but we could not judge well from the margin. We skirted it for another half hour or so, the ground growing firmer as we advanced, and presently we turned the corner of a wooded promontory and saw a quite different country--a sudden view of mountains, steep and bare."}, {"size": 630, "text": "\u201cOne of those long easterly spurs,\u201d Terry said appraisingly. \u201cMay be hundreds of miles from the range. They crop out like that.\u201d Suddenly we left the lake and struck directly toward the cliffs. We heard running water before we reached it, and the guide pointed proudly to his river. It was short. We could see where it poured down a narrow vertical cataract from an opening in the face of the cliff. It was sweet water. The guide drank eagerly and so did we. \u201cThat\u2019s snow water,\u201d Terry announced. \u201cMust come from way back in the hills.\u201d But as to being red and blue--it was greenish in tint. The guide seemed not at all surprised."}, {"size": 614, "text": "He hunted about a little and showed us a quiet marginal pool where there were smears of red along the border; yes, and of blue. Terry got out his magnifying glass and squatted down to investigate. \u201cChemicals of some sort--I can\u2019t tell on the spot. Look to me like dyestuffs. Let\u2019s get nearer,\u201d he urged, \u201cup there by the fall.\u201d We scrambled along the steep banks and got close to the pool that foamed and boiled beneath the falling water. Here we searched the border and found traces of color beyond dispute. More--Jeff suddenly held up an unlooked-for trophy. It was only a rag, a long, raveled fragment of cloth."}, {"size": 619, "text": "But it was a well-woven fabric, with a pattern, and of a clear scarlet that the water had not faded. No savage tribe that we had heard of made such fabrics. The guide stood serenely on the bank, well pleased with our excitement. \u201cOne day blue--one day red--one day green,\u201d he told us, and pulled from his pouch another strip of bright-hued cloth. \u201cCome down,\u201d he said, pointing to the cataract. \u201cWoman Country--up there.\u201d Then we were interested. We had our rest and lunch right there and pumped the man for further information. He could tell us only what the others had--a land of women--no men--babies, but all girls."}, {"size": 662, "text": "No place for men--dangerous. Some had gone to see--none had come back. I could see Terry\u2019s jaw set at that. No place for men? Dangerous? He looked as if he might shin up the waterfall on the spot. But the guide would not hear of going up, even if there had been any possible method of scaling that sheer cliff, and we had to get back to our party before night. \u201cThey might stay if we told them,\u201d I suggested. But Terry stopped in his tracks. \u201cLook here, fellows,\u201d he said. \u201cThis is our find. Let\u2019s not tell those cocky old professors. Let\u2019s go on home with \u2018em, and then come back--just us--have a little expedition of our own.\u201d We looked at him, much impressed."}, {"size": 661, "text": "There was something attractive to a bunch of unattached young men in finding an undiscovered country of a strictly Amazonian nature. Of course we didn\u2019t believe the story--but yet! \u201cThere is no such cloth made by any of these local tribes,\u201d I announced, examining those rags with great care. \u201cSomewhere up yonder they spin and weave and dye--as well as we do.\u201d \u201cThat would mean a considerable civilization, Van. There couldn\u2019t be such a place--and not known about.\u201d \u201cOh, well, I don\u2019t know. What\u2019s that old republic up in the Pyrenees somewhere--Andorra? Precious few people know anything about that, and it\u2019s been minding its own business for a thousand years."}, {"size": 716, "text": "Then there\u2019s Montenegro--splendid little state--you could lose a dozen Montenegroes up and down these great ranges.\u201d We discussed it hotly all the way back to camp. We discussed it with care and privacy on the voyage home. We discussed it after that, still only among ourselves, while Terry was making his arrangements. He was hot about it. Lucky he had so much money--we might have had to beg and advertise for years to start the thing, and then it would have been a matter of public amusement--just sport for the papers. But T. O. Nicholson could fix up his big steam yacht, load his specially-made big motorboat aboard, and tuck in a \u201cdissembled\u201d biplane without any more notice than a snip in the society column."}, {"size": 661, "text": "We had provisions and preventives and all manner of supplies. His previous experience stood him in good stead there. It was a very complete little outfit. We were to leave the yacht at the nearest safe port and go up that endless river in our motorboat, just the three of us and a pilot; then drop the pilot when we got to that last stopping place of the previous party, and hunt up that clear water stream ourselves. The motorboat we were going to leave at anchor in that wide shallow lake. It had a special covering of fitted armor, thin but strong, shut up like a clamshell. \u201cThose natives can\u2019t get into it, or hurt it, or move it,\u201d Terry explained proudly."}, {"size": 699, "text": "\u201cWe\u2019ll start our flier from the lake and leave the boat as a base to come back to.\u201d \u201cIf we come back,\u201d I suggested cheerfully. \u201c\u2018Fraid the ladies will eat you?\u201d he scoffed. \u201cWe\u2019re not so sure about those ladies, you know,\u201d drawled Jeff. \u201cThere may be a contingent of gentlemen with poisoned arrows or something.\u201d \u201cYou don\u2019t need to go if you don\u2019t want to,\u201d Terry remarked drily. \u201cGo? You\u2019ll have to get an injunction to stop me!\u201d Both Jeff and I were sure about that. But we did have differences of opinion, all the long way. An ocean voyage is an excellent time for discussion. Now we had no eavesdroppers, we could loll and loaf in our deck chairs and talk and talk--there was nothing else to do."}, {"size": 690, "text": "Our absolute lack of facts only made the field of discussion wider. \u201cWe\u2019ll leave papers with our consul where the yacht stays,\u201d Terry planned. \u201cIf we don\u2019t come back in--say a month--they can send a relief party after us.\u201d \u201cA punitive expedition,\u201d I urged. \u201cIf the ladies do eat us we must make reprisals.\u201d \u201cThey can locate that last stopping place easy enough, and I\u2019ve made a sort of chart of that lake and cliff and waterfall.\u201d \u201cYes, but how will they get up?\u201d asked Jeff. \u201cSame way we do, of course. If three valuable American citizens are lost up there, they will follow somehow--to say nothing of the glittering attractions of that fair land--let\u2019s call it \u2018Feminisia,\u2019\u201d he broke off."}, {"size": 605, "text": "\u201cYou\u2019re right, Terry. Once the story gets out, the river will crawl with expeditions and the airships rise like a swarm of mosquitoes.\u201d I laughed as I thought of it. \u201cWe\u2019ve made a great mistake not to let Mr. Yellow Press in on this. Save us! What headlines!\u201d \u201cNot much!\u201d said Terry grimly. \u201cThis is our party. We\u2019re going to find that place alone.\u201d \u201cWhat are you going to do with it when you do find it--if you do?\u201d Jeff asked mildly. Jeff was a tender soul. I think he thought that country--if there was one--was just blossoming with roses and babies and canaries and tidies, and all that sort of thing."}, {"size": 725, "text": "And Terry, in his secret heart, had visions of a sort of sublimated summer resort--just Girls and Girls and Girls--and that he was going to be--well, Terry was popular among women even when there were other men around, and it\u2019s not to be wondered at that he had pleasant dreams of what might happen. I could see it in his eyes as he lay there, looking at the long blue rollers slipping by, and fingering that impressive mustache of his. But I thought--then--that I could form a far clearer idea of what was before us than either of them. \u201cYou\u2019re all off, boys,\u201d I insisted. \u201cIf there is such a place--and there does seem some foundation for believing it--you\u2019ll find it\u2019s built on a sort of matriarchal principle, that\u2019s all."}, {"size": 710, "text": "The men have a separate cult of their own, less socially developed than the women, and make them an annual visit--a sort of wedding call. This is a condition known to have existed--here\u2019s just a survival. They\u2019ve got some peculiarly isolated valley or tableland up there, and their primeval customs have survived. That\u2019s all there is to it.\u201d \u201cHow about the boys?\u201d Jeff asked. \u201cOh, the men take them away as soon as they are five or six, you see.\u201d \u201cAnd how about this danger theory all our guides were so sure of?\u201d \u201cDanger enough, Terry, and we\u2019ll have to be mighty careful. Women of that stage of culture are quite able to defend themselves and have no welcome for unseasonable visitors.\u201d We talked and talked."}, {"size": 631, "text": "And with all my airs of sociological superiority I was no nearer than any of them. It was funny though, in the light of what we did find, those extremely clear ideas of ours as to what a country of women would be like. It was no use to tell ourselves and one another that all this was idle speculation. We were idle and we did speculate, on the ocean voyage and the river voyage, too. \u201cAdmitting the improbability,\u201d we\u2019d begin solemnly, and then launch out again. \u201cThey would fight among themselves,\u201d Terry insisted. \u201cWomen always do. We mustn\u2019t look to find any sort of order and organization.\u201d \u201cYou\u2019re dead wrong,\u201d Jeff told him."}, {"size": 655, "text": "\u201cIt will be like a nunnery under an abbess--a peaceful, harmonious sisterhood.\u201d I snorted derision at this idea. \u201cNuns, indeed! Your peaceful sisterhoods were all celibate, Jeff, and under vows of obedience. These are just women, and mothers, and where there\u2019s motherhood you don\u2019t find sisterhood--not much.\u201d \u201cNo, sir--they\u2019ll scrap,\u201d agreed Terry. \u201cAlso we mustn\u2019t look for inventions and progress; it\u2019ll be awfully primitive.\u201d \u201cHow about that cloth mill?\u201d Jeff suggested. \u201cOh, cloth! Women have always been spinsters. But there they stop--you\u2019ll see.\u201d We joked Terry about his modest impression that he would be warmly received, but he held his ground."}, {"size": 707, "text": "\u201cYou\u2019ll see,\u201d he insisted. \u201cI\u2019ll get solid with them all--and play one bunch against another. I\u2019ll get myself elected king in no time--whew! Solomon will have to take a back seat!\u201d \u201cWhere do we come in on that deal?\u201d I demanded. \u201cAren\u2019t we Viziers or anything?\u201d \u201cCouldn\u2019t risk it,\u201d he asserted solemnly. \u201cYou might start a revolution--probably would. No, you\u2019ll have to be beheaded, or bowstrung--or whatever the popular method of execution is.\u201d \u201cYou\u2019d have to do it yourself, remember,\u201d grinned Jeff. \u201cNo husky black slaves and mamelukes! And there\u2019d be two of us and only one of you--eh, Van?\u201d Jeff\u2019s ideas and Terry\u2019s were so far apart that sometimes it was all I could do to keep the peace between them."}, {"size": 819, "text": "Jeff idealized women in the best Southern style. He was full of chivalry and sentiment, and all that. And he was a good boy; he lived up to his ideals. You might say Terry did, too, if you can call his views about women anything so polite as ideals. I always liked Terry. He was a man\u2019s man, very much so, generous and brave and clever; but I don\u2019t think any of us in college days was quite pleased to have him with our sisters. We weren\u2019t very stringent, heavens no! But Terry was \u201cthe limit.\u201d Later on--why, of course a man\u2019s life is his own, we held, and asked no questions. But barring a possible exception in favor of a not impossible wife, or of his mother, or, of course, the fair relatives of his friends, Terry\u2019s idea seemed to be that pretty women were just so much game and homely ones not worth considering."}, {"size": 600, "text": "It was really unpleasant sometimes to see the notions he had. But I got out of patience with Jeff, too. He had such rose-colored halos on his womenfolks. I held a middle ground, highly scientific, of course, and used to argue learnedly about the physiological limitations of the sex. We were not in the least \u201cadvanced\u201d on the woman question, any of us, then. So we joked and disputed and speculated, and after an interminable journey, we got to our old camping place at last. It was not hard to find the river, just poking along that side till we came to it, and it was navigable as far as the lake."}, {"size": 641, "text": "When we reached that and slid out on its broad glistening bosom, with that high gray promontory running out toward us, and the straight white fall clearly visible, it began to be really exciting. There was some talk, even then, of skirting the rock wall and seeking a possible footway up, but the marshy jungle made that method look not only difficult but dangerous. Terry dismissed the plan sharply. \u201cNonsense, fellows! We\u2019ve decided that. It might take months--we haven\u2019t got the provisions. No, sir--we\u2019ve got to take our chances. If we get back safe--all right. If we don\u2019t, why, we\u2019re not the first explorers to get lost in the shuffle."}, {"size": 621, "text": "There are plenty to come after us.\u201d So we got the big biplane together and loaded it with our scientifically compressed baggage: the camera, of course; the glasses; a supply of concentrated food. Our pockets were magazines of small necessities, and we had our guns, of course--there was no knowing what might happen. Up and up and up we sailed, way up at first, to get \u201cthe lay of the land\u201d and make note of it. Out of that dark green sea of crowding forest this high-standing spur rose steeply. It ran back on either side, apparently, to the far-off white-crowned peaks in the distance, themselves probably inaccessible."}, {"size": 664, "text": "\u201cLet\u2019s make the first trip geographical,\u201d I suggested. \u201cSpy out the land, and drop back here for more gasoline. With your tremendous speed we can reach that range and back all right. Then we can leave a sort of map on board--for that relief expedition.\u201d \u201cThere\u2019s sense in that,\u201d Terry agreed. \u201cI\u2019ll put off being king of Ladyland for one more day.\u201d So we made a long skirting voyage, turned the point of the cape which was close by, ran up one side of the triangle at our best speed, crossed over the base where it left the higher mountains, and so back to our lake by moonlight. \u201cThat\u2019s not a bad little kingdom,\u201d we agreed when it was roughly drawn and measured."}, {"size": 782, "text": "We could tell the size fairly by our speed. And from what we could see of the sides--and that icy ridge at the back end--\u201cIt\u2019s a pretty enterprising savage who would manage to get into it,\u201d Jeff said. Of course we had looked at the land itself--eagerly, but we were too high and going too fast to see much. It appeared to be well forested about the edges, but in the interior there were wide plains, and everywhere parklike meadows and open places. There were cities, too; that I insisted. It looked--well, it looked like any other country--a civilized one, I mean. We had to sleep after that long sweep through the air, but we turned out early enough next day, and again we rose softly up the height till we could top the crowning trees and see the broad fair land at our pleasure."}, {"size": 875, "text": "\u201cSemitropical. Looks like a first-rate climate. It\u2019s wonderful what a little height will do for temperature.\u201d Terry was studying the forest growth. \u201cLittle height! Is that what you call little?\u201d I asked. Our instruments measured it clearly. We had not realized the long gentle rise from the coast perhaps. \u201cMighty lucky piece of land, I call it,\u201d Terry pursued. \u201cNow for the folks--I\u2019ve had enough scenery.\u201d So we sailed low, crossing back and forth, quartering the country as we went, and studying it. We saw--I can\u2019t remember now how much of this we noted then and how much was supplemented by our later knowledge, but we could not help seeing this much, even on that excited day--a land in a state of perfect cultivation, where even the forests looked as if they were cared for; a land that looked like an enormous park, only it was even more evidently an enormous garden."}, {"size": 633, "text": "\u201cI don\u2019t see any cattle,\u201d I suggested, but Terry was silent. We were approaching a village. I confess that we paid small attention to the clean, well-built roads, to the attractive architecture, to the ordered beauty of the little town. We had our glasses out; even Terry, setting his machine for a spiral glide, clapped the binoculars to his eyes. They heard our whirring screw. They ran out of the houses--they gathered in from the fields, swift-running light figures, crowds of them. We stared and stared until it was almost too late to catch the levers, sweep off and rise again; and then we held our peace for a long run upward."}, {"size": 666, "text": "\u201cGosh!\u201d said Terry, after a while. \u201cOnly women there--and children,\u201d Jeff urged excitedly. \u201cBut they look--why, this is a CIVILIZED country!\u201d I protested. \u201cThere must be men.\u201d \u201cOf course there are men,\u201d said Terry. \u201cCome on, let\u2019s find \u2018em.\u201d He refused to listen to Jeff\u2019s suggestion that we examine the country further before we risked leaving our machine. \u201cThere\u2019s a fine landing place right there where we came over,\u201d he insisted, and it was an excellent one--a wide, flat-topped rock, overlooking the lake, and quite out of sight from the interior. \u201cThey won\u2019t find this in a hurry,\u201d he asserted, as we scrambled with the utmost difficulty down to safer footing."}, {"size": 663, "text": "\u201cCome on, boys--there were some good lookers in that bunch.\u201d Of course it was unwise of us. It was quite easy to see afterward that our best plan was to have studied the country more fully before we left our swooping airship and trusted ourselves to mere foot service. But we were three young men. We had been talking about this country for over a year, hardly believing that there was such a place, and now--we were in it. It looked safe and civilized enough, and among those upturned, crowding faces, though some were terrified enough, there was great beauty--on that we all agreed. \u201cCome on!\u201d cried Terry, pushing forward. \u201cOh, come on! Here goes for Herland!\u201d"}, {"size": 764, "text": "CHAPTER 2. Rash Advances Not more than ten or fifteen miles we judged it from our landing rock to that last village. For all our eagerness we thought it wise to keep to the woods and go carefully. Even Terry\u2019s ardor was held in check by his firm conviction that there were men to be met, and we saw to it that each of us had a good stock of cartridges. \u201cThey may be scarce, and they may be hidden away somewhere--some kind of a matriarchate, as Jeff tells us; for that matter, they may live up in the mountains yonder and keep the women in this part of the country--sort of a national harem! But there are men somewhere--didn\u2019t you see the babies?\u201d We had all seen babies, children big and little, everywhere that we had come near enough to distinguish the people."}, {"size": 613, "text": "And though by dress we could not be sure of all the grown persons, still there had not been one man that we were certain of. \u201cI always liked that Arab saying, \u2018First tie your camel and then trust in the Lord,\u2019\u201d Jeff murmured; so we all had our weapons in hand, and stole cautiously through the forest. Terry studied it as we progressed. \u201cTalk of civilization,\u201d he cried softly in restrained enthusiasm. \u201cI never saw a forest so petted, even in Germany. Look, there\u2019s not a dead bough--the vines are trained--actually! And see here\u201d--he stopped and looked about him, calling Jeff\u2019s attention to the kinds of trees."}, {"size": 625, "text": "They left me for a landmark and made a limited excursion on either side. \u201cFood-bearing, practically all of them,\u201d they announced returning. \u201cThe rest, splendid hardwood. Call this a forest? It\u2019s a truck farm!\u201d \u201cGood thing to have a botanist on hand,\u201d I agreed. \u201cSure there are no medicinal ones? Or any for pure ornament?\u201d As a matter of fact they were quite right. These towering trees were under as careful cultivation as so many cabbages. In other conditions we should have found those woods full of fair foresters and fruit gatherers; but an airship is a conspicuous object, and by no means quiet--and women are cautious."}, {"size": 615, "text": "All we found moving in those woods, as we started through them, were birds, some gorgeous, some musical, all so tame that it seemed almost to contradict our theory of cultivation--at least until we came upon occasional little glades, where carved stone seats and tables stood in the shade beside clear fountains, with shallow bird baths always added. \u201cThey don\u2019t kill birds, and apparently they do kill cats,\u201d Terry declared. \u201cMUST be men here. Hark!\u201d We had heard something: something not in the least like a birdsong, and very much like a suppressed whisper of laughter--a little happy sound, instantly smothered."}, {"size": 718, "text": "We stood like so many pointers, and then used our glasses, swiftly, carefully. \u201cIt couldn\u2019t have been far off,\u201d said Terry excitedly. \u201cHow about this big tree?\u201d There was a very large and beautiful tree in the glade we had just entered, with thick wide-spreading branches that sloped out in lapping fans like a beech or pine. It was trimmed underneath some twenty feet up, and stood there like a huge umbrella, with circling seats beneath. \u201cLook,\u201d he pursued. \u201cThere are short stumps of branches left to climb on. There\u2019s someone up that tree, I believe.\u201d We stole near, cautiously. \u201cLook out for a poisoned arrow in your eye,\u201d I suggested, but Terry pressed forward, sprang up on the seat-back, and grasped the trunk."}, {"size": 619, "text": "\u201cIn my heart, more likely,\u201d he answered. \u201cGee! Look, boys!\u201d We rushed close in and looked up. There among the boughs overhead was something--more than one something--that clung motionless, close to the great trunk at first, and then, as one and all we started up the tree, separated into three swift-moving figures and fled upward. As we climbed we could catch glimpses of them scattering above us. By the time we had reached about as far as three men together dared push, they had left the main trunk and moved outward, each one balanced on a long branch that dipped and swayed beneath the weight. We paused uncertain."}, {"size": 602, "text": "If we pursued further, the boughs would break under the double burden. We might shake them off, perhaps, but none of us was so inclined. In the soft dappled light of these high regions, breathless with our rapid climb, we rested awhile, eagerly studying our objects of pursuit; while they in turn, with no more terror than a set of frolicsome children in a game of tag, sat as lightly as so many big bright birds on their precarious perches and frankly, curiously, stared at us. \u201cGirls!\u201d whispered Jeff, under his breath, as if they might fly if he spoke aloud. \u201cPeaches!\u201d added Terry, scarcely louder."}, {"size": 620, "text": "\u201cPeacherinos--apricot-nectarines! Whew!\u201d They were girls, of course, no boys could ever have shown that sparkling beauty, and yet none of us was certain at first. We saw short hair, hatless, loose, and shining; a suit of some light firm stuff, the closest of tunics and kneebreeches, met by trim gaiters. As bright and smooth as parrots and as unaware of danger, they swung there before us, wholly at ease, staring as we stared, till first one, and then all of them burst into peals of delighted laughter. Then there was a torrent of soft talk tossed back and forth; no savage sing-song, but clear musical fluent speech."}, {"size": 609, "text": "We met their laughter cordially, and doffed our hats to them, at which they laughed again, delightedly. Then Terry, wholly in his element, made a polite speech, with explanatory gestures, and proceeded to introduce us, with pointing finger. \u201cMr. Jeff Margrave,\u201d he said clearly; Jeff bowed as gracefully as a man could in the fork of a great limb. \u201cMr. Vandyck Jennings\u201d--I also tried to make an effective salute and nearly lost my balance. Then Terry laid his hand upon his chest--a fine chest he had, too, and introduced himself; he was braced carefully for the occasion and achieved an excellent obeisance."}, {"size": 841, "text": "Again they laughed delightedly, and the one nearest me followed his tactics. \u201cCelis,\u201d she said distinctly, pointing to the one in blue; \u201cAlima\u201d--the one in rose; then, with a vivid imitation of Terry\u2019s impressive manner, she laid a firm delicate hand on her gold-green jerkin--\u201cEllador.\u201d This was pleasant, but we got no nearer. \u201cWe can\u2019t sit here and learn the language,\u201d Terry protested. He beckoned to them to come nearer, most winningly--but they gaily shook their heads. He suggested, by signs, that we all go down together; but again they shook their heads, still merrily. Then Ellador clearly indicated that we should go down, pointing to each and all of us, with unmistakable firmness; and further seeming to imply by the sweep of a lithe arm that we not only go downward, but go away altogether--at which we shook our heads in turn."}, {"size": 636, "text": "\u201cHave to use bait,\u201d grinned Terry. \u201cI don\u2019t know about you fellows, but I came prepared.\u201d He produced from an inner pocket a little box of purple velvet, that opened with a snap--and out of it he drew a long sparkling thing, a necklace of big varicolored stones that would have been worth a million if real ones. He held it up, swung it, glittering in the sun, offered it first to one, then to another, holding it out as far as he could reach toward the girl nearest him. He stood braced in the fork, held firmly by one hand--the other, swinging his bright temptation, reached far out along the bough, but not quite to his full stretch."}, {"size": 668, "text": "She was visibly moved, I noted, hesitated, spoke to her companions. They chattered softly together, one evidently warning her, the other encouraging. Then, softly and slowly, she drew nearer. This was Alima, a tall long-limbed lass, well-knit and evidently both strong and agile. Her eyes were splendid, wide, fearless, as free from suspicion as a child\u2019s who has never been rebuked. Her interest was more that of an intent boy playing a fascinating game than of a girl lured by an ornament. The others moved a bit farther out, holding firmly, watching. Terry\u2019s smile was irreproachable, but I did not like the look in his eyes--it was like a creature about to spring."}, {"size": 682, "text": "I could already see it happen--the dropped necklace, the sudden clutching hand, the girl\u2019s sharp cry as he seized her and drew her in. But it didn\u2019t happen. She made a timid reach with her right hand for the gay swinging thing--he held it a little nearer--then, swift as light, she seized it from him with her left, and dropped on the instant to the bough below. He made his snatch, quite vainly, almost losing his position as his hand clutched only air; and then, with inconceivable rapidity, the three bright creatures were gone. They dropped from the ends of the big boughs to those below, fairly pouring themselves off the tree, while we climbed downward as swiftly as we could."}, {"size": 600, "text": "We heard their vanishing gay laughter, we saw them fleeting away in the wide open reaches of the forest, and gave chase, but we might as well have chased wild antelopes; so we stopped at length somewhat breathless. \u201cNo use,\u201d gasped Terry. \u201cThey got away with it. My word! The men of this country must be good sprinters!\u201d \u201cInhabitants evidently arboreal,\u201d I grimly suggested. \u201cCivilized and still arboreal--peculiar people.\u201d \u201cYou shouldn\u2019t have tried that way,\u201d Jeff protested. \u201cThey were perfectly friendly; now we\u2019ve scared them.\u201d But it was no use grumbling, and Terry refused to admit any mistake."}, {"size": 626, "text": "\u201cNonsense,\u201d he said. \u201cThey expected it. Women like to be run after. Come on, let\u2019s get to that town; maybe we\u2019ll find them there. Let\u2019s see, it was in this direction and not far from the woods, as I remember.\u201d When we reached the edge of the open country we reconnoitered with our field glasses. There it was, about four miles off, the same town, we concluded, unless, as Jeff ventured, they all had pink houses. The broad green fields and closely cultivated gardens sloped away at our feet, a long easy slant, with good roads winding pleasantly here and there, and narrower paths besides. \u201cLook at that!\u201d cried Jeff suddenly."}, {"size": 600, "text": "\u201cThere they go!\u201d Sure enough, close to the town, across a wide meadow, three bright-hued figures were running swiftly. \u201cHow could they have got that far in this time? It can\u2019t be the same ones,\u201d I urged. But through the glasses we could identify our pretty tree-climbers quite plainly, at least by costume. Terry watched them, we all did for that matter, till they disappeared among the houses. Then he put down his glass and turned to us, drawing a long breath. \u201cMother of Mike, boys--what Gorgeous Girls! To climb like that! to run like that! and afraid of nothing. This country suits me all right."}, {"size": 611, "text": "Let\u2019s get ahead.\u201d \u201cNothing venture, nothing have,\u201d I suggested, but Terry preferred \u201cFaint heart ne\u2019er won fair lady.\u201d We set forth in the open, walking briskly. \u201cIf there are any men, we\u2019d better keep an eye out,\u201d I suggested, but Jeff seemed lost in heavenly dreams, and Terry in highly practical plans. \u201cWhat a perfect road! What a heavenly country! See the flowers, will you?\u201d This was Jeff, always an enthusiast; but we could agree with him fully. The road was some sort of hard manufactured stuff, sloped slightly to shed rain, with every curve and grade and gutter as perfect as if it were Europe\u2019s best."}, {"size": 653, "text": "\u201cNo men, eh?\u201d sneered Terry. On either side a double row of trees shaded the footpaths; between the trees bushes or vines, all fruit-bearing, now and then seats and little wayside fountains; everywhere flowers. \u201cWe\u2019d better import some of these ladies and set \u2018em to parking the United States,\u201d I suggested. \u201cMighty nice place they\u2019ve got here.\u201d We rested a few moments by one of the fountains, tested the fruit that looked ripe, and went on, impressed, for all our gay bravado by the sense of quiet potency which lay about us. Here was evidently a people highly skilled, efficient, caring for their country as a florist cares for his costliest orchids."}, {"size": 605, "text": "Under the soft brilliant blue of that clear sky, in the pleasant shade of those endless rows of trees, we walked unharmed, the placid silence broken only by the birds. Presently there lay before us at the foot of a long hill the town or village we were aiming for. We stopped and studied it. Jeff drew a long breath. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t have believed a collection of houses could look so lovely,\u201d he said. \u201cThey\u2019ve got architects and landscape gardeners in plenty, that\u2019s sure,\u201d agreed Terry. I was astonished myself. You see, I come from California, and there\u2019s no country lovelier, but when it comes to towns--!"}, {"size": 774, "text": "I have often groaned at home to see the offensive mess man made in the face of nature, even though I\u2019m no art sharp, like Jeff. But this place! It was built mostly of a sort of dull rose-colored stone, with here and there some clear white houses; and it lay abroad among the green groves and gardens like a broken rosary of pink coral. \u201cThose big white ones are public buildings evidently,\u201d Terry declared. \u201cThis is no savage country, my friend. But no men? Boys, it behooves us to go forward most politely.\u201d The place had an odd look, more impressive as we approached. \u201cIt\u2019s like an exposition.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s too pretty to be true.\u201d \u201cPlenty of palaces, but where are the homes?\u201d \u201cOh there are little ones enough--but--.\u201d It certainly was different from any towns we had ever seen."}, {"size": 756, "text": "\u201cThere\u2019s no dirt,\u201d said Jeff suddenly. \u201cThere\u2019s no smoke,\u201d he added after a little. \u201cThere\u2019s no noise,\u201d I offered; but Terry snubbed me--\u201cThat\u2019s because they are laying low for us; we\u2019d better be careful how we go in there.\u201d Nothing could induce him to stay out, however, so we walked on. Everything was beauty, order, perfect cleanness, and the pleasantest sense of home over it all. As we neared the center of the town the houses stood thicker, ran together as it were, grew into rambling palaces grouped among parks and open squares, something as college buildings stand in their quiet greens. And then, turning a corner, we came into a broad paved space and saw before us a band of women standing close together in even order, evidently waiting for us."}, {"size": 639, "text": "We stopped a moment and looked back. The street behind was closed by another band, marching steadily, shoulder to shoulder. We went on--there seemed no other way to go--and presently found ourselves quite surrounded by this close-massed multitude, women, all of them, but-- They were not young. They were not old. They were not, in the girl sense, beautiful. They were not in the least ferocious. And yet, as I looked from face to face, calm, grave, wise, wholly unafraid, evidently assured and determined, I had the funniest feeling--a very early feeling--a feeling that I traced back and back in memory until I caught up with it at last."}, {"size": 639, "text": "It was that sense of being hopelessly in the wrong that I had so often felt in early youth when my short legs\u2019 utmost effort failed to overcome the fact that I was late to school. Jeff felt it too; I could see he did. We felt like small boys, very small boys, caught doing mischief in some gracious lady\u2019s house. But Terry showed no such consciousness. I saw his quick eyes darting here and there, estimating numbers, measuring distances, judging chances of escape. He examined the close ranks about us, reaching back far on every side, and murmured softly to me, \u201cEvery one of \u2018em over forty as I\u2019m a sinner.\u201d Yet they were not old women."}, {"size": 741, "text": "Each was in the full bloom of rosy health, erect, serene, standing sure-footed and light as any pugilist. They had no weapons, and we had, but we had no wish to shoot. \u201cI\u2019d as soon shoot my aunts,\u201d muttered Terry again. \u201cWhat do they want with us anyhow? They seem to mean business.\u201d But in spite of that businesslike aspect, he determined to try his favorite tactics. Terry had come armed with a theory. He stepped forward, with his brilliant ingratiating smile, and made low obeisance to the women before him. Then he produced another tribute, a broad soft scarf of filmy texture, rich in color and pattern, a lovely thing, even to my eye, and offered it with a deep bow to the tall unsmiling woman who seemed to head the ranks before him."}, {"size": 670, "text": "She took it with a gracious nod of acknowledgment, and passed it on to those behind her. He tried again, this time bringing out a circlet of rhinestones, a glittering crown that should have pleased any woman on earth. He made a brief address, including Jeff and me as partners in his enterprise, and with another bow presented this. Again his gift was accepted and, as before, passed out of sight. \u201cIf they were only younger,\u201d he muttered between his teeth. \u201cWhat on earth is a fellow to say to a regiment of old Colonels like this?\u201d In all our discussions and speculations we had always unconsciously assumed that the women, whatever else they might be, would be young."}, {"size": 708, "text": "Most men do think that way, I fancy. \u201cWoman\u201d in the abstract is young, and, we assume, charming. As they get older they pass off the stage, somehow, into private ownership mostly, or out of it altogether. But these good ladies were very much on the stage, and yet any one of them might have been a grandmother. We looked for nervousness--there was none. For terror, perhaps--there was none. For uneasiness, for curiosity, for excitement--and all we saw was what might have been a vigilance committee of women doctors, as cool as cucumbers, and evidently meaning to take us to task for being there. Six of them stepped forward now, one on either side of each of us, and indicated that we were to go with them."}, {"size": 751, "text": "We thought it best to accede, at first anyway, and marched along, one of these close at each elbow, and the others in close masses before, behind, on both sides. A large building opened before us, a very heavy thick-walled impressive place, big, and old-looking; of gray stone, not like the rest of the town. \u201cThis won\u2019t do!\u201d said Terry to us, quickly. \u201cWe mustn\u2019t let them get us in this, boys. All together, now--\u201d We stopped in our tracks. We began to explain, to make signs pointing away toward the big forest--indicating that we would go back to it--at once. It makes me laugh, knowing all I do now, to think of us three boys--nothing else; three audacious impertinent boys--butting into an unknown country without any sort of a guard or defense."}, {"size": 671, "text": "We seemed to think that if there were men we could fight them, and if there were only women--why, they would be no obstacles at all. Jeff, with his gentle romantic old-fashioned notions of women as clinging vines. Terry, with his clear decided practical theories that there were two kinds of women--those he wanted and those he didn\u2019t; Desirable and Undesirable was his demarcation. The latter as a large class, but negligible--he had never thought about them at all. And now here they were, in great numbers, evidently indifferent to what he might think, evidently determined on some purpose of their own regarding him, and apparently well able to enforce their purpose."}, {"size": 568, "text": "We all thought hard just then. It had not seemed wise to object to going with them, even if we could have; our one chance was friendliness--a civilized attitude on both sides. But once inside that building, there was no knowing what these determined ladies might do to us. Even a peaceful detention was not to our minds, and when we named it imprisonment it looked even worse. So we made a stand, trying to make clear that we preferred the open country. One of them came forward with a sketch of our flier, asking by signs if we were the aerial visitors they had seen."}, {"size": 681, "text": "They pointed to it again, and to the outlying country, in different directions--but we pretended we did not know where it was, and in truth we were not quite sure and gave a rather wild indication of its whereabouts. Again they motioned us to advance, standing so packed about the door that there remained but the one straight path open. All around us and behind they were massed solidly--there was simply nothing to do but go forward--or fight. We held a consultation. \u201cI never fought with women in my life,\u201d said Terry, greatly perturbed, \u201cbut I\u2019m not going in there. I\u2019m not going to be--herded in--as if we were in a cattle chute.\u201d \u201cWe can\u2019t fight them, of course,\u201d Jeff urged."}, {"size": 690, "text": "\u201cThey\u2019re all women, in spite of their nondescript clothes; nice women, too; good strong sensible faces. I guess we\u2019ll have to go in.\u201d \u201cWe may never get out, if we do,\u201d I told them. \u201cStrong and sensible, yes; but I\u2019m not so sure about the good. Look at those faces!\u201d They had stood at ease, waiting while we conferred together, but never relaxing their close attention. Their attitude was not the rigid discipline of soldiers; there was no sense of compulsion about them. Terry\u2019s term of a \u201cvigilance committee\u201d was highly descriptive. They had just the aspect of sturdy burghers, gathered hastily to meet some common need or peril, all moved by precisely the same feelings, to the same end."}, {"size": 616, "text": "Never, anywhere before, had I seen women of precisely this quality. Fishwives and market women might show similar strength, but it was coarse and heavy. These were merely athletic--light and powerful. College professors, teachers, writers--many women showed similar intelligence but often wore a strained nervous look, while these were as calm as cows, for all their evident intellect. We observed pretty closely just then, for all of us felt that it was a crucial moment. The leader gave some word of command and beckoned us on, and the surrounding mass moved a step nearer. \u201cWe\u2019ve got to decide quick,\u201d said Terry."}, {"size": 620, "text": "\u201cI vote to go in,\u201d Jeff urged. But we were two to one against him and he loyally stood by us. We made one more effort to be let go, urgent, but not imploring. In vain. \u201cNow for a rush, boys!\u201d Terry said. \u201cAnd if we can\u2019t break \u2018em, I\u2019ll shoot in the air.\u201d Then we found ourselves much in the position of the suffragette trying to get to the Parliament buildings through a triple cordon of London police. The solidity of those women was something amazing. Terry soon found that it was useless, tore himself loose for a moment, pulled his revolver, and fired upward. As they caught at it, he fired again--we heard a cry--."}, {"size": 669, "text": "Instantly each of us was seized by five women, each holding arm or leg or head; we were lifted like children, straddling helpless children, and borne onward, wriggling indeed, but most ineffectually. We were borne inside, struggling manfully, but held secure most womanfully, in spite of our best endeavors. So carried and so held, we came into a high inner hall, gray and bare, and were brought before a majestic gray-haired woman who seemed to hold a judicial position. There was some talk, not much, among them, and then suddenly there fell upon each of us at once a firm hand holding a wetted cloth before mouth and nose--an order of swimming sweetness--anesthesia."}, {"size": 696, "text": "CHAPTER 3. A Peculiar Imprisonment From a slumber as deep as death, as refreshing as that of a healthy child, I slowly awakened. It was like rising up, up, up through a deep warm ocean, nearer and nearer to full light and stirring air. Or like the return to consciousness after concussion of the brain. I was once thrown from a horse while on a visit to a wild mountainous country quite new to me, and I can clearly remember the mental experience of coming back to life, through lifting veils of dream. When I first dimly heard the voices of those about me, and saw the shining snowpeaks of that mighty range, I assumed that this too would pass, and I should presently find myself in my own home."}, {"size": 646, "text": "That was precisely the experience of this awakening: receding waves of half-caught swirling vision, memories of home, the steamer, the boat, the airship, the forest--at last all sinking away one after another, till my eyes were wide open, my brain clear, and I realized what had happened. The most prominent sensation was of absolute physical comfort. I was lying in a perfect bed: long, broad, smooth; firmly soft and level; with the finest linen, some warm light quilt of blanket, and a counterpane that was a joy to the eye. The sheet turned down some fifteen inches, yet I could stretch my feet at the foot of the bed free but warmly covered."}, {"size": 636, "text": "I felt as light and clean as a white feather. It took me some time to conscientiously locate my arms and legs, to feel the vivid sense of life radiate from the wakening center to the extremities. A big room, high and wide, with many lofty windows whose closed blinds let through soft green-lit air; a beautiful room, in proportion, in color, in smooth simplicity; a scent of blossoming gardens outside. I lay perfectly still, quite happy, quite conscious, and yet not actively realizing what had happened till I heard Terry. \u201cGosh!\u201d was what he said. I turned my head. There were three beds in this chamber, and plenty of room for them."}, {"size": 764, "text": "Terry was sitting up, looking about him, alert as ever. His remark, though not loud, roused Jeff also. We all sat up. Terry swung his legs out of bed, stood up, stretched himself mightily. He was in a long nightrobe, a sort of seamless garment, undoubtedly comfortable--we all found ourselves so covered. Shoes were beside each bed, also quite comfortable and goodlooking though by no means like our own. We looked for our clothes--they were not there, nor anything of all the varied contents of our pockets. A door stood somewhat ajar; it opened into a most attractive bathroom, copiously provided with towels, soap, mirrors, and all such convenient comforts, with indeed our toothbrushes and combs, our notebooks, and thank goodness, our watches--but no clothes."}, {"size": 641, "text": "Then we made a search of the big room again and found a large airy closet, holding plenty of clothing, but not ours. \u201cA council of war!\u201d demanded Terry. \u201cCome on back to bed--the bed\u2019s all right anyhow. Now then, my scientific friend, let us consider our case dispassionately.\u201d He meant me, but Jeff seemed most impressed. \u201cThey haven\u2019t hurt us in the least!\u201d he said. \u201cThey could have killed us--or--or anything--and I never felt better in my life.\u201d \u201cThat argues that they are all women,\u201d I suggested, \u201cand highly civilized. You know you hit one in the last scrimmage--I heard her sing out--and we kicked awfully.\u201d Terry was grinning at us."}, {"size": 602, "text": "\u201cSo you realize what these ladies have done to us?\u201d he pleasantly inquired. \u201cThey have taken away all our possessions, all our clothes--every stitch. We have been stripped and washed and put to bed like so many yearling babies--by these highly civilized women.\u201d Jeff actually blushed. He had a poetic imagination. Terry had imagination enough, of a different kind. So had I, also different. I always flattered myself I had the scientific imagination, which, incidentally, I considered the highest sort. One has a right to a certain amount of egotism if founded on fact--and kept to one\u2019s self--I think."}, {"size": 674, "text": "\u201cNo use kicking, boys,\u201d I said. \u201cThey\u2019ve got us, and apparently they\u2019re perfectly harmless. It remains for us to cook up some plan of escape like any other bottled heroes. Meanwhile we\u2019ve got to put on these clothes--Hobson\u2019s choice.\u201d The garments were simple in the extreme, and absolutely comfortable, physically, though of course we all felt like supes in the theater. There was a one-piece cotton undergarment, thin and soft, that reached over the knees and shoulders, something like the one-piece pajamas some fellows wear, and a kind of half-hose, that came up to just under the knee and stayed there--had elastic tops of their own, and covered the edges of the first."}, {"size": 735, "text": "Then there was a thicker variety of union suit, a lot of them in the closet, of varying weights and somewhat sturdier material--evidently they would do at a pinch with nothing further. Then there were tunics, knee-length, and some long robes. Needless to say, we took tunics. We bathed and dressed quite cheerfully. \u201cNot half bad,\u201d said Terry, surveying himself in a long mirror. His hair was somewhat longer than when we left the last barber, and the hats provided were much like those seen on the prince in the fairy tale, lacking the plume. The costume was similar to that which we had seen on all the women, though some of them, those working in the fields, glimpsed by our glasses when we first flew over, wore only the first two."}, {"size": 824, "text": "I settled my shoulders and stretched my arms, remarking: \u201cThey have worked out a mighty sensible dress, I\u2019ll say that for them.\u201d With which we all agreed. \u201cNow then,\u201d Terry proclaimed, \u201cwe\u2019ve had a fine long sleep--we\u2019ve had a good bath--we\u2019re clothed and in our right minds, though feeling like a lot of neuters. Do you think these highly civilized ladies are going to give us any breakfast?\u201d \u201cOf course they will,\u201d Jeff asserted confidently. \u201cIf they had meant to kill us, they would have done it before. I believe we are going to be treated as guests.\u201d \u201cHailed as deliverers, I think,\u201d said Terry. \u201cStudied as curiosities,\u201d I told them. \u201cBut anyhow, we want food.

Outside was another large room, furnished with a great table at one end, long benches or couches against the wall, some smaller tables and chairs. All these were solid, strong, simple in structure, and comfortable in use--also, incidentally, beautiful. This room was occupied by a number of women, eighteen to be exact, some of whom we distinctly recalled. Terry heaved a disappointed sigh. \u201cThe Colonels!\u201d I heard him whisper to Jeff. Jeff, however, advanced and bowed in his best manner; so did we all, and we were saluted civilly by the tall-standing women."}, {"size": 645, "text": "We had no need to make pathetic pantomime of hunger; the smaller tables were already laid with food, and we were gravely invited to be seated. The tables were set for two; each of us found ourselves placed vis-a-vis with one of our hosts, and each table had five other stalwarts nearby, unobtrusively watching. We had plenty of time to get tired of those women! The breakfast was not profuse, but sufficient in amount and excellent in quality. We were all too good travelers to object to novelty, and this repast with its new but delicious fruit, its dish of large rich-flavored nuts, and its highly satisfactory little cakes was most agreeable."}, {"size": 743, "text": "There was water to drink, and a hot beverage of a most pleasing quality, some preparation like cocoa. And then and there, willy-nilly, before we had satisfied our appetites, our education began. By each of our plates lay a little book, a real printed book, though different from ours both in paper and binding, as well, of course, as in type. We examined them curiously. \u201cShades of Sauveur!\u201d muttered Terry. \u201cWe\u2019re to learn the language!\u201d We were indeed to learn the language, and not only that, but to teach our own. There were blank books with parallel columns, neatly ruled, evidently prepared for the occasion, and in these, as fast as we learned and wrote down the name of anything, we were urged to write our own name for it by its side."}, {"size": 672, "text": "The book we had to study was evidently a schoolbook, one in which children learned to read, and we judged from this, and from their frequent consultation as to methods, that they had had no previous experience in the art of teaching foreigners their language, or of learning any other. On the other hand, what they lacked in experience, they made up for in genius. Such subtle understanding, such instant recognition of our difficulties, and readiness to meet them, were a constant surprise to us. Of course, we were willing to meet them halfway. It was wholly to our advantage to be able to understand and speak with them, and as to refusing to teach them--why should we?"}, {"size": 661, "text": "Later on we did try open rebellion, but only once. That first meal was pleasant enough, each of us quietly studying his companion, Jeff with sincere admiration, Terry with that highly technical look of his, as of a past master--like a lion tamer, a serpent charmer, or some such professional. I myself was intensely interested. It was evident that those sets of five were there to check any outbreak on our part. We had no weapons, and if we did try to do any damage, with a chair, say, why five to one was too many for us, even if they were women; that we had found out to our sorrow.

Immediately below us were gardens, fruitful and fragrant, but their high walls followed the edge of the cliff which dropped sheer down, we could not see how far. The distant sound of water suggested a river at the foot. We could look out east, west, and south.

I don\u2019t propose to make a rope of bedclothes and try those walls till I\u2019m sure there is no better way.\u201d We all concurred on this point, and returned to our discussion as to the women.

It\u2019s as if our being men was a minor incident.\u201d I nodded. I\u2019d noticed it myself. But Terry broke in rudely. \u201cFiddlesticks!\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s because of their advanced age. They\u2019re all grandmas, I tell you--or ought to be. Great aunts, anyhow.

Terry was moody as the days passed.

They all wore short hair, some few inches at most; some curly, some not; all light and clean and fresh-looking. \u201cIf their hair was only long,\u201d Jeff would complain, \u201cthey would look so much more feminine.\u201d I rather liked it myself, after I got used to it. Why we should so admire \u201ca woman\u2019s crown of hair\u201d and not admire a Chinaman\u2019s queue is hard to explain, except that we are so convinced that the long hair \u201cbelongs\u201d to a woman.

Our time was quite pleasantly filled. We were free of the garden below our windows, quite long in its irregular rambling shape, bordering the cliff. The walls were perfectly smooth and high, ending in the masonry of the building; and as I studied the great stones I became convinced that the whole structure was extremely old. It was built like the pre-Incan architecture in Peru, of enormous monoliths, fitted as closely as mosaics. \u201cThese folks have a history, that\u2019s sure,\u201d I told the others. \u201cAnd SOME time they were fighters--else why a fortress?\u201d I said we were free of the garden, but not wholly alone in it."}, {"size": 719, "text": "There was always a string of those uncomfortably strong women sitting about, always one of them watching us even if the others were reading, playing games, or busy at some kind of handiwork. \u201cWhen I see them knit,\u201d Terry said, \u201cI can almost call them feminine.\u201d \u201cThat doesn\u2019t prove anything,\u201d Jeff promptly replied. \u201cScotch shepherds knit--always knitting.\u201d \u201cWhen we get out--\u201d Terry stretched himself and looked at the far peaks, \u201cwhen we get out of this and get to where the real women are--the mothers, and the girls--\u201d \u201cWell, what\u2019ll we do then?\u201d I asked, rather gloomily. \u201cHow do you know we\u2019ll ever get out?\u201d This was an unpleasant idea, which we unanimously considered, returning with earnestness to our studies."}, {"size": 669, "text": "\u201cIf we are good boys and learn our lessons well,\u201d I suggested. \u201cIf we are quiet and respectful and polite and they are not afraid of us--then perhaps they will let us out. And anyway--when we do escape, it is of immense importance that we know the language.\u201d Personally, I was tremendously interested in that language, and seeing they had books, was eager to get at them, to dig into their history, if they had one. It was not hard to speak, smooth and pleasant to the ear, and so easy to read and write that I marveled at it. They had an absolutely phonetic system, the whole thing was as scientific as Esparanto yet bore all the marks of an old and rich civilization."}, {"size": 727, "text": "We were free to study as much as we wished, and were not left merely to wander in the garden for recreation but introduced to a great gymnasium, partly on the roof and partly in the story below. Here we learned real respect for our tall guards. No change of costume was needed for this work, save to lay off outer clothing. The first one was as perfect a garment for exercise as need be devised, absolutely free to move in, and, I had to admit, much better-looking than our usual one. \u201cForty--over forty--some of \u2018em fifty, I bet--and look at \u2018em!\u201d grumbled Terry in reluctant admiration. There were no spectacular acrobatics, such as only the young can perform, but for all-around development they had a most excellent system."}, {"size": 692, "text": "A good deal of music went with it, with posture dancing and, sometimes, gravely beautiful processional performances. Jeff was much impressed by it. We did not know then how small a part of their physical culture methods this really was, but found it agreeable to watch, and to take part in. Oh yes, we took part all right! It wasn\u2019t absolutely compulsory, but we thought it better to please. Terry was the strongest of us, though I was wiry and had good staying power, and Jeff was a great sprinter and hurdler, but I can tell you those old ladies gave us cards and spades. They ran like deer, by which I mean that they ran not as if it was a performance, but as if it was their natural gait."}, {"size": 758, "text": "We remembered those fleeting girls of our first bright adventure, and concluded that it was. They leaped like deer, too, with a quick folding motion of the legs, drawn up and turned to one side with a sidelong twist of the body.

We did not easily catch up with these experts, however. \u201cNever thought I\u2019d live to be bossed by a lot of elderly lady acrobats,\u201d Terry protested. They had games, too, a good many of them, but we found them rather uninteresting at first. It was like two people playing solitaire to see who would get it first; more like a race or a--a competitive examination, than a real game with some fight in it."}, {"size": 620, "text": "I philosophized a bit over this and told Terry it argued against their having any men about. \u201cThere isn\u2019t a man-size game in the lot,\u201d I said. \u201cBut they are interesting--I like them,\u201d Jeff objected, \u201cand I\u2019m sure they are educational.\u201d \u201cI\u2019m sick and tired of being educated,\u201d Terry protested. \u201cFancy going to a dame school--at our age. I want to Get Out!\u201d But we could not get out, and we were being educated swiftly. Our special tutors rose rapidly in our esteem. They seemed of rather finer quality than the guards, though all were on terms of easy friendliness. Mine was named Somel, Jeff\u2019s Zava, and Terry\u2019s Moadine."}, {"size": 760, "text": "We tried to generalize from the names, those of the guards, and of our three girls, but got nowhere. \u201cThey sound well enough, and they\u2019re mostly short, but there\u2019s no similarity of termination--and no two alike. However, our acquaintance is limited as yet.\u201d There were many things we meant to ask--as soon as we could talk well enough. Better teaching I never saw. From morning to night there was Somel, always on call except between two and four; always pleasant with a steady friendly kindness that I grew to enjoy very much. Jeff said Miss Zava--he would put on a title, though they apparently had none--was a darling, that she reminded him of his Aunt Esther at home; but Terry refused to be won, and rather jeered at his own companion, when we were alone."}, {"size": 605, "text": "\u201cI\u2019m sick of it!\u201d he protested. \u201cSick of the whole thing. Here we are cooped up as helpless as a bunch of three-year-old orphans, and being taught what they think is necessary--whether we like it or not. Confound their old-maid impudence!\u201d Nevertheless we were taught. They brought in a raised map of their country, beautifully made, and increased our knowledge of geographical terms; but when we inquired for information as to the country outside, they smilingly shook their heads. They brought pictures, not only the engravings in the books but colored studies of plants and trees and flowers and birds."}, {"size": 643, "text": "They brought tools and various small objects--we had plenty of \u201cmaterial\u201d in our school. If it had not been for Terry we would have been much more contented, but as the weeks ran into months he grew more and more irritable. \u201cDon\u2019t act like a bear with a sore head,\u201d I begged him. \u201cWe\u2019re getting on finely. Every day we can understand them better, and pretty soon we can make a reasonable plea to be let out--\u201d \u201cLET out!\u201d he stormed. \u201cLET out--like children kept after school. I want to Get Out, and I\u2019m going to.

If it isn\u2019t there, we\u2019ll find our way down somehow--the boat\u2019s there, I guess.\u201d It was hard on Terry, so hard that he finally persuaded us to consider a plan of escape.

There were plenty of strong ropes in the gymnasium--they seemed to love to swing and climb on them--but we were never there by ourselves.

I know just where I saw that bit of path below, and there\u2019s a big tree there, too, or a vine or something--I saw the leaves.\u201d It seemed a crazy risk to take, but this was, in a way, Terry\u2019s expedition, and we were all tired of our imprisonment.

Hangings, rugs, robes, towels, as well as bed-furniture--even the mattress covers--we left not one stitch upon another, as Jeff put it. Then at an end window, as less liable to observation, we fastened one end of our cable, strongly, to the firm-set hinge of the inner blind, and dropped our coiled bundle of rope softly over."}, {"size": 660, "text": "\u201cThis part\u2019s easy enough--I\u2019ll come last, so as to cut the rope,\u201d said Terry.

Then I slowly dropped to the ground, Jeff following, and at last we all three stood safe in the garden, with most of our rope with us. \u201cGood-bye, Grandma!\u201d whispered Terry, under his breath, and we crept softly toward the wall, taking advantage of the shadow of every bush and tree.

Then I\u2019ll go down to the end. If I can get off safely, you can see me and follow--or, say, I\u2019ll twitch it three times. If I find there\u2019s absolutely no footing--why I\u2019ll climb up again, that\u2019s all. I don\u2019t think they\u2019ll kill us.\u201d From the top he reconnoitered carefully, waved his hand, and whispered, \u201cOK,\u201d then slipped over. Jeff climbed up and I followed, and we rather shivered to see how far down that swaying, wavering figure dropped, hand under hand, till it disappeared in a mass of foliage far below.

The next stage was down a sort of \u201cchimney\u201d--a long irregular fissure; and so with scratches many and painful and bruises not a few, we finally reached the stream.

So we stocked up with nuts till we bulged like Prussian privates in marching order, drank all we could hold, and retired for the day.

We had room to stretch, if not to turn around; but we could very carefully roll over, one at a time, behind the sheltering foliage. It was no use to leave there by daylight.

By day, sleep, sound and sweet. Mighty lucky it was that we could live off the country as we did. Even that margin of forest seemed rich in foodstuffs. But Jeff thoughtfully suggested that that very thing showed how careful we should have to be, as we might run into some stalwart group of gardeners or foresters or nut-gatherers at any minute. Careful we were, feeling pretty sure that if we did not make good this time we were not likely to have another opportunity; and at last we reached a point from which we could see, far below, the broad stretch of that still lake from which we had made our ascent."}, {"size": 624, "text": "\u201cThat looks pretty good to me!\u201d said Terry, gazing down at it. \u201cNow, if we can\u2019t find the \u2018plane, we know where to aim if we have to drop over this wall some other way.\u201d The wall at that point was singularly uninviting. It rose so straight that we had to put our heads over to see the base, and the country below seemed to be a far-off marshy tangle of rank vegetation. We did not have to risk our necks to that extent, however, for at last, stealing along among the rocks and trees like so many creeping savages, we came to that flat space where we had landed; and there, in unbelievable good fortune, we found our machine."}, {"size": 677, "text": "\u201cCovered, too, by jingo! Would you think they had that much sense?\u201d cried Terry. \u201cIf they had that much, they\u2019re likely to have more,\u201d I warned him, softly. \u201cBet you the thing\u2019s watched.\u201d We reconnoitered as widely as we could in the failing moonlight--moons are of a painfully unreliable nature; but the growing dawn showed us the familiar shape, shrouded in some heavy cloth like canvas, and no slightest sign of any watchman near. We decided to make a quick dash as soon as the light was strong enough for accurate work. \u201cI don\u2019t care if the old thing\u2019ll go or not,\u201d Terry declared. \u201cWe can run her to the edge, get aboard, and just plane down--plop!--beside our boat there."}, {"size": 680, "text": "Look there--see the boat!\u201d Sure enough--there was our motor, lying like a gray cocoon on the flat pale sheet of water. Quietly but swiftly we rushed forward and began to tug at the fastenings of that cover. \u201cConfound the thing!\u201d Terry cried in desperate impatience. \u201cThey\u2019ve got it sewed up in a bag! And we\u2019ve not a knife among us!\u201d Then, as we tugged and pulled at that tough cloth we heard a sound that made Terry lift his head like a war horse--the sound of an unmistakable giggle, yes--three giggles. There they were--Celis, Alima, Ellador--looking just as they had when we first saw them, standing a little way off from us, as interested, as mischievous as three schoolboys."}, {"size": 632, "text": "\u201cHold on, Terry--hold on!\u201d I warned. \u201cThat\u2019s too easy. Look out for a trap.\u201d \u201cLet us appeal to their kind hearts,\u201d Jeff urged. \u201cI think they will help us. Perhaps they\u2019ve got knives.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s no use rushing them, anyhow,\u201d I was absolutely holding on to Terry. \u201cWe know they can out-run and out-climb us.\u201d He reluctantly admitted this; and after a brief parley among ourselves, we all advanced slowly toward them, holding out our hands in token of friendliness. They stood their ground till we had come fairly near, and then indicated that we should stop. To make sure, we advanced a step or two and they promptly and swiftly withdrew."}, {"size": 641, "text": "So we stopped at the distance specified. Then we used their language, as far as we were able, to explain our plight, telling how we were imprisoned, how we had escaped--a good deal of pantomime here and vivid interest on their part--how we had traveled by night and hidden by day, living on nuts--and here Terry pretended great hunger. I know he could not have been hungry; we had found plenty to eat and had not been sparing in helping ourselves. But they seemed somewhat impressed; and after a murmured consultation they produced from their pockets certain little packages, and with the utmost ease and accuracy tossed them into our hands."}, {"size": 669, "text": "Jeff was most appreciative of this; and Terry made extravagant gestures of admiration, which seemed to set them off, boy-fashion, to show their skill. While we ate the excellent biscuits they had thrown us, and while Ellador kept a watchful eye on our movements, Celis ran off to some distance, and set up a sort of \u201cduck-on-a-rock\u201d arrangement, a big yellow nut on top of three balanced sticks; Alima, meanwhile, gathering stones. They urged us to throw at it, and we did, but the thing was a long way off, and it was only after a number of failures, at which those elvish damsels laughed delightedly, that Jeff succeeded in bringing the whole structure to the ground."}, {"size": 643, "text": "It took me still longer, and Terry, to his intense annoyance, came third. Then Celis set up the little tripod again, and looked back at us, knocking it down, pointing at it, and shaking her short curls severely. \u201cNo,\u201d she said. \u201cBad--wrong!\u201d We were quite able to follow her. Then she set it up once more, put the fat nut on top, and returned to the others; and there those aggravating girls sat and took turns throwing little stones at that thing, while one stayed by as a setter-up; and they just popped that nut off, two times out of three, without upsetting the sticks. Pleased as Punch they were, too, and we pretended to be, but weren\u2019t."}, {"size": 755, "text": "We got very friendly over this game, but I told Terry we\u2019d be sorry if we didn\u2019t get off while we could, and then we begged for knives. It was easy to show what we wanted to do, and they each proudly produced a sort of strong clasp-knife from their pockets. \u201cYes,\u201d we said eagerly, \u201cthat\u2019s it! Please--\u201d We had learned quite a bit of their language, you see. And we just begged for those knives, but they would not give them to us. If we came a step too near they backed off, standing light and eager for flight. \u201cIt\u2019s no sort of use,\u201d I said. \u201cCome on--let\u2019s get a sharp stone or something--we must get this thing off.\u201d So we hunted about and found what edged fragments we could, and hacked away, but it was like trying to cut sailcloth with a clamshell."}, {"size": 657, "text": "Terry hacked and dug, but said to us under his breath. \u201cBoys, we\u2019re in pretty good condition--let\u2019s make a life and death dash and get hold of those girls--we\u2019ve got to.\u201d They had drawn rather nearer to watch our efforts, and we did take them rather by surprise; also, as Terry said, our recent training had strengthened us in wind and limb, and for a few desperate moments those girls were scared and we almost triumphant. But just as we stretched out our hands, the distance between us widened; they had got their pace apparently, and then, though we ran at our utmost speed, and much farther than I thought wise, they kept just out of reach all the time."}, {"size": 622, "text": "We stopped breathless, at last, at my repeated admonitions. \u201cThis is stark foolishness,\u201d I urged. \u201cThey are doing it on purpose--come back or you\u2019ll be sorry.\u201d We went back, much slower than we came, and in truth we were sorry. As we reached our swaddled machine, and sought again to tear loose its covering, there rose up from all around the sturdy forms, the quiet determined faces we knew so well. \u201cOh Lord!\u201d groaned Terry. \u201cThe Colonels! It\u2019s all up--they\u2019re forty to one.\u201d It was no use to fight. These women evidently relied on numbers, not so much as a drilled force but as a multitude actuated by a common impulse."}, {"size": 695, "text": "They showed no sign of fear, and since we had no weapons whatever and there were at least a hundred of them, standing ten deep about us, we gave in as gracefully as we might. Of course we looked for punishment--a closer imprisonment, solitary confinement maybe--but nothing of the kind happened. They treated us as truants only, and as if they quite understood our truancy. Back we went, not under an anesthetic this time but skimming along in electric motors enough like ours to be quite recognizable, each of us in a separate vehicle with one able-bodied lady on either side and three facing him. They were all pleasant enough, and talked to us as much as was possible with our limited powers."}, {"size": 750, "text": "And though Terry was keenly mortified, and at first we all rather dreaded harsh treatment, I for one soon began to feel a sort of pleasant confidence and to enjoy the trip. Here were my five familiar companions, all good-natured as could be, seeming to have no worse feeling than a mild triumph as of winning some simple game; and even that they politely suppressed. This was a good opportunity to see the country, too, and the more I saw of it, the better I liked it. We went too swiftly for close observation, but I could appreciate perfect roads, as dustless as a swept floor; the shade of endless lines of trees; the ribbon of flowers that unrolled beneath them; and the rich comfortable country that stretched off and away, full of varied charm."}, {"size": 723, "text": "We rolled through many villages and towns, and I soon saw that the parklike beauty of our first-seen city was no exception. Our swift high-sweeping view from the \u2018plane had been most attractive, but lacked detail; and in that first day of struggle and capture, we noticed little. But now we were swept along at an easy rate of some thirty miles an hour and covered quite a good deal of ground. We stopped for lunch in quite a sizable town, and here, rolling slowly through the streets, we saw more of the population. They had come out to look at us everywhere we had passed, but here were more; and when we went in to eat, in a big garden place with little shaded tables among the trees and flowers, many eyes were upon us."}, {"size": 622, "text": "And everywhere, open country, village, or city--only women. Old women and young women and a great majority who seemed neither young nor old, but just women; young girls, also, though these, and the children, seeming to be in groups by themselves generally, were less in evidence. We caught many glimpses of girls and children in what seemed to be schools or in playgrounds, and so far as we could judge there were no boys. We all looked, carefully. Everyone gazed at us politely, kindly, and with eager interest. No one was impertinent. We could catch quite a bit of the talk now, and all they said seemed pleasant enough."}, {"size": 730, "text": "Well--before nightfall we were all safely back in our big room. The damage we had done was quite ignored; the beds as smooth and comfortable as before, new clothing and towels supplied. The only thing those women did was to illuminate the gardens at night, and to set an extra watch. But they called us to account next day. Our three tutors, who had not joined in the recapturing expedition, had been quite busy in preparing for us, and now made explanation. They knew well we would make for our machine, and also that there was no other way of getting down--alive. So our flight had troubled no one; all they did was to call the inhabitants to keep an eye on our movements all along the edge of the forest between the two points."}, {"size": 607, "text": "It appeared that many of those nights we had been seen, by careful ladies sitting snugly in big trees by the riverbed, or up among the rocks. Terry looked immensely disgusted, but it struck me as extremely funny. Here we had been risking our lives, hiding and prowling like outlaws, living on nuts and fruit, getting wet and cold at night, and dry and hot by day, and all the while these estimable women had just been waiting for us to come out. Now they began to explain, carefully using such words as we could understand. It appeared that we were considered as guests of the country--sort of public wards."}, {"size": 762, "text": "Our first violence had made it necessary to keep us safeguarded for a while, but as soon as we learned the language--and would agree to do no harm--they would show us all about the land. Jeff was eager to reassure them. Of course he did not tell on Terry, but he made it clear that he was ashamed of himself, and that he would now conform. As to the language--we all fell upon it with redoubled energy. They brought us books, in greater numbers, and I began to study them seriously. \u201cPretty punk literature,\u201d Terry burst forth one day, when we were in the privacy of our own room. \u201cOf course one expects to begin on child-stories, but I would like something more interesting now.\u201d \u201cCan\u2019t expect stirring romance and wild adventure without men, can you?\u201d I asked."}, {"size": 702, "text": "Nothing irritated Terry more than to have us assume that there were no men; but there were no signs of them in the books they gave us, or the pictures. \u201cShut up!\u201d he growled. \u201cWhat infernal nonsense you talk! I\u2019m going to ask \u2018em outright--we know enough now.\u201d In truth we had been using our best efforts to master the language, and were able to read fluently and to discuss what we read with considerable ease. That afternoon we were all sitting together on the roof--we three and the tutors gathered about a table, no guards about. We had been made to understand some time earlier that if we would agree to do no violence they would withdraw their constant attendance, and we promised most willingly."}, {"size": 707, "text": "So there we sat, at ease; all in similar dress; our hair, by now, as long as theirs, only our beards to distinguish us. We did not want those beards, but had so far been unable to induce them to give us any cutting instruments. \u201cLadies,\u201d Terry began, out of a clear sky, as it were, \u201care there no men in this country?\u201d \u201cMen?\u201d Somel answered. \u201cLike you?\u201d \u201cYes, men,\u201d Terry indicated his beard, and threw back his broad shoulders. \u201cMen, real men.\u201d \u201cNo,\u201d she answered quietly. \u201cThere are no men in this country.

We are mothers--all of us--but there are no fathers. We thought you would ask about that long ago--why have you not?\u201d Her look was as frankly kind as always, her tone quite simple. Terry explained that we had not felt sufficiently used to the language, making rather a mess of it, I thought, but Jeff was franker. \u201cWill you excuse us all,\u201d he said, \u201cif we admit that we find it hard to believe? There is no such--possibility--in the rest of the world.\u201d \u201cHave you no kind of life where it is possible?\u201d asked Zava."}, {"size": 625, "text": "\u201cWhy, yes--some low forms, of course.\u201d \u201cHow low--or how high, rather?\u201d \u201cWell--there are some rather high forms of insect life in which it occurs. Parthenogenesis, we call it--that means virgin birth.\u201d She could not follow him. \u201cBIRTH, we know, of course; but what is VIRGIN?\u201d Terry looked uncomfortable, but Jeff met the question quite calmly. \u201cAmong mating animals, the term VIRGIN is applied to the female who has not mated,\u201d he answered. \u201cOh, I see. And does it apply to the male also? Or is there a different term for him?\u201d He passed this over rather hurriedly, saying that the same term would apply, but was seldom used."}, {"size": 721, "text": "\u201cNo?\u201d she said. \u201cBut one cannot mate without the other surely. Is not each then--virgin--before mating? And, tell me, have you any forms of life in which there is birth from a father only?\u201d \u201cI know of none,\u201d he answered, and I inquired seriously. \u201cYou ask us to believe that for two thousand years there have been only women here, and only girl babies born?\u201d \u201cExactly,\u201d answered Somel, nodding gravely. \u201cOf course we know that among other animals it is not so, that there are fathers as well as mothers; and we see that you are fathers, that you come from a people who are of both kinds.

All this had been scant and in outline, but they quite understood. I find I succeed very poorly in conveying the impression I would like to of these women. So far from being ignorant, they were deeply wise--that we realized more and more; and for clear reasoning, for real brain scope and power they were A No."}, {"size": 614, "text": "1, but there were a lot of things they did not know. They had the evenest tempers, the most perfect patience and good nature--one of the things most impressive about them all was the absence of irritability.

We had gradually come to feel that we were in the hands of friends, and very capable ones at that--but we couldn\u2019t form any opinion yet of the general level of these women. \u201cWe want you to teach us all you can,\u201d Somel went on, her firm shapely hands clasped on the table before her, her clear quiet eyes meeting ours frankly."}, {"size": 637, "text": "\u201cAnd we want to teach you what we have that is novel and useful. You can well imagine that it is a wonderful event to us, to have men among us--after two thousand years.

To compare the history of two thousand years, to see what the differences are--between us, who are only mothers, and you, who are mothers and fathers, too.

Jeff came to the rescue. \u201cWe keep cattle for their milk, as well as for their meat,\u201d he explained. \u201cCow\u2019s milk is a staple article of diet. There is a great milk industry--to collect and distribute it.\u201d Still they looked puzzled.

We did get away, as described, and were peacefully brought back again without, as Terry complained, even the satisfaction of hitting anybody. There were no adventures because there was nothing to fight. There were no wild beasts in the country and very few tame ones. Of these I might as well stop to describe the one common pet of the country."}, {"size": 713, "text": "Cats, of course. But such cats! What do you suppose these Lady Burbanks had done with their cats? By the most prolonged and careful selection and exclusion they had developed a race of cats that did not sing! That\u2019s a fact. The most those poor dumb brutes could do was to make a kind of squeak when they were hungry or wanted the door open, and, of course, to purr, and make the various mother-noises to their kittens. Moreover, they had ceased to kill birds. They were rigorously bred to destroy mice and moles and all such enemies of the food supply; but the birds were numerous and safe. While we were discussing birds, Terry asked them if they used feathers for their hats, and they seemed amused at the idea."}, {"size": 631, "text": "He made a few sketches of our women\u2019s hats, with plumes and quills and those various tickling things that stick out so far; and they were eagerly interested, as at everything about our women.

In cold weather they wore caps or hoods. \u201cBut for decorative purposes--don\u2019t you think they would be becoming?\u201d pursued Terry, making as pretty a picture as he could of a lady with a plumed hat.

They never expressed horror or disapproval, nor indeed much surprise--just a keen interest. And the notes they made!--miles of them! But to return to our pussycats. We were a good deal impressed by this achievement in breeding, and when they questioned us--I can tell you we were well pumped for information--we told of what had been done for dogs and horses and cattle, but that there was no effort applied to cats, except for show purposes."}, {"size": 637, "text": "I wish I could represent the kind, quiet, steady, ingenious way they questioned us. It was not just curiosity--they weren\u2019t a bit more curious about us than we were about them, if as much.

Why, the hunting dogs and watchdogs and sheepdogs are useful--and sleddogs of course!--and ratters, I suppose, but we don\u2019t keep dogs for their USEFULNESS."}, {"size": 693, "text": "The dog is \u2018the friend of man,\u2019 we say--we love them.\u201d That they understood. \u201cWe love our cats that way.

Big, handsome silky things, friendly with everyone and devotedly attached to their special owners. \u201cYou must have a heartbreaking time drowning kittens,\u201d we suggested. But they said, \u201cOh, no! You see we care for them as you do for your valuable cattle.

You see, it is many centuries that we have been breeding the kind of cats we wanted. They are healthy and happy and friendly, as you see. How do you manage with your dogs? Do you keep them in pairs, or segregate the fathers, or what?\u201d Then we explained that--well, that it wasn\u2019t a question of fathers exactly; that nobody wanted a--a mother dog; that, well, that practically all our dogs were males--there was only a very small percentage of females allowed to live.

These were used in our education--and theirs.

And this is what happened, according to their records."}, {"size": 678, "text": "As to geography--at about the time of the Christian era this land had a free passage to the sea. I\u2019m not saying where, for good reasons. But there was a fairly easy pass through that wall of mountains behind us, and there is no doubt in my mind that these people were of Aryan stock, and were once in contact with the best civilization of the old world. They were \u201cwhite,\u201d but somewhat darker than our northern races because of their constant exposure to sun and air. The country was far larger then, including much land beyond the pass, and a strip of coast. They had ships, commerce, an army, a king--for at that time they were what they so calmly called us--a bi-sexual race."}, {"size": 760, "text": "What happened to them first was merely a succession of historic misfortunes such as have befallen other nations often enough. They were decimated by war, driven up from their coastline till finally the reduced population, with many of the men killed in battle, occupied this hinterland, and defended it for years, in the mountain passes. Where it was open to any possible attack from below they strengthened the natural defenses so that it became unscalably secure, as we found it. They were a polygamous people, and a slave-holding people, like all of their time; and during the generation or two of this struggle to defend their mountain home they built the fortresses, such as the one we were held in, and other of their oldest buildings, some still in use."}, {"size": 681, "text": "Nothing but earthquakes could destroy such architecture--huge solid blocks, holding by their own weight.

Instead of a passage, a new ridge, sheer and high, stood between them and the sea; they were walled in, and beneath that wall lay their whole little army."}, {"size": 603, "text": "Very few men were left alive, save the slaves; and these now seized their opportunity, rose in revolt, killed their remaining masters even to the youngest boy, killed the old women too, and the mothers, intending to take possession of the country with the remaining young women and girls.

There were many of them, and but few of these would-be masters, so the young women, instead of submitting, rose in sheer desperation and slew their brutal conquerors.

There was literally no one left on this beautiful high garden land but a bunch of hysterical girls and some older slave women. That was about two thousand years ago. At first there was a period of sheer despair. The mountains towered between them and their old enemies, but also between them and escape. There was no way up or down or out--they simply had to stay there. Some were for suicide, but not the majority. They must have been a plucky lot, as a whole, and they decided to live--as long as they did live. Of course they had hope, as youth must, that something would happen to change their fate. So they set to work, to bury the dead, to plow and sow, to care for one another."}, {"size": 650, "text": "Speaking of burying the dead, I will set down while I think of it, that they had adopted cremation in about the thirteenth century, for the same reason that they had left off raising cattle--they could not spare the room. They were much surprised to learn that we were still burying--asked our reasons for it, and were much dissatisfied with what we gave. We told them of the belief in the resurrection of the body, and they asked if our God was not as well able to resurrect from ashes as from long corruption. We told them of how people thought it repugnant to have their loved ones burn, and they asked if it was less repugnant to have them decay."}, {"size": 713, "text": "They were inconveniently reasonable, those women.

There were a handful of the younger matrons who had escaped slaughter, and a few babies were born after the cataclysm--but only two boys, and they both died.

I did my best, keenly interested as I have always been in sociology and social psychology, to reconstruct in my mind the real position of these ancient women.

Here at last was Motherhood, and though it was not for all of them personally, it might--if the power was inherited--found here a new race.

Presently there were twenty-five New Women, Mothers in their own right, and the whole spirit of the country changed from mourning and mere courageous resignation to proud joy. The older women, those who remembered men, died off; the youngest of all the first lot of course died too, after a while, and by that time there were left one hundred and fifty-five parthenogenetic women, founding a new race."}, {"size": 838, "text": "They inherited all that the devoted care of that declining band of original ones could leave them.

There you have the start of Herland! One family, all descended from one mother! She lived to a hundred years old; lived to see her hundred and twenty-five great-granddaughters born; lived as Queen-Priestess-Mother of them all; and died with a nobler pride and a fuller joy than perhaps any human soul has ever known--she alone had founded a new race!"}, {"size": 642, "text": "The first five daughters had grown up in an atmosphere of holy calm, of awed watchful waiting, of breathless prayer.

And besides--what\u2019s the good of talking sentiment when we are just men together?

Each girl, of course, was reared in full knowledge of her Crowning Office, and they had, even then, very high ideas of the molding powers of the mother, as well as those of education.

Then, as they grew more intelligent, this had turned into a sort of Maternal Pantheism. Here was Mother Earth, bearing fruit. All that they ate was fruit of motherhood, from seed or egg or their product.

And he tried. I can see it now, or at least much more of it, but it has taken me a long time, and a good deal of honest intellectual effort.

They very soon eliminated all the grazing cattle--sheep were the last to go, I believe. Also, they worked out a system of intensive agriculture surpassing anything I ever heard of, with the very forests all reset with fruit- or nut-bearing trees.

Mother-love with them was not a brute passion, a mere \u201cinstinct,\u201d a wholly personal feeling; it was--a religion. It included that limitless feeling of sisterhood, that wide unity in service, which was so difficult for us to grasp. And it was National, Racial, Human--oh, I don\u2019t know how to say it.

In this, as in so many other points we had now to observe, there was shown the action of a practical intelligence, coupled with fine artistic feeling, and, apparently, untrammeled by any injurious influences.

When I dug into the records to follow out any line of development, that was the most astonishing thing--the conscious effort to make it better.

They had early decided that trees were the best food plants, requiring far less labor in tilling the soil, and bearing a larger amount of food for the same ground space; also doing much to preserve and enrich the soil. Due regard had been paid to seasonable crops, and their fruit and nuts, grains and berries, kept on almost the year through."}, {"size": 650, "text": "On the higher part of the country, near the backing wall of mountains, they had a real winter with snow. Toward the south-eastern point, where there was a large valley with a lake whose outlet was subterranean, the climate was like that of California, and citrus fruits, figs, and olives grew abundantly. What impressed me particularly was their scheme of fertilization. Here was this little shut-in piece of land where one would have thought an ordinary people would have been starved out long ago or reduced to an annual struggle for life. These careful culturists had worked out a perfect scheme of refeeding the soil with all that came out of it."}, {"size": 743, "text": "All the scraps and leavings of their food, plant waste from lumber work or textile industry, all the solid matter from the sewage, properly treated and combined--everything which came from the earth went back to it. The practical result was like that in any healthy forest; an increasingly valuable soil was being built, instead of the progressive impoverishment so often seen in the rest of the world. When this first burst upon us we made such approving comments that they were surprised that such obvious common sense should be praised; asked what our methods were; and we had some difficulty in--well, in diverting them, by referring to the extent of our own land, and the--admitted--carelessness with which we had skimmed the cream of it."}, {"size": 817, "text": "At least we thought we had diverted them. Later I found that besides keeping a careful and accurate account of all we told them, they had a sort of skeleton chart, on which the things we said and the things we palpably avoided saying were all set down and studied. It really was child\u2019s play for those profound educators to work out a painfully accurate estimate of our conditions--in some lines. When a given line of observation seemed to lead to some very dreadful inference they always gave us the benefit of the doubt, leaving it open to further knowledge. Some of the things we had grown to accept as perfectly natural, or as belonging to our human limitations, they literally could not have believed; and, as I have said, we had all of us joined in a tacit endeavor to conceal much of the social status at home."}, {"size": 630, "text": "\u201cConfound their grandmotherly minds!\u201d Terry said. \u201cOf course they can\u2019t understand a Man\u2019s World!

We were invited, always courteously and with free choice on our part, to address general audiences and classes of girls.I remember the first time--and how careful we were about our clothes, and our amateur barbering. Terry, in particular, was fussy to a degree about the cut of his beard, and so critical of our combined efforts, that we handed him the shears and told him to please himself. We began to rather prize those beards of ours; they were almost our sole distinction among those tall and sturdy women, with their cropped hair and sexless costume."}, {"size": 705, "text": "Being offered a wide selection of garments, we had chosen according to our personal taste, and were surprised to find, on meeting large audiences, that we were the most highly decorated, especially Terry. He was a very impressive figure, his strong features softened by the somewhat longer hair--though he made me trim it as closely as I knew how; and he wore his richly embroidered tunic with its broad, loose girdle with quite a Henry V air. Jeff looked more like--well, like a Huguenot Lover; and I don\u2019t know what I looked like, only that I felt very comfortable. When I got back to our own padded armor and its starched borders I realized with acute regret how comfortable were those Herland clothes."}, {"size": 612, "text": "We scanned that audience, looking for the three bright faces we knew; but they were not to be seen. Just a multitude of girls: quiet, eager, watchful, all eyes and ears to listen and learn. We had been urged to give, as fully as we cared to, a sort of synopsis of world history, in brief, and to answer questions. \u201cWe are so utterly ignorant, you see,\u201d Moadine had explained to us. \u201cWe know nothing but such science as we have worked out for ourselves, just the brain work of one small half-country; and you, we gather, have helped one another all over the globe, sharing your discoveries, pooling your progress."}, {"size": 729, "text": "How wonderful, how supremely beautiful your civilization must be!\u201d Somel gave a further suggestion. \u201cYou do not have to begin all over again, as you did with us. We have made a sort of digest of what we have learned from you, and it has been eagerly absorbed, all over the country. Perhaps you would like to see our outline?\u201d We were eager to see it, and deeply impressed. To us, at first, these women, unavoidably ignorant of what to us was the basic commonplace of knowledge, had seemed on the plane of children, or of savages. What we had been forced to admit, with growing acquaintance, was that they were ignorant as Plato and Aristotle were, but with a highly developed mentality quite comparable to that of Ancient Greece."}, {"size": 665, "text": "Far be it from me to lumber these pages with an account of what we so imperfectly strove to teach them. The memorable fact is what they taught us, or some faint glimpse of it. And at present, our major interest was not at all in the subject matter of our talk, but in the audience. Girls--hundreds of them--eager, bright-eyed, attentive young faces; crowding questions, and, I regret to say, an increasing inability on our part to answer them effectively. Our special guides, who were on the platform with us, and sometimes aided in clarifying a question or, oftener, an answer, noticed this effect, and closed the formal lecture part of the evening rather shortly."}, {"size": 679, "text": "\u201cOur young women will be glad to meet you,\u201d Somel suggested, \u201cto talk with you more personally, if you are willing?\u201d Willing!

Even then, with all those eager young things waiting to talk to us, a sudden question crossed my mind: \u201cWhat was their point of view? What did they think of us?\u201d We learned that later. Terry plunged in among those young creatures with a sort of rapture, somewhat as a glad swimmer takes to the sea. Jeff, with a rapt look on his high-bred face, approached as to a sacrament. But I was a little chilled by that last thought of mine, and kept my eyes open."}, {"size": 614, "text": "I found time to watch Jeff, even while I was surrounded by an eager group of questioners--as we all were--and saw how his worshipping eyes, his grave courtesy, pleased and drew some of them; while others, rather stronger spirits they looked to be, drew away from his group to Terry\u2019s or mine. I watched Terry with special interest, knowing how he had longed for this time, and how irresistible he had always been at home. And I could see, just in snatches, of course, how his suave and masterful approach seemed to irritate them; his too-intimate glances were vaguely resented, his compliments puzzled and annoyed."}, {"size": 673, "text": "Sometimes a girl would flush, not with drooped eyelids and inviting timidity, but with anger and a quick lift of the head. Girl after girl turned on her heel and left him, till he had but a small ring of questioners, and they, visibly, were the least \u201cgirlish\u201d of the lot. I saw him looking pleased at first, as if he thought he was making a strong impression; but, finally, casting a look at Jeff, or me, he seemed less pleased--and less. As for me, I was most agreeably surprised. At home I never was \u201cpopular.\u201d I had my girl friends, good ones, but they were friends--nothing else. Also they were of somewhat the same clan, not popular in the sense of swarming admirers."}, {"size": 605, "text": "But here, to my astonishment, I found my crowd was the largest. I have to generalize, of course, rather telescoping many impressions; but the first evening was a good sample of the impression we made. Jeff had a following, if I may call it that, of the more sentimental--though that\u2019s not the word I want. The less practical, perhaps; the girls who were artists of some sort, ethicists, teachers--that kind. Terry was reduced to a rather combative group: keen, logical, inquiring minds, not overly sensitive, the very kind he liked least; while, as for me--I became quite cocky over my general popularity."}, {"size": 778, "text": "Terry was furious about it. We could hardly blame him. \u201cGirls!\u201d he burst forth, when that evening was over and we were by ourselves once more. \u201cCall those GIRLS!\u201d \u201cMost delightful girls, I call them,\u201d said Jeff, his blue eyes dreamily contented. \u201cWhat do YOU call them?\u201d I mildly inquired. \u201cBoys! Nothing but boys, most of \u2018em. A standoffish, disagreeable lot at that. Critical, impertinent youngsters. No girls at all.\u201d He was angry and severe, not a little jealous, too, I think. Afterward, when he found out just what it was they did not like, he changed his manner somewhat and got on better. He had to. For, in spite of his criticism, they were girls, and, furthermore, all the girls there were! Always excepting our three!--with whom we presently renewed our acquaintance."}, {"size": 681, "text": "When it came to courtship, which it soon did, I can of course best describe my own--and am least inclined to.

At that, it was not smooth sailing. They broke and quarreled, over and over; he would rush off to console himself with some other fair one--the other fair one would have none of him--and he would drift back to Alima, becoming more and more devoted each time."}, {"size": 601, "text": "She never gave an inch.

Catch them if possible; tame and train them if necessary This may be a chance to re-establish a bi-sexual state for our people.\u201d They were not afraid of us--three million highly intelligent women--or two million, counting only grown-ups--were not likely to be afraid of three young men.

They thought--very cautiously and farsightedly--of picking us, if it seemed wise. All that time we were in training they studied us, analyzed us, prepared reports about us, and this information was widely disseminated all about the land. Not a girl in that country had not been learning for months as much as could be gathered about our country, our culture, our personal characters. No wonder their questions were hard to answer.

They were interested, profoundly interested, but it was not the kind of interest we were looking for. To get an idea of their attitude you have to hold in mind their extremely high sense of solidarity. They were not each choosing a lover; they hadn\u2019t the faintest idea of love--sex-love, that is. These girls--to each of whom motherhood was a lodestar, and that motherhood exalted above a mere personal function, looked forward to as the highest social service, as the sacrament of a lifetime--were now confronted with an opportunity to make the great step of changing their whole status, of reverting to their earlier bi-sexual order of nature."}, {"size": 627, "text": "Beside this underlying consideration there was the limitless interest and curiosity in our civilization, purely impersonal, and held by an order of mind beside which we were like--schoolboys. It was small wonder that our lectures were not a success; and none at all that our, or at least Terry\u2019s, advances were so ill received. The reason for my own comparative success was at first far from pleasing to my pride. \u201cWe like you the best,\u201d Somel told me, \u201cbecause you seem more like us.\u201d \u201cMore like a lot of women!\u201d I thought to myself disgustedly, and then remembered how little like \u201cwomen,\u201d in our derogatory sense, they were."}, {"size": 653, "text": "She was smiling at me, reading my thought. \u201cWe can quite see that we do not seem like--women--to you. Of course, in a bi-sexual race the distinctive feature of each sex must be intensified. But surely there are characteristics enough which belong to People, aren\u2019t there? That\u2019s what I mean about you being more like us--more like People. We feel at ease with you.\u201d Jeff\u2019s difficulty was his exalted gallantry. He idealized women, and was always looking for a chance to \u201cprotect\u201d or to \u201cserve\u201d them. These needed neither protection nor service.

Terry\u2019s jewels and trinkets they prized as curios; handed them about, asking questions as to workmanship, not in the least as to value; and discussed not ownership, but which museum to put them in. When a man has nothing to give a woman, is dependent wholly on his personal attraction, his courtship is under limitations. They were considering these two things: the advisability of making the Great Change; and the degree of personal adaptability which would best serve that end."}, {"size": 672, "text": "Here we had the advantage of our small personal experience with those three fleet forest girls; and that served to draw us together. As for Ellador: Suppose you come to a strange land and find it pleasant enough--just a little more than ordinarily pleasant--and then you find rich farmland, and then gardens, gorgeous gardens, and then palaces full of rare and curious treasures--incalculable, inexhaustible, and then--mountains--like the Himalayas, and then the sea.

Through her sympathetic intelligence I became more and more comprehending of the spirit of the people of Herland, more and more appreciative of its marvelous inner growth as well as outer perfection. I ceased to feel a stranger, a prisoner. There was a sense of understanding, of identity, of purpose."}, {"size": 619, "text": "We discussed--everything. And, as I traveled farther and farther, exploring the rich, sweet soul of her, my sense of pleasant friendship became but a broad foundation for such height, such breadth, such interlocked combination of feeling as left me fairly blinded with the wonder of it.

She taught me games and I taught her games, and we raced and rowed and had all manner of fun, as well as higher comradeship. Then, as I got on farther, the palace and treasures and snowy mountain ranges opened up. I had never known there could be such a human being. So--great. I don\u2019t mean talented. She was a forester--one of the best--but it was not that gift I mean. When I say GREAT, I mean great--big, all through.

I felt my own soul rise and lift its wings, as it were. Life got bigger. It seemed as if I understood--as I never had before--as if I could Do things--as if I too could grow--if she would help me. And then It came--to both of us, all at once. A still day--on the edge of the world, their world.

Ellador was brown: hair dark and soft, like a seal coat; clear brown skin with a healthy red in it; brown eyes--all the way from topaz to black velvet they seemed to range--splendid girls, all of them.

They had kept watch over our hooded machine, taking turns at it; and when our escape was announced, had followed along-side for a day or two, and been there at the last, as described. They felt a special claim on us--called us \u201ctheir men\u201d--and when we were at liberty to study the land and people, and be studied by them, their claim was recognized by the wise leaders. But I felt, we all did, that we should have chosen them among millions, unerringly.

The \u201clong suit\u201d in most courtships is sex attraction, of course. Then gradually develops such comradeship as the two temperaments allow. Then, after marriage, there is either the establishment of a slow-growing, widely based friendship, the deepest, tenderest, sweetest of relations, all lit and warmed by the recurrent flame of love; or else that process is reversed, love cools and fades, no friendship grows, the whole relation turns from beauty to ashes."}, {"size": 813, "text": "Here everything was different. There was no sex-feeling to appeal to, or practically none. Two thousand years\u2019 disuse had left very little of the instinct; also we must remember that those who had at times manifested it as atavistic exceptions were often, by that very fact, denied motherhood. Yet while the mother process remains, the inherent ground for sex-distinction remains also; and who shall say what long-forgotten feeling, vague and nameless, was stirred in some of these mother hearts by our arrival? What left us even more at sea in our approach was the lack of any sex-tradition.

The differences in the education of the average man and woman are great enough, but the trouble they make is not mostly for the man; he generally carries out his own views of the case.

This tradition relates the woman to the man. He goes on with his business, and she adapts herself to him and to it.

And perhaps she was a bit nervous, I don\u2019t know, but she got Moadine to come and stay next door to her. Also, she had a sturdy assistant detailed to accompany her in her work.

Terry put in practice his pet conviction that a woman loves to be mastered, and by sheer brute force, in all the pride and passion of his intense masculinity, he tried to master this woman.

They had the different peoples of the earth roughly outlined, and their status in civilization indicated. They had charts and figures and estimates, based on the facts in that traitorous little book and what they had learned from us. Somel explained: \u201cWe find that in all your historic period, so much longer than ours, that with all the interplay of services, the exchange of inventions and discoveries, and the wonderful progress we so admire, that in this widespread Other World of yours, there is still much disease, often contagious.\u201d We admitted this at once."}, {"size": 643, "text": "\u201cAlso there is still, in varying degree, ignorance, with prejudice and unbridled emotion.\u201d This too was admitted. \u201cWe find also that in spite of the advance of democracy and the increase of wealth, that there is still unrest and sometimes combat.\u201d Yes, yes, we admitted it all. We were used to these things and saw no reason for so much seriousness. \u201cAll things considered,\u201d they said, and they did not say a hundredth part of the things they were considering, \u201cwe are unwilling to expose our country to free communication with the rest of the world--as yet. If Ellador comes back, and we approve her report, it may be done later--but not yet."}, {"size": 784, "text": "\u201cSo we have this to ask of you gentlemen [they knew that word was held a title of honor with us], that you promise not in any way to betray the location of this country until permission--after Ellador\u2019s return.\u201d Jeff was perfectly satisfied. He thought they were quite right. He always did. I never saw an alien become naturalized more quickly than that man in Herland. I studied it awhile, thinking of the time they\u2019d have if some of our contagions got loose there, and concluded they were right. So I agreed. Terry was the obstacle. \u201cIndeed I won\u2019t!\u201d he protested. \u201cThe first thing I\u2019ll do is to get an expedition fixed up to force an entrance into Ma-land.\u201d \u201cThen,\u201d they said quite calmly, \u201che must remain an absolute prisoner, always.\u201d \u201cAnesthesia would be kinder,\u201d urged Moadine."}, {"size": 124, "text": "\u201cAnd safer,\u201d added Zava. \u201cHe will promise, I think,\u201d said Ellador.
