The Fairy Tale of Father Brown ONE -- The Absence of Mr GlassTHE consulting-rooms of Dr Orion Hood, the eminent criminologist and specialist in certain moral disorders, lay along the sea-front at Scarborough, in a series of very large and well-lighted french windows, which showed the North Sea like one endless outer wall of blue-green marble."}, {"size": 806, "text": "In such a place the sea had something of the monotony of a blue-green dado: for the chambers themselves were ruled throughout by a terrible tidiness not unlike the terrible tidiness of the sea. It must not be supposed that Dr Hood\u2019s apartments excluded luxury, or even poetry. These things were there, in their place; but one felt that they were never allowed out of their place. Luxury was there: there stood upon a special table eight or ten boxes of the best cigars; but they were built upon a plan so that the strongest were always nearest the wall and the mildest nearest the window. A tantalus containing three kinds of spirit, all of a liqueur excellence, stood always on this table of luxury; but the fanciful have asserted that the whisky, brandy, and rum seemed always to stand at the same level."}, {"size": 750, "text": "Poetry was there: the left-hand corner of the room was lined with as complete a set of English classics as the right hand could show of English and foreign physiologists. But if one took a volume of Chaucer or Shelley from that rank, its absence irritated the mind like a gap in a man\u2019s front teeth. One could not say the books were never read; probably they were, but there was a sense of their being chained to their places, like the Bibles in the old churches. Dr Hood treated his private book-shelf as if it were a public library. And if this strict scientific intangibility steeped even the shelves laden with lyrics and ballads and the tables laden with drink and tobacco, it goes without saying that yet more of such heathen holiness protected"}, {"size": 729, "text": "the other shelves that held the specialist\u2019s library, and the other tables that sustained the frail and even fairylike instruments of chemistry or mechanics. Dr Hood paced the length of his string of apartments, bounded--as the boys\u2019 geographies say--on the east by the North Sea and on the west by the serried ranks of his sociological and criminologist library. He was clad in an artist\u2019s velvet, but with none of an artist\u2019s negligence; his hair was heavily shot with grey, but growing thick and healthy; his face was lean, but sanguine and expectant. Everything about him and his room indicated something at once rigid and restless, like that great northern sea by which (on pure principles of hygiene) he had built his home."}, {"size": 772, "text": "Fate, being in a funny mood, pushed the door open and introduced into those long, strict, sea-flanked apartments one who was perhaps the most startling opposite of them and their master. In answer to a curt but civil summons, the door opened inwards and there shambled into the room a shapeless little figure, which seemed to find its own hat and umbrella as unmanageable as a mass of luggage. The umbrella was a black and prosaic bundle long past repair; the hat was a broad-curved black hat, clerical but not common in England; the man was the very embodiment of all that is homely and helpless. The doctor regarded the new-comer with a restrained astonishment, not unlike that he would have shown if some huge but obviously harmless sea-beast had crawled into his room."}, {"size": 608, "text": "The new-comer regarded the doctor with that beaming but breathless geniality which characterizes a corpulent charwoman who has just managed to stuff herself into an omnibus. It is a rich confusion of social self-congratulation and bodily disarray. His hat tumbled to the carpet, his heavy umbrella slipped between his knees with a thud; he reached after the one and ducked after the other, but with an unimpaired smile on his round face spoke simultaneously as follows: \u201cMy name is Brown. Pray excuse me. I\u2019ve come about that business of the MacNabs. I have heard, you often help people out of such troubles."}, {"size": 656, "text": "Pray excuse me if I am wrong.\u201d By this time he had sprawlingly recovered the hat, and made an odd little bobbing bow over it, as if setting everything quite right. \u201cI hardly understand you,\u201d replied the scientist, with a cold intensity of manner. \u201cI fear you have mistaken the chambers. I am Dr Hood, and my work is almost entirely literary and educational. It is true that I have sometimes been consulted by the police in cases of peculiar difficulty and importance, but--\u201d \u201cOh, this is of the greatest importance,\u201d broke in the little man called Brown. \u201cWhy, her mother won\u2019t let them get engaged.\u201d And he leaned back in his chair in radiant rationality."}, {"size": 721, "text": "The brows of Dr Hood were drawn down darkly, but the eyes under them were bright with something that might be anger or might be amusement. \u201cAnd still,\u201d he said, \u201cI do not quite understand.\u201d \u201cYou see, they want to get married,\u201d said the man with the clerical hat. \u201cMaggie MacNab and young Todhunter want to get married. Now, what can be more important than that?\u201d The great Orion Hood\u2019s scientific triumphs had deprived him of many things--some said of his health, others of his God; but they had not wholly despoiled him of his sense of the absurd. At the last plea of the ingenuous priest a chuckle broke out of him from inside, and he threw himself into an arm-chair in an ironical attitude of the consulting physician."}, {"size": 602, "text": "\u201cMr Brown,\u201d he said gravely, \u201cit is quite fourteen and a half years since I was personally asked to test a personal problem: then it was the case of an attempt to poison the French President at a Lord Mayor\u2019s Banquet. It is now, I understand, a question of whether some friend of yours called Maggie is a suitable fiancee for some friend of hers called Todhunter. Well, Mr Brown, I am a sportsman. I will take it on. I will give the MacNab family my best advice, as good as I gave the French Republic and the King of England--no, better: fourteen years better. I have nothing else to do this afternoon."}, {"size": 668, "text": "Tell me your story.\u201d The little clergyman called Brown thanked him with unquestionable warmth, but still with a queer kind of simplicity. It was rather as if he were thanking a stranger in a smoking-room for some trouble in passing the matches, than as if he were (as he was) practically thanking the Curator of Kew Gardens for coming with him into a field to find a four-leaved clover. With scarcely a semi-colon after his hearty thanks, the little man began his recital: \u201cI told you my name was Brown; well, that\u2019s the fact, and I\u2019m the priest of the little Catholic Church I dare say you\u2019ve seen beyond those straggly streets, where the town ends towards the north."}, {"size": 786, "text": "In the last and straggliest of those streets which runs along the sea like a sea-wall there is a very honest but rather sharp-tempered member of my flock, a widow called MacNab. She has one daughter, and she lets lodgings, and between her and the daughter, and between her and the lodgers--well, I dare say there is a great deal to be said on both sides. At present she has only one lodger, the young man called Todhunter; but he has given more trouble than all the rest, for he wants to marry the young woman of the house.\u201d \u201cAnd the young woman of the house,\u201d asked Dr Hood, with huge and silent amusement, \u201cwhat does she want?\u201d \u201cWhy, she wants to marry him,\u201d cried Father Brown, sitting up eagerly. \u201cThat is just the awful complication.\u201d \u201cIt is indeed a hideous enigma,\u201d said Dr Hood."}, {"size": 625, "text": "\u201cThis young James Todhunter,\u201d continued the cleric, \u201cis a very decent man so far as I know; but then nobody knows very much. He is a bright, brownish little fellow, agile like a monkey, clean-shaven like an actor, and obliging like a born courtier. He seems to have quite a pocketful of money, but nobody knows what his trade is. Mrs MacNab, therefore (being of a pessimistic turn), is quite sure it is something dreadful, and probably connected with dynamite. The dynamite must be of a shy and noiseless sort, for the poor fellow only shuts himself up for several hours of the day and studies something behind a locked door."}, {"size": 683, "text": "He declares his privacy is temporary and justified, and promises to explain before the wedding. That is all that anyone knows for certain, but Mrs MacNab will tell you a great deal more than even she is certain of. You know how the tales grow like grass on such a patch of ignorance as that. There are tales of two voices heard talking in the room; though, when the door is opened, Todhunter is always found alone. There are tales of a mysterious tall man in a silk hat, who once came out of the sea-mists and apparently out of the sea, stepping softly across the sandy fields and through the small back garden at twilight, till he was heard talking to the lodger at his open window."}, {"size": 661, "text": "The colloquy seemed to end in a quarrel. Todhunter dashed down his window with violence, and the man in the high hat melted into the sea-fog again. This story is told by the family with the fiercest mystification; but I really think Mrs MacNab prefers her own original tale: that the Other Man (or whatever it is) crawls out every night from the big box in the corner, which is kept locked all day. You see, therefore, how this sealed door of Todhunter\u2019s is treated as the gate of all the fancies and monstrosities of the \u2018Thousand and One Nights\u2019. And yet there is the little fellow in his respectable black jacket, as punctual and innocent as a parlour clock."}, {"size": 702, "text": "He pays his rent to the tick; he is practically a teetotaller; he is tirelessly kind with the younger children, and can keep them amused for a day on end; and, last and most urgent of all, he has made himself equally popular with the eldest daughter, who is ready to go to church with him tomorrow.\u201d A man warmly concerned with any large theories has always a relish for applying them to any triviality. The great specialist having condescended to the priest\u2019s simplicity, condescended expansively. He settled himself with comfort in his arm-chair and began to talk in the tone of a somewhat absent-minded lecturer: \u201cEven in a minute instance, it is best to look first to the main tendencies of Nature."}, {"size": 602, "text": "A particular flower may not be dead in early winter, but the flowers are dying; a particular pebble may never be wetted with the tide, but the tide is coming in. To the scientific eye all human history is a series of collective movements, destructions or migrations, like the massacre of flies in winter or the return of birds in spring. Now the root fact in all history is Race. Race produces religion; Race produces legal and ethical wars. There is no stronger case than that of the wild, unworldly and perishing stock which we commonly call the Celts, of whom your friends the MacNabs are specimens."}, {"size": 629, "text": "Small, swarthy, and of this dreamy and drifting blood, they accept easily the superstitious explanation of any incidents, just as they still accept (you will excuse me for saying) that superstitious explanation of all incidents which you and your Church represent. It is not remarkable that such people, with the sea moaning behind them and the Church (excuse me again) droning in front of them, should put fantastic features into what are probably plain events. You, with your small parochial responsibilities, see only this particular Mrs MacNab, terrified with this particular tale of two voices and a tall man out of the sea."}, {"size": 762, "text": "But the man with the scientific imagination sees, as it were, the whole clans of MacNab scattered over the whole world, in its ultimate average as uniform as a tribe of birds. He sees thousands of Mrs MacNabs, in thousands of houses, dropping their little drop of morbidity in the tea-cups of their friends; he sees--\u201d Before the scientist could conclude his sentence, another and more impatient summons sounded from without; someone with swishing skirts was marshalled hurriedly down the corridor, and the door opened on a young girl, decently dressed but disordered and red-hot with haste. She had sea-blown blonde hair, and would have been entirely beautiful if her cheek-bones had not been, in the Scotch manner, a little high in relief as well as in colour."}, {"size": 627, "text": "Her apology was almost as abrupt as a command. \u201cI\u2019m sorry to interrupt you, sir,\u201d she said, \u201cbut I had to follow Father Brown at once; it\u2019s nothing less than life or death.\u201d Father Brown began to get to his feet in some disorder. \u201cWhy, what has happened, Maggie?\u201d he said. \u201cJames has been murdered, for all I can make out,\u201d answered the girl, still breathing hard from her rush. \u201cThat man Glass has been with him again; I heard them talking through the door quite plain. Two separate voices: for James speaks low, with a burr, and the other voice was high and quavery.\u201d \u201cThat man Glass?\u201d repeated the priest in some perplexity."}, {"size": 695, "text": "\u201cI know his name is Glass,\u201d answered the girl, in great impatience. \u201cI heard it through the door. They were quarrelling--about money, I think--for I heard James say again and again, \u2018That\u2019s right, Mr Glass,\u2019 or \u2018No, Mr Glass,\u2019 and then, \u2018Two or three, Mr Glass.\u2019 But we\u2019re talking too much; you must come at once, and there may be time yet.\u201d \u201cBut time for what?\u201d asked Dr Hood, who had been studying the young lady with marked interest. \u201cWhat is there about Mr Glass and his money troubles that should impel such urgency?\u201d \u201cI tried to break down the door and couldn\u2019t,\u201d answered the girl shortly, \u201cThen I ran to the back-yard, and managed to climb on to the window-sill that looks into the room."}, {"size": 833, "text": "It was all dim, and seemed to be empty, but I swear I saw James lying huddled up in a corner, as if he were drugged or strangled.\u201d \u201cThis is very serious,\u201d said Father Brown, gathering his errant hat and umbrella and standing up; \u201cin point of fact I was just putting your case before this gentleman, and his view--\u201d \u201cHas been largely altered,\u201d said the scientist gravely. \u201cI do not think this young lady is so Celtic as I had supposed. As I have nothing else to do, I will put on my hat and stroll down town with you.\u201d In a few minutes all three were approaching the dreary tail of the MacNabs\u2019 street: the girl with the stern and breathless stride of the mountaineer, the criminologist with a lounging grace (which was not without a certain leopard-like swiftness), and the priest at an energetic trot entirely devoid of distinction."}, {"size": 666, "text": "The aspect of this edge of the town was not entirely without justification for the doctor\u2019s hints about desolate moods and environments. The scattered houses stood farther and farther apart in a broken string along the seashore; the afternoon was closing with a premature and partly lurid twilight; the sea was of an inky purple and murmuring ominously. In the scrappy back garden of the MacNabs which ran down towards the sand, two black, barren-looking trees stood up like demon hands held up in astonishment, and as Mrs MacNab ran down the street to meet them with lean hands similarly spread, and her fierce face in shadow, she was a little like a demon herself."}, {"size": 625, "text": "The doctor and the priest made scant reply to her shrill reiterations of her daughter\u2019s story, with more disturbing details of her own, to the divided vows of vengeance against Mr Glass for murdering, and against Mr Todhunter for being murdered, or against the latter for having dared to want to marry her daughter, and for not having lived to do it. They passed through the narrow passage in the front of the house until they came to the lodger\u2019s door at the back, and there Dr Hood, with the trick of an old detective, put his shoulder sharply to the panel and burst in the door. It opened on a scene of silent catastrophe."}, {"size": 634, "text": "No one seeing it, even for a flash, could doubt that the room had been the theatre of some thrilling collision between two, or perhaps more, persons. Playing-cards lay littered across the table or fluttered about the floor as if a game had been interrupted. Two wine glasses stood ready for wine on a side-table, but a third lay smashed in a star of crystal upon the carpet. A few feet from it lay what looked like a long knife or short sword, straight, but with an ornamental and pictured handle, its dull blade just caught a grey glint from the dreary window behind, which showed the black trees against the leaden level of the sea."}, {"size": 687, "text": "Towards the opposite corner of the room was rolled a gentleman\u2019s silk top hat, as if it had just been knocked off his head; so much so, indeed, that one almost looked to see it still rolling. And in the corner behind it, thrown like a sack of potatoes, but corded like a railway trunk, lay Mr James Todhunter, with a scarf across his mouth, and six or seven ropes knotted round his elbows and ankles. His brown eyes were alive and shifted alertly. Dr Orion Hood paused for one instant on the doormat and drank in the whole scene of voiceless violence. Then he stepped swiftly across the carpet, picked up the tall silk hat, and gravely put it upon the head of the yet pinioned Todhunter."}, {"size": 656, "text": "It was so much too large for him that it almost slipped down on to his shoulders. \u201cMr Glass\u2019s hat,\u201d said the doctor, returning with it and peering into the inside with a pocket lens. \u201cHow to explain the absence of Mr Glass and the presence of Mr Glass\u2019s hat? For Mr Glass is not a careless man with his clothes. That hat is of a stylish shape and systematically brushed and burnished, though not very new. An old dandy, I should think.\u201d \u201cBut, good heavens!\u201d called out Miss MacNab, \u201caren\u2019t you going to untie the man first?\u201d \u201cI say \u2018old\u2019 with intention, though not with certainty\u201d continued the expositor; \u201cmy reason for it might seem a little far-fetched."}, {"size": 725, "text": "The hair of human beings falls out in very varying degrees, but almost always falls out slightly, and with the lens I should see the tiny hairs in a hat recently worn. It has none, which leads me to guess that Mr Glass is bald. Now when this is taken with the high-pitched and querulous voice which Miss MacNab described so vividly (patience, my dear lady, patience), when we take the hairless head together with the tone common in senile anger, I should think we may deduce some advance in years. Nevertheless, he was probably vigorous, and he was almost certainly tall. I might rely in some degree on the story of his previous appearance at the window, as a tall man in a silk hat, but I think I have more exact indication."}, {"size": 631, "text": "This wineglass has been smashed all over the place, but one of its splinters lies on the high bracket beside the mantelpiece. No such fragment could have fallen there if the vessel had been smashed in the hand of a comparatively short man like Mr Todhunter.\u201d \u201cBy the way,\u201d said Father Brown, \u201cmight it not be as well to untie Mr Todhunter?\u201d \u201cOur lesson from the drinking-vessels does not end here,\u201d proceeded the specialist. \u201cI may say at once that it is possible that the man Glass was bald or nervous through dissipation rather than age. Mr Todhunter, as has been remarked, is a quiet thrifty gentleman, essentially an abstainer."}, {"size": 801, "text": "These cards and wine-cups are no part of his normal habit; they have been produced for a particular companion. But, as it happens, we may go farther. Mr Todhunter may or may not possess this wine-service, but there is no appearance of his possessing any wine. What, then, were these vessels to contain? I would at once suggest some brandy or whisky, perhaps of a luxurious sort, from a flask in the pocket of Mr Glass. We have thus something like a picture of the man, or at least of the type: tall, elderly, fashionable, but somewhat frayed, certainly fond of play and strong waters, perhaps rather too fond of them. Mr Glass is a gentleman not unknown on the fringes of society.\u201d \u201cLook here,\u201d cried the young woman, \u201cif you don\u2019t let me pass to untie him I\u2019ll run outside and scream for the police.\u201d"}, {"size": 703, "text": "\u201cI should not advise you, Miss MacNab,\u201d said Dr Hood gravely, \u201cto be in any hurry to fetch the police. Father Brown, I seriously ask you to compose your flock, for their sakes, not for mine. Well, we have seen something of the figure and quality of Mr Glass; what are the chief facts known of Mr Todhunter? They are substantially three: that he is economical, that he is more or less wealthy, and that he has a secret. Now, surely it is obvious that there are the three chief marks of the kind of man who is blackmailed. And surely it is equally obvious that the faded finery, the profligate habits, and the shrill irritation of Mr Glass are the unmistakable marks of the kind of man who blackmails him."}, {"size": 751, "text": "We have the two typical figures of a tragedy of hush money: on the one hand, the respectable man with a mystery; on the other, the West-end vulture with a scent for a mystery. These two men have met here today and have quarrelled, using blows and a bare weapon.\u201d \u201cAre you going to take those ropes off?\u201d asked the girl stubbornly. Dr Hood replaced the silk hat carefully on the side table, and went across to the captive. He studied him intently, even moving him a little and half-turning him round by the shoulders, but he only answered: \u201cNo; I think these ropes will do very well till your friends the police bring the handcuffs.\u201d Father Brown, who had been looking dully at the carpet, lifted his round face and said: \u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d The man of"}, {"size": 614, "text": "science had picked up the peculiar dagger-sword from the carpet and was examining it intently as he answered: \u201cBecause you find Mr Todhunter tied up,\u201d he said, \u201cyou all jump to the conclusion that Mr Glass had tied him up; and then, I suppose, escaped. There are four objections to this: First, why should a gentleman so dressy as our friend Glass leave his hat behind him, if he left of his own free will? Second,\u201d he continued, moving towards the window, \u201cthis is the only exit, and it is locked on the inside. Third, this blade here has a tiny touch of blood at the point, but there is no wound on Mr Todhunter."}, {"size": 748, "text": "Mr Glass took that wound away with him, dead or alive. Add to all this primary probability. It is much more likely that the blackmailed person would try to kill his incubus, rather than that the blackmailer would try to kill the goose that lays his golden egg. There, I think, we have a pretty complete story.\u201d \u201cBut the ropes?\u201d inquired the priest, whose eyes had remained open with a rather vacant admiration. \u201cAh, the ropes,\u201d said the expert with a singular intonation. \u201cMiss MacNab very much wanted to know why I did not set Mr Todhunter free from his ropes. Well, I will tell her. I did not do it because Mr Todhunter can set himself free from them at any minute he chooses.\u201d \u201cWhat?\u201d cried the audience on quite different notes of astonishment."}, {"size": 707, "text": "\u201cI have looked at all the knots on Mr Todhunter,\u201d reiterated Hood quietly. \u201cI happen to know something about knots; they are quite a branch of criminal science. Every one of those knots he has made himself and could loosen himself; not one of them would have been made by an enemy really trying to pinion him. The whole of this affair of the ropes is a clever fake, to make us think him the victim of the struggle instead of the wretched Glass, whose corpse may be hidden in the garden or stuffed up the chimney.\u201d There was a rather depressed silence; the room was darkening, the sea-blighted boughs of the garden trees looked leaner and blacker than ever, yet they seemed to have come nearer to the window."}, {"size": 635, "text": "One could almost fancy they were sea-monsters like krakens or cuttlefish, writhing polypi who had crawled up from the sea to see the end of this tragedy, even as he, the villain and victim of it, the terrible man in the tall hat, had once crawled up from the sea. For the whole air was dense with the morbidity of blackmail, which is the most morbid of human things, because it is a crime concealing a crime; a black plaster on a blacker wound. The face of the little Catholic priest, which was commonly complacent and even comic, had suddenly become knotted with a curious frown. It was not the blank curiosity of his first innocence."}, {"size": 612, "text": "It was rather that creative curiosity which comes when a man has the beginnings of an idea. \u201cSay it again, please,\u201d he said in a simple, bothered manner; \u201cdo you mean that Todhunter can tie himself up all alone and untie himself all alone?\u201d \u201cThat is what I mean,\u201d said the doctor. \u201cJerusalem!\u201d ejaculated Brown suddenly, \u201cI wonder if it could possibly be that!\u201d He scuttled across the room rather like a rabbit, and peered with quite a new impulsiveness into the partially-covered face of the captive. Then he turned his own rather fatuous face to the company. \u201cYes, that\u2019s it!\u201d he cried in a certain excitement."}, {"size": 879, "text": "\u201cCan\u2019t you see it in the man\u2019s face? Why, look at his eyes!\u201d Both the Professor and the girl followed the direction of his glance.

He laughed very much over the hat, still more uproariously over the broken glass, but the blood on the sword point sent him into mortal convulsions of amusement. Then he turned to the fuming specialist."}, {"size": 722, "text": "\u201cDr Hood,\u201d he cried enthusiastically, \u201cyou are a great poet! You have called an uncreated being out of the void.

Indeed, the mere facts are rather commonplace and comic by comparison.\u201d \u201cI have no notion what you are talking about,\u201d said Dr Hood rather haughtily; \u201cmy facts are all inevitable, though necessarily incomplete. A place may be permitted to intuition, perhaps (or poetry if you prefer the term), but only because the corresponding details cannot as yet be ascertained.

On the impulse of the moment I warned her brother that she might be in peril; I said nothing of its nature, for I did not know. But if it meant this capture in the hills, the thing is nonsense.

He had lately even discovered a noiseless explosive, the secret of which the Government was carefully guarding.

In about half a minute, however, the inner door opened, and she entered as she always did, even in private life, so that the very silence seemed to be a roar of applause, and one well-deserved."}, {"size": 865, "text": "She was clad in a somewhat strange garb of peacock green and peacock blue satins, that gleamed like blue and green metals, such as delight children and aesthetes, and her heavy, hot brown hair framed one of those magic faces which are dangerous to all men, but especially to boys and to men growing grey. In company with her male colleague, the great American actor, Isidore Bruno, she was producing a particularly poetical and fantastic interpretation of Midsummer Night\u2019s Dream: in which the artistic prominence was given to Oberon and Titania, or in other words to Bruno and herself. Set in dreamy and exquisite scenery, and moving in mystical dances, the green costume, like burnished beetle-wings, expressed all the elusive individuality of an elfin queen. But when personally confronted in what was still broad daylight, a man looked only at the woman\u2019s face."}, {"size": 659, "text": "She greeted both men with the beaming and baffling smile which kept so many males at the same just dangerous distance from her. She accepted some flowers from Cutler, which were as tropical and expensive as his victories; and another sort of present from Sir Wilson Seymour, offered later on and more nonchalantly by that gentleman. For it was against his breeding to show eagerness, and against his conventional unconventionality to give anything so obvious as flowers. He had picked up a trifle, he said, which was rather a curiosity, it was an ancient Greek dagger of the Mycenaean Epoch, and might well have been worn in the time of Theseus and Hippolyta."}, {"size": 607, "text": "It was made of brass like all the Heroic weapons, but, oddly enough, sharp enough to prick anyone still. He had really been attracted to it by the leaf-like shape; it was as perfect as a Greek vase. If it was of any interest to Miss Rome or could come in anywhere in the play, he hoped she would-- The inner door burst open and a big figure appeared, who was more of a contrast to the explanatory Seymour than even Captain Cutler. Nearly six-foot-six, and of more than theatrical thews and muscles, Isidore Bruno, in the gorgeous leopard skin and golden-brown garments of Oberon, looked like a barbaric god."}, {"size": 713, "text": "He leaned on a sort of hunting-spear, which across a theatre looked a slight, silvery wand, but which in the small and comparatively crowded room looked as plain as a pike-staff--and as menacing. His vivid black eyes rolled volcanically, his bronzed face, handsome as it was, showed at that moment a combination of high cheekbones with set white teeth, which recalled certain American conjectures about his origin in the Southern plantations. \u201cAurora,\u201d he began, in that deep voice like a drum of passion that had moved so many audiences, \u201cwill you--\u201d He stopped indecisively because a sixth figure had suddenly presented itself just inside the doorway--a figure so incongruous in the scene as to be almost comic."}, {"size": 646, "text": "It was a very short man in the black uniform of the Roman secular clergy, and looking (especially in such a presence as Bruno\u2019s and Aurora\u2019s) rather like the wooden Noah out of an ark. He did not, however, seem conscious of any contrast, but said with dull civility: \u201cI believe Miss Rome sent for me.\u201d A shrewd observer might have remarked that the emotional temperature rather rose at so unemotional an interruption. The detachment of a professional celibate seemed to reveal to the others that they stood round the woman as a ring of amorous rivals; just as a stranger coming in with frost on his coat will reveal that a room is like a furnace."}, {"size": 617, "text": "The presence of the one man who did not care about her increased Miss Rome\u2019s sense that everybody else was in love with her, and each in a somewhat dangerous way: the actor with all the appetite of a savage and a spoilt child; the soldier with all the simple selfishness of a man of will rather than mind; Sir Wilson with that daily hardening concentration with which old Hedonists take to a hobby; nay, even the abject Parkinson, who had known her before her triumphs, and who followed her about the room with eyes or feet, with the dumb fascination of a dog. A shrewd person might also have noted a yet odder thing."}, {"size": 614, "text": "The man like a black wooden Noah (who was not wholly without shrewdness) noted it with a considerable but contained amusement. It was evident that the great Aurora, though by no means indifferent to the admiration of the other sex, wanted at this moment to get rid of all the men who admired her and be left alone with the man who did not--did not admire her in that sense at least; for the little priest did admire and even enjoy the firm feminine diplomacy with which she set about her task. There was, perhaps, only one thing that Aurora Rome was clever about, and that was one half of humanity--the other half."}, {"size": 628, "text": "The little priest watched, like a Napoleonic campaign, the swift precision of her policy for expelling all while banishing none. Bruno, the big actor, was so babyish that it was easy to send him off in brute sulks, banging the door. Cutler, the British officer, was pachydermatous to ideas, but punctilious about behaviour. He would ignore all hints, but he would die rather than ignore a definite commission from a lady. As to old Seymour, he had to be treated differently; he had to be left to the last. The only way to move him was to appeal to him in confidence as an old friend, to let him into the secret of the clearance."}, {"size": 676, "text": "The priest did really admire Miss Rome as she achieved all these three objects in one selected action. She went across to Captain Cutler and said in her sweetest manner: \u201cI shall value all these flowers, because they must be your favourite flowers. But they won\u2019t be complete, you know, without my favourite flower. Do go over to that shop round the corner and get me some lilies-of-the-valley, and then it will be quite lovely.\u201d The first object of her diplomacy, the exit of the enraged Bruno, was at once achieved. He had already handed his spear in a lordly style, like a sceptre, to the piteous Parkinson, and was about to assume one of the cushioned seats like a throne."}, {"size": 845, "text": "But at this open appeal to his rival there glowed in his opal eyeballs all the sensitive insolence of the slave; he knotted his enormous brown fists for an instant, and then, dashing open the door, disappeared into his own apartments beyond. But meanwhile Miss Rome\u2019s experiment in mobilizing the British Army had not succeeded so simply as seemed probable. Cutler had indeed risen stiffly and suddenly, and walked towards the door, hatless, as if at a word of command. But perhaps there was something ostentatiously elegant about the languid figure of Seymour leaning against one of the looking-glasses that brought him up short at the entrance, turning his head this way and that like a bewildered bulldog. \u201cI must show this stupid man where to go,\u201d said Aurora in a whisper to Seymour, and ran out to the threshold to speed the parting guest."}, {"size": 726, "text": "Seymour seemed to be listening, elegant and unconscious as was his posture, and he seemed relieved when he heard the lady call out some last instructions to the Captain, and then turn sharply and run laughing down the passage towards the other end, the end on the terrace above the Thames. Yet a second or two after Seymour\u2019s brow darkened again. A man in his position has so many rivals, and he remembered that at the other end of the passage was the corresponding entrance to Bruno\u2019s private room. He did not lose his dignity; he said some civil words to Father Brown about the revival of Byzantine architecture in the Westminster Cathedral, and then, quite naturally, strolled out himself into the upper end of the passage."}, {"size": 612, "text": "Father Brown and Parkinson were left alone, and they were neither of them men with a taste for superfluous conversation. The dresser went round the room, pulling out looking-glasses and pushing them in again, his dingy dark coat and trousers looking all the more dismal since he was still holding the festive fairy spear of King Oberon. Every time he pulled out the frame of a new glass, a new black figure of Father Brown appeared; the absurd glass chamber was full of Father Browns, upside down in the air like angels, turning somersaults like acrobats, turning their backs to everybody like very rude persons."}, {"size": 602, "text": "Father Brown seemed quite unconscious of this cloud of witnesses, but followed Parkinson with an idly attentive eye till he took himself and his absurd spear into the farther room of Bruno. Then he abandoned himself to such abstract meditations as always amused him--calculating the angles of the mirrors, the angles of each refraction, the angle at which each must fit into the wall...when he heard a strong but strangled cry. He sprang to his feet and stood rigidly listening. At the same instant Sir Wilson Seymour burst back into the room, white as ivory. \u201cWho\u2019s that man in the passage?\u201d he cried."}, {"size": 718, "text": "\u201cWhere\u2019s that dagger of mine?\u201d Before Father Brown could turn in his heavy boots Seymour was plunging about the room looking for the weapon. And before he could possibly find that weapon or any other, a brisk running of feet broke upon the pavement outside, and the square face of Cutler was thrust into the same doorway. He was still grotesquely grasping a bunch of lilies-of-the-valley. \u201cWhat\u2019s this?\u201d he cried. \u201cWhat\u2019s that creature down the passage? Is this some of your tricks?\u201d \u201cMy tricks!\u201d hissed his pale rival, and made a stride towards him. In the instant of time in which all this happened Father Brown stepped out into the top of the passage, looked down it, and at once walked briskly towards what he saw."}, {"size": 714, "text": "At this the other two men dropped their quarrel and darted after him, Cutler calling out: \u201cWhat are you doing? Who are you?\u201d \u201cMy name is Brown,\u201d said the priest sadly, as he bent over something and straightened himself again. \u201cMiss Rome sent for me, and I came as quickly as I could. I have come too late.\u201d The three men looked down, and in one of them at least the life died in that late light of afternoon. It ran along the passage like a path of gold, and in the midst of it Aurora Rome lay lustrous in her robes of green and gold, with her dead face turned upwards. Her dress was torn away as in a struggle, leaving the right shoulder bare, but the wound from which the blood was welling was on the other side."}, {"size": 867, "text": "The brass dagger lay flat and gleaming a yard or so away. There was a blank stillness for a measurable time, so that they could hear far off a flower-girl\u2019s laugh outside Charing Cross, and someone whistling furiously for a taxicab in one of the streets off the Strand. Then the Captain, with a movement so sudden that it might have been passion or play-acting, took Sir Wilson Seymour by the throat. Seymour looked at him steadily without either fight or fear. \u201cYou need not kill me,\u201d he said in a voice quite cold; \u201cI shall do that on my own account.\u201d The Captain\u2019s hand hesitated and dropped; and the other added with the same icy candour: \u201cIf I find I haven\u2019t the nerve to do it with that dagger I can do it in a month with drink.\u201d \u201cDrink isn\u2019t good enough for me,\u201d replied Cutler, \u201cbut I\u2019ll have blood for this before I die.

As he did so, old Parkinson tottered in his wavering way out of the door and caught sight of the corpse lying in the passage. He moved shakily towards it; looked at it weakly with a working face; then moved shakily back into the dressing-room again, and sat down suddenly on one of the richly cushioned chairs. Father Brown instantly ran across to him, taking no notice of Cutler and the colossal actor, though the room already rang with their blows and they began to struggle for the dagger. Seymour, who retained some practical sense, was whistling for the police at the end of the passage."}, {"size": 653, "text": "When the police arrived it was to tear the two men from an almost ape-like grapple; and, after a few formal inquiries, to arrest Isidore Bruno upon a charge of murder, brought against him by his furious opponent. The idea that the great national hero of the hour had arrested a wrongdoer with his own hand doubtless had its weight with the police, who are not without elements of the journalist. They treated Cutler with a certain solemn attention, and pointed out that he had got a slight slash on the hand. Even as Cutler bore him back across tilted chair and table, Bruno had twisted the dagger out of his grasp and disabled him just below the wrist."}, {"size": 677, "text": "The injury was really slight, but till he was removed from the room the half-savage prisoner stared at the running blood with a steady smile. \u201cLooks a cannibal sort of chap, don\u2019t he?\u201d said the constable confidentially to Cutler. Cutler made no answer, but said sharply a moment after: \u201cWe must attend to the...the death...\u201d and his voice escaped from articulation. \u201cThe two deaths,\u201d came in the voice of the priest from the farther side of the room. \u201cThis poor fellow was gone when I got across to him.\u201d And he stood looking down at old Parkinson, who sat in a black huddle on the gorgeous chair. He also had paid his tribute, not without eloquence, to the woman who had died."}, {"size": 620, "text": "The silence was first broken by Cutler, who seemed not untouched by a rough tenderness. \u201cI wish I was him,\u201d he said huskily. \u201cI remember he used to watch her wherever she walked more than--anybody. She was his air, and he\u2019s dried up. He\u2019s just dead.\u201d \u201cWe are all dead,\u201d said Seymour in a strange voice, looking down the road. They took leave of Father Brown at the corner of the road, with some random apologies for any rudeness they might have shown. Both their faces were tragic, but also cryptic. The mind of the little priest was always a rabbit-warren of wild thoughts that jumped too quickly for him to catch them."}, {"size": 622, "text": "Like the white tail of a rabbit he had the vanishing thought that he was certain of their grief, but not so certain of their innocence. \u201cWe had better all be going,\u201d said Seymour heavily; \u201cwe have done all we can to help.\u201d \u201cWill you understand my motives,\u201d asked Father Brown quietly, \u201cif I say you have done all you can to hurt?\u201d They both started as if guiltily, and Cutler said sharply: \u201cTo hurt whom?\u201d \u201cTo hurt yourselves,\u201d answered the priest. \u201cI would not add to your troubles if it weren\u2019t common justice to warn you.

You hurt yourselves with that; and then Captain Cutler must have hurt himself with the dagger.\u201d \u201cHurt myself!\u201d exclaimed the Captain, with contempt. \u201cA silly little scratch.\u201d \u201cWhich drew blood,\u201d replied the priest, nodding. \u201cWe know there\u2019s blood on the brass now. And so we shall never know whether there was blood on it before.\u201d There was a silence; and then Seymour said, with an emphasis quite alien to his daily accent: \u201cBut I saw a man in the passage.\u201d \u201cI know you did,\u201d answered the cleric Brown with a face of wood, \u201cso did Captain Cutler."}, {"size": 637, "text": "That\u2019s what seems so improbable.\u201d Before either could make sufficient sense of it even to answer, Father Brown had politely excused himself and gone stumping up the road with his stumpy old umbrella. As modern newspapers are conducted, the most honest and most important news is the police news. If it be true that in the twentieth century more space is given to murder than to politics, it is for the excellent reason that murder is a more serious subject.

The true reason, of course, was the coincidence of persons. The victim was a popular actress; the accused was a popular actor; and the accused had been caught red-handed, as it were, by the most popular soldier of the patriotic season. In those extraordinary circumstances the Press was paralysed into probity and accuracy; and the rest of this somewhat singular business can practically be recorded from reports of Bruno\u2019s trial."}, {"size": 606, "text": "The trial was presided over by Mr Justice Monkhouse, one of those who are jeered at as humorous judges, but who are generally much more serious than the serious judges, for their levity comes from a living impatience of professional solemnity; while the serious judge is really filled with frivolity, because he is filled with vanity. All the chief actors being of a worldly importance, the barristers were well balanced; the prosecutor for the Crown was Sir Walter Cowdray, a heavy, but weighty advocate of the sort that knows how to seem English and trustworthy, and how to be rhetorical with reluctance."}, {"size": 633, "text": "The prisoner was defended by Mr Patrick Butler, K.C., who was mistaken for a mere flaneur by those who misunderstood the Irish character--and those who had not been examined by him. The medical evidence involved no contradictions, the doctor, whom Seymour had summoned on the spot, agreeing with the eminent surgeon who had later examined the body. Aurora Rome had been stabbed with some sharp instrument such as a knife or dagger; some instrument, at least, of which the blade was short. The wound was just over the heart, and she had died instantly. When the doctor first saw her she could hardly have been dead for twenty minutes."}, {"size": 750, "text": "Therefore when Father Brown found her she could hardly have been dead for three.

When these details had been supplied, though not explained, the first of the important witnesses was called. Sir Wilson Seymour gave evidence as he did everything else that he did at all--not only well, but perfectly.

Miss Rome had then gone just outside the theatre to the entrance of the passage, in order to point out to Captain Cutler a flower-shop at which he was to buy her some more flowers; and the witness had remained in the room, exchanging a few words with the priest."}, {"size": 788, "text": "He had then distinctly heard the deceased, having sent the Captain on his errand, turn round laughing and run down the passage towards its other end, where was the prisoner\u2019s dressing-room.

Did he see anything in the passage? Yes; he saw something in the passage. Sir Walter Cowdray allowed an impressive interval, during which the witness looked down, and for all his usual composure seemed to have more than his usual pallor.

They seemed to be holding their eyes away from the prisoner by main force; but they felt his figure in the dock, and they felt it as gigantic. Tall as Bruno was to the eye, he seemed to swell taller and taller when an eyes had been torn away from him.

But the man was plainly shaken with sorrow and sincere anger, and Cowdray quickly excused him from confirming facts that were already fairly clear.

I crouched behind the fence which ran not more than two hundred yards from one wing of the great mansion, and which was fortunately split in places, as if specially for the application of a cautious eye.

If the convict was not keeping the shot for Todd, as he evidently wasn\u2019t, it is most likely that he was keeping it for Lord Falconroy; and it looks as if he had delivered the goods.

Nor indeed was the expression altogether misleading. It might truly be said of him, as for many journalists in authority, that his most familiar emotion was one of continuous fear; fear of libel actions, fear of lost advertisements, fear of misprints, fear of the sack."}, {"size": 722, "text": "His life was a series of distracted compromises between the proprietor of the paper (and of him), who was a senile soap-boiler with three ineradicable mistakes in his mind, and the very able staff he had collected to run the paper; some of whom were brilliant and experienced men and (what was even worse) sincere enthusiasts for the political policy of the paper. A letter from one of these lay immediately before him, and rapid and resolute as he was, he seemed almost to hesitate before opening it. He took up a strip of proof instead, ran down it with a blue eye, and a blue pencil, altered the word \u201cadultery\u201d to the word \u201cimpropriety,\u201d and the word \u201cJew\u201d to the word \u201cAlien,\u201d rang a bell and sent it flying upstairs."}, {"size": 616, "text": "Then, with a more thoughtful eye, he ripped open the letter from his more distinguished contributor, which bore a postmark of Devonshire, and read as follows: DEAR NUTT,--As I see you\u2019re working Spooks and Dooks at the same time, what about an article on that rum business of the Eyres of Exmoor; or as the old women call it down here, the Devil\u2019s Ear of Eyre? The head of the family, you know, is the Duke of Exmoor; he is one of the few really stiff old Tory aristocrats left, a sound old crusted tyrant it is quite in our line to make trouble about.

But that is not the point. The point is that there really is something queer about Exmoor and his family; something quite natural, I dare say, but quite abnormal. And the Ear is in it somehow, I fancy; either a symbol or a delusion or disease or something.

I suggest a series of articles pointing out how dreary, how inhuman, how downright diabolist, is the very smell and atmosphere of some of these great houses.

It was only when I saw his broad curved hat lying on the table beside him that I realized why I connected him with anything ancient. He was a Roman Catholic priest.

The unobtrusive yet unusual colour was all the more notable because his hair was almost unnaturally healthy and curling, and he wore it full.

So we got on very well together; but the third man, the old gentleman in the tight pantaloons, seemed rather distant and haughty, until I slid into the subject of the Duke of Exmoor and his ancestry.

It was built by the Pendragons in the very days of the Spanish wars; and though it\u2019s needed patching and even rebuilding for another reason, it\u2019s always been rebuilt in the old way."}, {"size": 801, "text": "The story goes that the lady of Sir Peter Pendragon built it in this place and to this height, because from the top you can just see the corner where vessels turn into the river mouth; and she wished to be the first to see her husband\u2019s ship, as he sailed home from the Spanish Main.\u201d \u201cFor what other reason,\u201d asked Father Brown, \u201cdo you mean that it has been rebuilt?\u201d \u201cOh, there\u2019s a strange story about that, too,\u201d said the young squire with relish. \u201cYou are really in a land of strange stories. King Arthur was here and Merlin and the fairies before him. The story goes that Sir Peter Pendragon, who (I fear) had some of the faults of the pirates as well as the virtues of the sailor, was bringing home three Spanish gentlemen in honourable captivity, intending to escort them to Elizabeth\u2019s court."}, {"size": 708, "text": "But he was a man of flaming and tigerish temper, and coming to high words with one of them, he caught him by the throat and flung him by accident or design, into the sea. A second Spaniard, who was the brother of the first, instantly drew his sword and flew at Pendragon, and after a short but furious combat in which both got three wounds in as many minutes, Pendragon drove his blade through the other\u2019s body and the second Spaniard was accounted for. As it happened the ship had already turned into the river mouth and was close to comparatively shallow water. The third Spaniard sprang over the side of the ship, struck out for the shore, and was soon near enough to it to stand up to his waist in water."}, {"size": 698, "text": "And turning again to face the ship, and holding up both arms to Heaven--like a prophet calling plagues upon a wicked city--he called out to Pendragon in a piercing and terrible voice, that he at least was yet living, that he would go on living, that he would live for ever; and that generation after generation the house of Pendragon should never see him or his, but should know by very certain signs that he and his vengeance were alive. With that he dived under the wave, and was either drowned or swam so long under water that no hair of his head was seen afterwards.\u201d \u201cThere\u2019s that girl in the canoe again,\u201d said Flambeau irrelevantly, for good-looking young women would call him off any topic."}, {"size": 650, "text": "\u201cShe seems bothered by the queer tower just as we were.\u201d Indeed, the black-haired young lady was letting her canoe float slowly and silently past the strange islet; and was looking intently up at the strange tower, with a strong glow of curiosity on her oval and olive face. \u201cNever mind girls,\u201d said Fanshaw impatiently, \u201cthere are plenty of them in the world, but not many things like the Pendragon Tower. As you may easily suppose, plenty of superstitions and scandals have followed in the track of the Spaniard\u2019s curse; and no doubt, as you would put it, any accident happening to this Cornish family would be connected with it by rural credulity."}, {"size": 875, "text": "But it is perfectly true that this tower has been burnt down two or three times; and the family can\u2019t be called lucky, for more than two, I think, of the Admiral\u2019s near kin have perished by shipwreck; and one at least, to my own knowledge, on practically the same spot where Sir Peter threw the Spaniard overboard.\u201d \u201cWhat a pity!\u201d exclaimed Flambeau. \u201cShe\u2019s going.\u201d \u201cWhen did your friend the Admiral tell you this family history?\u201d asked Father Brown, as the girl in the canoe paddled off, without showing the least intention of extending her interest from the tower to the yacht, which Fanshaw had already caused to lie alongside the island. \u201cMany years ago,\u201d replied Fanshaw; \u201che hasn\u2019t been to sea for some time now, though he is as keen on it as ever.

They entered a wooded avenue between two fences of thin greyish wood, such as often enclose parks or gardens, and over the top of which the dark trees tossed to and fro like black and purple plumes upon the hearse of a giant. The tower, as they left it behind, looked all the quainter, because such entrances are usually flanked by two towers; and this one looked lopsided."}, {"size": 629, "text": "But for this, the avenue had the usual appearance of the entrance to a gentleman\u2019s grounds; and, being so curved that the house was now out of sight, somehow looked a much larger park than any plantation on such an island could really be. Father Brown was, perhaps, a little fanciful in his fatigue, but he almost thought the whole place must be growing larger, as things do in a nightmare. Anyhow, a mystical monotony was the only character of their march, until Fanshaw suddenly stopped, and pointed to something sticking out through the grey fence--something that looked at first rather like the imprisoned horn of some beast."}, {"size": 798, "text": "Closer observation showed that it was a slightly curved blade of metal that shone faintly in the fading light. Flambeau, who like all Frenchmen had been a soldier, bent over it and said in a startled voice: \u201cWhy, it\u2019s a sabre! I believe I know the sort, heavy and curved, but shorter than the cavalry; they used to have them in artillery and the--\u201d As he spoke the blade plucked itself out of the crack it had made and came down again with a more ponderous slash, splitting the fissiparous fence to the bottom with a rending noise. Then it was pulled out again, flashed above the fence some feet further along, and again split it halfway down with the first stroke; and after waggling a little to extricate itself (accompanied with curses in the darkness) split it down to the ground with a second."}, {"size": 816, "text": "Then a kick of devilish energy sent the whole loosened square of thin wood flying into the pathway, and a great gap of dark coppice gaped in the paling. Fanshaw peered into the dark opening and uttered an exclamation of astonishment. \u201cMy dear Admiral!\u201d he exclaimed, \u201cdo you--er--do you generally cut out a new front door whenever you want to go for a walk?\u201d The voice in the gloom swore again, and then broke into a jolly laugh. \u201cNo,\u201d it said; \u201cI\u2019ve really got to cut down this fence somehow; it\u2019s spoiling all the plants, and no one else here can do it. But I\u2019ll only carve another bit off the front door, and then come out and welcome you.\u201d And sure enough, he heaved up his weapon once more, and, hacking twice, brought down another and similar strip of fence, making the opening about fourteen feet wide in all."}, {"size": 706, "text": "Then through this larger forest gateway he came out into the evening light, with a chip of grey wood sticking to his sword-blade. He momentarily fulfilled all Fanshaw\u2019s fable of an old piratical Admiral; though the details seemed afterwards to decompose into accidents. For instance, he wore a broad-brimmed hat as protection against the sun; but the front flap of it was turned up straight to the sky, and the two corners pulled down lower than the ears, so that it stood across his forehead in a crescent like the old cocked hat worn by Nelson. He wore an ordinary dark-blue jacket, with nothing special about the buttons, but the combination of it with white linen trousers somehow had a sailorish look."}, {"size": 867, "text": "He was tall and loose, and walked with a sort of swagger, which was not a sailor\u2019s roll, and yet somehow suggested it; and he held in his hand a short sabre which was like a navy cutlass, but about twice as big. Under the bridge of the hat his eagle face looked eager, all the more because it was not only clean-shaven, but without eyebrows. It seemed almost as if all the hair had come off his face from his thrusting it through a throng of elements. His eyes were prominent and piercing. His colour was curiously attractive, while partly tropical; it reminded one vaguely of a blood-orange. That is, that while it was ruddy and sanguine, there was a yellow in it that was in no way sickly, but seemed rather to glow like gold apples of the Hesperides--Father Brown thought he had never seen a figure so expressive of all the romances about the countries of the Sun."}, {"size": 647, "text": "When Fanshaw had presented his two friends to their host he fell again into a tone of rallying the latter about his wreckage of the fence and his apparent rage of profanity. The Admiral pooh-poohed it at first as a piece of necessary but annoying garden work; but at length the ring of real energy came back into his laughter, and he cried with a mixture of impatience and good humour: \u201cWell, perhaps I do go at it a bit rabidly, and feel a kind of pleasure in smashing anything. So would you if your only pleasure was in cruising about to find some new Cannibal Islands, and you had to stick on this muddy little rockery in a sort of rustic pond."}, {"size": 770, "text": "When I remember how I\u2019ve cut down a mile and a half of green poisonous jungle with an old cutlass half as sharp as this; and then remember I must stop here and chop this matchwood, because of some confounded old bargain scribbled in a family Bible, why, I--\u201d He swung up the heavy steel again; and this time sundered the wall of wood from top to bottom at one stroke. \u201cI feel like that,\u201d he said laughing, but furiously flinging the sword some yards down the path, \u201cand now let\u2019s go up to the house; you must have some dinner.\u201d The semicircle of lawn in front of the house was varied by three circular garden beds, one of red tulips, a second of yellow tulips, and the third of some white, waxen-looking blossoms that the visitors did not know and presumed to be exotic."}, {"size": 740, "text": "A heavy, hairy and rather sullen-looking gardener was hanging up a heavy coil of garden hose. The corners of the expiring sunset which seemed to cling about the corners of the house gave glimpses here and there of the colours of remoter flowerbeds; and in a treeless space on one side of the house opening upon the river stood a tall brass tripod on which was tilted a big brass telescope. Just outside the steps of the porch stood a little painted green garden table, as if someone had just had tea there. The entrance was flanked with two of those half-featured lumps of stone with holes for eyes that are said to be South Sea idols; and on the brown oak beam across the doorway were some confused carvings that looked almost as barbaric."}, {"size": 697, "text": "As they passed indoors, the little cleric hopped suddenly on to the table, and standing on it peered unaffectedly through his spectacles at the mouldings in the oak. Admiral Pendragon looked very much astonished, though not particularly annoyed; while Fanshaw was so amused with what looked like a performing pigmy on his little stand, that he could not control his laughter. But Father Brown was not likely to notice either the laughter or the astonishment. He was gazing at three carved symbols, which, though very worn and obscure, seemed still to convey some sense to him. The first seemed to be the outline of some tower or other building, crowned with what looked like curly-pointed ribbons."}, {"size": 716, "text": "The second was clearer: an old Elizabethan galley with decorative waves beneath it, but interrupted in the middle by a curious jagged rock, which was either a fault in the wood or some conventional representation of the water coming in. The third represented the upper half of a human figure, ending in an escalloped line like the waves; the face was rubbed and featureless, and both arms were held very stiffly up in the air. \u201cWell,\u201d muttered Father Brown, blinking, \u201chere is the legend of the Spaniard plain enough. Here he is holding up his arms and cursing in the sea; and here are the two curses: the wrecked ship and the burning of Pendragon Tower.\u201d Pendragon shook his head with a kind of venerable amusement."}, {"size": 651, "text": "\u201cAnd how many other things might it not be?\u201d he said. \u201cDon\u2019t you know that that sort of half-man, like a half-lion or half-stag, is quite common in heraldry? Might not that line through the ship be one of those parti-per-pale lines, indented, I think they call it? And though the third thing isn\u2019t so very heraldic, it would be more heraldic to suppose it a tower crowned with laurel than with fire; and it looks just as like it.\u201d \u201cBut it seems rather odd,\u201d said Flambeau, \u201cthat it should exactly confirm the old legend.\u201d \u201cAh,\u201d replied the sceptical traveller, \u201cbut you don\u2019t know how much of the old legend may have been made up from the old figures."}, {"size": 673, "text": "Besides, it isn\u2019t the only old legend. Fanshaw, here, who is fond of such things, will tell you there are other versions of the tale, and much more horrible ones. One story credits my unfortunate ancestor with having had the Spaniard cut in two; and that will fit the pretty picture also. Another obligingly credits our family with the possession of a tower full of snakes and explains those little, wriggly things in that way. And a third theory supposes the crooked line on the ship to be a conventionalized thunderbolt; but that alone, if seriously examined, would show what a very little way these unhappy coincidences really go.\u201d \u201cWhy, how do you mean?\u201d asked Fanshaw."}, {"size": 600, "text": "\u201cIt so happens,\u201d replied his host coolly, \u201cthat there was no thunder and lightning at all in the two or three shipwrecks I know of in our family.\u201d \u201cOh!\u201d said Father Brown, and jumped down from the little table. There was another silence in which they heard the continuous murmur of the river; then Fanshaw said, in a doubtful and perhaps disappointed tone: \u201cThen you don\u2019t think there is anything in the tales of the tower in flames?\u201d \u201cThere are the tales, of course,\u201d said the Admiral, shrugging his shoulders; \u201cand some of them, I don\u2019t deny, on evidence as decent as one ever gets for such things."}, {"size": 630, "text": "Someone saw a blaze hereabout, don\u2019t you know, as he walked home through a wood; someone keeping sheep on the uplands inland thought he saw a flame hovering over Pendragon Tower.

They were all thrown a little off their balance, and the more fanciful Fanshaw had even some difficulty in recovering his, as they saw a long, thin stream of blue smoke ascending silently into the end of the evening light."}, {"size": 639, "text": "Then Pendragon broke into a scornful laugh again. \u201cGipsies!\u201d he said; \u201cthey\u2019ve been camping about here for about a week. Gentlemen, you want your dinner,\u201d and he turned as if to enter the house. But the antiquarian superstition in Fanshaw was still quivering, and he said hastily: \u201cBut, Admiral, what\u2019s that hissing noise quite near the island? It\u2019s very like fire.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s more like what it is,\u201d said the Admiral, laughing as he led the way; \u201cit\u2019s only some canoe going by.\u201d Almost as he spoke, the butler, a lean man in black, with very black hair and a very long, yellow face, appeared in the doorway and told him that dinner was served."}, {"size": 610, "text": "The dining-room was as nautical as the cabin of a ship; but its note was rather that of the modern than the Elizabethan captain. There were, indeed, three antiquated cutlasses in a trophy over the fireplace, and one brown sixteenth-century map with Tritons and little ships dotted about a curly sea. But such things were less prominent on the white panelling than some cases of quaint-coloured South American birds, very scientifically stuffed, fantastic shells from the Pacific, and several instruments so rude and queer in shape that savages might have used them either to kill their enemies or to cook them."}, {"size": 754, "text": "But the alien colour culminated in the fact that, besides the butler, the Admiral\u2019s only servants were two negroes, somewhat quaintly clad in tight uniforms of yellow. The priest\u2019s instinctive trick of analysing his own impressions told him that the colour and the little neat coat-tails of these bipeds had suggested the word \u201cCanary,\u201d and so by a mere pun connected them with southward travel. Towards the end of the dinner they took their yellow clothes and black faces out of the room, leaving only the black clothes and yellow face of the butler. \u201cI\u2019m rather sorry you take this so lightly,\u201d said Fanshaw to the host; \u201cfor the truth is, I\u2019ve brought these friends of mine with the idea of their helping you, as they know a good deal of these things."}, {"size": 655, "text": "Don\u2019t you really believe in the family story at all?\u201d \u201cI don\u2019t believe in anything,\u201d answered Pendragon very briskly, with a bright eye cocked at a red tropical bird. \u201cI\u2019m a man of science.\u201d Rather to Flambeau\u2019s surprise, his clerical friend, who seemed to have entirely woken up, took up the digression and talked natural history with his host with a flow of words and much unexpected information, until the dessert and decanters were set down and the last of the servants vanished. Then he said, without altering his tone. \u201cPlease don\u2019t think me impertinent, Admiral Pendragon.

Fanshaw, with his fairy tales, would say my blood moved against men with that black, Spanish-looking hair.\u201d Flambeau struck the table with his heavy fist. \u201cBy Jove!\u201d he cried; \u201cand so had that girl!\u201d \u201cI hope it\u2019ll all end tonight,\u201d continued the Admiral, \u201cwhen my nephew comes back safe from his ship."}, {"size": 673, "text": "You looked surprised.

You see, my father had two sons; I remained a bachelor, but my elder brother married, and had a son who became a sailor like all the rest of us, and will inherit the proper estate. Well, my father was a strange man; he somehow combined Fanshaw\u2019s superstition with a good deal of my scepticism--they were always fighting in him; and after my first voyages, he developed a notion which he thought somehow would settle finally whether the curse was truth or trash.

He drank and put down the glass with a composed face; but his hand had started at the exact moment when he became conscious of a face looking in through the garden window just behind the Admiral--the face of a woman, swarthy, with southern hair and eyes, and young, but like a mask of tragedy.

But he remained composed; and never took his eye off the patch of flame which had begun by spreading, but now seemed to shrink a little as it hissed under the torch of the long silver spear of water. He kept his finger along the nozzle of the pipe to ensure the aim, and attended to no other business, knowing only by the noise and that semi-conscious corner of the eye, the exciting incidents that began to tumble themselves about the island garden."}, {"size": 626, "text": "He gave two brief directions to his friends. One was: \u201cKnock these fellows down somehow and tie them up, whoever they are; there\u2019s rope down by those faggots.

Ask her if they could get some buckets across and fill them from the river.\u201d Then he closed his mouth and continued to water the new red flower as ruthlessly as he had watered the red tulip.

Flambeau\u2019s enormous strength more than redressed the odds in the fight, especially as the fourth man still hovered near the house, only a shadow and a voice. He heard also the water broken by the paddles of a canoe; the girl\u2019s voice giving orders, the voices of gipsies answering and coming nearer, the plumping and sucking noise of empty buckets plunged into a full stream; and finally the sound of many feet around the fire. But all this was less to him than the fact that the red rent, which had lately once more increased, had once more slightly diminished."}, {"size": 661, "text": "Then came a cry that very nearly made him turn his head.

It was echoed by a howl not to be called human, as the being broke from their hold and ran along the garden. Three times at least it raced round the whole island, in a way that was as horrible as the chase of a lunatic, both in the cries of the pursued and the ropes carried by the pursuers; but was more horrible still, because it somehow suggested one of the chasing games of children in a garden."}, {"size": 753, "text": "Then, finding them closing in on every side, the figure sprang upon one of the higher river banks and disappeared with a splash into the dark and driving river. \u201cYou can do no more, I fear,\u201d said Brown in a voice cold with pain. \u201cHe has been washed down to the rocks by now, where he has sent so many others.

A light fall of snow had half-melted into a few strips, also looking leaden rather than silver, when it had been fixed again by the seal of frost; no fresh snow had fallen, but a ribbon of the old snow ran along the very margin of the coast, so as to parallel the pale ribbon of the foam."}, {"size": 671, "text": "The line of the sea looked frozen in the very vividness of its violet-blue, like the vein of a frozen finger.

At last he said thoughtfully: \u201cWant to get out? Why, no. I rather think I want to get in.\u201d And he dived into the darkness under the wooden floor so abruptly as to knock off his big curved clerical hat and leave it lying on the boards above, without any clerical head in it.

Following his finger, Flambeau saw for the first time the corners of a building nearer than the farmhouse, but screened for the most part with a fringe of trees.

As they drew nearer and nearer to the place they saw in front of the buffet, which was apparently closed, one of the iron garden-seats with curly backs that had adorned the gardens, but much longer, running almost the whole length of the frontage. Presumably, it was placed so that visitors might sit there and look at the sea, but one hardly expected to find anyone doing it in such weather. Nevertheless, just in front of the extreme end of the iron seat stood a small round restaurant table, and on this stood a small bottle of Chablis and a plate of almonds and raisins."}, {"size": 726, "text": "Behind the table and on the seat sat a dark-haired young man, bareheaded, and gazing at the sea in a state of almost astonishing immobility.

I have no staff at present, but I can get you anything simple myself.\u201d \u201cMuch obliged,\u201d said Flambeau. \u201cSo you are the proprietor?\u201d \u201cYes,\u201d said the dark man, dropping back a little into his motionless manner. \u201cMy waiters are all Italians, you see, and I thought it only fair they should see their countryman beat the black, if he really can do it."}, {"size": 642, "text": "You know the great fight between Malvoli and Nigger Ned is coming off after all?\u201d \u201cI\u2019m afraid we can\u2019t wait to trouble your hospitality seriously,\u201d said Father Brown. \u201cBut my friend would be glad of a glass of sherry, I\u2019m sure, to keep out the cold and drink success to the Latin champion.\u201d Flambeau did not understand the sherry, but he did not object to it in the least.

He was interrupted by a bellowing human voice that came out of the bowels of the uninhabited hotel. It thundered some foreign name loudly but inaudibly, and the hotel proprietor moved more sharply towards it than he had done for Flambeau\u2019s sherry. As instant evidence proved, the proprietor had told, then and after, nothing but the literal truth.

He will be starting presently. Sherry, sir?\u201d And, sure enough, there appeared in the doorway a big white bulk with white cap and white apron, as befits a cook, but with the needless emphasis of a black face. Flambeau had often heard that negroes made good cooks. But somehow something in the contrast of colour and caste increased his surprise that the hotel proprietor should answer the call of the cook, and not the cook the call of the proprietor. But he reflected that head cooks are proverbially arrogant; and, besides, the host had come back with the sherry, and that was the great thing."}, {"size": 804, "text": "\u201cI rather wonder,\u201d said Father Brown, \u201cthat there are so few people about the beach, when this big fight is coming on after all.

They are only interested in the sport, and will stop in hotels for the night only. After all, it is hardly weather for basking on the shore.\u201d \u201cOr on the seat,\u201d said Flambeau, and pointed to the little table. \u201cI have to keep a look-out,\u201d said the man with the motionless face.

His phrase that the cook was starting presently was fulfilled to the letter, for the cook came out, pulling his gloves on, even as they spoke. But he was a very different figure from the confused mass of white and black that had appeared for an instant in the doorway.

A tall black hat was tilted on his broad black head--a hat of the sort that the French wit has compared to eight mirrors."}, {"size": 692, "text": "But somehow the black man was like the black hat.

And in the way he carried his cane in one hand and his cigar in the other there was a certain attitude--an attitude we must always remember when we talk of racial prejudices: something innocent and insolent--the cake walk. \u201cSometimes,\u201d said Flambeau, looking after him, \u201cI\u2019m not surprised that they lynch them.\u201d \u201cI am never surprised,\u201d said Father Brown, \u201cat any work of hell."}, {"size": 745, "text": "But as I was saying,\u201d he resumed, as the negro, still ostentatiously pulling on his yellow gloves, betook himself briskly towards the watering-place, a queer music-hall figure against that grey and frosty scene--\u201cas I was saying, I couldn\u2019t describe the man very minutely, but he had a flourish and old-fashioned whiskers and moustachios, dark or dyed, as in the pictures of foreign financiers, round his neck was wrapped a long purple scarf that thrashed out in the wind as he walked. It was fixed at the throat rather in the way that nurses fix children\u2019s comforters with a safety-pin.

But the long shadow, in the level evening light, looked like a giant brandishing the Eiffel Tower.

There was a man of action, who was as modest as a primrose and as punctual as a clock; who went his small round of duties and never dreamed of altering it.

William James figured there as well as \u201cWeary Willie,\u201d and pragmatists alternated with pugilists in the long procession of its portraits. Thus, when a very unobtrusive Oxford man named John Boulnois wrote in a very unreadable review called the Natural Philosophy Quarterly a series of articles on alleged weak points in Darwinian evolution, it fluttered no corner of the English papers; though Boulnois\u2019s theory (which was that of a comparatively"}, {"size": 796, "text": "stationary universe visited occasionally by convulsions of change) had some rather faddy fashionableness at Oxford, and got so far as to be named \u201cCatastrophism\u201d.

A year or two before, Boulnois had married a beautiful and not unsuccessful actress, to whom he was devoted in his own shy and ponderous style; and the proximity of the household to Champion\u2019s had given that flighty celebrity opportunities for behaving in a way that could not but cause painful and rather base excitement."}, {"size": 712, "text": "Sir Claude had carried the arts of publicity to perfection; and he seemed to take a crazy pleasure in being equally ostentatious in an intrigue that could do him no sort of honour.

More than once, as he went up that strange, black road of tragic artifice, he stopped, startled, thinking he heard steps in front of him."}, {"size": 710, "text": "He could see nothing in front but the twin sombre walls of pine and the wedge of starlit sky above them. At first he thought he must have fancied it or been mocked by a mere echo of his own tramp. But as he went on he was more and more inclined to conclude, with the remains of his reason, that there really were other feet upon the road. He thought hazily of ghosts; and was surprised how swiftly he could see the image of an appropriate and local ghost, one with a face as white as Pierrot\u2019s, but patched with black. The apex of the triangle of dark-blue sky was growing brighter and bluer, but he did not realize as yet that this was because he was coming nearer to the lights of the great house and garden."}, {"size": 648, "text": "He only felt that the atmosphere was growing more intense, there was in the sadness more violence and secrecy--more--he hesitated for the word, and then said it with a jerk of laughter--Catastrophism.

It is vain to say that he felt as if he had got into a dream; but this time he felt quite certain that he had got into a book.

Over the black pine-wood came flying and flashing in the moon a naked sword--such a slender and sparkling rapier as may have fought many an unjust duel in that ancient park. It fell on the pathway far in front of him and lay there glistening like a large needle. He ran like a hare and bent to look at it. Seen at close quarters it had rather a showy look: the big red jewels in the hilt and guard were a little dubious. But there were other red drops upon the blade which were not dubious. He looked round wildly in the direction from which the dazzling missile had come, and saw that at this point the sable facade of fir and pine was interrupted by a smaller road at right angles; which, when he turned it, brought him in full view of the long, lighted house, with a lake and fountains in front of it."}, {"size": 664, "text": "Nevertheless, he did not look at this, having something more interesting to look at. Above him, at the angle of the steep green bank of the terraced garden, was one of those small picturesque surprises common in the old landscape gardening; a kind of small round hill or dome of grass, like a giant mole-hill, ringed and crowned with three concentric fences of roses, and having a sundial in the highest point in the centre. Kidd could see the finger of the dial stand up dark against the sky like the dorsal fin of a shark and the vain moonlight clinging to that idle clock. But he saw something else clinging to it also, for one wild moment--the figure of a man."}, {"size": 719, "text": "Though he saw it there only for a moment, though it was outlandish and incredible in costume, being clad from neck to heel in tight crimson, with glints of gold, yet he knew in one flash of moonlight who it was.

The wild red figure reeled an instant against the sundial; the next it had rolled down the steep bank and lay at the American\u2019s feet, faintly moving one arm. A gaudy, unnatural gold ornament on the arm suddenly reminded Kidd of Romeo and Juliet; of course the tight crimson suit was part of the play."}, {"size": 657, "text": "But there was a long red stain down the bank from which the man had rolled--that was no part of the play. He had been run through the body. Mr Calhoun Kidd shouted and shouted again. Once more he seemed to hear phantasmal footsteps, and started to find another figure already near him. He knew the figure, and yet it terrified him. The dissipated youth who had called himself Dalroy had a horribly quiet way with him; if Boulnois failed to keep appointments that had been made, Dalroy had a sinister air of keeping appointments that hadn\u2019t.

Indeed, it is by no means certain that the occupation would ever have been successful had not one of the three brothers, Paul, despicably, but very decisively declined to abide these things any longer, and, by surrendering all the secrets of the insurrection, ensured its overthrow and his own ultimate promotion to the post of chamberlain to Prince Otto."}, {"size": 652, "text": "After this, Ludwig, the one genuine hero among Mr Swinburne\u2019s heroes, was killed, sword in hand, in the capture of the city; and the third, Heinrich, who, though not a traitor, had always been tame and even timid compared with his active brothers, retired into something like a hermitage, became converted to a Christian quietism which was almost Quakerish, and never mixed with men except to give nearly all he had to the poor. They tell me that not long ago he could still be seen about the neighbourhood occasionally, a man in a black cloak, nearly blind, with very wild, white hair, but a face of astonishing softness.\u201d \u201cI know,\u201d said Father Brown."}, {"size": 717, "text": "\u201cI saw him once.\u201d His friend looked at him in some surprise. \u201cI didn\u2019t know you\u2019d been here before,\u201d he said. \u201cPerhaps you know as much about it as I do.

They were geological experts sent to investigate the old question of the alleged supply of gold from the rocks round here, upon which (as it was said) the small city-state had so long maintained its credit and been able to negotiate with its neighbours even under the ceaseless bombardment of bigger armies. Hitherto it had never been found by the most exacting inquiry which could--\u201d \u201cWhich could be quite certain of discovering a toy pistol,\u201d said Father Brown with a smile. \u201cBut what about the brother who ratted?

That also was empty, but the steel turret or cabin erected in the middle of it took some time to open. When it did open it was empty, too. He went and looked into the hole in the ground, which seemed deeper and somehow all the more like a grave--that is his account, of course."}, {"size": 677, "text": "And even as he did so he heard a burst of cries and tumult in the long rooms and corridors without. \u201cFirst it was a distant din and thrill of something unthinkable on the horizon of the crowd, even beyond the castle.

Next came words of a terrible clearness, coming nearer, and next one man, rushing into the room and telling the news as briefly as such news is told. \u201cOtto, Prince of Heiligwaldenstein and Grossenmark, was lying in the dews of the darkening twilight in the woods beyond the castle, with his arms flung out and his face flung up to the moon."}, {"size": 748, "text": "The blood still pulsed from his shattered temple and jaw, but it was the only part of him that moved like a living thing.

But, dead or alive, he was a riddle--he who had always hidden in the inmost chamber out there in the wet woods, unarmed and alone.\u201d \u201cWho found his body?\u201d asked Father Brown. \u201cSome girl attached to the Court named Hedwig von something or other,\u201d replied his friend, \u201cwho had been out in the wood picking wild flowers.\u201d \u201cHad she picked any?\u201d asked the priest, staring rather vacantly at the veil of the branches above him."}, {"size": 744, "text": "\u201cYes,\u201d replied Flambeau. \u201cI particularly remember that the Chamberlain, or old Grimm or somebody, said how horrible it was, when they came up at her call, to see a girl holding spring flowers and bending over that--that bloody collapse. However, the main point is that before help arrived he was dead, and the news, of course, had to be carried back to the castle. The consternation it created was something beyond even that natural in a Court at the fall of a potentate. The foreign visitors, especially the mining experts, were in the wildest doubt and excitement, as well as many important Prussian officials, and it soon began to be clear that the scheme for finding the treasure bulked much bigger in the business than people had supposed."}, {"size": 680, "text": "Experts and officials had been promised great prizes or international advantages, and some even said that the Prince\u2019s secret apartments and strong military protection were due less to fear of the populace than to the pursuit of some private investigation of--\u201d \u201cHad the flowers got long stalks?\u201d asked Father Brown. Flambeau stared at him. \u201cWhat an odd person you are!\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s exactly what old Grimm said. He said the ugliest part of it, he thought--uglier than the blood and bullet--was that the flowers were quite short, plucked close under the head.\u201d \u201cOf course,\u201d said the priest, \u201cwhen a grown up girl is really picking flowers, she picks them with plenty of stalk."}, {"size": 756, "text": "If she just pulled their heads off, as a child does, it looks as if--\u201d And he hesitated. \u201cWell?\u201d inquired the other. \u201cWell, it looks rather as if she had snatched them nervously, to make an excuse for being there after--well, after she was there.\u201d \u201cI know what you\u2019re driving at,\u201d said Flambeau rather gloomily. \u201cBut that and every other suspicion breaks down on the one point--the want of a weapon. He could have been killed, as you say, with lots of other things--even with his own military sash; but we have to explain not how he was killed, but how he was shot. And the fact is we can\u2019t.

I leave it to you, my friend.\u201d \u201cHow do you know there were two shots?\u201d asked the little priest. \u201cThere was only one in his head,\u201d said his companion, \u201cbut there was another bullet-hole in the sash.\u201d Father Brown\u2019s smooth brow became suddenly constricted. \u201cWas the other bullet found?\u201d he demanded.

Let me think this out for a moment.\u201d \u201cAll right,\u201d said Flambeau, laughing, and finished his beer. A slight breeze stirred the budding trees and blew up into the sky cloudlets of white and pink that seemed to make the sky bluer and the whole coloured scene more quaint.

He had distinguished himself even, before his exploits at Sadowa and Gravelotte; in fact, he rose from the ranks, which is very unusual even in the smallest of the German...\u201d Father Brown sat up suddenly. \u201cRose from the ranks!\u201d he cried, and made a mouth as if to whistle. \u201cWell, well, what a queer story!

Perhaps I ought to say he died of having a sash. I know it doesn\u2019t sound like having a disease.\u201d \u201cI suppose,\u201d said Flambeau, \u201cthat you\u2019ve got some notion in your head, but it won\u2019t easily get the bullet out of his. As I explained before, he might easily have been strangled. But he was shot. By whom? By what?\u201d \u201cHe was shot by his own orders,\u201d said the priest. \u201cYou mean he committed suicide?\u201d \u201cI didn\u2019t say by his own wish,\u201d replied Father Brown."}, {"size": 768, "text": "\u201cI said by his own orders.\u201d \u201cWell, anyhow, what is your theory?\u201d Father Brown laughed. \u201cI am only on my holiday,\u201d he said. \u201cI haven\u2019t got any theories. Only this place reminds me of fairy stories, and, if you like, I\u2019ll tell you a story.\u201d The little pink clouds, that looked rather like sweet-stuff, had floated up to crown the turrets of the gilt gingerbread castle, and the pink baby fingers of the budding trees seemed spreading and stretching to reach them; the blue sky began to take a bright violet of evening, when Father Brown suddenly spoke again: \u201cIt was on a dismal night, with rain still dropping from the trees and dew already clustering, that Prince Otto of Grossenmark stepped hurriedly out of a side door of the castle and walked swiftly into the wood."}, {"size": 660, "text": "One of the innumerable sentries saluted him, but he did not notice it. He had no wish to be specially noticed himself. He was glad when the great trees, grey and already greasy with rain, swallowed him up like a swamp. He had deliberately chosen the least frequented side of his palace, but even that was more frequented than he liked. But there was no particular chance of officious or diplomatic pursuit, for his exit had been a sudden impulse. All the full-dressed diplomatists he left behind were unimportant. He had realized suddenly that he could do without them. \u201cHis great passion was not the much nobler dread of death, but the strange desire of gold."}, {"size": 895, "text": "For this legend of the gold he had left Grossenmark and invaded Heiligwaldenstein. For this and only this he had bought the traitor and butchered the hero, for this he had long questioned and cross-questioned the false Chamberlain, until he had come to the conclusion that, touching his ignorance, the renegade really told the truth. For this he had, somewhat reluctantly, paid and promised money on the chance of gaining the larger amount; and for this he had stolen out of his palace like a thief in the rain, for he had thought of another way to get the desire of his eyes, and to get it cheap. \u201cAway at the upper end of a rambling mountain path to which he was making his way, among the pillared rocks along the ridge that hangs above the town, stood the hermitage, hardly more than a cavern fenced with thorn, in which the third of the great brethren had long hidden himself from the world."}, {"size": 862, "text": "He, thought Prince Otto, could have no real reason for refusing to give up the gold. He had known its place for years, and made no effort to find it, even before his new ascetic creed had cut him off from property or pleasures. True, he had been an enemy, but he now professed a duty of having no enemies. Some concession to his cause, some appeal to his principles, would probably get the mere money secret out of him. Otto was no coward, in spite of his network of military precautions, and, in any case, his avarice was stronger than his fears. Nor was there much cause for fear. Since he was certain there were no private arms in the whole principality, he was a hundred times more certain there were none in the Quaker\u2019s little hermitage on the hill, where he lived on herbs, with two old rustic servants, and with no other voice of man for year after year."}, {"size": 728, "text": "Prince Otto looked down with something of a grim smile at the bright, square labyrinths of the lamp-lit city below him.

On the small rock platform stood an old bronze lectern or reading-stand, groaning under a great German Bible. The bronze or copper of it had grown green with the eating airs of that exalted place, and Otto had instantly the thought, \u2018Even if they had arms, they must be rusted by now.\u2019 Moonrise had already made a deathly dawn behind the crests and crags, and the rain had ceased."}, {"size": 692, "text": "\u201cBehind the lectern, and looking across the valley, stood a very old man in a black robe that fell as straight as the cliffs around him, but whose white hair and weak voice seemed alike to waver in the wind.
