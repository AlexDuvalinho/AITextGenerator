ADULFO SANCHEZ, OF MONTEREY)At last, after so many years, I have the pleasure of re-introducing you to \u2018Prince Otto,\u2019 whom you will remember a very little fellow, no bigger in fact than a few sheets of memoranda written for me by your kind hand. The sight of his name will carry you back to an old wooden house embowered in creepers; a house that was far gone in the respectable stages of antiquity and seemed indissoluble from the green garden in which it stood, and that yet was a sea-traveller in its younger days, and had come round the Horn piecemeal in the belly of a ship, and might have heard the seamen stamping and shouting and the note of the boatswain\u2019s whistle."}, {"size": 767, "text": "It will recall to you the nondescript inhabitants now so widely scattered:\u2014the two horses, the dog, and the four cats, some of them still looking in your face as you read these lines;\u2014the poor lady, so unfortunately married to an author;\u2014the China boy, by this time, perhaps, baiting his line by the banks of a river in the Flowery Land;\u2014and in particular the Scot who was then sick apparently unto death, and whom you did so much to cheer and keep in good behaviour. You may remember that he was full of ambitions and designs: so soon as he had his health again completely, you may remember the fortune he was to earn, the journeys he was to go upon, the delights he was to enjoy and confer, and (among other matters) the masterpiece he was to make of \u2018Prince Otto\u2019!"}, {"size": 760, "text": "Well, we will not give in that we are finally beaten. We read together in those days the story of Braddock, and how, as he was carried dying from the scene of his defeat, he promised himself to do better another time: a story that will always touch a brave heart, and a dying speech worthy of a more fortunate commander. I try to be of Braddock\u2019s mind. I still mean to get my health again; I still purpose, by hook or crook, this book or the next, to launch a masterpiece; and I still intend\u2014somehow, some time or other\u2014to see your face and to hold your hand. Meanwhile, this little paper traveller goes forth instead, crosses the great seas and the long plains and the dark mountains, and comes at last to your door in Monterey, charged with tender greetings."}, {"size": 236, "text": "Pray you, take him in.

CHAPTER I\u2014IN WHICH THE PRINCE DEPARTS ON AN ADVENTURE You shall seek in vain upon the map of Europe for the bygone state of Gr\u00fcnewald. An independent principality, an infinitesimal member of the German Empire, she played, for several centuries, her part in the discord of Europe; and, at last, in the ripeness of time and at the spiriting of several bald diplomatists, vanished like a morning ghost. Less fortunate than Poland, she left not a regret behind her; and the very memory of her boundaries has faded.It was a patch of hilly country covered with thick wood. Many streams took their beginning in the glens of Gr\u00fcnewald, turning mills for the inhabitants."}, {"size": 623, "text": "There was one town, Mittwalden, and many brown, wooden hamlets, climbing roof above roof, along the steep bottom of dells, and communicating by covered bridges over the larger of the torrents. The hum of watermills, the splash of running water, the clean odour of pine sawdust, the sound and smell of the pleasant wind among the innumerable army of the mountain pines, the dropping fire of huntsmen, the dull stroke of the wood-axe, intolerable roads, fresh trout for supper in the clean bare chamber of an inn, and the song of birds and the music of the village-bells\u2014these were the recollections of the Gr\u00fcnewald tourist."}, {"size": 690, "text": "North and east the foothills of Gr\u00fcnewald sank with varying profile into a vast plain. On these sides many small states bordered with the principality, Gerolstein, an extinct grand duchy, among the number. On the south it marched with the comparatively powerful kingdom of Seaboard Bohemia, celebrated for its flowers and mountain bears, and inhabited by a people of singular simplicity and tenderness of heart. Several intermarriages had, in the course of centuries, united the crowned families of Gr\u00fcnewald and Maritime Bohemia; and the last Prince of Gr\u00fcnewald, whose history I purpose to relate, drew his descent through Perdita, the only daughter of King Florizel the First of Bohemia."}, {"size": 750, "text": "That these intermarriages had in some degree mitigated the rough, manly stock of the first Gr\u00fcnewalds, was an opinion widely held within the borders of the principality. The charcoal burner, the mountain sawyer, the wielder of the broad axe among the congregated pines of Gr\u00fcnewald, proud of their hard hands, proud of their shrewd ignorance and almost savage lore, looked with an unfeigned contempt on the soft character and manners of the sovereign race. The precise year of grace in which this tale begins shall be left to the conjecture of the reader. But for the season of the year (which, in such a story, is the more important of the two) it was already so far forward in the spring, that when mountain people heard horns echoing all day about"}, {"size": 700, "text": "At this point the borders of Gr\u00fcnewald descend somewhat steeply, here and there breaking into crags; and this shaggy and trackless country stands in a bold contrast to the cultivated plain below. It was traversed at that period by two roads alone; one, the imperial highway, bound to Brandenau in Gerolstein, descended the slope obliquely and by the easiest gradients. The other ran like a fillet across the very forehead of the hills, dipping into savage gorges, and wetted by the spray of tiny waterfalls. Once it passed beside a certain tower or castle, built sheer upon the margin of a formidable cliff, and commanding a vast prospect of the skirts of Gr\u00fcnewald and the busy plains of Gerolstein."}, {"size": 697, "text": "The Felsenburg (so this tower was called) served now as a prison, now as a hunting-seat; and for all it stood so lonesome to the naked eye, with the aid of a good glass the burghers of Brandenau could count its windows from the lime-tree terrace where they walked at night. In the wedge of forest hillside enclosed between the roads, the horns continued all day long to scatter tumult; and at length, as the sun began to draw near to the horizon of the plain, a rousing triumph announced the slaughter of the quarry. The first and second huntsman had drawn somewhat aside, and from the summit of a knoll gazed down before them on the drooping shoulders of the hill and across the expanse of plain."}, {"size": 686, "text": "They covered their eyes, for the sun was in their faces. The glory of its going down was somewhat pale. Through the confused tracery of many thousands of naked poplars, the smoke of so many houses, and the evening steam ascending from the fields, the sails of a windmill on a gentle eminence moved very conspicuously, like a donkey\u2019s ears. And hard by, like an open gash, the imperial high-road ran straight sun-ward, an artery of travel. There is one of nature\u2019s spiritual ditties, that has not yet been set to words or human music: \u2018The Invitation to the Road\u2019; an air continually sounding in the ears of gipsies, and to whose inspiration our nomadic fathers journeyed all their days."}, {"size": 640, "text": "The hour, the season, and the scene, all were in delicate accordance. The air was full of birds of passage, steering westward and northward over Gr\u00fcnewald, an army of specks to the up-looking eye. And below, the great practicable road was bound for the same quarter. But to the two horsemen on the knoll this spiritual ditty was unheard. They were, indeed, in some concern of mind, scanning every fold of the subjacent forest, and betraying both anger and dismay in their impatient gestures. \u2018I do not see him, Kuno,\u2019 said the first huntsman, \u2018nowhere\u2014not a trace, not a hair of the mare\u2019s tail! No, sir, he\u2019s off; broke cover and got away."}, {"size": 648, "text": "Why, for twopence I would hunt him with the dogs!\u2019 \u2018Mayhap, he\u2019s gone home,\u2019 said Kuno, but without conviction. \u2018Home!\u2019 sneered the other. \u2018I give him twelve days to get home. No, it\u2019s begun again; it\u2019s as it was three years ago, before he married; a disgrace! Hereditary prince, hereditary fool! There goes the government over the borders on a grey mare. What\u2019s that? No, nothing\u2014no, I tell you, on my word, I set more store by a good gelding or an English dog. That for your Otto!\u2019 \u2018He\u2019s not my Otto,\u2019 growled Kuno. \u2018Then I don\u2019t know whose he is,\u2019 was the retort. \u2018You would put your hand in the fire for him to-morrow,\u2019 said Kuno, facing round."}, {"size": 612, "text": "\u2018Me!\u2019 cried the huntsman. \u2018I would see him hanged! I\u2019m a Gr\u00fcnewald patriot\u2014enrolled, and have my medal, too; and I would help a prince! I\u2019m for liberty and Gondremark.\u2019 \u2018Well, it\u2019s all one,\u2019 said Kuno. \u2018If anybody said what you said, you would have his blood, and you know it.\u2019 \u2018You have him on the brain,\u2019 retorted his companion. \u2018There he goes!\u2019 he cried, the next moment. And sure enough, about a mile down the mountain, a rider on a white horse was seen to flit rapidly across a heathy open and vanish among the trees on the farther side. \u2018In ten minutes he\u2019ll be over the border into Gerolstein,\u2019 said Kuno."}, {"size": 289, "text": "\u2018It\u2019s past cure.\u2019 \u2018Well, if he founders that mare, I\u2019ll never forgive him,\u2019 added the other, gathering his reins. And as they turned down from the knoll to rejoin their comrades, the sun dipped and disappeared, and the woods fell instantly into the gravity and greyness of the early night."}, {"size": 721, "text": "CHAPTER II\u2014IN WHICH THE PRINCE PLAYS HAROUN-AL-RASCHID The night fell upon the Prince while he was threading green tracks in the lower valleys of the wood; and though the stars came out overhead and displayed the interminable order of the pine-tree pyramids, regular and dark like cypresses, their light was of small service to a traveller in such lonely paths, and from thenceforth he rode at random. The austere face of nature, the uncertain issue of his course, the open sky and the free air, delighted him like wine; and the hoarse chafing of a river on his left sounded in his ears agreeably.It was past eight at night before his toil was rewarded and he issued at last out of the forest on the firm white high-road."}, {"size": 640, "text": "It lay downhill before him, with a sweeping eastward trend, faintly bright between the thickets; and Otto paused and gazed upon it. So it ran, league after league, still joining others, to the farthest ends of Europe, there skirting the sea-surge, here gleaming in the lights of cities; and the innumerable army of tramps and travellers moved upon it in all lands as by a common impulse, and were now in all places drawing near to the inn door and the night\u2019s rest. The pictures swarmed and vanished in his brain; a surge of temptation, a beat of all his blood, went over him, to set spur to the mare and to go on into the unknown for ever."}, {"size": 675, "text": "And then it passed away; hunger and fatigue, and that habit of middling actions which we call common sense, resumed their empire; and in that changed mood his eye lighted upon two bright windows on his left hand, between the road and river. He turned off by a by-road, and in a few minutes he was knocking with his whip on the door of a large farmhouse, and a chorus of dogs from the farmyard were making angry answer. A very tall, old, white-headed man came, shading a candle, at the summons. He had been of great strength in his time, and of a handsome countenance; but now he was fallen away, his teeth were quite gone, and his voice when he spoke was broken and falsetto."}, {"size": 619, "text": "\u2018You will pardon me,\u2019 said Otto. \u2018I am a traveller and have entirely lost my way.\u2019 \u2018Sir,\u2019 said the old man, in a very stately, shaky manner, \u2018you are at the River Farm, and I am Killian Gottesheim, at your disposal. We are here, sir, at about an equal distance from Mittwalden in Gr\u00fcnewald and Brandenau in Gerolstein: six leagues to either, and the road excellent; but there is not a wine bush, not a carter\u2019s alehouse, anywhere between. You will have to accept my hospitality for the night; rough hospitality, to which I make you freely welcome; for, sir,\u2019 he added with a bow, \u2018it is God who sends the guest.\u2019 \u2018Amen."}, {"size": 723, "text": "And I most heartily thank you,\u2019 replied Otto, bowing in his turn. \u2018Fritz,\u2019 said the old man, turning towards the interior, \u2018lead round this gentleman\u2019s horse; and you, sir, condescend to enter.\u2019 Otto entered a chamber occupying the greater part of the ground-floor of the building. It had probably once been divided; for the farther end was raised by a long step above the nearer, and the blazing fire and the white supper-table seemed to stand upon a da\u00efs. All around were dark, brass-mounted cabinets and cupboards; dark shelves carrying ancient country crockery; guns and antlers and broadside ballads on the wall; a tall old clock with roses on the dial; and down in one corner the comfortable promise of a wine barrel."}, {"size": 609, "text": "It was homely, elegant, and quaint. A powerful youth hurried out to attend on the grey mare; and when Mr. Killian Gottesheim had presented him to his daughter Ottilia, Otto followed to the stable as became, not perhaps the Prince, but the good horseman. When he returned, a smoking omelette and some slices of home-cured ham were waiting him; these were followed by a ragout and a cheese; and it was not until his guest had entirely satisfied his hunger, and the whole party drew about the fire over the wine jug, that Killian Gottesheim\u2019s elaborate courtesy permitted him to address a question to the Prince."}, {"size": 678, "text": "\u2018You have perhaps ridden far, sir?\u2019 he inquired. \u2018I have, as you say, ridden far,\u2019 replied Otto; \u2018and, as you have seen, I was prepared to do justice to your daughters cookery.\u2019 \u2018Possibly, sir, from the direction of Brandenau?\u2019 continued Killian. \u2018Precisely: and I should have slept to-night, had I not wandered, in Mittwalden,\u2019 answered the Prince, weaving in a patch of truth, according to the habit of all liars. \u2018Business leads you to Mittwalden?\u2019 was the next question. \u2018Mere curiosity,\u2019 said Otto. \u2018I have never yet visited the principality of Gr\u00fcnewald.\u2019 \u2018A pleasant state, sir,\u2019 piped the old man, nodding, \u2018a very pleasant state, and a fine race, both pines and people."}, {"size": 663, "text": "We reckon ourselves part Gr\u00fcnewalders here, lying so near the borders; and the river there is all good Gr\u00fcnewald water, every drop of it. Yes, sir, a fine state. A man of Gr\u00fcnewald now will swing me an axe over his head that many a man of Gerolstein could hardly lift; and the pines, why, deary me, there must be more pines in that little state, sir, than people in this whole big world. \u2019Tis twenty years now since I crossed the marshes, for we grow home-keepers in old age; but I mind it as if it was yesterday. Up and down, the road keeps right on from here to Mittwalden; and nothing all the way but the good green pine-trees, big and little, and water-power!"}, {"size": 631, "text": "water-power at every step, sir. We once sold a bit of forest, up there beside the high-road; and the sight of minted money that we got for it has set me ciphering ever since what all the pines in Gr\u00fcnewald would amount to.\u2019 \u2018I suppose you see nothing of the Prince?\u2019 inquired Otto. \u2018No,\u2019 said the young man, speaking for the first time, \u2018nor want to.\u2019 \u2018Why so? is he so much disliked?\u2019 asked Otto. \u2018Not what you might call disliked,\u2019 replied the old gentleman, \u2018but despised, sir.\u2019 \u2018Indeed,\u2019 said the Prince, somewhat faintly. \u2018Yes, sir, despised,\u2019 nodded Killian, filling a long pipe, \u2018and, to my way of thinking, justly despised."}, {"size": 732, "text": "Here is a man with great opportunities, and what does he do with them? He hunts, and he dresses very prettily\u2014which is a thing to be ashamed of in a man\u2014and he acts plays; and if he does aught else, the news of it has not come here.\u2019 \u2018Yet these are all innocent,\u2019 said Otto. \u2018What would you have him do\u2014make war?\u2019 \u2018No, sir,\u2019 replied the old man. \u2018But here it is; I have been fifty years upon this River Farm, and wrought in it, day in, day out; I have ploughed and sowed and reaped, and risen early, and waked late; and this is the upshot: that all these years it has supported me and my family; and been the best friend that ever I had, set aside my wife; and now, when my time comes, I leave it a better farm than when I found it."}, {"size": 723, "text": "So it is, if a man works hearty in the order of nature, he gets bread and he receives comfort, and whatever he touches breeds. And it humbly appears to me, if that Prince was to labour on his throne, as I have laboured and wrought in my farm, he would find both an increase and a blessing.\u2019 \u2018I believe with you, sir,\u2019 Otto said; \u2018and yet the parallel is inexact. For the farmer\u2019s life is natural and simple; but the prince\u2019s is both artificial and complicated. It is easy to do right in the one, and exceedingly difficult not to do wrong in the other. If your crop is blighted, you can take off your bonnet and say, \u201cGod\u2019s will be done\u201d; but if the prince meets with a reverse, he may have to blame himself for the attempt."}, {"size": 752, "text": "And perhaps, if all the kings in Europe were to confine themselves to innocent amusement, the subjects would be the better off.\u2019 \u2018Ay,\u2019 said the young man Fritz, \u2018you are in the right of it there. That was a true word spoken. And I see you are like me, a good patriot and an enemy to princes.\u2019 Otto was somewhat abashed at this deduction, and he made haste to change his ground. \u2018But,\u2019 said he, \u2018you surprise me by what you say of this Prince Otto. I have heard him, I must own, more favourably painted. I was told he was, in his heart, a good fellow, and the enemy of no one but himself.\u2019 \u2018And so he is, sir,\u2019 said the girl, \u2018a very handsome, pleasant prince; and we know some who would shed their blood for him.\u2019 \u2018O! Kuno!\u2019 said Fritz. \u2018An ignoramus!\u2019"}, {"size": 729, "text": "\u2018Ay, Kuno, to be sure,\u2019 quavered the old farmer. \u2018Well, since this gentleman is a stranger to these parts, and curious about the Prince, I do believe that story might divert him. This Kuno, you must know, sir, is one of the hunt servants, and a most ignorant, intemperate man: a right Gr\u00fcnewalder, as we say in Gerolstein. We know him well, in this house; for he has come as far as here after his stray dogs; and I make all welcome, sir, without account of state or nation. And, indeed, between Gerolstein and Gr\u00fcnewald the peace has held so long that the roads stand open like my door; and a man will make no more of the frontier than the very birds themselves.\u2019 \u2018Ay,\u2019 said Otto, \u2018it has been a long peace\u2014a peace of centuries.\u2019"}, {"size": 724, "text": "\u2018Centuries, as you say,\u2019 returned Killian; \u2018the more the pity that it should not be for ever. Well, sir, this Kuno was one day in fault, and Otto, who has a quick temper, up with his whip and thrashed him, they do say, soundly. Kuno took it as best he could, but at last he broke out, and dared the Prince to throw his whip away and wrestle like a man; for we are all great at wrestling in these parts, and it\u2019s so that we generally settle our disputes. Well, sir, the Prince did so; and, being a weakly creature, found the tables turned; for the man whom he had just been thrashing like a negro slave, lifted him with a back grip and threw him heels overhead.\u2019 \u2018He broke his bridle-arm,\u2019 cried Fritz\u2014\u2018and some say his nose."}, {"size": 736, "text": "Serve him right, say I!

I don\u2019t say it\u2019s a discreditable story, you observe,\u2019 continued Mr. Gottesheim; \u2018but it\u2019s droll, and that\u2019s the fact. A man should think before he strikes; for, as my nephew says, man to man was the old valuation.\u2019 \u2018Now, if you were to ask me,\u2019 said Otto, \u2018I should perhaps surprise you. I think it was the Prince that conquered.\u2019 \u2018And, sir, you would be right,\u2019 replied Killian seriously. \u2018In the eyes of God, I do not question but you would be right; but men, sir, look at these things differently, and they laugh.\u2019 \u2018They made a song of it,\u2019 observed Fritz."}, {"size": 661, "text": "\u2018How does it go?

And they said he was so handsome when he was young!\u2019 \u2018And bald, too,\u2019 added Fritz. Otto passed his hand among his locks. At that moment he was far from happy, and even the tedious evenings at Mittwalden Palace began to smile upon him by comparison. \u2018O, six-and-thirty!\u2019 he protested. \u2018A man is not yet old at six-and-thirty. I am that age myself.\u2019"}, {"size": 728, "text": "\u2018I should have taken you for more, sir,\u2019 piped the old farmer. \u2018But if that be so, you are of an age with Master Ottekin, as people call him; and, I would wager a crown, have done more service in your time. Though it seems young by comparison with men of a great age like me, yet it\u2019s some way through life for all that; and the mere fools and fiddlers are beginning to grow weary and to look old. Yes, sir, by six-and-thirty, if a man be a follower of God\u2019s laws, he should have made himself a home and a good name to live by; he should have got a wife and a blessing on his marriage; and his works, as the Word says, should begin to follow him.\u2019 \u2018Ah, well, the Prince is married,\u2019 cried Fritz, with a coarse burst of laughter."}, {"size": 614, "text": "\u2018That seems to entertain you, sir,\u2019 said Otto. \u2018Ay,\u2019 said the young boor. \u2018Did you not know that?

But the truth is, that the whole princely family and Court are rips and rascals, not one to mend another. They live, sir, in idleness and\u2014what most commonly follows it\u2014corruption.

What he has worked for, that he has got; and may God have pity on his soul, for a great and a silly sinner\u2019s!\u2019 \u2018He has broke his oath; then he is a perjurer.

There\u2019s such a thing as a man being pious and honest in the private way; and there is such a thing, sir, as a public virtue; but when a man has neither, the Lord lighten him!

For my part, although you are right in thinking that I have to do with politics, I am unfit by intellect and temper for a leading r\u00f4le. I was intended, I fear, for a subaltern. Yet we have all something to command, Mr. Fritz, if it be only our own temper; and a man about to marry must look closely to himself. The husband\u2019s, like the prince\u2019s, is a very artificial standing; and it is hard to be kind in either. Do you follow that?\u2019 \u2018O yes, I follow that,\u2019 replied the young man, sadly chop-fallen over the nature of the information he had elicited; and then brightening up: \u2018Is it,\u2019 he ventured, \u2018is it for an arsenal that you have bought the farm?\u2019 \u2018We\u2019ll see about that,\u2019 the Prince answered, laughing."}, {"size": 638, "text": "\u2018You must not be too zealous.

The merchants were very loud and mirthful; each had a face like a nor\u2019west moon; and they played pranks with each others\u2019 horses, and mingled songs and choruses, and alternately remembered and forgot the companion of their ride.

Her Serene Highness Amalia Seraphina, Princess of Gr\u00fcnewald, was the heroine, Gondremark the hero of this ballad. Shame hissed in Otto\u2019s ears. He reined up short and sat stunned in the saddle; and the singers continued to descend the hill without him.

On the far side the ground rose again, and was crowned by the confused roofs and gables of the palace. The modern pillared front, the ball-room, the great library, the princely apartments, the busy and illuminated quarters of that great house, all faced the town.

And now, when he was about midway of the descent, distant strains of music began to fall upon his ear from the ball-room, where the court was dancing.

Some way below he came unexpectedly upon a sentry; yet a little farther, and he was challenged by a second; and as he crossed the bridge over the fish-pond, an officer making the rounds stopped him once more.

He was a man of about forty, flaxen-haired, with refined features a little worn, and bright eyes somewhat faded. Early to bed and early to rise, his life was devoted to two things: erudition and Rhine wine. An ancient friendship existed latent between him and Otto; they rarely met, but when they did it was to take up at once the thread of their suspended intimacy.

Accident, indeed, decided, and not I; but I have seen no reason to regret my visit.

He is not ill-looking; he has hair of a ruddy gold, which naturally curls, and his eyes are dark, a combination which I always regard as the mark of some congenital deficiency, physical or moral; his features are irregular, but pleasing; the nose perhaps a little short, and the mouth a little womanish; his address is excellent, and he can express himself with point."}, {"size": 783, "text": "But to pierce below these externals is to come on a vacuity of any sterling quality, a deliquescence of the moral nature, a frivolity and inconsequence of purpose that mark the nearly perfect fruit of a decadent age.

The idea of extending Gr\u00fcnewald may appear absurd, but the little state is advantageously placed, its neighbours are all defenceless; and if at any moment the jealousies of the greater courts should neutralise each other, an active policy might double the principality both in population and extent."}, {"size": 692, "text": "Certainly at least the scheme is entertained in the court of Mittwalden; nor do I myself regard it as entirely desperate.

Older than her husband, certainly uglier, and, according to the feeble ideas common among women, in every particular less pleasing, he has not only seized the complete command of all her thought and action, but has imposed on her in public a humiliating part."}, {"size": 871, "text": "I do not here refer to the complete sacrifice of every rag of her reputation; for to many women these extremities are in themselves attractive.

I had thought, at first, that she was but a hired accomplice, a mere blind or buffer for the more important sinner. A few hours\u2019 acquaintance with Madame von Rosen for ever dispelled the illusion. She is one rather to make than to prevent a scandal, and she values none of those bribes\u2014money, honours, or employment\u2014with which the situation might be gilded. Indeed, as a person frankly bad, she pleased me, in the court of Gr\u00fcnewald, like a piece of nature."}, {"size": 832, "text": "The power of this man over the Princess is, therefore, without bounds. She has sacrificed to the adoration with which he has inspired her not only her marriage vow and every shred of public decency, but that vice of jealousy which is so much dearer to the female sex than either intrinsic honour or outward consideration. Nay, more: a young, although not a very attractive woman, and a princess both by birth and fact, she submits to the triumphant rivalry of one who might be her mother as to years, and who is so manifestly her inferior in station. This is one of the mysteries of the human heart. But the rage of illicit love, when it is once indulged, appears to grow by feeding; and to a person of the character and temperament of this unfortunate young lady, almost any depth of degradation is within the reach of possibility."}, {"size": 678, "text": "CHAPTER III\u2014THE PRINCE AND THE ENGLISH TRAVELLER So far Otto read, with waxing indignation; and here his fury overflowed.

It was a long and complicated voyage; for the library was in the wing of the new buildings, and the tower which carried the flag was in the old schloss upon the garden. By a great variety of stairs and corridors, they came out at last upon a patch of gravelled court; the garden peeped through a high grating with a flash of green; tall, old gabled buildings mounted on every side; the Flag Tower climbed, stage after stage, into the blue; and high over all, among the building daws, the yellow flag wavered in the wind."}, {"size": 697, "text": "A sentinel at the foot of the tower stairs presented arms; another paced the first landing; and a third was stationed before the door of the extemporised prison. \u2018We guard this mud-bag like a jewel,\u2019 Otto sneered.

The rooms were large, airy, pleasant, and looked upon the garden; but the walls were of great thickness (for the tower was old), and the windows were heavily barred.

And artful, in a sense, she was. Chafing that she was not a man, and could not shine by action, she had conceived a woman\u2019s part, of answerable domination; she sought to subjugate for by-ends, to rain influence and be fancy free; and, while she loved not man, loved to see man obey her."}, {"size": 650, "text": "It is a common girl\u2019s ambition.

The formidable blue jowl of the man, and the dull bilious eye, set perhaps a higher value on his evident desire to please.

As soon as they were gone, and Otto knew the length and breadth of his miscarriage, and how he had done the contrary of all that he intended, he stood stupefied. A fiasco so complete and sweeping was laughable, even to himself; and he laughed aloud in his wrath. Upon this mood there followed the sharpest violence of remorse; and to that again, as he recalled his provocation, anger succeeded afresh.

The pistol, you might say, was charged. And when jealousy from time to time fetched him a lash across the tenderest of his feeling, and sent a string of her fire-pictures glancing before his mind\u2019s eye, the contraction of his face was even dangerous.

There had been a period of bustle, liveried messengers speeding here and there with notes; and at half-past ten in the morning, about an hour before its usual hour, the council of Gr\u00fcnewald sat around the board.It was not a large body.

She had a duty to perform, she must free Otto\u2014so her mind said, very coldly; but her heart embraced the notion of that duty even with ardour, and her hands began to yearn for the grasp of kindness.

And betweenwhiles, the unfeatured darkness would redouble and the whole ear of night appear to be gloating on her steps.

The day drew its first long breath, steady and chill; and for leagues around the woods sighed and shivered. And then, at one bound, the sun had floated up; and her startled eyes received day\u2019s first arrow, and quailed under the buffet.

Some way off among the lower woods, a pillar of smoke was mounting and melting in the gold and blue. There, surely enough, were human folk, the hearth-surrounders. Man\u2019s fingers had laid the twigs; it was man\u2019s breath that had quickened and encouraged the baby flames; and now, as the fire caught, it would be playing ruddily on the face of its creator."}, {"size": 615, "text": "At the thought, she felt a-cold and little and lost in that great out-of-doors.

Here Seraphina hastened along forest paths. She had lost sight of the pilot smoke, which blew another way, and conducted herself in that great wilderness by the direction of the sun. But presently fresh signs bespoke the neighbourhood of man; felled trunks, white slivers from the axe, bundles of green boughs, and stacks of firewood."}, {"size": 605, "text": "These guided her forward; until she came forth at last upon the clearing whence the smoke arose. A hut stood in the clear shadow, hard by a brook which made a series of inconsiderable falls; and on the threshold the Princess saw a sun-burnt and hard-featured woodman, standing with his hands behind his back and gazing skyward. She went to him directly: a beautiful, bright-eyed, and haggard vision; splendidly arrayed and pitifully tattered; the diamond ear-drops still glittering in her ears; and with the movement of her coming, one small breast showing and hiding among the ragged covert of the laces."}, {"size": 699, "text": "At that ambiguous hour, and coming as she did from the great silence of the forest, the man drew back from the Princess as from something elfin. \u2018I am cold,\u2019 she said, \u2018and weary. Let me rest beside your fire.\u2019 The woodman was visibly commoved, but answered nothing. \u2018I will pay,\u2019 she said, and then repented of the words, catching perhaps a spark of terror from his frightened eyes. But, as usual, her courage rekindled brighter for the check. She put him from the door and entered; and he followed her in superstitious wonder. Within, the hut was rough and dark; but on the stone that served as hearth, twigs and a few dry branches burned with the brisk sounds and all the variable beauty of fire."}, {"size": 655, "text": "The very sight of it composed her; she crouched hard by on the earth floor and shivered in the glow, and looked upon the eating blaze with admiration.

He found no word to utter. \u2018Give me food,\u2019 said she,\u2014\u2018here, by the fire.\u2019 He set down a pitcher of coarse wine, bread, a piece of cheese, and a handful of raw onions. The bread was hard and sour, the cheese like leather; even the onion, which ranks with the truffle and the nectarine in the chief place of honour of earth\u2019s fruits, is not perhaps a dish for princesses when raw."}, {"size": 605, "text": "But she ate, if not with appetite, with courage; and when she had eaten, did not disdain the pitcher. In all her life before, she had not tasted of gross food nor drunk after another; but a brave woman far more readily accepts a change of circumstances than the bravest man. All that while, the woodman continued to observe her furtively, many low thoughts of fear and greed contending in his eyes. She read them clearly, and she knew she must begone. Presently she arose and offered him a florin. \u2018Will that repay you?\u2019 she asked.

But as soon as the least turning of the path had concealed her from the woodman\u2019s eyes, she slipped among the trees and ran till she deemed herself in safety.

On she passed, and up and down, in sun and shadow; now aloft on the bare ridge among the rocks and birches, with the lizards and the snakes; and anon in the deep grove among sunless pillars.

Upon all these things, as she still sped along in the bright air, she looked with a rapture of surprise and a joyful fainting of the heart; they seemed so novel, they touched so strangely home, they were so hued and scented, they were so beset and canopied by the dome of the blue air of heaven."}, {"size": 803, "text": "At length, when she was well weary, she came upon a wide and shallow pool.

She crept to the margin and beheld herself with wonder, a hollow and bright-eyed phantom, in the ruins of her palace robe. The breeze now shook her image; now it would be marred with flies; and at that she smiled; and from the fading circles, her counterpart smiled back to her and looked kind.

Her hair had smelt like violets, she remembered Otto saying; and so now she tried to smell it, and then shook her head, and laughed a little, sadly, to herself.

She thought upon the birds and looked again at her two visitors; so little larger and so far more innocent. On their clear faces, as in a pool, she saw the reflection of their fears. With gracious purpose she arose. \u2018Come,\u2019 she said, \u2018do not be afraid of me,\u2019 and took a step towards them.

Hastily she trod the thoughts out like a burning paper; hastily rolled up her locks, and with terror dogging her, and her whole bosom sick with grief, resumed her journey. Past ten in the forenoon, she struck a high-road, marching in that place uphill between two stately groves, a river of sunlight; and here, dead weary, careless of consequences, and taking some courage from the human and civilised neighbourhood of the road, she stretched herself on the green margin in the shadow of a tree."}, {"size": 635, "text": "Sleep closed on her, at first with a horror of fainting, but when she ceased to struggle, kindly embracing her.

Let me serve and help you; let me be your servant; it is enough for me to serve you and to be near you; let me be near you, dear\u2014do not send me away.\u2019 He hurried his pleading like the speech of a frightened child."}, {"size": 783, "text": "\u2018It is not love,\u2019 he went on; \u2018I do not ask for love; my love is enough . . .\u2019 \u2018Otto!\u2019 she said, as if in pain. He looked up into her face. It was wrung with the very ecstasy of tenderness and anguish; on her features, and most of all in her changed eyes, there shone the very light of love. \u2018Seraphina?\u2019 he cried aloud, and with a sudden, tuneless voice, \u2018Seraphina?\u2019 \u2018Look round you at this glade,\u2019 she cried, \u2018and where the leaves are coming on young trees, and the flowers begin to blossom. This is where we meet, meet for the first time; it is so much better to forget and to be born again.

The best account is to be found in the memoirs of Herr Greisengesang (7 B\u00e4nde: Leipzig), by our passing acquaintance the licentiate Roederer. Herr Roederer, with too much of an author\u2019s licence, makes a great figure of his hero\u2014poses him, indeed, to be the centre-piece and cloud-compeller of the whole. But, with due allowance for this bias, the book is able and complete.The reader is of course acquainted with the vigorous and bracing pages of Sir John (2 vols., London: Longman, Hurst, Rees, Orme and Brown)."}, {"size": 746, "text": "Sir John, who plays but a tooth-comb in the orchestra of this historical romance, blows in his own book the big bassoon. His character is there drawn at large; and the sympathy of Landor has countersigned the admiration of the public. One point, however, calls for explanation; the chapter on Gr\u00fcnewald was torn by the hand of the author in the palace gardens; how comes it, then, to figure at full length among my more modest pages, the Lion of the caravan? That eminent literatus was a man of method; \u2018Juvenal by double entry,\u2019 he was once profanely called; and when he tore the sheets in question, it was rather, as he has since explained, in the search for some dramatic evidence of his sincerity, than with the thought of practical deletion."}, {"size": 620, "text": "At that time, indeed, he was possessed of two blotted scrolls and a fair copy in double. But the chapter, as the reader knows, was honestly omitted from the famous \u2018Memoirs on the various Courts of Europe.\u2019 It has been mine to give it to the public. Bibliography still helps us with a further glimpse of our characters. I have here before me a small volume (printed for private circulation: no printer\u2019s name; n.d.), \u2018Po\u00e9sies par Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric et Am\u00e9lie.\u2019 Mine is a presentation copy, obtained for me by Mr. Bain in the Haymarket; and the name of the first owner is written on the fly-leaf in the hand of Prince Otto himself."}, {"size": 677, "text": "The modest epigraph\u2014\u2018Le rime n\u2019est pas riche\u2019\u2014may be attributed, with a good show of likelihood, to the same collaborator. It is strikingly appropriate, and I have found the volume very dreary. Those pieces in which I seem to trace the hand of the Princess are particularly dull and conscientious. But the booklet had a fair success with that public for which it was designed; and I have come across some evidences of a second venture of the same sort, now unprocurable. Here, at least, we may take leave of Otto and Seraphina\u2014what do I say? of Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric and Am\u00e9lie\u2014ageing together peaceably at the court of the wife\u2019s father, jingling French rhymes and correcting joint proofs."}, {"size": 750, "text": "Still following the book-lists, I perceive that Mr. Swinburne has dedicated a rousing lyric and some vigorous sonnets to the memory of Gondremark; that name appears twice at least in Victor Hugo\u2019s trumpet-blasts of patriot enumeration; and I came latterly, when I supposed my task already ended, on a trace of the fallen politician and his Countess. It is in the \u2018Diary of J. Hogg Cotterill, Esq.\u2019 (that very interesting work).
