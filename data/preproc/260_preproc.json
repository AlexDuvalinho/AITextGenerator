There is no objection to such extension in ordinary speech, no more than there is to that of the signification of the word, \u201cbeauty\u201d to what is purely abstract.

Such periods may embody in their literatures a large amount of thought,--thought which is conversant with the externality of things; but that of itself will not constitute a noble literature, however perfect the forms in which it may be embodied, and the general sense of the civilized world, independently of any theories of literature, will not regard such a literature as noble."}, {"size": 878, "text": "It is made up of what must be, in time, superseded; it has not a sufficiently large element of the essential, the eternal, which can be reached only through the assimilating life of the spirit.

The devotion to the new queen with which it was inspired was grateful, generous, enthusiastic, and even romantic.

It was, I am assured, through his deep and sensitive spirit-life that Shakespeare felt the universal spirit and constitution of the world as fully, perhaps, as the human soul, in this life, is capable of feeling it. Through it he took cognizance of the workings of nature, and of the life of man, BY DIRECT ASSIMILATION OF THEIR HIDDEN PRINCIPLES,-- principles which cannot be reached through an observation, by the natural intelligence, of the phenomenal. He thus became possessed of a knowledge, or rather wisdom, far beyond his conscious observation and objective experience."}, {"size": 771, "text": "Shakespeare may be regarded as the first and the last great artistic physiologist or natural historian of the passions; and he was this by virtue of the life of the spirit, which enabled him to reproduce sympathetically the whole range of human passion within himself.

And the moral proportion he preserved in exhibiting the complex and often wild play of the passions must have been largely due to the harmony of his soul with the constitution of things.

In Milton, though there is a noticeable, an even distinctly marked, reduction of the life of the spirit (in the sense in which I have been using these words) exhibited by Shakespeare, it is still very strong and efficient, and continues uninfluenced by the malign atmosphere around him the last fifteen years of his life, which were lived in the reign of Charles II."}, {"size": 800, "text": "Within that period he wrote the \u2018Paradise Lost\u2019, \u2018Paradise Regained\u2019, and \u2018Samson Agonistes\u2019. \u201cMilton,\u201d says Emerson, \u201cwas the stair or high table-land to let down the English genius from the summits of Shakespeare.\u201d \u201cThese heights could not be maintained.

Verse may be very musical, and yet more or less mechanical; that is, it may CLOTHE thought and sentiment, but not be a part of it, not EMBODY it. Unrippled verse, which many readers demand, MUST be more or less mechanical. Such verse flows according to its own sweet will, independently of the thought-articulation.

When we have distinguished compositions as dramatic, lyrical, or characterized a poet in like manner, we have done little. What we want to ascertain is the peculiar quality of the imaginative stuff with which he plastically works, and to appreciate its worth. This is always a great task, but one particularly necessary in the case of Browning, because the stuff in which he has wrought is so novel in the poet\u2019s hands. Psychology itself is comparatively a new and modern study, as a distinct science; but a psychological poet, who has made it his business to clothe psychic abstractions \u2018in sights and sounds\u2019, is entirely a novel appearance in literature."}, {"size": 647, "text": "\u201cNow that phrase \u2018clothing in sights and sounds\u2019 may yield us the clue to the classification we are seeking. The function of artists, that is, musicians, poets in the narrower sense, and painters, is to clothe Truth in sights and sounds for the hearing and seeing of us all. Their call to do this lies in their finer and fuller aesthetic faculty. The sense of hearing and that of seeing stand in polar opposition, and thus a natural scale offers itself by which we may rank and arrange our artists. At the one end of the scale is the acoustic artist, i.e., the musician. At the other end of the scale is the optic artist, the painter and sculptor."}, {"size": 641, "text": "Between these, and comprising both these activities in his own, is the poet, who is both acoustic and optic artist. He translates the sounds of the world, both external and internal,-- the tumult of storms, the murmurs of waves, the SUSURRUS of the woodland, the tinkling of brooks, the throbbing of human hearts, the cries of all living creatures; all those groans of pain, stammers of desire, shrieks of despair, yawns even of languor, which are ever breaking out of the heart of things; and beside all this, the hearsay, commonplace, proverbial lore of the world. He turns these into melodies which shall be caught up by those who listen."}, {"size": 654, "text": "In short, he converts by his alchemy the common stuff of pain and of joy into music. But he is optic as well as acoustic; that is, he calls up at the same time by his art a procession of images which march or dance across the theatre of the listener\u2019s fancy. Now the question of classification on this scheme comes to this, Does the particular poet who invites our attention deal more with the aesthesis of the ear or with that of the eye? Does he more fill our ear with sweet tunes or our fancy with shapes and colours? Does he compel us to listen and shut our eyes, or to open our eyes wide and dispense with all but the faintest musical accompaniment?"}, {"size": 630, "text": "What sense, in short, does he mainly address himself to? Goethe said that he was a \u2018seeing\u2019 man; W. von Humboldt, the great linguist, that he was a \u2018listening\u2019 man. The influence of Milton\u2019s blindness on his poetry was noticed by Lessing. The short-sightedness of Wieland has also been detected in his poetry. \u201cIf we apply these tests to Browning, there can be, I think, no doubt as to the answer. He is, in common with all poets, both musician and painter, but much more the latter than the former. He is never for a moment the slave of his ear, if I may so express it. We know that he has, on the contrary, the mastery of music."}, {"size": 717, "text": "But music helps and supports his imagination, never controls it.

Take only \u2018Saul\u2019 and \u2018Abt Vogler\u2019 in illustration. \u2018Saul\u2019 is a magnificent interpretation of the old theme, a favorite with the mystics, that evil spirits are driven out by music. But in this interpretation it is not the mere tones, the thrumming on the harp, it is the religious movement of the intelligence, it is the truth of Divine love throbbing in every chord, which constitutes the spell."}, {"size": 755, "text": "And so in \u2018Abt Vogler\u2019; the abbot\u2019s instrument is only the means whereby he strikes out the light of faith and hope within him.

But he has printed no \u2018versus inopes rerum, nugaeque canorae\u2019 (Hor. ad Pis.). He has had higher objects in view, and has dispensed better stuff than that which lingers in the ear, and tends to suppress rather than support the higher activity of thought. \u201cWhen for a moment he shuts his eyes, and falls purely into the listening or \u2018musing\u2019 mood, he becomes the instrument of a rich deep music, breaking out of the heart of the unseen"}, {"size": 633, "text": "world, as in the Dirge of unfaithful Poets in \u2018Paracelsus\u2019, or the Gypsy\u2019s Incantation in the \u2018Flight of the Duchess\u2019, or the Meditation at the crisis of Sordello\u2019s temptation. \u201cWhen the keen inquisitive intelligence is in its full waking activity there grows \u2018more of the words\u2019 and thought, and \u2018less of the music\u2019, to invert a phrase of the poet\u2019s.

In plain words the problem is, how far the pleasures of sound and of sense can be united in poetry; and it will be found in every case that a poet sacrifices something either to the one or to the other. Browning has said something in his arch way on this point. In effect, he remarks, Italian prose can render a simple thought more sweetly to the ear than either Greek or English verse."}, {"size": 651, "text": "It seems clear from many other of his critical remarks that he considers the demand for music in preference to thought in poetry, as the symptom of a false taste. \u201cBrowning\u2019s poetry is to be gazed at, rather than listened to and recited, for the most part. It is infinitely easier to listen for an hour to spiritual music than to fix one\u2019s whole attention for a few minutes on a spiritual picture. In the latter act of mind we find a rich musical accompaniment distracting, while a slight musical accompaniment is probably helpful. And perhaps we may characterize Browning\u2019s poetry as a series of spiritual pictures with a faint musical accompaniment."}, {"size": 701, "text": "\u201cFor illustration by extreme contrast, Milton may be compared with Browning. Milton was a great hearsay poet, Browning repeats no hearsay. In reading Milton, the difficulty is to keep up the mental tension where there is so little thought, strictly speaking. With Browning the highest tension is exacted. \u201cHe is pre-eminently the looker, the seer, the \u2018maker-see\u2019; the reporter, the painter of the scenery and events of the soul. And if the sense of vision is our noblest, and we instinctively express the acts of intelligence in terms drawn from physical vision, the poet who leans most towards the \u2018SEER of Power and Love in the absolute, Beauty and Goodness in the concrete\u2019, takes the higher rank."}, {"size": 306, "text": "This is no matter for bigotry of taste.
