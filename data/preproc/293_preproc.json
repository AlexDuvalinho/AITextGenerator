The speaker was a tall, pompous-looking man, whose age appeared to verge close upon fifty. He was sitting bolt upright in a high-backed chair, and looked as if it would be quite impossible to deviate from his position of unbending rigidity.Squire Benjamin Newcome, as he was called, in the right of his position as Justice of the Peace, Chairman of the Selectmen, and wealthiest resident of Wrenville, was a man of rule and measure. He was measured in his walk, measured in his utterance, and measured in all his transactions. He might be called a dignified machine. He had a very exalted conception of his own position, and the respect which he felt to be his due, not only from his own household, but from all who approached him."}, {"size": 630, "text": "If the President of the United States had called upon him, Squire Newcome would very probably have felt that he himself was the party who conferred distinction, and not received it. Squire Newcome was a widower. His wife, who was as different from himself as could well be conceived, did not live long after marriage. She was chilled to death, as it was thought, by the dignified iceberg of whose establishment she had become a part. She had left, however, a child, who had now grown to be a boy of twelve. This boy was a thorn in the side of his father, who had endeavored in vain to mould him according to his idea of propriety."}, {"size": 617, "text": "But Ben was gifted with a spirit of fun, sometimes running into mischief, which was constantly bursting out in new directions, in spite of his father's numerous and rather prosy lectures. \u201cHan-nah!\u201d again called Squire Newcome, separating the two syllables by a pause of deliberation, and strongly accenting the last syllable,--a habit of his with all proper names. Hannah was the Irish servant of all work, who was just then engaged in mixing up bread in the room adjoining, which was the kitchen. Feeling a natural reluctance to appear before her employer with her hands covered with dough, she hastily washed them."}, {"size": 633, "text": "All this, however, took time, and before she responded to the first summons, the second \u201cHan-nah!\u201d delivered with a little sharp emphasis, had been uttered. At length she appeared at the door of the sitting-room. \u201cHan-nah!\u201d said Squire Newcome, fixing his cold gray eye upon her, \u201cwhen you hear my voice a calling you, it is your duty to answer the summons IMMEJIATELY.\u201d I have endeavored to represent the Squire's pronunciation of the last word. \u201cSo I would have come IMMEJOUSLY,\u201d said Hannah, displaying a most reprehensible ignorance, \u201cbut me hands were all covered with flour.\u201d \u201cThat makes no difference,\u201d interrupted the Squire."}, {"size": 699, "text": "\u201cFlour is an accidental circumstance.\u201d \u201cWhat's that?\u201d thought Hannah, opening her eyes in amazement. \u201cAnd should not be allowed to interpose an obstacle to an IMMEJIATE answer to my summons.\u201d \u201cSir,\u201d said Hannah, who guessed at the meaning though she did not understand the words, \u201cyou wouldn't have me dirty the door-handle with me doughy hands?\u201d \u201cThat could easily be remedied by ablution.\u201d \u201cThere ain't any ablution in the house,\u201d said the mystified Hannah. \u201cI mean,\u201d Squire Newcome condescended to explain, \u201cthe application of water--in short, washing.\u201d \u201cShure,\u201d said Hannah, as light broke in upon her mind, \u201cI never knew that was what they called it before.\u201d \u201cIs Ben-ja-min at home?\u201d \u201cYes, sir."}, {"size": 753, "text": "He was out playin' in the yard a minute ago.

The cause of her sudden exit was revealed on looking out of the window. Master Benjamin, or Ben, as he was called everywhere except in his own family, had got possession of the black kitten, and appeared to be submerging her in the hogshead of rainwater. \u201cO, you wicked, cruel boy, to drown poor Kitty!\u201d exclaimed the indignant Hannah, rushing into the yard and endeavoring to snatch her feline favorite--an attempt which Ben stoutly resisted."}, {"size": 179, "text": "Doubtless the poor kitten would have fared badly between the two, had not the window opened, and the deliberate voice of his father, called out in tones which Ben saw fit to heed."}, {"size": 751, "text": "\u201cCome into my presence immejiately, and learn to answer me with more respect.\u201d Ben came in looking half defiant.

You will never learn to employ your tongue with elegance and precision, unless you engage in this beneficial study.\u201d \u201cI can use my tongue well enough, without studying grammar,\u201d said Ben.

You may go to Mr. Prescott's and see if he is yet living. I hear that he is a lying on the brink of the grave.\u201d An expression of sadness stole over the usually merry face of Ben, as he started on his errand. \u201cPoor Paul!\u201d he thought, \u201cwhat will he do when his father dies?

We will precede Ben on his visit to the house of Mr. Prescott.It was an old weather-beaten house, of one story, about half a mile distant from 'Squire Newcome's residence. The Prescott family had lived here for five years, or ever since they had removed to Wrenville. Until within a year they had lived comfortably, when two blows came in quick succession. The first was the death of Mrs. Prescott, an excellent woman, whose loss was deeply felt by her husband and son. Soon afterwards Mr. Prescott, a carpenter by trade, while at work upon the roof of a high building, fell off, and not only broke his leg badly, but suffered some internal injury of a still more serious nature."}, {"size": 615, "text": "He had not been able to do a stroke of work since. After some months it became evident that he would never recover. A year had now passed. During this time his expenses had swallowed up the small amount which he had succeeded in laying up previous to his sickness. It was clear that at his death there would be nothing left. At thirteen years of age Paul would have to begin the world without a penny. Mr. Prescott lay upon a bed in a small bedroom adjoining the kitchen. Paul, a thoughtful-looking boy sat beside it, ready to answer his call. There had been silence for some time, when Mr. Prescott called feebly--"}, {"size": 682, "text": "\u201cI am here, father,\u201d said Paul. \u201cI am almost gone, Paul, I don't think I shall last through the day.\u201d \u201cO, father,\u201d said Paul, sorrowfully, \u201cDon't leave me.\u201d \u201cThat is the only grief I have in dying--I must leave you to struggle for yourself, Paul.

I am young and strong--I can earn my living in some way.\u201d \u201cI hoped to live long enough to give you an education. I wanted you to have a fairer start in the world than I had.\u201d \u201cNever mind, father,\u201d said Paul, soothingly, \u201cDon't be uneasy about me. God will provide for me.\u201d Again there was a silence, broken only by the difficult breathing of the sick man."}, {"size": 726, "text": "\u201cThere is one thing, Paul, that I want to tell you before I die.\u201d Paul drew closer to the bedside. \u201cIt is something which has troubled me as I lay here. I shall feel easier for speaking of it. You remember that we lived at Cedarville before we came here.\u201d\u201cAbout two years before we left there, a promising speculation was brought to my notice. An agent of a Lake Superior mine visited our village and represented the mine in so favorable a light that many of my neighbors bought shares, fully expecting to double their money in a year. Among the rest I was attacked with the fever of speculation. I had always been obliged to work hard for a moderate compensation, and had not been able to do much more than support my family."}, {"size": 349, "text": "This it seemed to me, afforded an excellent opportunity of laying up a little something which might render me secure in the event of a sudden attack of sickness. I had but about two hundred dollars, however, and from so scanty an investment I could not, of course, expect a large return; accordingly I went to Squire Conant; you remember him, Paul?\u201d"}, {"size": 725, "text": "'I went to him and asked a loan of five hundred dollars. After some hesitation he agreed to lend it to me. He was fond of his money and not much given to lending, but it so happened that he had invested in the same speculation, and had a high opinion of it, so he felt pretty safe in advancing me the money. Well, this loan gave me seven hundred dollars, with which I purchased seven shares in the Lake Superior Grand Combination Mining Company. For some months afterwards, I felt like a rich man. I carefully put away my certificate of stock, looking upon it as the beginning of a competence. But at the end of six months the bubble burst--the stock proved to be utterly worthless,--Squire Conant lost five thousand dollars."}, {"size": 752, "text": "I lost seven hundred, five hundred being borrowed money. The Squire's loss was much larger, but mine was the more serious, since I lost everything and was plunged into debt, while he had at least forty thousand dollars left. \u201cTwo days after the explosion, Squire Conant came into my shop and asked abruptly when I could pay him the amount I had borrowed. I told him that I could not fix a time. I said that I had been overwhelmed by a result so contrary to my anticipations, but I told him I would not rest till I had done something to satisfy his claim. He was always an unreasonable man, and reproached me bitterly for sinking his money in a useless speculation, as if I could foresee how it would end any better than he.\u201d \u201cHave you ever been able to"}, {"size": 417, "text": "pay back any part of the five hundred dollars, father?\u201d \u201cI have paid the interest regularly, and a year ago, just before I met with my accident, I had laid up a hundred and fifty dollars which I had intended to pay the Squire, but when my sickness came I felt obliged to retain it to defray our expenses, being cut off from earning anything.\u201d \u201cThen I suppose you have not been able to pay interest for the last year.\u201d"}, {"size": 649, "text": "\u201cHave you heard from the Squire lately?\u201d \u201cYes, I had a letter only last week.

I should like to have you get it and read it.\u201d Paul readily found the letter. It was enclosed in a brown envelope, directed in a bold hand to \u201cMr. John Prescott, Wrenville.\u201d The letter was as follows:-- CEDARVILLE, APRIL 15, 18--,SIR: I have been waiting impatiently to hear something about the five hundred dollars in which sum you are indebted to me, on account of a loan which I was fool enough to make you seven years since."}, {"size": 587, "text": "I thought you an honest man, but I have found, to my cost, that I was mistaken. For the last year you have even failed to pay interest as stipulated between us. Your intention is evident.

I do not hesitate to say that if you had your deserts you would be in the Penitentiary. Let me advise you, if you wish to avoid further trouble, to make no delay in paying a portion of this debt. Yours, etc. EZEKIEL CONANT."}, {"size": 619, "text": "Paul's face flushed with indignation as he read this bitter and cruel letter. \u201cDoes Squire Conant know that you are sick, father?\u201d he inquired. \u201cYes, I wrote him about my accident, telling him at the same time that I regretted it in part on account of the interruption which it must occasion in my payments.\u201d \u201cAnd knowing this, he wrote such a letter as that,\u201d said Paul, indignantly, \u201cwhat a hard, unfeeling wretch he must be!\u201d \u201cI suppose it is vexatious to him to be kept out of his money.\u201d \u201cBut he has plenty more.

It will be a comfort to me to feel that there is some hope of the debt being paid at some future day.\u201d \u201cThen don't let it trouble you any longer, father. The debt shall be mine, and I will pay it.\u201d Again a shadow passed over the sick man's face, \u201cPoor boy,\u201d he said, \u201cwhy should I burden your young life with such a load?"}, {"size": 604, "text": "You will have to struggle hard enough as it is. No, Paul, recall your promise. I don't want to purchase comfort at such a price.\u201d \u201cNo, father,\u201d said Paul sturdily, \u201cit is too late now. I have made the promise and I mean to stick to it. Besides, it will give me something to live for. I am young--I may have a great many years before me. For thirteen years you have supported me. It is only right that I should make what return I can. I'll keep my promise, father.\u201d \u201cMay God help and prosper you, my boy,\u201d said Mr. Prescott, solemnly. \u201cYou've been a good son; I pray that you may grow up to be a good man."}, {"size": 507, "text": "But, my dear, I feel tired. I think I will try to go to sleep.\u201d Paul smoothed the comforter, adjusting it carefully about his father's neck, and going to the door went out in search of some wood to place upon the fire. Their scanty stock of firewood was exhausted, and Paul was obliged to go into the woods near by, to obtain such loose fagots as he might find upon the ground. He was coming back with his load when his attention was drawn by a whistle.

He said he was tired just before I went out.\u201d \u201cI brought over something for you,\u201d said Ben, tugging away at his pocket. Opening a paper he displayed a couple of apple turnovers fried brown. \u201cI found 'em in the closet,\u201d he said. \u201cWon't Hannah make a precious row when she finds 'em gone?\u201d \u201cThen I don't know as I ought to take them,\u201d said Paul, though, to tell the truth, they looked tempting to him."}, {"size": 656, "text": "\u201cO, nonsense,\u201d said Ben; \u201cthey don't belong to Hannah.

Two days later, the funeral of Mr. Prescott took place. Poor Paul! It seemed to him a dream of inexpressible sorrow. His father and mother both gone, he felt that he was indeed left alone in the world. No thought of the future had yet entered his mind. He was wholly occupied with his present sorrow. Desolate at heart he slipped away from the graveyard after the funeral ceremony was over, and took his way back again to the lonely dwelling which he had called home.

But you look just like my friend, Tom Crocker.\u201d To this succeeded a few inquiries, which Paul unsuspiciously answered. \u201cDo you like oysters?\u201d inquired the new-comer, after a while."}, {"size": 608, "text": "\u201cBecause I know of a tip top place to get some, just round the corner. Wouldn't you like some?\u201d Paul thanked his new acquaintance, and said he would. Without more ado, his companion ushered him into a basement room near by. He led the way into a curtained recess, and both boys took seats one on each side of a small table. \u201cJust pull the bell, will you, and tell the waiter we'll have two stews.\u201d \u201cI suppose,\u201d continued the other, \u201cthe governor wouldn't like it much if he knew where I was.\u201d \u201cThe governor!\u201d repeated Paul. \u201cWhy, it isn't against the laws, is it?\u201d \u201cNo,\u201d laughed the other. \u201cI mean my father."}, {"size": 625, "text": "How jolly queer you are!\u201d He meant to say green, but had a purpose in not offending Paul. \u201cAre you the Governor's son?\u201d asked Paul in amazement. \u201cTo be sure,\u201d carelessly replied the other. Paul's wonder had been excited many times in the course of the day, but this was more surprising than anything which had yet befallen him. That he should have the luck to fall in with the son of the Governor, on his first arrival in the city, and that the latter should prove so affable and condescending, was indeed surprising. Paul inwardly determined to mention it in his first letter to Aunt Lucy. He could imagine her astonishment."}, {"size": 618, "text": "While he was busy with these thoughts, his companion had finished his oysters. \u201cMost through?\u201d he inquired nonchalantly. \u201cI've got to step out a minute; wait till I come back.\u201d Paul unsuspectingly assented. He heard his companion say a word to the barkeeper, and then go out. He waited patiently for fifteen minutes and he did not return; another quarter of an hour, and he was still absent. Thinking he might have been unexpectedly detained, he rose to go, but was called back by the barkeeper. \u201cHallo, youngster! are you going off without paying?\u201d \u201cFor what?\u201d inquired Paul, in surprise. \u201cFor the oysters, of course."}, {"size": 600, "text": "You don't suppose I give 'em away, do you?\u201d \u201cI thought,\u201d hesitated Paul, \u201cthat the one who was with me paid,--the Governor's son,\u201d he added, conscious of a certain pride in his intimacy with one so nearly related to the chief magistrate of the Commonwealth. \u201cThe Governor's son,\u201d laughed the barkeeper. \u201cWhy the Governor lives a hundred miles off and more. That wasn't the Governor's son any more than I am.\u201d \u201cHe called his father governor,\u201d said Paul, beginning to be afraid that he had made some ridiculous blunder. \u201cWell, I wouldn't advise you to trust him again, even if he's the President's son."}, {"size": 605, "text": "He only got you in here to pay for his oysters. He told me when he went out that you would pay for them.\u201d \u201cAnd didn't he say he was coming back?\u201d asked Paul, quite dumbfounded. \u201cHe said you hadn't quite finished, but would pay for both when you came out. It's two shillings.\u201d Paul rather ruefully took out the half dollar which constituted his entire stock of money, and tendered it to the barkeeper who returned him the change. So Paul went out into the streets, with his confidence in human nature somewhat lessened. Here, then, is our hero with twenty-five cents in his pocket, and his fortune to make."}, {"size": 742, "text": "A STRANGE BED-CHAMBER. Although Paul could not help being vexed at having been so cleverly taken in by his late companion, he felt the better for having eaten the oysters. Carefully depositing his only remaining coin in his pocket, he resumed his wanderings. It is said that a hearty meal is a good promoter of cheerfulness. It was so in Paul's case, and although he had as yet had no idea where he should find shelter for the night he did not allow that consideration to trouble him. So the day passed, and the evening came on. Paul's appetite returned to him once more. He invested one-half of his money at an old woman's stall for cakes and apples, and then he ate leisurely while leaning against the iron railing which encircles the park."}, {"size": 723, "text": "He began to watch with interest the movements of those about him. Already the lamplighter had started on his accustomed round, and with ladder in hand was making his way from one lamp-post to another. Paul quite marvelled at the celerity with which the lamps were lighted, never before having witnessed the use of gas. He was so much interested in the process that he sauntered along behind the lamplighter for some time. At length his eye fell upon a group common enough in our cities, but new to him. An Italian, short and dark-featured, with a velvet cap, was grinding out music from a hand-organ, while a woman with a complexion equally dark, and black sorrowful-looking eyes, accompanied her husband on the tambourine."}, {"size": 648, "text": "They were playing a lively tune as Paul came up, but quickly glided into \u201cHome, Sweet Home.\u201d Paul listened with pleased, yet sad interest, for him \u201chome\u201d was only a sad remembrance. He wandered on, pausing now and then to look into one of the brilliantly illuminated shop windows, or catching a glimpse through the open doors of the gay scene within, and as one after another of these lively scenes passed before him, he began to think that all the strange and wonderful things in the world must be collected in these rich stores. Next, he came to a place of public amusement. Crowds were entering constantly, and Paul, from curiosity, entered too."}, {"size": 561, "text": "He passed on to a little wicket, when a man stopped him. \u201cWhere's your ticket?\u201d he asked. \u201cI haven't got any,\u201d said Paul. \u201cThen what business have you here?\u201d said the man, roughly. \u201cIsn't this a meeting-house?\u201d asked Paul. This remark seemed to amuse two boys who were standing by. Looking up with some indignation, Paul recognized in one of them the boy who had cheated him out of the oysters. \u201cLook here,\u201d said Paul, \u201cwhat made you go off and leave me to pay for the oysters this morning?\u201d \u201cWhich of us do you mean?\u201d inquired the 'governor's son,' carelessly."}, {"size": 838, "text": "\u201cReally, I don't understand your meaning. Perhaps you mistake me for somebody else.\u201d \u201cWhat?\u201d said Paul, in great astonishment. \u201cDon't you remember me, and how you told me you were the Governor's son?\u201d \u201cYou must be mistaken. I haven't the honor of being related to the distinguished gentleman you name.\u201d The speaker made a mocking bow to Paul. \u201cI know that,\u201d said Paul, with spirit, \u201cbut you said you were, for all that.\u201d \u201cIt must have been some other good-looking boy, that you are mistaking me for. What are you going to do about it? I hope, by the way, that the oysters agreed with you.\u201d \u201cYes, they did,\u201d said Paul, \u201cfor I came honestly by them.\u201d \u201cHe's got you there, Gerald,\u201d said the other boy.

As his funds were reduced to twelve cents, he could not have purchased a ticket if he had desired it."}, {"size": 640, "text": "Soon he came to another building, which was in like manner lighted up, but not so brilliantly as the theater. This time, from the appearance of the building, and from the tall steeple,--so tall that his eye could scarcely reach the tapering spire,--he knew that it must be a church. There was not such a crowd gathered about the door as at the place he had just left, but he saw a few persons entering, and he joined them. The interior of the church was far more gorgeous than the plain village meeting-house which he had been accustomed to attend with his mother. He gazed about him with a feeling of awe, and sank quietly into a back pew."}, {"size": 648, "text": "As it was a week-day evening, and nothing of unusual interest was anticipated, there were but few present, here and there one, scattered through the capacious edifice. By-and-by the organist commenced playing, and a flood of music, grander and more solemn than he had ever heard, filled the whole edifice. He listened with rapt attention and suspended breath till the last note died away, and then sank back upon the richly cushioned seat with a feeling of enjoyment. In the services which followed he was not so much interested. The officiating clergyman delivered a long homily in a dull unimpassioned manner, which failed to awaken his interest."}, {"size": 663, "text": "Already disposed to be drowsy, it acted upon him like a gentle soporific. He tried to pay attention as he had always been used to do, but owing to his occupying a back seat, and the low voice of the preacher, but few words reached him, and those for the most part were above his comprehension. Gradually the feeling of fatigue--for he had been walking the streets all day--became so powerful that his struggles to keep awake became harder and harder. In vain he sat erect, resolved not to yield. The moment afterwards his head inclined to one side; the lights began to swim before his eyes; the voice of the preacher subsided into a low and undistinguishable hum."}, {"size": 636, "text": "Paul's head sank upon the cushion, his bundle, which had been his constant companion during the day, fell softly to the floor, and he fell into a deep sleep. Meanwhile the sermon came to a close, and another hymn was sung, but even the music was insufficient to wake our hero now. So the benediction was pronounced, and the people opened the doors of their pews and left the church. Last of all the sexton walked up and down the aisles, closing such of the pew doors as were open. Then he shut off the gas, and after looking around to see that nothing was forgotten, went out, apparently satisfied, and locked the outer door behind him."}, {"size": 384, "text": "Paul, meanwhile, wholly unconscious of his situation, slept on as tranquilly as if there were nothing unusual in the circumstances in which he was placed. Through the stained windows the softened light fell upon his tranquil countenance, on which a smile played, as if his dreams were pleasant.

Paul sprang to his feet and looked around him in bewilderment. \u201cWhere am I?\u201d he exclaimed in astonishment. In the momentary confusion of ideas which is apt to follow a sudden awakening, he could not remember where he was, or how he chanced to be there. But in a moment memory came to his aid, and he recalled the events of the preceding day, and saw that he must have been locked up in the church."}, {"size": 665, "text": "\u201cHow am I going to get out?\u201d Paul asked himself in dismay. This was the important question just now. He remembered that the village meeting-house which he had been accustomed to attend was rarely opened except on Sundays. What if this should be the case here? It was Thursday morning, and three days must elapse before his release. This would never do. He must seek some earlier mode of deliverance. He went first to the windows, but found them so secured that it was impossible for him to get them open. He tried the doors, but found, as he had anticipated, that they were fast. His last resource failing, he was at liberty to follow the dictates of his curiosity."}, {"size": 705, "text": "Finding a small door partly open, he peeped within, and found a flight of steep stairs rising before him. They wound round and round, and seemed almost interminable. At length, after he had become almost weary of ascending, he came to a small window, out of which he looked. At his feet lay the numberless roofs of the city, while not far away his eye rested on thousands of masts. The river sparkled in the sun, and Paul, in spite of his concern, could not help enjoying the scene. The sound of horses and carriages moving along the great thoroughfare below came confusedly to his ears. He leaned forward to look down, but the distance was so much greater than he had thought, that he drew back in alarm."}, {"size": 654, "text": "\u201cWhat shall I do?\u201d Paul asked himself, rather frightened. \u201cI wonder if I can stand going without food for three days? I suppose nobody would hear me if I should scream as loud as I could.\u201d Paul shouted, but there was so much noise in the streets that nobody probably heard him. He descended the staircase, and once more found himself in the body of the church. He went up into the pulpit, but there seemed no hope of escape in that direction. There was a door leading out on one side, but this only led to a little room into which the minister retired before service. It seemed rather odd to Paul to find himself the sole occupant of so large a building."}, {"size": 583, "text": "He began to wonder whether it would not have been better for him to stay in the poorhouse, than come to New York to die of starvation. Just at this moment Paul heard a key rattle in the outer door. Filled with new hope, he ran down the pulpit stairs and out into the porch, just in time to see the entrance of the sexton. The sexton started in surprise as his eye fell upon Paul standing before him, with his bundle under his arm. \u201cWhere did you come from, and how came you here?\u201d he asked with some suspicion. \u201cI came in last night, and fell asleep.\u201d \u201cSo you passed the night here?\u201d"}, {"size": 722, "text": "\u201cWhat made you come in at all?\u201d inquired the sexton, who knew enough of boys to be curious upon this point. \u201cI didn't know where else to go,\u201d said Paul.

You should have good reasons for entering on such an undertaking. I--I don't think you are a bad boy. You don't look like a bad one,\u201d he added, half to himself. \u201cI hope not, sir,\u201d said Paul. \u201cI hope not, too. I was going to say that I wish I could help you to some kind of work. If you will come home with me, you shall be welcome to a dinner, and perhaps I may be able to think of something for you.\u201d Paul gladly prepared to follow his new acquaintance. \u201cWhat is your name?\u201d inquired the sexton."}, {"size": 654, "text": "\u201cThat sounds like a good name.

Heaven helps those who help themselves.\u201d When they were fairly out of the church, Paul had an opportunity of observing his companion's external appearance.

It was plainly but neatly furnished, the only ornament being one or two engravings cheaply framed and hung over the mantel-piece.

At the feet of the sexton's wife, for such she was, reposed a maltese cat, purring softly by way of showing her contentment. Indeed, she had good reason to be satisfied.

So he had been, but he made it his business to ascertain where it was. He had no idea of losing sight of so valuable a prize.

It was at this moment that Paul halted his chaise at the gate, and lightly jumping out, fastened his horse to a tree, and walked up to the front door. \u201cWho can it be?\u201d thought Mrs. Mudge, hastily adjusting her cap, and taking off her apron. \u201cI don't know, I'm sure,\u201d said Mr."}, {"size": 470, "text": "Mudge, unsuspiciously. \u201cI declare! I look like a fright.\u201d \u201cNo worse than usual,\u201d said her husband, gallantly. By this time Paul had knocked. \u201cGood-morning, sir,\u201d said Mrs. Mudge, deferentially, her respect excited by Paul's dress and handsome chaise. \u201cIs Mrs. Lee in?\u201d inquired Paul, not caring to declare himself, yet, to his old enemy. \u201cYes,\u201d said Mrs. Mudge, obsequiously, though not overpleased to find that this was Aunt Lucy's visitor; \u201cwould you like to see her?\u201d"}, {"size": 608, "text": "\u201cWhat can he want of the old lady?\u201d thought Mrs. Mudge, as she went to summon her. \u201cA visitor for me?\u201d asked Aunt Lucy, looking at Mrs. Mudge somewhat suspiciously. \u201cYes; and as he's come in a carriage, you'd better slick up a little; put on a clean cap or something.\u201d Aunt Lucy was soon ready. She looked wonderingly at Paul, not recognizing him. \u201cYou are not very good at remembering your old friends,\u201d said Paul, with a smile. \u201cWhat!\u201d exclaimed Aunt Lucy, her face lighting up with joy; \u201care you little Paul?\u201d \u201cNot very little, now,\u201d said our hero, laughing; \u201cbut I'm the same Paul you used to know.\u201d Mrs."}, {"size": 616, "text": "Mudge, who through the half open door had heard this revelation, was overwhelmed with astonishment and confusion. She hurried to her husband. \u201cWonders will never cease!\u201d she exclaimed, holding up both hands. \u201cIf that doesn't turn out to be Paul Prescott. Of course he's up in the world, or he wouldn't dress so well, and ride in such a handsome carriage.\u201d \u201cYou don't say so!\u201d returned Mr. Mudge, who looked as if he had heard of a heavy misfortune. \u201cYes, I do; I heard him say so with his own lips. It's a pity you showed that paragraph to Aunt Lucy, this morning.\u201d \u201cThat you showed, you mean,\u201d retorted her husband."}, {"size": 609, "text": "\u201cNo, I don't. You know it was you that did it.\u201d \u201cHush; they'll hear.\u201d Meanwhile the two friends were conversing together happily. \u201cI'm so glad you're doing so well, Paul,\u201d said Aunt Lucy. \u201cIt was a lucky day when you left the Poorhouse behind you.\u201d \u201cYes, Aunt Lucy, and to-day is a lucky day for you. There's room for two in that chaise, and I'm going to take you away with me.\u201d \u201cI should enjoy a ride, Paul. It's a long time since I have taken one.\u201d \u201cYou don't understand me. You're going away not to return.\u201d The old lady smiled sadly. \u201cNo, no, Paul. I can't consent to become a burden upon your generosity."}, {"size": 767, "text": "You can't afford it, and it will not be right.\u201d \u201cO,\u201d said Paul, smiling, \u201cyou give me credit for too much. I mean that you shall pay your board.\u201d \u201cBut you know I have no money.\u201d \u201cNo, I don't. I don't consider that a lady is penniless, who has an income of three hundred dollars a year.\u201d \u201cI don't understand you, Paul.\u201d \u201cThen, perhaps you will understand this,\u201d said our hero, enjoying the old lady's astonishment. He drew from his pocket a roll of bills, and passed them to Aunt Lucy. The old lady looked so bewildered, that he lost no time in explaining the matter to her. Then, indeed, Aunt Lucy was happy; not only because she had become suddenly independent, but, because after years of coldness and estrangement, her brother had at last become reconciled to her."}, {"size": 614, "text": "\u201cNow, Aunt Lucy,\u201d resumed Paul, \u201cI'll tell you what my plans are. You shall get into the chaise with me, and go at once to New York. I think Aunt Hester will be willing to receive you as a boarder; if not, I will find you a pleasant place near by. Will that suit you?\u201d \u201cIt will make me very happy; but I cannot realize it. It seems like a dream.\u201d At this moment Mrs. Mudge entered the room, and, after a moment's scrutiny, pretended to recognize Paul. Her husband followed close behind her. \u201cCan I believe my eyes?\u201d she exclaimed. \u201cIs this indeed Paul Prescott? I am very glad to see you back.\u201d \u201cOnly a visit, Mrs."}, {"size": 658, "text": "Mudge,\u201d said Paul, smiling. \u201cYou'll stop to dinner, I hope?\u201d Paul thought of the soup and dry bread which he used to find so uninviting, and said that he should not have time to do so. \u201cWe've thought of you often,\u201d said Mr. Mudge, writhing his harsh features into a smile. \u201cThere's scarcely a day that we haven't spoken of you.\u201d \u201cI ought to feel grateful for your remembrance,\u201d said Paul, his eyes twinkling with mirth. \u201cBut I don't think, Mr. Mudge, you always thought so much of me.\u201d Mr. Mudge coughed in some embarrassment, and not thinking of anything in particular to say, said nothing. \u201cI am going to take from you another of your boarders,\u201d said Paul."}, {"size": 635, "text": "\u201cCan you spare Aunt Lucy?\u201d \u201cFor how long?\u201d asked Mrs. Mudge. \u201cFor all the time.

She felt that as a lady of property, Aunt Lucy was entitled to much greater respect and deference than before. \u201cThank you, Mrs. Mudge,\u201d said Paul, answering for her."}, {"size": 764, "text": "\u201cShe won't have occasion for anything in this house. She will get a supply of new things when she gets to New York.\u201d The old lady looked very happy, and Mrs. Mudge, in spite of her outward deference, felt thoroughly provoked at her good fortune. I will not dwell upon the journey to New York. Aunt Lucy, though somewhat fatigued, bore it much better than she had anticipated. Mr. and Mrs. Cameron entered very heartily into Paul's plans, and readily agreed to receive Aunt Lucy as an inmate of their happy and united household. The old lady felt it to be a happy and blessed change from the Poorhouse, where scanty food and poor accommodations had been made harder to bear by the ill temper of Mr. and Mrs. Mudge, to a home whose atmosphere was peace and kindness."}, {"size": 709, "text": "And now, dear reader, it behooves us to draw together the different threads of our story, and bring all to a satisfactory end.Mr. and Mrs. Mudge are no longer in charge of the Wrenville Poorhouse. After Aunt Lucy's departure, Mrs. Mudge became so morose and despotic, that her rule became intolerable. Loud complaints came to the ears of 'Squire Newcome, Chairman of the Overseers of the Poor. One fine morning he was compelled to ride over and give the interesting couple warning to leave immediately. Mr. Mudge undertook the charge of a farm, but his habits of intoxication increased upon him to such an extent, that he was found dead one winter night, in a snow-drift, between his own house and the tavern."}, {"size": 695, "text": "Mrs. Mudge was not extravagant in her expressions of grief, not having a very strong affection for her husband. At last accounts, she was keeping a boarding-house in a manufacturing town. Some time since, her boarders held an indignation meeting, and threatened to leave in a body unless she improved her fare,--a course to which she was obliged to submit. George Dawkins, unable to obtain a recommendation from Mr. Danforth, did not succeed in securing another place in New York. He finally prevailed upon his father to advance him a sum of money, with which he went to California. Let us hope that he may \u201cturn over a new leaf\u201d there, and establish a better reputation than he did in New York."}, {"size": 691, "text": "Mr. Stubbs is still in the tin business. He is as happy as the day is long, and so are his wife and children. Once a year he comes to New York and pays Paul a visit. This supplies him with something to talk about for the rest of the year. He is frugal in his expenses, and is able to lay up a couple of hundred dollars every year, which he confides to Paul, in whose financial skill he has the utmost confidence. I am sure my boy readers would not forgive me for omitting to tell them something more about Ben Newcome. Although his mirthful spirit sometimes led him into mischief, he was good-hearted, and I have known him do many an act of kindness, even at considerable trouble to himself."}, {"size": 842, "text": "It will be remembered that in consequence of his night adventure, during which he personated a ghost, much to the terror of Mr. Mudge his father determined to send him to a military school. This proved to be a wise arrangement. The discipline was such as Ben needed, and he soon distinguished himself by his excellence in the military drill. Soon after he graduated, the Rebellion broke out, and Ben was at once, in spite of his youth, elected Captain of the Wrenville company. At the battle of Antietam he acquitted himself with so much credit that he was promoted to a major. He was again promoted, and when Richmond was evacuated, he was one of the first officers to enter the streets of the Rebel capital, a colonel in command of his regiment. I have heard on high authority, that he is considered one of the best officers in the service."}, {"size": 725, "text": "Mr. and Mrs. Cameron are still living. They are happy in the success and increasing prosperity of Paul, whom they regard as a son. Between them and Aunt Lucy he would stand a very fair chance of being spoiled, if his own good sense and good judgment were not sufficient to save him from such a misfortune. Paul is now admitted to a small interest in the firm, which entitles him to a share in the profits. As Danforth and Co. have done a very extensive business of late years, this interest brings him in a very handsome income. There is only one cause of difference between him and the sexton. He insists that Uncle Hugh, who is getting infirm, should resign his office, as he is abundantly able to support the whole family."}, {"size": 620, "text": "But the good sexton loves his duties, and will continue to discharge them as long as he is able. And now we must bid farewell to Paul. He has battled bravely with the difficulties and discouragements that beset him in early life, he has been faithful to the charge which he voluntarily assumed, and his father's memory is free from reproach. He often wishes that his father could have lived to witness his prosperity? but God has decreed it otherwise. Happy in the love of friends, and in the enjoyment of all that can make life desirable, so far as external circumstances have that power, let us all wish him God speed!"}]}
