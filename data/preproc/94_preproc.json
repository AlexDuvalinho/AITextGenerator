He had lived there as a student, but for twenty years and more, since he had been Professor of Philosophy in a Western university, he had seldom come East except to take a steamer for some foreign port. Wilson was standing quite still, contemplating with a whimsical smile the slanting street, with its worn paving, its irregular, gravely colored houses, and the row of naked trees on which the thin sunlight was still shining."}, {"size": 630, "text": "The gleam of the river at the foot of the hill made him blink a little, not so much because it was too bright as because he found it so pleasant. The few passers-by glanced at him unconcernedly, and even the children who hurried along with their school-bags under their arms seemed to find it perfectly natural that a tall brown gentleman should be standing there, looking up through his glasses at the gray housetops. The sun sank rapidly; the silvery light had faded from the bare boughs and the watery twilight was setting in when Wilson at last walked down the hill, descending into cooler and cooler depths of grayish shadow."}, {"size": 715, "text": "His nostril, long unused to it, was quick to detect the smell of wood smoke in the air, blended with the odor of moist spring earth and the saltiness that came up the river with the tide. He crossed Charles Street between jangling street cars and shelving lumber drays, and after a moment of uncertainty wound into Brimmer Street. The street was quiet, deserted, and hung with a thin bluish haze. He had already fixed his sharp eye upon the house which he reasoned should be his objective point, when he noticed a woman approaching rapidly from the opposite direction. Always an interested observer of women, Wilson would have slackened his pace anywhere to follow this one with his impersonal, appreciative glance."}, {"size": 648, "text": "She was a person of distinction he saw at once, and, moreover, very handsome. She was tall, carried her beautiful head proudly, and moved with ease and certainty. One immediately took for granted the costly privileges and fine spaces that must lie in the background from which such a figure could emerge with this rapid and elegant gait. Wilson noted her dress, too,--for, in his way, he had an eye for such things,--particularly her brown furs and her hat. He got a blurred impression of her fine color, the violets she wore, her white gloves, and, curiously enough, of her veil, as she turned up a flight of steps in front of him and disappeared."}, {"size": 617, "text": "Wilson was able to enjoy lovely things that passed him on the wing as completely and deliberately as if they had been dug-up marvels, long anticipated, and definitely fixed at the end of a railway journey. For a few pleasurable seconds he quite forgot where he was going, and only after the door had closed behind her did he realize that the young woman had entered the house to which he had directed his trunk from the South Station that morning. He hesitated a moment before mounting the steps. \u201cCan that,\u201d he murmured in amazement,--\u201ccan that possibly have been Mrs. Alexander?\u201d When the servant admitted him, Mrs."}, {"size": 730, "text": "Alexander was still standing in the hallway. She heard him give his name, and came forward holding out her hand. \u201cIs it you, indeed, Professor Wilson? I was afraid that you might get here before I did. I was detained at a concert, and Bartley telephoned that he would be late. Thomas will show you your room. Had you rather have your tea brought to you there, or will you have it down here with me, while we wait for Bartley?\u201d Wilson was pleased to find that he had been the cause of her rapid walk, and with her he was even more vastly pleased than before. He followed her through the drawing-room into the library, where the wide back windows looked out upon the garden and the sunset and a fine stretch of silver-colored river."}, {"size": 635, "text": "A harp-shaped elm stood stripped against the pale-colored evening sky, with ragged last year\u2019s birds\u2019 nests in its forks, and through the bare branches the evening star quivered in the misty air. The long brown room breathed the peace of a rich and amply guarded quiet. Tea was brought in immediately and placed in front of the wood fire. Mrs. Alexander sat down in a high-backed chair and began to pour it, while Wilson sank into a low seat opposite her and took his cup with a great sense of ease and harmony and comfort. \u201cYou have had a long journey, haven\u2019t you?\u201d Mrs. Alexander asked, after showing gracious concern about his tea."}, {"size": 652, "text": "\u201cAnd I am so sorry Bartley is late. He\u2019s often tired when he\u2019s late. He flatters himself that it is a little on his account that you have come to this Congress of Psychologists.\u201d \u201cIt is,\u201d Wilson assented, selecting his muffin carefully; \u201cand I hope he won\u2019t be tired tonight. But, on my own account, I\u2019m glad to have a few moments alone with you, before Bartley comes. I was somehow afraid that my knowing him so well would not put me in the way of getting to know you.\u201d \u201cThat\u2019s very nice of you.\u201d She nodded at him above her cup and smiled, but there was a little formal tightness in her tone which had not been there when she greeted him in the hall."}, {"size": 632, "text": "Wilson leaned forward. \u201cHave I said something awkward? I live very far out of the world, you know. But I didn\u2019t mean that you would exactly fade dim, even if Bartley were here.\u201d Mrs. Alexander laughed relentingly. \u201cOh, I\u2019m not so vain! How terribly discerning you are.\u201d She looked straight at Wilson, and he felt that this quick, frank glance brought about an understanding between them. He liked everything about her, he told himself, but he particularly liked her eyes; when she looked at one directly for a moment they were like a glimpse of fine windy sky that may bring all sorts of weather. \u201cSince you noticed something,\u201d Mrs."}, {"size": 678, "text": "Alexander went on, \u201cit must have been a flash of the distrust I have come to feel whenever I meet any of the people who knew Bartley when he was a boy. It is always as if they were talking of someone I had never met. Really, Professor Wilson, it would seem that he grew up among the strangest people. They usually say that he has turned out very well, or remark that he always was a fine fellow. I never know what reply to make.\u201d Wilson chuckled and leaned back in his chair, shaking his left foot gently. \u201cI expect the fact is that we none of us knew him very well, Mrs. Alexander. Though I will say for myself that I was always confident he\u2019d do something extraordinary.\u201d Mrs."}, {"size": 615, "text": "Alexander\u2019s shoulders gave a slight movement, suggestive of impatience. \u201cOh, I should think that might have been a safe prediction. Another cup, please?\u201d \u201cYes, thank you. But predicting, in the case of boys, is not so easy as you might imagine, Mrs. Alexander. Some get a bad hurt early and lose their courage; and some never get a fair wind. Bartley\u201d--he dropped his chin on the back of his long hand and looked at her admiringly--\u201cBartley caught the wind early, and it has sung in his sails ever since.\u201d Mrs. Alexander sat looking into the fire with intent preoccupation, and Wilson studied her half-averted face."}, {"size": 692, "text": "He liked the suggestion of stormy possibilities in the proud curve of her lip and nostril. Without that, he reflected, she would be too cold. \u201cI should like to know what he was really like when he was a boy. I don\u2019t believe he remembers,\u201d she said suddenly. \u201cWon\u2019t you smoke, Mr. Wilson?\u201d Wilson lit a cigarette. \u201cNo, I don\u2019t suppose he does. He was never introspective. He was simply the most tremendous response to stimuli I have ever known. We didn\u2019t know exactly what to do with him.\u201d A servant came in and noiselessly removed the tea-tray. Mrs. Alexander screened her face from the firelight, which was beginning to throw wavering bright spots on her dress and hair as the dusk deepened."}, {"size": 704, "text": "\u201cOf course,\u201d she said, \u201cI now and again hear stories about things that happened when he was in college.\u201d \u201cBut that isn\u2019t what you want.\u201d Wilson wrinkled his brows and looked at her with the smiling familiarity that had come about so quickly. \u201cWhat you want is a picture of him, standing back there at the other end of twenty years. You want to look down through my memory.\u201d She dropped her hands in her lap. \u201cYes, yes; that\u2019s exactly what I want.\u201d At this moment they heard the front door shut with a jar, and Wilson laughed as Mrs. Alexander rose quickly. \u201cThere he is. Away with perspective! No past, no future for Bartley; just the fiery moment. The only moment that ever was or will be in the world!\u201d"}, {"size": 802, "text": "The door from the hall opened, a voice called \u201cWinifred?\u201d hurriedly, and a big man came through the drawing-room with a quick, heavy tread, bringing with him a smell of cigar smoke and chill out-of-doors air. When Alexander reached the library door, he switched on the lights and stood six feet and more in the archway, glowing with strength and cordiality and rugged, blond good looks. There were other bridge-builders in the world, certainly, but it was always Alexander\u2019s picture that the Sunday Supplement men wanted, because he looked as a tamer of rivers ought to look. Under his tumbled sandy hair his head seemed as hard and powerful as a catapult, and his shoulders looked strong enough in themselves to support a span of any one of his ten great bridges that cut the air above as many rivers."}, {"size": 651, "text": "After dinner Alexander took Wilson up to his study. It was a large room over the library, and looked out upon the black river and the row of white lights along the Cambridge Embankment. The room was not at all what one might expect of an engineer\u2019s study. Wilson felt at once the harmony of beautiful things that have lived long together without obtrusions of ugliness or change. It was none of Alexander\u2019s doing, of course; those warm consonances of color had been blending and mellowing before he was born. But the wonder was that he was not out of place there,--that it all seemed to glow like the inevitable background for his vigor and vehemence."}, {"size": 624, "text": "He sat before the fire, his shoulders deep in the cushions of his chair, his powerful head upright, his hair rumpled above his broad forehead. He sat heavily, a cigar in his large, smooth hand, a flush of after-dinner color in his face, which wind and sun and exposure to all sorts of weather had left fair and clear-skinned. \u201cYou are off for England on Saturday, Bartley, Mrs. Alexander tells me.\u201d \u201cYes, for a few weeks only. There\u2019s a meeting of British engineers, and I\u2019m doing another bridge in Canada, you know.\u201d \u201cOh, every one knows about that. And it was in Canada that you met your wife, wasn\u2019t it?\u201d \u201cYes, at Allway."}, {"size": 631, "text": "She was visiting her great-aunt there. A most remarkable old lady. I was working with MacKeller then, an old Scotch engineer who had picked me up in London and taken me back to Quebec with him. He had the contract for the Allway Bridge, but before he began work on it he found out that he was going to die, and he advised the committee to turn the job over to me. Otherwise I\u2019d never have got anything good so early. MacKeller was an old friend of Mrs. Pemberton, Winifred\u2019s aunt. He had mentioned me to her, so when I went to Allway she asked me to come to see her. She was a wonderful old lady.\u201d \u201cLike her niece?\u201d Wilson queried."}, {"size": 739, "text": "Bartley laughed. \u201cShe had been very handsome, but not in Winifred\u2019s way. When I knew her she was little and fragile, very pink and white, with a splendid head and a face like fine old lace, somehow,--but perhaps I always think of that because she wore a lace scarf on her hair. She had such a flavor of life about her. She had known Gordon and Livingstone and Beaconsfield when she was young,--every one. She was the first woman of that sort I\u2019d ever known. You know how it is in the West,--old people are poked out of the way. Aunt Eleanor fascinated me as few young women have ever done. I used to go up from the works to have tea with her, and sit talking to her for hours. It was very stimulating, for she couldn\u2019t tolerate stupidity.\u201d"}, {"size": 651, "text": "\u201cIt must have been then that your luck began, Bartley,\u201d said Wilson, flicking his cigar ash with his long finger. \u201cIt\u2019s curious, watching boys,\u201d he went on reflectively. \u201cI\u2019m sure I did you justice in the matter of ability. Yet I always used to feel that there was a weak spot where some day strain would tell. Even after you began to climb, I stood down in the crowd and watched you with--well, not with confidence. The more dazzling the front you presented, the higher your facade rose, the more I expected to see a big crack zigzagging from top to bottom,\u201d--he indicated its course in the air with his forefinger,--\u201cthen a crash and clouds of dust."}, {"size": 692, "text": "It was curious. I had such a clear picture of it. And another curious thing, Bartley,\u201d Wilson spoke with deliberateness and settled deeper into his chair, \u201cis that I don\u2019t feel it any longer. I am sure of you.\u201d Alexander laughed. \u201cNonsense! It\u2019s not I you feel sure of; it\u2019s Winifred. People often make that mistake.\u201d \u201cNo, I\u2019m serious, Alexander. You\u2019ve changed. You have decided to leave some birds in the bushes. You used to want them all.\u201d Alexander\u2019s chair creaked. \u201cI still want a good many,\u201d he said rather gloomily. \u201cAfter all, life doesn\u2019t offer a man much. You work like the devil and think you\u2019re getting on, and suddenly you discover that you\u2019ve only been getting yourself tied up."}, {"size": 711, "text": "A million details drink you dry. Your life keeps going for things you don\u2019t want, and all the while you are being built alive into a social structure you don\u2019t care a rap about. I sometimes wonder what sort of chap I\u2019d have been if I hadn\u2019t been this sort; I want to go and live out his potentialities, too. I haven\u2019t forgotten that there are birds in the bushes.\u201d Bartley stopped and sat frowning into the fire, his shoulders thrust forward as if he were about to spring at something. Wilson watched him, wondering. His old pupil always stimulated him at first, and then vastly wearied him. The machinery was always pounding away in this man, and Wilson preferred companions of a more reflective habit of mind."}, {"size": 637, "text": "He could not help feeling that there were unreasoning and unreasonable activities going on in Alexander all the while; that even after dinner, when most men achieve a decent impersonality, Bartley had merely closed the door of the engine-room and come up for an airing. The machinery itself was still pounding on. Bartley\u2019s abstraction and Wilson\u2019s reflections were cut short by a rustle at the door, and almost before they could rise Mrs. Alexander was standing by the hearth. Alexander brought a chair for her, but she shook her head. \u201cNo, dear, thank you. I only came in to see whether you and Professor Wilson were quite comfortable."}, {"size": 600, "text": "I am going down to the music-room.\u201d \u201cWhy not practice here? Wilson and I are growing very dull. We are tired of talk.\u201d \u201cYes, I beg you, Mrs. Alexander,\u201d Wilson began, but he got no further. \u201cWhy, certainly, if you won\u2019t find me too noisy. I am working on the Schumann `Carnival,\u2019 and, though I don\u2019t practice a great many hours, I am very methodical,\u201d Mrs. Alexander explained, as she crossed to an upright piano that stood at the back of the room, near the windows. Wilson followed, and, having seen her seated, dropped into a chair behind her. She played brilliantly and with great musical feeling."}, {"size": 810, "text": "Wilson could not imagine her permitting herself to do anything badly, but he was surprised at the cleanness of her execution. He wondered how a woman with so many duties had managed to keep herself up to a standard really professional. It must take a great deal of time, certainly, and Bartley must take a great deal of time. Wilson reflected that he had never before known a woman who had been able, for any considerable while, to support both a personal and an intellectual passion. Sitting behind her, he watched her with perplexed admiration, shading his eyes with his hand. In her dinner dress she looked even younger than in street clothes, and, for all her composure and self-sufficiency, she seemed to him strangely alert and vibrating, as if in her, too, there were something never altogether at rest."}, {"size": 634, "text": "He felt that he knew pretty much what she demanded in people and what she demanded from life, and he wondered how she squared Bartley. After ten years she must know him; and however one took him, however much one admired him, one had to admit that he simply wouldn\u2019t square. He was a natural force, certainly, but beyond that, Wilson felt, he was not anything very really or for very long at a time. Wilson glanced toward the fire, where Bartley\u2019s profile was still wreathed in cigar smoke that curled up more and more slowly. His shoulders were sunk deep in the cushions and one hand hung large and passive over the arm of his chair."}, {"size": 552, "text": "He had slipped on a purple velvet smoking-coat. His wife, Wilson surmised, had chosen it. She was clearly very proud of his good looks and his fine color. But, with the glow of an immediate interest gone out of it, the engineer\u2019s face looked tired, even a little haggard. The three lines in his forehead, directly above the nose, deepened as he sat thinking, and his powerful head drooped forward heavily. Although Alexander was only forty-three, Wilson thought that beneath his vigorous color he detected the dulling weariness of on-coming middle age."}, {"size": 617, "text": "The next afternoon, at the hour when the river was beginning to redden under the declining sun, Wilson again found himself facing Mrs. Alexander at the tea-table in the library. \u201cWell,\u201d he remarked, when he was bidden to give an account of himself, \u201cthere was a long morning with the psychologists, luncheon with Bartley at his club, more psychologists, and here I am. I\u2019ve looked forward to this hour all day.\u201d Mrs. Alexander smiled at him across the vapor from the kettle. \u201cAnd do you remember where we stopped yesterday?\u201d\u201cPerfectly. I was going to show you a picture. But I doubt whether I have color enough in me."}, {"size": 847, "text": "Bartley makes me feel a faded monochrome. You can\u2019t get at the young Bartley except by means of color.\u201d Wilson paused and deliberated. Suddenly he broke out: \u201cHe wasn\u2019t a remarkable student, you know, though he was always strong in higher mathematics. His work in my own department was quite ordinary. It was as a powerfully equipped nature that I found him interesting. That is the most interesting thing a teacher can find. It has the fascination of a scientific discovery. We come across other pleasing and endearing qualities so much oftener than we find force.\u201d \u201cAnd, after all,\u201d said Mrs. Alexander, \u201cthat is the thing we all live upon. It is the thing that takes us forward.\u201d Wilson thought she spoke a little wistfully. \u201cExactly,\u201d he assented warmly. \u201cIt builds the bridges into the future, over which the feet of every one of us will go.\u201d"}, {"size": 672, "text": "\u201cHow interested I am to hear you put it in that way. The bridges into the future--I often say that to myself. Bartley\u2019s bridges always seem to me like that. Have you ever seen his first suspension bridge in Canada, the one he was doing when I first knew him? I hope you will see it sometime. We were married as soon as it was finished, and you will laugh when I tell you that it always has a rather bridal look to me. It is over the wildest river, with mists and clouds always battling about it, and it is as delicate as a cobweb hanging in the sky. It really was a bridge into the future. You have only to look at it to feel that it meant the beginning of a great career."}, {"size": 639, "text": "But I have a photograph of it here.\u201d She drew a portfolio from behind a bookcase. \u201cAnd there, you see, on the hill, is my aunt\u2019s house.\u201d Wilson took up the photograph. \u201cBartley was telling me something about your aunt last night. She must have been a delightful person.\u201d Winifred laughed. \u201cThe bridge, you see, was just at the foot of the hill, and the noise of the engines annoyed her very much at first. But after she met Bartley she pretended to like it, and said it was a good thing to be reminded that there were things going on in the world. She loved life, and Bartley brought a great deal of it in to her when he came to the house."}, {"size": 693, "text": "Aunt Eleanor was very worldly in a frank, Early-Victorian manner. She liked men of action, and disliked young men who were careful of themselves and who, as she put it, were always trimming their wick as if they were afraid of their oil\u2019s giving out. MacKeller, Bartley\u2019s first chief, was an old friend of my aunt, and he told her that Bartley was a wild, ill-governed youth, which really pleased her very much. I remember we were sitting alone in the dusk after Bartley had been there for the first time. I knew that Aunt Eleanor had found him much to her taste, but she hadn\u2019t said anything. Presently she came out, with a chuckle: `MacKeller found him sowing wild oats in London, I believe."}, {"size": 898, "text": "I hope he didn\u2019t stop him too soon. Life coquets with dashing fellows. The coming men are always like that. We must have him to dinner, my dear.\u2019 And we did. She grew much fonder of Bartley than she was of me. I had been studying in Vienna, and she thought that absurd. She was interested in the army and in politics, and she had a great contempt for music and art and philosophy. She used to declare that the Prince Consort had brought all that stuff over out of Germany. She always sniffed when Bartley asked me to play for him. She considered that a newfangled way of making a match of it.\u201d When Alexander came in a few moments later, he found Wilson and his wife still confronting the photograph. \u201cOh, let us get that out of the way,\u201d he said, laughing. \u201cWinifred, Thomas can bring my trunk down. I\u2019ve decided to go over to New York to-morrow night and take a fast boat. I shall save two days.\u201d"}, {"size": 674, "text": "On the night of his arrival in London, Alexander went immediately to the hotel on the Embankment at which he always stopped, and in the lobby he was accosted by an old acquaintance, Maurice Mainhall, who fell upon him with effusive cordiality and indicated a willingness to dine with him. Bartley never dined alone if he could help it, and Mainhall was a good gossip who always knew what had been going on in town; especially, he knew everything that was not printed in the newspapers. The nephew of one of the standard Victorian novelists, Mainhall bobbed about among the various literary cliques of London and its outlying suburbs, careful to lose touch with none of them."}, {"size": 683, "text": "He had written a number of books himself; among them a \u201cHistory of Dancing,\u201d a \u201cHistory of Costume,\u201d a \u201cKey to Shakespeare\u2019s Sonnets,\u201d a study of \u201cThe Poetry of Ernest Dowson,\u201d etc. Although Mainhall\u2019s enthusiasm was often tiresome, and although he was often unable to distinguish between facts and vivid figments of his imagination, his imperturbable good nature overcame even the people whom he bored most, so that they ended by becoming, in a reluctant manner, his friends. In appearance, Mainhall was astonishingly like the conventional stage-Englishman of American drama: tall and thin, with high, hitching shoulders and a small head glistening with closely brushed yellow hair."}, {"size": 690, "text": "He spoke with an extreme Oxford accent, and when he was talking well, his face sometimes wore the rapt expression of a very emotional man listening to music. Mainhall liked Alexander because he was an engineer. He had preconceived ideas about everything, and his idea about Americans was that they should be engineers or mechanics. He hated them when they presumed to be anything else. While they sat at dinner Mainhall acquainted Bartley with the fortunes of his old friends in London, and as they left the table he proposed that they should go to see Hugh MacConnell\u2019s new comedy, \u201cBog Lights.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s really quite the best thing MacConnell\u2019s done,\u201d he explained as they got into a hansom."}, {"size": 607, "text": "\u201cIt\u2019s tremendously well put on, too. Florence Merrill and Cyril Henderson. But Hilda Burgoyne\u2019s the hit of the piece. Hugh\u2019s written a delightful part for her, and she\u2019s quite inexpressible. It\u2019s been on only two weeks, and I\u2019ve been half a dozen times already. I happen to have MacConnell\u2019s box for tonight or there\u2019d be no chance of our getting places. There\u2019s everything in seeing Hilda while she\u2019s fresh in a part. She\u2019s apt to grow a bit stale after a time. The ones who have any imagination do.\u201d \u201cHilda Burgoyne!\u201d Alexander exclaimed mildly. \u201cWhy, I haven\u2019t heard of her for--years.\u201d Mainhall laughed."}, {"size": 657, "text": "\u201cThen you can\u2019t have heard much at all, my dear Alexander. It\u2019s only lately, since MacConnell and his set have got hold of her, that she\u2019s come up. Myself, I always knew she had it in her. If we had one real critic in London--but what can one expect? Do you know, Alexander,\u201d--Mainhall looked with perplexity up into the top of the hansom and rubbed his pink cheek with his gloved finger,--\u201cdo you know, I sometimes think of taking to criticism seriously myself. In a way, it would be a sacrifice; but, dear me, we do need some one.\u201d Just then they drove up to the Duke of York\u2019s, so Alexander did not commit himself, but followed Mainhall into the theatre."}, {"size": 808, "text": "When they entered the stage-box on the left the first act was well under way, the scene being the interior of a cabin in the south of Ireland. As they sat down, a burst of applause drew Alexander\u2019s attention to the stage. Miss Burgoyne and her donkey were thrusting their heads in at the half door. \u201cAfter all,\u201d he reflected, \u201cthere\u2019s small probability of her recognizing me. She doubtless hasn\u2019t thought of me for years.\u201d He felt the enthusiasm of the house at once, and in a few moments he was caught up by the current of MacConnell\u2019s irresistible comedy. The audience had come forewarned, evidently, and whenever the ragged slip of a donkey-girl ran upon the stage there was a deep murmur of approbation, every one smiled and glowed, and Mainhall hitched his heavy chair a little nearer the brass railing."}, {"size": 864, "text": "\u201cYou see,\u201d he murmured in Alexander\u2019s ear, as the curtain fell on the first act, \u201cone almost never sees a part like that done without smartness or mawkishness. Of course, Hilda is Irish,--the Burgoynes have been stage people for generations,--and she has the Irish voice. It\u2019s delightful to hear it in a London theatre. That laugh, now, when she doubles over at the hips--who ever heard it out of Galway? She saves her hand, too. She\u2019s at her best in the second act.

When she began to dance, by way of showing the gossoons what she had seen in the fairy rings at night, the house broke into a prolonged uproar.

He remembered that, in so far as she had been brought up at all, she had been brought up in Bloomsbury.

That forbidding pile was the goal of her truant fancy, and she was sometimes taken there for a treat, as other children are taken to the theatre.

The new number probably meant increased prosperity. He hoped so. He would like to know that she was snugly settled. He looked at his watch. It was a quarter past ten; she would not be home for a good two hours yet, and he might as well walk over and have a look at the place. He remembered the shortest way. It was a warm, smoky evening, and there was a grimy moon. He went through Covent Garden to Oxford Street, and as he turned into Museum Street he walked more slowly, smiling at his own nervousness as he approached the sullen gray mass at the end."}, {"size": 698, "text": "He had not been inside the Museum, actually, since he and Hilda used to meet there; sometimes to set out for gay adventures at Twickenham or Richmond, sometimes to linger about the place for a while and to ponder by Lord Elgin\u2019s marbles upon the lastingness of some things, or, in the mummy room, upon the awful brevity of others. Since then Bartley had always thought of the British Museum as the ultimate repository of mortality, where all the dead things in the world were assembled to make one\u2019s hour of youth the more precious. One trembled lest before he got out it might somehow escape him, lest he might drop the glass from over-eagerness and see it shivered on the stone floor at his feet."}, {"size": 635, "text": "How one hid his youth under his coat and hugged it! And how good it was to turn one\u2019s back upon all that vaulted cold, to take Hilda\u2019s arm and hurry out of the great door and down the steps into the sunlight among the pigeons--to know that the warm and vital thing within him was still there and had not been snatched away to flush Caesar\u2019s lean cheek or to feed the veins of some bearded Assyrian king. They in their day had carried the flaming liquor, but to-day was his! So the song used to run in his head those summer mornings a dozen years ago. Alexander walked by the place very quietly, as if he were afraid of waking some one."}, {"size": 638, "text": "He crossed Bedford Square and found the number he was looking for. The house, a comfortable, well-kept place enough, was dark except for the four front windows on the second floor, where a low, even light was burning behind the white muslin sash curtains. Outside there were window boxes, painted white and full of flowers. Bartley was making a third round of the Square when he heard the far-flung hoof-beats of a hansom-cab horse, driven rapidly. He looked at his watch, and was astonished to find that it was a few minutes after twelve. He turned and walked back along the iron railing as the cab came up to Hilda\u2019s number and stopped."}, {"size": 666, "text": "The hansom must have been one that she employed regularly, for she did not stop to pay the driver. She stepped out quickly and lightly. He heard her cheerful \u201cGood-night, cabby,\u201d as she ran up the steps and opened the door with a latchkey. In a few moments the lights flared up brightly behind the white curtains, and as he walked away he heard a window raised. But he had gone too far to look up without turning round. He went back to his hotel, feeling that he had had a good evening, and he slept well. For the next few days Alexander was very busy. He took a desk in the office of a Scotch engineering firm on Henrietta Street, and was at work almost constantly."}, {"size": 665, "text": "He avoided the clubs and usually dined alone at his hotel. One afternoon, after he had tea, he started for a walk down the Embankment toward Westminster, intending to end his stroll at Bedford Square and to ask whether Miss Burgoyne would let him take her to the theatre. But he did not go so far. When he reached the Abbey, he turned back and crossed Westminster Bridge and sat down to watch the trails of smoke behind the Houses of Parliament catch fire with the sunset. The slender towers were washed by a rain of golden light and licked by little flickering flames; Somerset House and the bleached gray pinnacles about Whitehall were floated in a luminous haze."}, {"size": 700, "text": "The yellow light poured through the trees and the leaves seemed to burn with soft fires. There was a smell of acacias in the air everywhere, and the laburnums were dripping gold over the walls of the gardens. It was a sweet, lonely kind of summer evening. Remembering Hilda as she used to be, was doubtless more satisfactory than seeing her as she must be now--and, after all, Alexander asked himself, what was it but his own young years that he was remembering? He crossed back to Westminster, went up to the Temple, and sat down to smoke in the Middle Temple gardens, listening to the thin voice of the fountain and smelling the spice of the sycamores that came out heavily in the damp evening air."}, {"size": 625, "text": "He thought, as he sat there, about a great many things: about his own youth and Hilda\u2019s; above all, he thought of how glorious it had been, and how quickly it had passed; and, when it had passed, how little worth while anything was. None of the things he had gained in the least compensated. In the last six years his reputation had become, as the saying is, popular. Four years ago he had been called to Japan to deliver, at the Emperor\u2019s request, a course of lectures at the Imperial University, and had instituted reforms throughout the islands, not only in the practice of bridge-building but in drainage and road-making."}, {"size": 856, "text": "On his return he had undertaken the bridge at Moorlock, in Canada, the most important piece of bridge-building going on in the world,--a test, indeed, of how far the latest practice in bridge structure could be carried. It was a spectacular undertaking by reason of its very size, and Bartley realized that, whatever else he might do, he would probably always be known as the engineer who designed the great Moorlock Bridge, the longest cantilever in existence. Yet it was to him the least satisfactory thing he had ever done. He was cramped in every way by a niggardly commission, and was using lighter structural material than he thought proper. He had vexations enough, too, with his work at home. He had several bridges under way in the United States, and they were always being held up by strikes and delays resulting from a general industrial unrest."}, {"size": 736, "text": "Though Alexander often told himself he had never put more into his work than he had done in the last few years, he had to admit that he had never got so little out of it. He was paying for success, too, in the demands made on his time by boards of civic enterprise and committees of public welfare. The obligations imposed by his wife\u2019s fortune and position were sometimes distracting to a man who followed his profession, and he was expected to be interested in a great many worthy endeavors on her account as well as on his own. His existence was becoming a network of great and little details. He had expected that success would bring him freedom and power; but it had brought only power that was in itself another kind of restraint."}, {"size": 684, "text": "He had always meant to keep his personal liberty at all costs, as old MacKeller, his first chief, had done, and not, like so many American engineers, to become a part of a professional movement, a cautious board member, a Nestor de pontibus. He happened to be engaged in work of public utility, but he was not willing to become what is called a public man. He found himself living exactly the kind of life he had determined to escape. What, he asked himself, did he want with these genial honors and substantial comforts? Hardships and difficulties he had carried lightly; overwork had not exhausted him; but this dead calm of middle life which confronted him,--of that he was afraid."}, {"size": 751, "text": "He was not ready for it. It was like being buried alive. In his youth he would not have believed such a thing possible. The one thing he had really wanted all his life was to be free; and there was still something unconquered in him, something besides the strong work-horse that his profession had made of him. He felt rich to-night in the possession of that unstultified survival; in the light of his experience, it was more precious than honors or achievement. In all those busy, successful years there had been nothing so good as this hour of wild light-heartedness.

He remembered how, when he was a little boy and his father called him in the morning, he used to leap from his bed into the full consciousness of himself. That consciousness was Life itself.

Solitude, but not solitariness; for he walked shoulder to shoulder with a shadowy companion--not little Hilda Burgoyne, by any means, but some one vastly dearer to him than she had ever been--his own young self, the youth who had waited for him upon the steps of the British Museum that night, and who, though he had tried to pass so quietly, had known him and come down and linked an arm in his.

They were all laughing and bending toward her. When she saw Alexander, she rose quickly and put out her hand. The other men drew back a little to let him approach. \u201cMr. Alexander! I am delighted. Have you been in London long?\u201d Bartley bowed, somewhat laboriously, over her hand. \u201cLong enough to have seen you more than once.

She was sitting on the edge of her chair, as if she had alighted there for a moment only.

The weather had so far been dark and raw. For two hours he had been watching the low, dirty sky and the beating of the heavy rain upon the iron-colored sea. There was a long, oily swell that made exercise laborious. The decks smelled of damp woolens, and the air was so humid that drops of moisture kept gathering upon his hair and mustache. He seldom moved except to brush them away. The great open spaces made him passive and the restlessness of the water quieted him."}, {"size": 679, "text": "He intended during the voyage to decide upon a course of action, but he held all this away from him for the present and lay in a blessed gray oblivion. Deep down in him somewhere his resolution was weakening and strengthening, ebbing and flowing. The thing that perturbed him went on as steadily as his pulse, but he was almost unconscious of it. He was submerged in the vast impersonal grayness about him, and at intervals the sidelong roll of the boat measured off time like the ticking of a clock. He felt released from everything that troubled and perplexed him. It was as if he had tricked and outwitted torturing memories, had actually managed to get on board without them."}, {"size": 647, "text": "He thought of nothing at all. If his mind now and again picked a face out of the grayness, it was Lucius Wilson\u2019s, or the face of an old schoolmate, forgotten for years; or it was the slim outline of a favorite greyhound he used to hunt jack-rabbits with when he was a boy. Toward six o\u2019clock the wind rose and tugged at the tarpaulin and brought the swell higher. After dinner Alexander came back to the wet deck, piled his damp rugs over him again, and sat smoking, losing himself in the obliterating blackness and drowsing in the rush of the gale. Before he went below a few bright stars were pricked off between heavily moving masses of cloud."}, {"size": 659, "text": "The next morning was bright and mild, with a fresh breeze. Alexander felt the need of exercise even before he came out of his cabin. When he went on deck the sky was blue and blinding, with heavy whiffs of white cloud, smoke-colored at the edges, moving rapidly across it. The water was roughish, a cold, clear indigo breaking into whitecaps. Bartley walked for two hours, and then stretched himself in the sun until lunch-time. In the afternoon he wrote a long letter to Winifred. Later, as he walked the deck through a splendid golden sunset, his spirits rose continually. It was agreeable to come to himself again after several days of numbness and torpor."}, {"size": 658, "text": "He stayed out until the last tinge of violet had faded from the water. There was literally a taste of life on his lips as he sat down to dinner and ordered a bottle of champagne. He was late in finishing his dinner, and drank rather more wine than he had meant to. When he went above, the wind had risen and the deck was almost deserted. As he stepped out of the door a gale lifted his heavy fur coat about his shoulders. He fought his way up the deck with keen exhilaration. The moment he stepped, almost out of breath, behind the shelter of the stern, the wind was cut off, and he felt, like a rush of warm air, a sense of close and intimate companionship."}, {"size": 647, "text": "He started back and tore his coat open as if something warm were actually clinging to him beneath it. He hurried up the deck and went into the saloon parlor, full of women who had retreated thither from the sharp wind. He threw himself upon them. He talked delightfully to the older ones and played accompaniments for the younger ones until the last sleepy girl had followed her mother below. Then he went into the smoking-room. He played bridge until two o\u2019clock in the morning, and managed to lose a considerable sum of money without really noticing that he was doing so. After the break of one fine day the weather was pretty consistently dull."}, {"size": 704, "text": "When the low sky thinned a trifle, the pale white spot of a sun did no more than throw a bluish lustre on the water, giving it the dark brightness of newly cut lead. Through one after another of those gray days Alexander drowsed and mused, drinking in the grateful moisture. But the complete peace of the first part of the voyage was over. Sometimes he rose suddenly from his chair as if driven out, and paced the deck for hours. People noticed his propensity for walking in rough weather, and watched him curiously as he did his rounds. From his abstraction and the determined set of his jaw, they fancied he must be thinking about his bridge. Every one had heard of the new cantilever bridge in Canada."}, {"size": 672, "text": "But Alexander was not thinking about his work. After the fourth night out, when his will suddenly softened under his hands, he had been continually hammering away at himself. More and more often, when he first wakened in the morning or when he stepped into a warm place after being chilled on the deck, he felt a sudden painful delight at being nearer another shore. Sometimes when he was most despondent, when he thought himself worn out with this struggle, in a flash he was free of it and leaped into an overwhelming consciousness of himself. On the instant he felt that marvelous return of the impetuousness, the intense excitement, the increasing expectancy of youth."}, {"size": 622, "text": "The last two days of the voyage Bartley found almost intolerable. The stop at Queenstown, the tedious passage up the Mersey, were things that he noted dimly through his growing impatience.

She blushed and smiled and fumbled his card in her confusion before she ran upstairs."}, {"size": 657, "text": "Alexander paced up and down the hallway, buttoning and unbuttoning his overcoat, until she returned and took him up to Hilda\u2019s living-room. The room was empty when he entered. A coal fire was crackling in the grate and the lamps were lit, for it was already beginning to grow dark outside. Alexander did not sit down. He stood his ground over by the windows until Hilda came in. She called his name on the threshold, but in her swift flight across the room she felt a change in him and caught herself up so deftly that he could not tell just when she did it.

Except for an old farmer, jogging along the highroad in his box-wagon, there was not another living creature to be seen.

And after the light went out he walked alone, taking the heavens into his confidence, unable to tear himself away from the white magic of the night, unwilling to sleep because longing was so sweet to him, and because, for the first time since first the hills were hung with moonlight, there was a lover in the world."}, {"size": 603, "text": "And always there was the sound of the rushing water underneath, the sound which, more than anything else, meant death; the wearing away of things under the impact of physical forces which men could direct but never circumvent or diminish.

Alexander, still standing at the end of the river span, saw the lower chord of the cantilever arm give a little, like an elbow bending. He shouted and ran after the second gang, but by this time every one knew that the big river span was slowly settling. There was a burst of shouting that was immediately drowned by the scream and cracking of tearing iron, as all the tension work began to pull asunder. Once the chords began to buckle, there were thousands of tons of ironwork, all riveted together and lying in midair without support."}, {"size": 614, "text": "It tore itself to pieces with roaring and grinding and noises that were like the shrieks of a steam whistle. There was no shock of any kind; the bridge had no impetus except from its own weight. It lurched neither to right nor left, but sank almost in a vertical line, snapping and breaking and tearing as it went, because no integral part could bear for an instant the enormous strain loosed upon it. Some of the men jumped and some ran, trying to make the shore. At the first shriek of the tearing iron, Alexander jumped from the downstream side of the bridge.

When it seemed impossible, and his chest was about to heave, he thought he heard his wife telling him that he could hold out a little longer. An instant later his face cleared the water. For a moment, in the depths of the river, he had realized what it would mean to die a hypocrite, and to lie dead under the last abandonment of her tenderness. But once in the light and air, he knew he should live to tell her and to recover all he had lost. Now, at last, he felt sure of himself. He was not startled. It seemed to him that he had been through something of this sort before."}, {"size": 669, "text": "There was nothing horrible about it. This, too, was life, and life was activity, just as it was in Boston or in London. He was himself, and there was something to be done; everything seemed perfectly natural. Alexander was a strong swimmer, but he had gone scarcely a dozen strokes when the bridge itself, which had been settling faster and faster, crashed into the water behind him. Immediately the river was full of drowning men. A gang of French Canadians fell almost on top of him. He thought he had cleared them, when they began coming up all around him, clutching at him and at each other. Some of them could swim, but they were either hurt or crazed with fright."}, {"size": 515, "text": "Alexander tried to beat them off, but there were too many of them. One caught him about the neck, another gripped him about the middle, and they went down together. When he sank, his wife seemed to be there in the water beside him, telling him to keep his head, that if he could hold out the men would drown and release him. There was something he wanted to tell his wife, but he could not think clearly for the roaring in his ears. Suddenly he remembered what it was. He caught his breath, and then she let him go."}, {"size": 694, "text": "The work of recovering the dead went on all day and all the following night. By the next morning forty-eight bodies had been taken out of the river, but there were still twenty missing. Many of the men had fallen with the bridge and were held down under the debris. Early on the morning of the second day a closed carriage was driven slowly along the river-bank and stopped a little below the works, where the river boiled and churned about the great iron carcass which lay in a straight line two thirds across it. The carriage stood there hour after hour, and word soon spread among the crowds on the shore that its occupant was the wife of the Chief Engineer; his body had not yet been found."}, {"size": 661, "text": "The widows of the lost workmen, moving up and down the bank with shawls over their heads, some of them carrying babies, looked at the rusty hired hack many times that morning.

That\u2019s Mrs. Alexander. They haven\u2019t found him yet. She got off the train this morning. Horton met her.

But, you see, Mrs. Alexander, such a thing never happened before. According to all human calculations, it simply couldn\u2019t happen.\u201d Horton leaned wearily against the front wheel of the cab. He had not had his clothes off for thirty hours, and the stimulus of violent excitement was beginning to wear off. \u201cDon\u2019t be afraid to tell me the worst, Mr. Horton.

For Alexander death was an easy creditor. Fortune, which had smiled upon him consistently all his life, did not desert him in the end.

One afternoon, soon after his return, he put on his frock-coat and drove in a hansom to pay a call upon Hilda Burgoyne, who still lived at her old number, off Bedford Square. He and Miss Burgoyne had been fast friends for a long time. He had first noticed her about the corridors of the British Museum, where he read constantly. Her being there so often had made him feel that he would like to know her, and as she was not an inaccessible person, an introduction was not difficult.

She sent for fresh tea and made him comfortable, as she had such a knack of making people comfortable. \u201cHow good you were to come back before Christmas! I quite dreaded the Holidays without you.

Hilda laughed as she carefully poured his cream. \u201cThat means that I was looking very seedy at the end of the season, doesn\u2019t it? Well, we must show wear at last, you know.\u201d Wilson took the cup gratefully. \u201cAh, no need to remind a man of seventy, who has just been home to find that he has survived all his contemporaries.

I can\u2019t even let you go home again. You must stay put, now that I have you back. You\u2019re the realest thing I have.\u201d Wilson chuckled. \u201cDear me, am I?
