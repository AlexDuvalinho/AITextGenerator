To the left a group of barren islets, suggesting ruins of stone walls, towers, and blockhouses, had its foundations set in a blue sea that itself looked solid, so still and stable did it lie below my feet; even the track of light from the westering sun shone smoothly, without that animated glitter which tells of an imperceptible ripple."}, {"size": 796, "text": "And when I turned my head to take a parting glance at the tug which had just left us anchored outside the bar, I saw the straight line of the flat shore joined to the stable sea, edge to edge, with a perfect and unmarked closeness, in one leveled floor half brown, half blue under the enormous dome of the sky. Corresponding in their insignificance to the islets of the sea, two small clumps of trees, one on each side of the only fault in the impeccable joint, marked the mouth of the river Meinam we had just left on the first preparatory stage of our homeward journey; and, far back on the inland level, a larger and loftier mass, the grove surrounding the great Paknam pagoda, was the only thing on which the eye could rest from the vain task of exploring the monotonous sweep of the horizon."}, {"size": 649, "text": "Here and there gleams as of a few scattered pieces of silver marked the windings of the great river; and on the nearest of them, just within the bar, the tug steaming right into the land became lost to my sight, hull and funnel and masts, as though the impassive earth had swallowed her up without an effort, without a tremor. My eye followed the light cloud of her smoke, now here, now there, above the plain, according to the devious curves of the stream, but always fainter and farther away, till I lost it at last behind the miter-shaped hill of the great pagoda. And then I was left alone with my ship, anchored at the head of the Gulf of Siam."}, {"size": 619, "text": "She floated at the starting point of a long journey, very still in an immense stillness, the shadows of her spars flung far to the eastward by the setting sun. At that moment I was alone on her decks. There was not a sound in her--and around us nothing moved, nothing lived, not a canoe on the water, not a bird in the air, not a cloud in the sky. In this breathless pause at the threshold of a long passage we seemed to be measuring our fitness for a long and arduous enterprise, the appointed task of both our existences to be carried out, far from all human eyes, with only sky and sea for spectators and for judges."}, {"size": 634, "text": "There must have been some glare in the air to interfere with one\u2019s sight, because it was only just before the sun left us that my roaming eyes made out beyond the highest ridges of the principal islet of the group something which did away with the solemnity of perfect solitude. The tide of darkness flowed on swiftly; and with tropical suddenness a swarm of stars came out above the shadowy earth, while I lingered yet, my hand resting lightly on my ship\u2019s rail as if on the shoulder of a trusted friend. But, with all that multitude of celestial bodies staring down at one, the comfort of quiet communion with her was gone for good."}, {"size": 626, "text": "And there were also disturbing sounds by this time--voices, footsteps forward; the steward flitted along the main-deck, a busily ministering spirit; a hand bell tinkled urgently under the poop deck.... I found my two officers waiting for me near the supper table, in the lighted cuddy. We sat down at once, and as I helped the chief mate, I said: \u201cAre you aware that there is a ship anchored inside the islands? I saw her mastheads above the ridge as the sun went down.\u201d He raised sharply his simple face, overcharged by a terrible growth of whisker, and emitted his usual ejaculations: \u201cBless my soul, sir! You don\u2019t say so!\u201d"}, {"size": 612, "text": "My second mate was a round-cheeked, silent young man, grave beyond his years, I thought; but as our eyes happened to meet I detected a slight quiver on his lips. I looked down at once. It was not my part to encourage sneering on board my ship. It must be said, too, that I knew very little of my officers. In consequence of certain events of no particular significance, except to myself, I had been appointed to the command only a fortnight before. Neither did I know much of the hands forward. All these people had been together for eighteen months or so, and my position was that of the only stranger on board."}, {"size": 738, "text": "I mention this because it has some bearing on what is to follow. But what I felt most was my being a stranger to the ship; and if all the truth must be told, I was somewhat of a stranger to myself. The youngest man on board (barring the second mate), and untried as yet by a position of the fullest responsibility, I was willing to take the adequacy of the others for granted. They had simply to be equal to their tasks; but I wondered how far I should turn out faithful to that ideal conception of one\u2019s own personality every man sets up for himself secretly. Meantime the chief mate, with an almost visible effect of collaboration on the part of his round eyes and frightful whiskers, was trying to evolve a theory of the anchored ship."}, {"size": 710, "text": "His dominant trait was to take all things into earnest consideration. He was of a painstaking turn of mind. As he used to say, he \u201cliked to account to himself\u201d for practically everything that came in his way, down to a miserable scorpion he had found in his cabin a week before. The why and the wherefore of that scorpion--how it got on board and came to select his room rather than the pantry (which was a dark place and more what a scorpion would be partial to), and how on earth it managed to drown itself in the inkwell of his writing desk--had exercised him infinitely. The ship within the islands was much more easily accounted for; and just as we were about to rise from table he made his pronouncement."}, {"size": 750, "text": "She was, he doubted not, a ship from home lately arrived. Probably she drew too much water to cross the bar except at the top of spring tides. Therefore she went into that natural harbor to wait for a few days in preference to remaining in an open roadstead. \u201cThat\u2019s so,\u201d confirmed the second mate, suddenly, in his slightly hoarse voice. \u201cShe draws over twenty feet. She\u2019s the Liverpool ship Sephora with a cargo of coal. Hundred and twenty-three days from Cardiff.\u201d We looked at him in surprise. \u201cThe tugboat skipper told me when he came on board for your letters, sir,\u201d explained the young man. \u201cHe expects to take her up the river the day after tomorrow.\u201d After thus overwhelming us with the extent of his information he slipped out of the cabin."}, {"size": 667, "text": "The mate observed regretfully that he \u201ccould not account for that young fellow\u2019s whims.\u201d What prevented him telling us all about it at once, he wanted to know. I detained him as he was making a move. For the last two days the crew had had plenty of hard work, and the night before they had very little sleep. I felt painfully that I--a stranger--was doing something unusual when I directed him to let all hands turn in without setting an anchor watch. I proposed to keep on deck myself till one o\u2019clock or thereabouts. I would get the second mate to relieve me at that hour. \u201cHe will turn out the cook and the steward at four,\u201d I concluded, \u201cand then give you a call."}, {"size": 715, "text": "Of course at the slightest sign of any sort of wind we\u2019ll have the hands up and make a start at once.\u201d He concealed his astonishment. \u201cVery well, sir.\u201d Outside the cuddy he put his head in the second mate\u2019s door to inform him of my unheard-of caprice to take a five hours\u2019 anchor watch on myself. I heard the other raise his voice incredulously--\u201cWhat? The Captain himself?\u201d Then a few more murmurs, a door closed, then another. A few moments later I went on deck. My strangeness, which had made me sleepless, had prompted that unconventional arrangement, as if I had expected in those solitary hours of the night to get on terms with the ship of which I knew nothing, manned by men of whom I knew very little more."}, {"size": 871, "text": "Fast alongside a wharf, littered like any ship in port with a tangle of unrelated things, invaded by unrelated shore people, I had hardly seen her yet properly. Now, as she lay cleared for sea, the stretch of her main-deck seemed to me very fine under the stars. Very fine, very roomy for her size, and very inviting. I descended the poop and paced the waist, my mind picturing to myself the coming passage through the Malay Archipelago, down the Indian Ocean, and up the Atlantic. All its phases were familiar enough to me, every characteristic, all the alternatives which were likely to face me on the high seas--everything!... except the novel responsibility of command. But I took heart from the reasonable thought that the ship was like other ships, the men like other men, and that the sea was not likely to keep any special surprises expressly for my discomfiture."}, {"size": 820, "text": "Arrived at that comforting conclusion, I bethought myself of a cigar and went below to get it. All was still down there. Everybody at the after end of the ship was sleeping profoundly. I came out again on the quarter-deck, agreeably at ease in my sleeping suit on that warm breathless night, barefooted, a glowing cigar in my teeth, and, going forward, I was met by the profound silence of the fore end of the ship. Only as I passed the door of the forecastle, I heard a deep, quiet, trustful sigh of some sleeper inside. And suddenly I rejoiced in the great security of the sea as compared with the unrest of the land, in my choice of that untempted life presenting no disquieting problems, invested with an elementary moral beauty by the absolute straightforwardness of its appeal and by the singleness of its purpose."}, {"size": 655, "text": "The riding light in the forerigging burned with a clear, untroubled, as if symbolic, flame, confident and bright in the mysterious shades of the night. Passing on my way aft along the other side of the ship, I observed that the rope side ladder, put over, no doubt, for the master of the tug when he came to fetch away our letters, had not been hauled in as it should have been. I became annoyed at this, for exactitude in some small matters is the very soul of discipline. Then I reflected that I had myself peremptorily dismissed my officers from duty, and by my own act had prevented the anchor watch being formally set and things properly attended to."}, {"size": 877, "text": "I asked myself whether it was wise ever to interfere with the established routine of duties even from the kindest of motives. My action might have made me appear eccentric. Goodness only knew how that absurdly whiskered mate would \u201caccount\u201d for my conduct, and what the whole ship thought of that informality of their new captain. I was vexed with myself. Not from compunction certainly, but, as it were mechanically, I proceeded to get the ladder in myself. Now a side ladder of that sort is a light affair and comes in easily, yet my vigorous tug, which should have brought it flying on board, merely recoiled upon my body in a totally unexpected jerk. What the devil!... I was so astounded by the immovableness of that ladder that I remained stock-still, trying to account for it to myself like that imbecile mate of mine. In the end, of course, I put my head over the rail."}, {"size": 608, "text": "The side of the ship made an opaque belt of shadow on the darkling glassy shimmer of the sea. But I saw at once something elongated and pale floating very close to the ladder. Before I could form a guess a faint flash of phosphorescent light, which seemed to issue suddenly from the naked body of a man, flickered in the sleeping water with the elusive, silent play of summer lightning in a night sky. With a gasp I saw revealed to my stare a pair of feet, the long legs, a broad livid back immersed right up to the neck in a greenish cadaverous glow. One hand, awash, clutched the bottom rung of the ladder."}, {"size": 673, "text": "He was complete but for the head. A headless corpse! The cigar dropped out of my gaping mouth with a tiny plop and a short hiss quite audible in the absolute stillness of all things under heaven. At that I suppose he raised up his face, a dimly pale oval in the shadow of the ship\u2019s side. But even then I could only barely make out down there the shape of his black-haired head. However, it was enough for the horrid, frost-bound sensation which had gripped me about the chest to pass off. The moment of vain exclamations was past, too. I only climbed on the spare spar and leaned over the rail as far as I could, to bring my eyes nearer to that mystery floating alongside."}, {"size": 693, "text": "As he hung by the ladder, like a resting swimmer, the sea lightning played about his limbs at every stir; and he appeared in it ghastly, silvery, fishlike. He remained as mute as a fish, too. He made no motion to get out of the water, either. It was inconceivable that he should not attempt to come on board, and strangely troubling to suspect that perhaps he did not want to. And my first words were prompted by just that troubled incertitude. \u201cWhat\u2019s the matter?\u201d I asked in my ordinary tone, speaking down to the face upturned exactly under mine. \u201cCramp,\u201d it answered, no louder. Then slightly anxious, \u201cI say, no need to call anyone.\u201d \u201cI was not going to,\u201d I said. \u201cAre you alone on deck?\u201d"}, {"size": 673, "text": "I had somehow the impression that he was on the point of letting go the ladder to swim away beyond my ken--mysterious as he came. But, for the moment, this being appearing as if he had risen from the bottom of the sea (it was certainly the nearest land to the ship) wanted only to know the time. I told him. And he, down there, tentatively: \u201cI suppose your captain\u2019s turned in?\u201d \u201cI am sure he isn\u2019t,\u201d I said. He seemed to struggle with himself, for I heard something like the low, bitter murmur of doubt. \u201cWhat\u2019s the good?\u201d His next words came out with a hesitating effort. \u201cLook here, my man. Could you call him out quietly?\u201d I thought the time had come to declare myself."}, {"size": 670, "text": "I heard a \u201cBy Jove!\u201d whispered at the level of the water. The phosphorescence flashed in the swirl of the water all about his limbs, his other hand seized the ladder. The voice was calm and resolute. A good voice. The self-possession of that man had somehow induced a corresponding state in myself. It was very quietly that I remarked: \u201cYou must be a good swimmer.\u201d \u201cYes. I\u2019ve been in the water practically since nine o\u2019clock. The question for me now is whether I am to let go this ladder and go on swimming till I sink from exhaustion, or--to come on board here.\u201d I felt this was no mere formula of desperate speech, but a real alternative in the view of a strong soul."}, {"size": 622, "text": "I should have gathered from this that he was young; indeed, it is only the young who are ever confronted by such clear issues. But at the time it was pure intuition on my part. A mysterious communication was established already between us two--in the face of that silent, darkened tropical sea. I was young, too; young enough to make no comment. The man in the water began suddenly to climb up the ladder, and I hastened away from the rail to fetch some clothes. Before entering the cabin I stood still, listening in the lobby at the foot of the stairs. A faint snore came through the closed door of the chief mate\u2019s room."}, {"size": 751, "text": "The second mate\u2019s door was on the hook, but the darkness in there was absolutely soundless. He, too, was young and could sleep like a stone. Remained the steward, but he was not likely to wake up before he was called. I got a sleeping suit out of my room and, coming back on deck, saw the naked man from the sea sitting on the main hatch, glimmering white in the darkness, his elbows on his knees and his head in his hands. In a moment he had concealed his damp body in a sleeping suit of the same gray-stripe pattern as the one I was wearing and followed me like my double on the poop. Together we moved right aft, barefooted, silent. \u201cWhat is it?\u201d I asked in a deadened voice, taking the lighted lamp out of the binnacle, and raising it to his face."}, {"size": 625, "text": "He had rather regular features; a good mouth; light eyes under somewhat heavy, dark eyebrows; a smooth, square forehead; no growth on his cheeks; a small, brown mustache, and a well-shaped, round chin. His expression was concentrated, meditative, under the inspecting light of the lamp I held up to his face; such as a man thinking hard in solitude might wear. My sleeping suit was just right for his size. A well-knit young fellow of twenty-five at most. He caught his lower lip with the edge of white, even teeth. \u201cYes,\u201d I said, replacing the lamp in the binnacle. The warm, heavy tropical night closed upon his head again."}, {"size": 814, "text": "\u201cThere\u2019s a ship over there,\u201d he murmured. \u201cYes, I know. The Sephora. Did you know of us?\u201d \u201cHadn\u2019t the slightest idea. I am the mate of her--\u201d He paused and corrected himself. \u201cI should say I _was_.\u201d \u201cAha! Something wrong?\u201d \u201cYes. Very wrong indeed. I\u2019ve killed a man.\u201d \u201cWhat do you mean? Just now?\u201d \u201cNo, on the passage. Weeks ago. Thirty-nine south. When I say a man--\u201d \u201cFit of temper,\u201d I suggested, confidently. The shadowy, dark head, like mine, seemed to nod imperceptibly above the ghostly gray of my sleeping suit. It was, in the night, as though I had been faced by my own reflection in the depths of a somber and immense mirror. \u201cA pretty thing to have to own up to for a Conway boy,\u201d murmured my double, distinctly. \u201cYou\u2019re a Conway boy?\u201d \u201cI am,\u201d he said, as if startled. Then, slowly... \u201cPerhaps you too--\u201d"}, {"size": 654, "text": "It was so; but being a couple of years older I had left before he joined. After a quick interchange of dates a silence fell; and I thought suddenly of my absurd mate with his terrific whiskers and the \u201cBless my soul--you don\u2019t say so\u201d type of intellect. My double gave me an inkling of his thoughts by saying: \u201cMy father\u2019s a parson in Norfolk. Do you see me before a judge and jury on that charge? For myself I can\u2019t see the necessity. There are fellows that an angel from heaven--And I am not that. He was one of those creatures that are just simmering all the time with a silly sort of wickedness. Miserable devils that have no business to live at all."}, {"size": 635, "text": "He wouldn\u2019t do his duty and wouldn\u2019t let anybody else do theirs. But what\u2019s the good of talking! You know well enough the sort of ill-conditioned snarling cur--\u201d He appealed to me as if our experiences had been as identical as our clothes. And I knew well enough the pestiferous danger of such a character where there are no means of legal repression. And I knew well enough also that my double there was no homicidal ruffian. I did not think of asking him for details, and he told me the story roughly in brusque, disconnected sentences. I needed no more. I saw it all going on as though I were myself inside that other sleeping suit."}, {"size": 631, "text": "\u201cIt happened while we were setting a reefed foresail, at dusk. Reefed foresail! You understand the sort of weather. The only sail we had left to keep the ship running; so you may guess what it had been like for days. Anxious sort of job, that. He gave me some of his cursed insolence at the sheet. I tell you I was overdone with this terrific weather that seemed to have no end to it. Terrific, I tell you--and a deep ship. I believe the fellow himself was half crazed with funk. It was no time for gentlemanly reproof, so I turned round and felled him like an ox. He up and at me. We closed just as an awful sea made for the ship."}, {"size": 611, "text": "All hands saw it coming and took to the rigging, but I had him by the throat, and went on shaking him like a rat, the men above us yelling, \u2018Look out! look out!\u2019 Then a crash as if the sky had fallen on my head. They say that for over ten minutes hardly anything was to be seen of the ship--just the three masts and a bit of the forecastle head and of the poop all awash driving along in a smother of foam. It was a miracle that they found us, jammed together behind the forebitts. It\u2019s clear that I meant business, because I was holding him by the throat still when they picked us up. He was black in the face."}, {"size": 633, "text": "It was too much for them. It seems they rushed us aft together, gripped as we were, screaming \u2018Murder!\u2019 like a lot of lunatics, and broke into the cuddy. And the ship running for her life, touch and go all the time, any minute her last in a sea fit to turn your hair gray only a-looking at it. I understand that the skipper, too, started raving like the rest of them. The man had been deprived of sleep for more than a week, and to have this sprung on him at the height of a furious gale nearly drove him out of his mind. I wonder they didn\u2019t fling me overboard after getting the carcass of their precious shipmate out of my fingers."}, {"size": 620, "text": "They had rather a job to separate us, I\u2019ve been told. A sufficiently fierce story to make an old judge and a respectable jury sit up a bit. The first thing I heard when I came to myself was the maddening howling of that endless gale, and on that the voice of the old man. He was hanging on to my bunk, staring into my face out of his sou\u2019wester. \u201c\u2018Mr. Leggatt, you have killed a man. You can act no longer as chief mate of this ship.\u2019\u201d His care to subdue his voice made it sound monotonous. He rested a hand on the end of the skylight to steady himself with, and all that time did not stir a limb, so far as I could see."}, {"size": 626, "text": "\u201cNice little tale for a quiet tea party,\u201d he concluded in the same tone. One of my hands, too, rested on the end of the skylight; neither did I stir a limb, so far as I knew. We stood less than a foot from each other. It occurred to me that if old \u201cBless my soul--you don\u2019t say so\u201d were to put his head up the companion and catch sight of us, he would think he was seeing double, or imagine himself come upon a scene of weird witchcraft; the strange captain having a quiet confabulation by the wheel with his own gray ghost. I became very much concerned to prevent anything of the sort. I heard the other\u2019s soothing undertone."}, {"size": 668, "text": "\u201cMy father\u2019s a parson in Norfolk,\u201d it said. Evidently he had forgotten he had told me this important fact before. Truly a nice little tale. \u201cYou had better slip down into my stateroom now,\u201d I said, moving off stealthily. My double followed my movements; our bare feet made no sound; I let him in, closed the door with care, and, after giving a call to the second mate, returned on deck for my relief. \u201cNot much sign of any wind yet,\u201d I remarked when he approached. \u201cNo, sir. Not much,\u201d he assented, sleepily, in his hoarse voice, with just enough deference, no more, and barely suppressing a yawn. \u201cWell, that\u2019s all you have to look out for.

The cuddy lamp was burning over the table on which stood a vase with flowers, a polite attention from the ship\u2019s provision merchant--the last flowers we should see for the next three months at the very least. Two bunches of bananas hung from the beam symmetrically, one on each side of the rudder casing. Everything was as before in the ship--except that two of her captain\u2019s sleeping suits were simultaneously in use, one motionless in the cuddy, the other keeping very still in the captain\u2019s stateroom."}, {"size": 662, "text": "It must be explained here that my cabin had the form of the capital letter L, the door being within the angle and opening into the short part of the letter.

But anyone opening it, unless he stepped right inside, had no view of what I call the long (or vertical) part of the letter. It contained some lockers surmounted by a bookcase; and a few clothes, a thick jacket or two, caps, oilskin coat, and such like, hung on hooks. There was at the bottom of that part a door opening into my bathroom, which could be entered also directly from the saloon."}, {"size": 670, "text": "But that way was never used.

I, too, spoke under my breath. \u201cNobody is likely to come in here without knocking and getting permission.\u201d He nodded. His face was thin and the sunburn faded, as though he had been ill. And no wonder. He had been, I heard presently, kept under arrest in his cabin for nearly seven weeks."}, {"size": 607, "text": "But there was nothing sickly in his eyes or in his expression.

When I had him in my cabin--he stood by the door looking at me as if I had the halter round my neck already--I asked him right away to leave my cabin door unlocked at night while the ship was going through Sunda Straits.

I wonder what he thought had come to me before he understood and suddenly desisted."}, {"size": 280, "text": "Our hands met gropingly, lingered united in a steady, motionless clasp for a second. ... No word was breathed by either of us when they separated. I was standing quietly by the pantry door when the steward returned. \u201cSorry, sir. Kettle barely warm. Shall I light the spirit lamp?\u201d"}, {"size": 707, "text": "I came out on deck slowly. It was now a matter of conscience to shave the land as close as possible--for now he must go overboard whenever the ship was put in stays. Must! There could be no going back for him. After a moment I walked over to leeward and my heart flew into my mouth at the nearness of the land on the bow. Under any other circumstances I would not have held on a minute longer. The second mate had followed me anxiously. I looked on till I felt I could command my voice. \u201cShe will weather,\u201d I said then in a quiet tone. \u201cAre you going to try that, sir?\u201d he stammered out incredulously. I took no notice of him and raised my tone just enough to be heard by the helmsman. \u201cKeep her good full.\u201d"}, {"size": 644, "text": "The wind fanned my cheek, the sails slept, the world was silent. The strain of watching the dark loom of the land grow bigger and denser was too much for me. I had shut my eyes--because the ship must go closer. She must! The stillness was intolerable. Were we standing still? When I opened my eyes the second view started my heart with a thump. The black southern hill of Koh-ring seemed to hang right over the ship like a towering fragment of everlasting night. On that enormous mass of blackness there was not a gleam to be seen, not a sound to be heard. It was gliding irresistibly towards us and yet seemed already within reach of the hand."}, {"size": 631, "text": "I saw the vague figures of the watch grouped in the waist, gazing in awed silence. \u201cAre you going on, sir?\u201d inquired an unsteady voice at my elbow. I ignored it. I had to go on. \u201cKeep her full. Don\u2019t check her way. That won\u2019t do now,\u201d I said warningly. \u201cI can\u2019t see the sails very well,\u201d the helmsman answered me, in strange, quavering tones. Was she close enough? Already she was, I won\u2019t say in the shadow of the land, but in the very blackness of it, already swallowed up as it were, gone too close to be recalled, gone from me altogether. \u201cGive the mate a call,\u201d I said to the young man who stood at my elbow as still as death."}, {"size": 629, "text": "\u201cAnd turn all hands up.\u201d My tone had a borrowed loudness reverberated from the height of the land. Several voices cried out together: \u201cWe are all on deck, sir.\u201d Then stillness again, with the great shadow gliding closer, towering higher, without a light, without a sound. Such a hush had fallen on the ship that she might have been a bark of the dead floating in slowly under the very gate of Erebus. \u201cMy God! Where are we?\u201d It was the mate moaning at my elbow. He was thunderstruck, and as it were deprived of the moral support of his whiskers. He clapped his hands and absolutely cried out, \u201cLost!\u201d \u201cBe quiet,\u201d I said, sternly."}, {"size": 652, "text": "He lowered his tone, but I saw the shadowy gesture of his despair. \u201cWhat are we doing here?\u201d \u201cLooking for the land wind.\u201d He made as if to tear his hair, and addressed me recklessly. \u201cShe will never get out. You have done it, sir. I knew it\u2019d end in something like this. She will never weather, and you are too close now to stay. She\u2019ll drift ashore before she\u2019s round. Oh my God!\u201d I caught his arm as he was raising it to batter his poor devoted head, and shook it violently. \u201cShe\u2019s ashore already,\u201d he wailed, trying to tear himself away. \u201cIs she?... Keep good full there!\u201d \u201cGood full, sir,\u201d cried the helmsman in a frightened, thin, childlike voice."}, {"size": 718, "text": "I hadn\u2019t let go the mate\u2019s arm and went on shaking it. \u201cReady about, do you hear? You go forward\u201d--shake--\u201cand stop there\u201d--shake--\u201cand hold your noise\u201d--shake--\u201cand see these head-sheets properly overhauled\u201d--shake, shake--shake. And all the time I dared not look towards the land lest my heart should fail me. I released my grip at last and he ran forward as if fleeing for dear life. I wondered what my double there in the sail locker thought of this commotion. He was able to hear everything--and perhaps he was able to understand why, on my conscience, it had to be thus close--no less. My first order \u201cHard alee!\u201d re-echoed ominously under the towering shadow of Koh-ring as if I had shouted in a mountain gorge."}, {"size": 749, "text": "And then I watched the land intently. In that smooth water and light wind it was impossible to feel the ship coming-to. No! I could not feel her. And my second self was making now ready to ship out and lower himself overboard. Perhaps he was gone already...? The great black mass brooding over our very mastheads began to pivot away from the ship\u2019s side silently. And now I forgot the secret stranger ready to depart, and remembered only that I was a total stranger to the ship. I did not know her. Would she do it? How was she to be handled? I swung the mainyard and waited helplessly. She was perhaps stopped, and her very fate hung in the balance, with the black mass of Koh-ring like the gate of the everlasting night towering over her taffrail."}, {"size": 617, "text": "What would she do now? Had she way on her yet? I stepped to the side swiftly, and on the shadowy water I could see nothing except a faint phosphorescent flash revealing the glassy smoothness of the sleeping surface. It was impossible to tell--and I had not learned yet the feel of my ship. Was she moving? What I needed was something easily seen, a piece of paper, which I could throw overboard and watch. I had nothing on me. To run down for it I didn\u2019t dare. There was no time. All at once my strained, yearning stare distinguished a white object floating within a yard of the ship\u2019s side. White on the black water."}, {"size": 607, "text": "A phosphorescent flash passed under it. What was that thing?... I recognized my own floppy hat. It must have fallen off his head... and he didn\u2019t bother. Now I had what I wanted--the saving mark for my eyes. But I hardly thought of my other self, now gone from the ship, to be hidden forever from all friendly faces, to be a fugitive and a vagabond on the earth, with no brand of the curse on his sane forehead to stay a slaying hand... too proud to explain. And I watched the hat--the expression of my sudden pity for his mere flesh. It had been meant to save his homeless head from the dangers of the sun."}, {"size": 711, "text": "And now--behold--it was saving the ship, by serving me for a mark to help out the ignorance of my strangeness. Ha! It was drifting forward, warning me just in time that the ship had gathered sternaway. \u201cShift the helm,\u201d I said in a low voice to the seaman standing still like a statue. The man\u2019s eyes glistened wildly in the binnacle light as he jumped round to the other side and spun round the wheel. I walked to the break of the poop. On the over-shadowed deck all hands stood by the forebraces waiting for my order. The stars ahead seemed to be gliding from right to left. And all was so still in the world that I heard the quiet remark, \u201cShe\u2019s round,\u201d passed in a tone of intense relief between two seamen."}, {"size": 839, "text": "The foreyards ran round with a great noise, amidst cheery cries. And now the frightful whiskers made themselves heard giving various orders. Already the ship was drawing ahead. And I was alone with her. Nothing! no one in the world should stand now between us, throwing a shadow on the way of silent knowledge and mute affection, the perfect communion of a seaman with his first command. Walking to the taffrail, I was in time to make out, on the very edge of a darkness thrown by a towering black mass like the very gateway of Erebus--yes, I was in time to catch an evanescent glimpse of my white hat left behind to mark the spot where the secret sharer of my cabin and of my thoughts, as though he were my second self, had lowered himself into the water to take his punishment: a free man, a proud swimmer striking out for a new destiny."}]}
