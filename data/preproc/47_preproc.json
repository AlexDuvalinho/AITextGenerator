Miss Lavendar was to be married in it. Two weeks later Anne and Gilbert would leave for Redmond College. In a week\u2019s time Mrs. Rachel Lynde would move to Green Gables and set up her lares and penates in the erstwhile spare room, which was already prepared for her coming. She had sold all her superfluous household plenishings by auction and was at present reveling in the congenial occupation of helping the Allans pack up. Mr. Allan was to preach his farewell sermon the next Sunday. The old order was changing rapidly to give place to the new, as Anne felt with a little sadness threading all her excitement and happiness."}, {"size": 732, "text": "\u201cChanges ain\u2019t totally pleasant but they\u2019re excellent things,\u201d said Mr. Harrison philosophically. \u201cTwo years is about long enough for things to stay exactly the same. If they stayed put any longer they might grow mossy.\u201d Mr. Harrison was smoking on his veranda. His wife had self-sacrificingly told that he might smoke in the house if he took care to sit by an open window. Mr. Harrison rewarded this concession by going outdoors altogether to smoke in fine weather, and so mutual goodwill reigned. Anne had come over to ask Mrs. Harrison for some of her yellow dahlias.
