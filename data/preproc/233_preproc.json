THE MAGNET ATTRACTING: A WAIF AMID FORCESWhen Caroline Meeber boarded the afternoon train for Chicago, her total outfit consisted of a small trunk, a cheap imitation alligator-skin satchel, a small lunch in a paper box, and a yellow leather snap purse, containing her ticket, a scrap of paper with her sister\u2019s address in Van Buren Street, and four dollars in money. It was in August, 1889. She was eighteen years of age, bright, timid, and full of the illusions of ignorance and youth. Whatever touch of regret at parting characterised her thoughts, it was certainly not for advantages now being given up."}, {"size": 838, "text": "A gush of tears at her mother\u2019s farewell kiss, a touch in her throat when the cars clacked by the flour mill where her father worked by the day, a pathetic sigh as the familiar green environs of the village passed in review, and the threads which bound her so lightly to girlhood and home were irretrievably broken. To be sure there was always the next station, where one might descend and return. There was the great city, bound more closely by these very trains which came up daily. Columbia City was not so very far away, even once she was in Chicago. What, pray, is a few hours\u2014a few hundred miles? She looked at the little slip bearing her sister\u2019s address and wondered. She gazed at the green landscape, now passing in swift review, until her swifter thoughts replaced its impression with vague conjectures of what Chicago might be."}, {"size": 695, "text": "When a girl leaves her home at eighteen, she does one of two things. Either she falls into saving hands and becomes better, or she rapidly assumes the cosmopolitan standard of virtue and becomes worse. Of an intermediate balance, under the circumstances, there is no possibility. The city has its cunning wiles, no less than the infinitely smaller and more human tempter. There are large forces which allure with all the soulfulness of expression possible in the most cultured human. The gleam of a thousand lights is often as effective as the persuasive light in a wooing and fascinating eye. Half the undoing of the unsophisticated and natural mind is accomplished by forces wholly superhuman."}, {"size": 648, "text": "A blare of sound, a roar of life, a vast array of human hives, appeal to the astonished senses in equivocal terms. Without a counsellor at hand to whisper cautious interpretations, what falsehoods may not these things breathe into the unguarded ear! Unrecognised for what they are, their beauty, like music, too often relaxes, then weakens, then perverts the simpler human perceptions. Caroline, or Sister Carrie, as she had been half affectionately termed by the family, was possessed of a mind rudimentary in its power of observation and analysis. Self-interest with her was high, but not strong. It was, nevertheless, her guiding characteristic."}, {"size": 643, "text": "Warm with the fancies of youth, pretty with the insipid prettiness of the formative period, possessed of a figure promising eventual shapeliness and an eye alight with certain native intelligence, she was a fair example of the middle American class\u2014two generations removed from the emigrant. Books were beyond her interest\u2014knowledge a sealed book. In the intuitive graces she was still crude. She could scarcely toss her head gracefully. Her hands were almost ineffectual. The feet, though small, were set flatly. And yet she was interested in her charms, quick to understand the keener pleasures of life, ambitious to gain in material things."}, {"size": 839, "text": "A half-equipped little knight she was, venturing to reconnoitre the mysterious city and dreaming wild dreams of some vague, far-off supremacy, which should make it prey and subject\u2014the proper penitent, grovelling at a woman\u2019s slipper. \u201cThat,\u201d said a voice in her ear, \u201cis one of the prettiest little resorts in Wisconsin.\u201d \u201cIs it?\u201d she answered nervously. The train was just pulling out of Waukesha. For some time she had been conscious of a man behind. She felt him observing her mass of hair. He had been fidgetting, and with natural intuition she felt a certain interest growing in that quarter. Her maidenly reserve, and a certain sense of what was conventional under the circumstances, called her to forestall and deny this familiarity, but the daring and magnetism of the individual, born of past experiences and triumphs, prevailed."}, {"size": 822, "text": "She answered. He leaned forward to put his elbows upon the back of her seat and proceeded to make himself volubly agreeable. \u201cYes, that is a great resort for Chicago people. The hotels are swell. You are not familiar with this part of the country, are you?\u201d \u201cOh, yes, I am,\u201d answered Carrie. \u201cThat is, I live at Columbia City. I have never been through here, though.\u201d \u201cAnd so this is your first visit to Chicago,\u201d he observed. All the time she was conscious of certain features out of the side of her eye. Flush, colourful cheeks, a light moustache, a grey fedora hat. She now turned and looked upon him in full, the instincts of self-protection and coquetry mingling confusedly in her brain. \u201cI didn\u2019t say that,\u201d she said. \u201cOh,\u201d he answered, in a very pleasing way and with an assumed air of mistake, \u201cI thought you did.\u201d"}, {"size": 623, "text": "Here was a type of the travelling canvasser for a manufacturing house\u2014a class which at that time was first being dubbed by the slang of the day \u201cdrummers.\u201d He came within the meaning of a still newer term, which had sprung into general use among Americans in 1880, and which concisely expressed the thought of one whose dress or manners are calculated to elicit the admiration of susceptible young women\u2014a \u201cmasher.\u201d His suit was of a striped and crossed pattern of brown wool, new at that time, but since become familiar as a business suit. The low crotch of the vest revealed a stiff shirt bosom of white and pink stripes."}, {"size": 654, "text": "From his coat sleeves protruded a pair of linen cuffs of the same pattern, fastened with large, gold plate buttons, set with the common yellow agates known as \u201ccat\u2019s-eyes.\u201d His fingers bore several rings\u2014one, the ever-enduring heavy seal\u2014and from his vest dangled a neat gold watch chain, from which was suspended the secret insignia of the Order of Elks. The whole suit was rather tight-fitting, and was finished off with heavy-soled tan shoes, highly polished, and the grey fedora hat. He was, for the order of intellect represented, attractive, and whatever he had to recommend him, you may be sure was not lost upon Carrie, in this, her first glance."}, {"size": 606, "text": "Lest this order of individual should permanently pass, let me put down some of the most striking characteristics of his most successful manner and method. Good clothes, of course, were the first essential, the things without which he was nothing. A strong physical nature, actuated by a keen desire for the feminine, was the next. A mind free of any consideration of the problems or forces of the world and actuated not by greed, but an insatiable love of variable pleasure. His method was always simple. Its principal element was daring, backed, of course, by an intense desire and admiration for the sex."}, {"size": 778, "text": "Let him meet with a young woman once and he would approach her with an air of kindly familiarity, not unmixed with pleading, which would result in most cases in a tolerant acceptance. If she showed any tendency to coquetry he would be apt to straighten her tie, or if she \u201ctook up\u201d with him at all, to call her by her first name. If he visited a department store it was to lounge familiarly over the counter and ask some leading questions. In more exclusive circles, on the train or in waiting stations, he went slower. If some seemingly vulnerable object appeared he was all attention\u2014to pass the compliments of the day, to lead the way to the parlor car, carrying her grip, or, failing that, to take a seat next her with the hope of being able to court her to her destination."}, {"size": 634, "text": "Pillows, books, a footstool, the shade lowered; all these figured in the things which he could do. If, when she reached her destination he did not alight and attend her baggage for her, it was because, in his own estimation, he had signally failed. A woman should some day write the complete philosophy of clothes. No matter how young, it is one of the things she wholly comprehends. There is an indescribably faint line in the matter of man\u2019s apparel which somehow divides for her those who are worth glancing at and those who are not. Once an individual has passed this faint line on the way downward he will get no glance from her."}, {"size": 646, "text": "There is another line at which the dress of a man will cause her to study her own. This line the individual at her elbow now marked for Carrie. She became conscious of an inequality. Her own plain blue dress, with its black cotton tape trimmings, now seemed to her shabby. She felt the worn state of her shoes. \u201cLet\u2019s see,\u201d he went on, \u201cI know quite a number of people in your town. Morgenroth the clothier and Gibson the dry goods man.\u201d \u201cOh, do you?\u201d she interrupted, aroused by memories of longings their show windows had cost her. At last he had a clew to her interest, and followed it deftly. In a few minutes he had come about into her seat."}, {"size": 694, "text": "He talked of sales of clothing, his travels, Chicago, and the amusements of that city. \u201cIf you are going there, you will enjoy it immensely. Have you relatives?\u201d \u201cI am going to visit my sister,\u201d she explained. \u201cYou want to see Lincoln Park,\u201d he said, \u201cand Michigan Boulevard. They are putting up great buildings there. It\u2019s a second New York\u2014great. So much to see\u2014theatres, crowds, fine houses\u2014oh, you\u2019ll like that.\u201d There was a little ache in her fancy of all he described. Her insignificance in the presence of so much magnificence faintly affected her. She realised that hers was not to be a round of pleasure, and yet there was something promising in all the material prospect he set forth."}, {"size": 607, "text": "There was something satisfactory in the attention of this individual with his good clothes. She could not help smiling as he told her of some popular actress of whom she reminded him. She was not silly, and yet attention of this sort had its weight. \u201cYou will be in Chicago some little time, won\u2019t you?\u201d he observed at one turn of the now easy conversation. \u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d said Carrie vaguely\u2014a flash vision of the possibility of her not securing employment rising in her mind. \u201cSeveral weeks, anyhow,\u201d he said, looking steadily into her eyes. There was much more passing now than the mere words indicated."}, {"size": 623, "text": "He recognised the indescribable thing that made up for fascination and beauty in her. She realised that she was of interest to him from the one standpoint which a woman both delights in and fears. Her manner was simple, though for the very reason that she had not yet learned the many little affectations with which women conceal their true feelings. Some things she did appeared bold. A clever companion\u2014had she ever had one\u2014would have warned her never to look a man in the eyes so steadily. \u201cWhy do you ask?\u201d she said. \u201cWell, I\u2019m going to be there several weeks. I\u2019m going to study stock at our place and get new samples."}, {"size": 677, "text": "I might show you \u2019round.\u201d \u201cI don\u2019t know whether you can or not. I mean I don\u2019t know whether I can. I shall be living with my sister, and\u2014\u2014\u201d \u201cWell, if she minds, we\u2019ll fix that.\u201d He took out his pencil and a little pocket note-book as if it were all settled. \u201cWhat is your address there?\u201d She fumbled her purse which contained the address slip. He reached down in his hip pocket and took out a fat purse. It was filled with slips of paper, some mileage books, a roll of greenbacks. It impressed her deeply. Such a purse had never been carried by any one attentive to her. Indeed, an experienced traveller, a brisk man of the world, had never come within such close range before."}, {"size": 724, "text": "The purse, the shiny tan shoes, the smart new suit, and the air with which he did things, built up for her a dim world of fortune, of which he was the centre. It disposed her pleasantly toward all he might do. He took out a neat business card, on which was engraved Bartlett, Caryoe & Company, and down in the left-hand corner, Chas. H. Drouet. \u201cThat\u2019s me,\u201d he said, putting the card in her hand and touching his name. \u201cIt\u2019s pronounced Drew-eh. Our family was French, on my father\u2019s side.\u201d She looked at it while he put up his purse. Then he got out a letter from a bunch in his coat pocket. \u201cThis is the house I travel for,\u201d he went on, pointing to a picture on it, \u201ccorner of State and Lake.\u201d There was pride in his voice."}, {"size": 603, "text": "He felt that it was something to be connected with such a place, and he made her feel that way. \u201cWhat is your address?\u201d he began again, fixing his pencil to write. She looked at his hand. \u201cCarrie Meeber,\u201d she said slowly. \u201cThree hundred and fifty-four West Van Buren Street, care S. C. Hanson.\u201d He wrote it carefully down and got out the purse again. \u201cYou\u2019ll be at home if I come around Monday night?\u201d he said. \u201cI think so,\u201d she answered. How true it is that words are but the vague shadows of the volumes we mean. Little audible links, they are, chaining together great inaudible feelings and purposes."}, {"size": 603, "text": "Here were these two, bandying little phrases, drawing purses, looking at cards, and both unconscious of how inarticulate all their real feelings were. Neither was wise enough to be sure of the working of the mind of the other. He could not tell how his luring succeeded. She could not realise that she was drifting, until he secured her address. Now she felt that she had yielded something\u2014he, that he had gained a victory. Already they felt that they were somehow associated. Already he took control in directing the conversation. His words were easy. Her manner was relaxed. They were nearing Chicago."}, {"size": 724, "text": "Signs were everywhere numerous. Trains flashed by them. Across wide stretches of flat, open prairie they could see lines of telegraph poles stalking across the fields toward the great city. Far away were indications of suburban towns, some big smokestacks towering high in the air. Frequently there were two-story frame houses standing out in the open fields, without fence or trees, lone outposts of the approaching army of homes. To the child, the genius with imagination, or the wholly untravelled, the approach to a great city for the first time is a wonderful thing. Particularly if it be evening\u2014that mystic period between the glare and gloom of the world when life is changing from one sphere or condition to another."}, {"size": 622, "text": "Ah, the promise of the night. What does it not hold for the weary! What old illusion of hope is not here forever repeated! Says the soul of the toiler to itself, \u201cI shall soon be free. I shall be in the ways and the hosts of the merry. The streets, the lamps, the lighted chamber set for dining, are for me. The theatre, the halls, the parties, the ways of rest and the paths of song\u2014these are mine in the night.\u201d Though all humanity be still enclosed in the shops, the thrill runs abroad. It is in the air. The dullest feel something which they may not always express or describe. It is the lifting of the burden of toil."}, {"size": 608, "text": "Sister Carrie gazed out of the window. Her companion, affected by her wonder, so contagious are all things, felt anew some interest in the city and pointed out its marvels. \u201cThis is Northwest Chicago,\u201d said Drouet. \u201cThis is the Chicago River,\u201d and he pointed to a little muddy creek, crowded with the huge masted wanderers from far-off waters nosing the black-posted banks. With a puff, a clang, and a clatter of rails it was gone. \u201cChicago is getting to be a great town,\u201d he went on. \u201cIt\u2019s a wonder. You\u2019ll find lots to see here.\u201d She did not hear this very well. Her heart was troubled by a kind of terror."}, {"size": 639, "text": "The fact that she was alone, away from home, rushing into a great sea of life and endeavour, began to tell. She could not help but feel a little choked for breath\u2014a little sick as her heart beat so fast. She half closed her eyes and tried to think it was nothing, that Columbia City was only a little way off. \u201cChicago! Chicago!\u201d called the brakeman, slamming open the door. They were rushing into a more crowded yard, alive with the clatter and clang of life. She began to gather up her poor little grip and closed her hand firmly upon her purse. Drouet arose, kicked his legs to straighten his trousers, and seized his clean yellow grip."}, {"size": 628, "text": "\u201cI suppose your people will be here to meet you?\u201d he said. \u201cLet me carry your grip.\u201d \u201cOh, no,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019d rather you wouldn\u2019t. I\u2019d rather you wouldn\u2019t be with me when I meet my sister.\u201d \u201cAll right,\u201d he said in all kindness. \u201cI\u2019ll be near, though, in case she isn\u2019t here, and take you out there safely.\u201d \u201cYou\u2019re so kind,\u201d said Carrie, feeling the goodness of such attention in her strange situation. \u201cChicago!\u201d called the brakeman, drawing the word out long. They were under a great shadowy train shed, where the lamps were already beginning to shine out, with passenger cars all about and the train moving at a snail\u2019s pace."}, {"size": 660, "text": "The people in the car were all up and crowding about the door. \u201cWell, here we are,\u201d said Drouet, leading the way to the door. \u201cGood-bye, till I see you Monday.\u201d \u201cGood-bye,\u201d she answered, taking his proffered hand. \u201cRemember, I\u2019ll be looking till you find your sister.\u201d She smiled into his eyes. They filed out, and he affected to take no notice of her. A lean-faced, rather commonplace woman recognised Carrie on the platform and hurried forward. \u201cWhy, Sister Carrie!\u201d she began, and there was embrace of welcome. Carrie realised the change of affectional atmosphere at once. Amid all the maze, uproar, and novelty she felt cold reality taking her by the hand."}, {"size": 669, "text": "No world of light and merriment. No round of amusement. Her sister carried with her most of the grimness of shift and toil. \u201cWhy, how are all the folks at home?\u201d she began; \u201chow is father, and mother?\u201d Carrie answered, but was looking away. Down the aisle, toward the gate leading into the waiting-room and the street, stood Drouet. He was looking back. When he saw that she saw him and was safe with her sister he turned to go, sending back the shadow of a smile. Only Carrie saw it. She felt something lost to her when he moved away. When he disappeared she felt his absence thoroughly. With her sister she was much alone, a lone figure in a tossing, thoughtless sea."}, {"size": 623, "text": "Chapter II. WHAT POVERTY THREATENED: OF GRANITE AND BRASSMinnie\u2019s flat, as the one-floor resident apartments were then being called, was in a part of West Van Buren Street inhabited by families of labourers and clerks, men who had come, and were still coming, with the rush of population pouring in at the rate of 50,000 a year. It was on the third floor, the front windows looking down into the street, where, at night, the lights of grocery stores were shining and children were playing. To Carrie, the sound of the little bells upon the horse-cars, as they tinkled in and out of hearing, was as pleasing as it was novel."}, {"size": 651, "text": "She gazed into the lighted street when Minnie brought her into the front room, and wondered at the sounds, the movement, the murmur of the vast city which stretched for miles and miles in every direction. Mrs. Hanson, after the first greetings were over, gave Carrie the baby and proceeded to get supper. Her husband asked a few questions and sat down to read the evening paper. He was a silent man, American born, of a Swede father, and now employed as a cleaner of refrigerator cars at the stock-yards. To him the presence or absence of his wife\u2019s sister was a matter of indifference. Her personal appearance did not affect him one way or the other."}, {"size": 618, "text": "His one observation to the point was concerning the chances of work in Chicago. \u201cIt\u2019s a big place,\u201d he said. \u201cYou can get in somewhere in a few days. Everybody does.\u201d It had been tacitly understood beforehand that she was to get work and pay her board. He was of a clean, saving disposition, and had already paid a number of monthly instalments on two lots far out on the West Side. His ambition was some day to build a house on them. In the interval which marked the preparation of the meal Carrie found time to study the flat. She had some slight gift of observation and that sense, so rich in every woman\u2014intuition."}, {"size": 613, "text": "She felt the drag of a lean and narrow life. The walls of the rooms were discordantly papered. The floors were covered with matting and the hall laid with a thin rag carpet. One could see that the furniture was of that poor, hurriedly patched together quality sold by the instalment houses. She sat with Minnie, in the kitchen, holding the baby until it began to cry. Then she walked and sang to it, until Hanson, disturbed in his reading, came and took it. A pleasant side to his nature came out here. He was patient. One could see that he was very much wrapped up in his offspring. \u201cNow, now,\u201d he said, walking."}, {"size": 697, "text": "\u201cThere, there,\u201d and there was a certain Swedish accent noticeable in his voice. \u201cYou\u2019ll want to see the city first, won\u2019t you?\u201d said Minnie, when they were eating. \u201cWell, we\u2019ll go out Sunday and see Lincoln Park.\u201d Carrie noticed that Hanson had said nothing to this. He seemed to be thinking of something else. \u201cWell,\u201d she said, \u201cI think I\u2019ll look around to-morrow. I\u2019ve got Friday and Saturday, and it won\u2019t be any trouble. Which way is the business part?\u201d Minnie began to explain, but her husband took this part of the conversation to himself. \u201cIt\u2019s that way,\u201d he said, pointing east. \u201cThat\u2019s east.\u201d Then he went off into the longest speech he had yet indulged in, concerning the lay of Chicago."}, {"size": 749, "text": "\u201cYou\u2019d better look in those big manufacturing houses along Franklin Street and just the other side of the river,\u201d he concluded. \u201cLots of girls work there. You could get home easy, too. It isn\u2019t very far.\u201d Carrie nodded and asked her sister about the neighbourhood. The latter talked in a subdued tone, telling the little she knew about it, while Hanson concerned himself with the baby. Finally he jumped up and handed the child to his wife. \u201cI\u2019ve got to get up early in the morning, so I\u2019ll go to bed,\u201d and off he went, disappearing into the dark little bedroom off the hall, for the night. \u201cHe works way down at the stock-yards,\u201d explained Minnie, \u201cso he\u2019s got to get up at half-past five.\u201d \u201cWhat time do you get up to get breakfast?\u201d asked Carrie."}, {"size": 700, "text": "\u201cAt about twenty minutes of five.\u201d Together they finished the labour of the day, Carrie washing the dishes while Minnie undressed the baby and put it to bed. Minnie\u2019s manner was one of trained industry, and Carrie could see that it was a steady round of toil with her. She began to see that her relations with Drouet would have to be abandoned. He could not come here. She read from the manner of Hanson, in the subdued air of Minnie, and, indeed, the whole atmosphere of the flat, a settled opposition to anything save a conservative round of toil. If Hanson sat every evening in the front room and read his paper, if he went to bed at nine, and Minnie a little later, what would they expect of her?"}, {"size": 687, "text": "She saw that she would first need to get work and establish herself on a paying basis before she could think of having company of any sort. Her little flirtation with Drouet seemed now an extraordinary thing. \u201cNo,\u201d she said to herself, \u201che can\u2019t come here.\u201d She asked Minnie for ink and paper, which were upon the mantel in the dining-room, and when the latter had gone to bed at ten, got out Drouet\u2019s card and wrote him. \u201cI cannot have you call on me here.

Her sister was busy in the dining-room, which was also the sitting-room, sewing.

She was now a thin, though rugged, woman of twenty-seven, with ideas of life coloured by her husband\u2019s, and fast hardening into narrower conceptions of pleasure and duty than had ever been hers in a thoroughly circumscribed youth.

In 1889 Chicago had the peculiar qualifications of growth which made such adventuresome pilgrimages even on the part of young girls plausible. Its many and growing commercial opportunities gave it widespread fame, which made of it a giant magnet, drawing to itself, from all quarters, the hopeful and the hopeless\u2014those who had their fortune yet to make and those whose fortunes and affairs had reached a disastrous climax elsewhere. It was a city of over 500,000, with the ambition, the daring, the activity of a metropolis of a million."}, {"size": 603, "text": "Its streets and houses were already scattered over an area of seventy-five square miles. Its population was not so much thriving upon established commerce as upon the industries which prepared for the arrival of others. The sound of the hammer engaged upon the erection of new structures was everywhere heard. Great industries were moving in. The huge railroad corporations which had long before recognised the prospects of the place had seized upon vast tracts of land for transfer and shipping purposes. Street-car lines had been extended far out into the open country in anticipation of rapid growth."}, {"size": 739, "text": "The city had laid miles and miles of streets and sewers through regions where, perhaps, one solitary house stood out alone\u2014a pioneer of the populous ways to be. There were regions open to the sweeping winds and rain, which were yet lighted throughout the night with long, blinking lines of gas-lamps, fluttering in the wind. Narrow board walks extended out, passing here a house, and there a store, at far intervals, eventually ending on the open prairie. In the central portion was the vast wholesale and shopping district, to which the uninformed seeker for work usually drifted. It was a characteristic of Chicago then, and one not generally shared by other cities, that individual firms of any pretension occupied individual buildings."}, {"size": 896, "text": "The presence of ample ground made this possible. It gave an imposing appearance to most of the wholesale houses, whose offices were upon the ground floor and in plain view of the street. The large plates of window glass, now so common, were then rapidly coming into use, and gave to the ground floor offices a distinguished and prosperous look. The casual wanderer could see as he passed a polished array of office fixtures, much frosted glass, clerks hard at work, and genteel businessmen in \u201cnobby\u201d suits and clean linen lounging about or sitting in groups. Polished brass or nickel signs at the square stone entrances announced the firm and the nature of the business in rather neat and reserved terms. The entire metropolitan centre possessed a high and mighty air calculated to overawe and abash the common applicant, and to make the gulf between poverty and success seem both wide and deep."}, {"size": 752, "text": "Into this important commercial region the timid Carrie went.

The great streets were wall-lined mysteries to her; the vast offices, strange mazes which concerned far-off individuals of importance."}, {"size": 463, "text": "She could only think of people connected with them as counting money, dressing magnificently, and riding in carriages. What they dealt in, how they laboured, to what end it all came, she had only the vaguest conception.

She had never done this thing before, and lacked courage. To avoid a certain indefinable shame she felt at being caught spying about for a position, she quickened her steps and assumed an air of indifference supposedly common to one upon an errand. In this way she passed many manufacturing and wholesale houses without once glancing in."}, {"size": 739, "text": "At last, after several blocks of walking, she felt that this would not do, and began to look about again, though without relaxing her pace.

When she came within a score of feet of the desired goal, she saw through the window a young man in a grey checked suit.

She crossed over and walked directly toward the entrance. As she did so, two men came out and paused in the door. A telegraph messenger in blue dashed past her and up the few steps that led to the entrance and disappeared.

It was too difficult a task. She could not go past them."}, {"size": 685, "text": "So severe a defeat told sadly upon her nerves. Her feet carried her mechanically forward, every foot of her progress being a satisfactory portion of a flight which she gladly made. Block after block passed by. Upon streetlamps at the various corners she read names such as Madison, Monroe, La Salle, Clark, Dearborn, State, and still she went, her feet beginning to tire upon the broad stone flagging. She was pleased in part that the streets were bright and clean. The morning sun, shining down with steadily increasing warmth, made the shady side of the streets pleasantly cool. She looked at the blue sky overhead with more realisation of its charm than had ever come to her before."}, {"size": 738, "text": "Her cowardice began to trouble her in a way.

On the way, she encountered a great wholesale shoe company, through the broad plate windows of which she saw an enclosed executive department, hidden by frosted glass. Without this enclosure, but just within the street entrance, sat a grey-haired gentleman at a small table, with a large open ledger before him. She walked by this institution several times hesitating, but, finding herself unobserved, faltered past the screen door and stood humbly waiting. \u201cWell, young lady,\u201d observed the old gentleman, looking at her somewhat kindly, \u201cwhat is it you wish?\u201d \u201cI am, that is, do you\u2014I mean, do you need any help?\u201d she stammered."}, {"size": 647, "text": "\u201cNot just at present,\u201d he answered smiling. \u201cNot just at present.

The greeting drove all courage from her at once. \u201cDo you need any help?\u201d she stammered. \u201cNo,\u201d he replied abruptly, and turned upon his heel. She went foolishly out, the office boy deferentially swinging the door for her, and gladly sank into the obscuring crowd. It was a severe setback to her recently pleased mental state.

At that time the department store was in its earliest form of successful operation, and there were not many. The first three in the United States, established about 1884, were in Chicago.

At last she inquired of a police officer, and was directed to proceed \u201ctwo blocks up,\u201d where she would find \u201cThe Fair.\u201d The nature of these vast retail combinations, should they ever permanently disappear, will form an interesting chapter in the commercial history of our nation."}, {"size": 678, "text": "Such a flowering out of a modest trade principle the world had never witnessed up to that time.

Carrie passed along the busy aisles, much affected by the remarkable displays of trinkets, dress goods, stationery, and jewelry. Each separate counter was a show place of dazzling interest and attraction. She could not help feeling the claim of each trinket and valuable upon her personally, and yet she did not stop."}, {"size": 737, "text": "There was nothing there which she could not have used\u2014nothing which she did not long to own. The dainty slippers and stockings, the delicately frilled skirts and petticoats, the laces, ribbons, hair-combs, purses, all touched her with individual desire, and she felt keenly the fact that not any of these things were in the range of her purchase. She was a work-seeker, an outcast without employment, one whom the average employee could tell at a glance was poor and in need of a situation. It must not be thought that any one could have mistaken her for a nervous, sensitive, high-strung nature, cast unduly upon a cold, calculating, and unpoetic world. Such certainly she was not.

Carrie was not familiar with the appearance of her more fortunate sisters of the city. Neither had she before known the nature and appearance of the shop girls with whom she now compared poorly.

A flame of envy lighted in her heart. She realised in a dim way how much the city held\u2014wealth, fashion, ease\u2014every adornment for women, and she longed for dress and beauty with a whole heart. On the second floor were the managerial offices, to which, after some inquiry, she was now directed.

It was not so much the particular rebuff which she had just experienced, but the whole abashing trend of the day. She was tired and nervous. She abandoned the thought of appealing to the other department stores and now wandered on, feeling a certain safety and relief in mingling with the crowd. In her indifferent wandering she turned into Jackson Street, not far from the river, and was keeping her way along the south side of that imposing thoroughfare, when a piece of wrapping paper, written on with marking ink and tacked up on the door, attracted her attention.

The former were drabby-looking creatures, stained in face with oil and dust, clad in thin, shapeless, cotton dresses and shod with more or less worn shoes.

They were the serious reflections of a mind which invariably adjusted itself, without much complaining, to such surroundings as its industry could make for it.

The thoroughfare, in this part, was like a walled canon of brown stone and dark red brick. The big windows looked shiny and clean.

He seemed rather annoyed at having to bother with such help, but put down her name and then led her across to where a line of girls occupied stools in front of clacking machines.

The girls at her left and right realised her predicament and feelings, and, in a way, tried to aid her, as much as they dared, by working slower. At this task she laboured incessantly for some time, finding relief from her own nervous fears and imaginings in the humdrum, mechanical movement of the machine."}, {"size": 685, "text": "She felt, as the minutes passed, that the room was not very light. It had a thick odour of fresh leather, but that did not worry her. She felt the eyes of the other help upon her, and troubled lest she was not working fast enough.

As the morning wore on the room became hotter. She felt the need of a breath of fresh air and a drink of water, but did not venture to stir.

She twisted and turned from one position to another slightly different, but it did not ease her for long.

She could also note a thing or two out of the side of her eye. \u201cDid you see Harry last night?\u201d said the girl at her left, addressing her neighbour."}, {"size": 644, "text": "\u201cYou ought to have seen the tie he had on. Gee, but he was a mark.\u201d \u201cS-s-t,\u201d said the other girl, bending over her work. The first, silenced, instantly assumed a solemn face. The foreman passed slowly along, eyeing each worker distinctly. The moment he was gone, the conversation was resumed again. \u201cSay,\u201d began the girl at her left, \u201cwhat jeh think he said?\u201d \u201cHe said he saw us with Eddie Harris at Martin\u2019s last night.\u201d \u201cNo!\u201d They both giggled.

There was nothing of the gallant in him. Carrie at last could scarcely sit still. Her legs began to tire and she wanted to get up and stretch. Would noon never come? It seemed as if she had worked an entire day. She was not hungry at all, but weak, and her eyes were tired, straining at the one point where the eye-punch came down.

When she was wondering whether the strain would ever cease, a dull-sounding bell clanged somewhere down an elevator shaft, and the end came."}, {"size": 634, "text": "In an instant there was a buzz of action and conversation. All the girls instantly left their stools and hurried away in an adjoining room, men passed through, coming from some department which opened on the right.

Under better material conditions, this kind of work would not have been so bad, but the new socialism which involves pleasant working conditions for employees had not then taken hold upon manufacturing companies.

The washrooms were disagreeable, crude, if not foul places, and the whole atmosphere was sordid.

The floors were of brightly coloured tiles, the walls a composition of rich, dark, polished wood, which reflected the light, and coloured stucco-work, which gave the place a very sumptuous appearance.

It is so easy to do this when the thing opined is in the line of what we desire. In his hearty way, he insisted upon her good looks. He looked at her admiringly, and she took it at its full value. Under the circumstances, she did not need to carry herself as pretty women do. She picked that knowledge up fast enough for herself. Drouet had a habit, characteristic of his kind, of looking after stylishly dressed or pretty women on the street and remarking upon them.

A dainty, self-conscious swaying of the hips by a woman was to him as alluring as the glint of rare wine to a toper. He would turn and follow the disappearing vision with his eyes. He would thrill as a child with the unhindered passion that was in him. He loved the thing that women love in themselves, grace. At this, their own shrine, he knelt with them, an ardent devotee. \u201cDid you see that woman who went by just now?\u201d he said to Carrie on the first day they took a walk together."}, {"size": 646, "text": "\u201cFine stepper, wasn\u2019t she?\u201d Carrie looked, and observed the grace commended. \u201cYes, she is,\u201d she returned, cheerfully, a little suggestion of possible defect in herself awakening in her mind. If that was so fine, she must look at it more closely. Instinctively, she felt a desire to imitate it. Surely she could do that too. When one of her mind sees many things emphasized and re-emphasized and admired, she gathers the logic of it and applies accordingly. Drouet was not shrewd enough to see that this was not tactful. He could not see that it would be better to make her feel that she was competing with herself, not others better than herself."}, {"size": 603, "text": "He would not have done it with an older, wiser woman, but in Carrie he saw only the novice. Less clever than she, he was naturally unable to comprehend her sensibility. He went on educating and wounding her, a thing rather foolish in one whose admiration for his pupil and victim was apt to grow. Carrie took the instructions affably. She saw what Drouet liked; in a vague way she saw where he was weak. It lessens a woman\u2019s opinion of a man when she learns that his admiration is so pointedly and generously distributed. She sees but one object of supreme compliment in this world, and that is herself."}, {"size": 631, "text": "If a man is to succeed with many women, he must be all in all to each. In her own apartments Carrie saw things which were lessons in the same school. In the same house with her lived an official of one of the theatres, Mr. Frank A. Hale, manager of the Standard, and his wife, a pleasing-looking brunette of thirty-five. They were people of a sort very common in America to-day, who live respectably from hand to mouth. Hale received a salary of forty-five dollars a week. His wife, quite attractive, affected the feeling of youth, and objected to that sort of home life which means the care of a house and the raising of a family."}, {"size": 621, "text": "Like Drouet and Carrie, they also occupied three rooms on the floor above. Not long after she arrived Mrs. Hale established social relations with her, and together they went about. For a long time this was her only companionship, and the gossip of the manager\u2019s wife formed the medium through which she saw the world. Such trivialities, such praises of wealth, such conventional expression of morals as sifted through this passive creature\u2019s mind, fell upon Carrie and for the while confused her. On the other hand, her own feelings were a corrective influence. The constant drag to something better was not to be denied."}, {"size": 618, "text": "By those things which address the heart was she steadily recalled. In the apartments across the hall were a young girl and her mother. They were from Evansville, Indiana, the wife and daughter of a railroad treasurer. The daughter was here to study music, the mother to keep her company. Carrie did not make their acquaintance, but she saw the daughter coming in and going out. A few times she had seen her at the piano in the parlour, and not infrequently had heard her play. This young woman was particularly dressy for her station, and wore a jewelled ring or two which flashed upon her white fingers as she played."}, {"size": 658, "text": "Now Carrie was affected by music. Her nervous composition responded to certain strains, much as certain strings of a harp vibrate when a corresponding key of a piano is struck. She was delicately moulded in sentiment, and answered with vague ruminations to certain wistful chords. They awoke longings for those things which she did not have. They caused her to cling closer to things she possessed. One short song the young lady played in a most soulful and tender mood. Carrie heard it through the open door from the parlour below. It was at that hour between afternoon and night when, for the idle, the wanderer, things are apt to take on a wistful aspect."}, {"size": 632, "text": "The mind wanders forth on far journeys and returns with sheaves of withered and departed joys. Carrie sat at her window looking out. Drouet had been away since ten in the morning. She had amused herself with a walk, a book by Bertha M. Clay which Drouet had left there, though she did not wholly enjoy the latter, and by changing her dress for the evening. Now she sat looking out across the park as wistful and depressed as the nature which craves variety and life can be under such circumstances. As she contemplated her new state, the strain from the parlour below stole upward. With it her thoughts became coloured and enmeshed."}, {"size": 621, "text": "She reverted to the things which were best and saddest within the small limit of her experience. She became for the moment a repentant. While she was in this mood Drouet came in, bringing with him an entirely different atmosphere. It was dusk and Carrie had neglected to light the lamp. The fire in the grate, too, had burned low. \u201cWhere are you, Cad?\u201d he said, using a pet name he had given her. \u201cHere,\u201d she answered. There was something delicate and lonely in her voice, but he could not hear it. He had not the poetry in him that would seek a woman out under such circumstances and console her for the tragedy of life."}, {"size": 681, "text": "Instead, he struck a match and lighted the gas. \u201cHello,\u201d he exclaimed, \u201cyou\u2019ve been crying.\u201d Her eyes were still wet with a few vague tears. \u201cPshaw,\u201d he said, \u201cyou don\u2019t want to do that.\u201d He took her hand, feeling in his good-natured egotism that it was probably lack of his presence which had made her lonely. \u201cCome on, now,\u201d he went on; \u201cit\u2019s all right. Let\u2019s waltz a little to that music.\u201d He could not have introduced a more incongruous proposition. It made clear to Carrie that he could not sympathise with her. She could not have framed thoughts which would have expressed his defect or made clear the difference between them, but she felt it. It was his first great mistake."}, {"size": 627, "text": "What Drouet said about the girl\u2019s grace, as she tripped out evenings accompanied by her mother, caused Carrie to perceive the nature and value of those little modish ways which women adopt when they would presume to be something.

She caught up her skirts with an easy swing, for had not Drouet remarked that in her and several others, and Carrie was naturally imitative. She began to get the hang of those little things which the pretty woman who has vanity invariably adopts."}, {"size": 615, "text": "In short, her knowledge of grace doubled, and with it her appearance changed. She became a girl of considerable taste. Drouet noticed this. He saw the new bow in her hair and the new way of arranging her locks which she affected one morning. \u201cYou look fine that way, Cad,\u201d he said. \u201cDo I?\u201d she replied, sweetly. It made her try for other effects that selfsame day. She used her feet less heavily, a thing that was brought about by her attempting to imitate the treasurer\u2019s daughter\u2019s graceful carriage. How much influence the presence of that young woman in the same house had upon her it would be difficult to say."}, {"size": 675, "text": "But, because of all these things, when Hurstwood called he had found a young woman who was much more than the Carrie to whom Drouet had first spoken. The primary defects of dress and manner had passed. She was pretty, graceful, rich in the timidity born of uncertainty, and with a something childlike in her large eyes which captured the fancy of this starched and conventional poser among men. It was the ancient attraction of the fresh for the stale. If there was a touch of appreciation left in him for the bloom and unsophistication which is the charm of youth, it rekindled now. He looked into her pretty face and felt the subtle waves of young life radiating therefrom."}, {"size": 604, "text": "In that large clear eye he could see nothing that his _blas\u00e9_ nature could understand as guile.

The cab plopped along between the far-receding lines of gas lamps on either hand. He folded his gloved hands and saw only the lighted chamber and Carrie\u2019s face.

He did not know, he could not guess, what the result would be. A few weeks later Drouet, in his peregrinations, encountered one of his well-dressed lady acquaintances in Chicago on his return from a short trip to Omaha.

Drouet was just finishing a little incident he was relating, and his face was expanding into a smile, when Hurstwood\u2019s eye caught his own. The latter had come in with several friends, and, seeing Drouet and some woman, not Carrie, drew his own conclusion. \u201cAh, the rascal,\u201d he thought, and then, with a touch of righteous sympathy, \u201cthat\u2019s pretty hard on the little girl.\u201d Drouet jumped from one easy thought to another as he caught Hurstwood\u2019s eye."}, {"size": 773, "text": "He felt but very little misgiving, until he saw that Hurstwood was cautiously pretending not to see.

Such a chance half-hour with an old friend must not have anything more attached to it than it really warranted. For the first time he was troubled. Here was a moral complication of which he could not possibly get the ends. Hurstwood would laugh at him for being a fickle boy. He would laugh with Hurstwood. Carrie would never hear, his present companion at table would never know, and yet he could not help feeling that he was getting the worst of it\u2014there was some faint stigma attached, and he was not guilty."}, {"size": 847, "text": "He broke up the dinner by becoming dull, and saw his companion on her car.

He raised his forefinger indicatively, as parents do to children. \u201cAn old acquaintance of mine that I ran into just as I was coming up from the station,\u201d explained Drouet. \u201cShe used to be quite a beauty.\u201d \u201cStill attracts a little, eh?\u201d returned the other, affecting to jest. \u201cOh, no,\u201d said Drouet, \u201cjust couldn\u2019t escape her this time.\u201d \u201cHow long are you here?\u201d asked Hurstwood."}, {"size": 684, "text": "\u201cYou must bring the girl down and take dinner with me,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m afraid you keep her cooped up out there.

He gave Drouet no credit for any feelings toward Carrie whatever. He envied him, and now, as he looked at the well-dressed jolly salesman, whom he so much liked, the gleam of the rival glowed in his eye. He began to \u201csize up\u201d Drouet from the standpoints of wit and fascination. He began to look to see where he was weak.

She was relieved to see that he felt nothing. She did not credit her willingness to go to any fascination Hurstwood held for her.

If ever there was dressiness it was here. It was the personification of the old term spick and span. \u201cDid you ever see Jefferson?\u201d he questioned, as he leaned toward Carrie in the box. \u201cI never did,\u201d she returned. \u201cHe\u2019s delightful, delightful,\u201d he went on, giving the commonplace rendition of approval which such men know.

When the winter season had passed and the first fine days of the early spring appeared, Mrs. Hale secured a buggy for an afternoon and invited Carrie. They rode first through Lincoln Park and on far out towards Evanston, turning back at four and arriving at the north end of the Shore Drive at about five o\u2019clock."}, {"size": 676, "text": "At this time of year the days are still comparatively short, and the shadows of the evening were beginning to settle down upon the great city.

She was ripened by it in spirit for many suggestions. As they drove along the smooth pavement an occasional carriage passed. She saw one stop and the footman dismount, opening the door for a gentleman who seemed to be leisurely returning from some afternoon pleasure."}, {"size": 765, "text": "Across the broad lawns, now first freshening into green, she saw lamps faintly glowing upon rich interiors. Now it was but a chair, now a table, now an ornate corner, which met her eye, but it appealed to her as almost nothing else could. Such childish fancies as she had had of fairy palaces and kingly quarters now came back. She imagined that across these richly carved entrance-ways, where the globed and crystalled lamps shone upon panelled doors set with stained and designed panes of glass, was neither care nor unsatisfied desire. She was perfectly certain that here was happiness.

What, after all, was Drouet? What was she? At her window, she thought it over, rocking to and fro, and gazing out across the lamp-lit park toward the lamp-lit houses on Warren and Ashland avenues.

She was sad beyond measure, and yet uncertain, wishing, fancying. Finally, it seemed as if all her state was one of loneliness and forsakenness, and she could scarce refrain from trembling at the lip.

She had seen comparatively little of the manager during the winter, but had been kept constantly in mind of him by one thing and another, principally by the strong impression he had made.

It was surprising\u2014the ease with which he conducted a conversation. He was like every man who has had the advantage of practice and knows he has sympathy. He knew that Carrie listened to him pleasurably, and, without the least effort, he fell into a train of observation which absorbed her fancy. He drew up his chair and modulated his voice to such a degree that what he said seemed wholly confidential. He confined himself almost exclusively to his observation of men and pleasures."}, {"size": 853, "text": "He had been here and there, he had seen this and that. Somehow he made Carrie wish to see similar things, and all the while kept her aware of himself. She could not shut out the consciousness of his individuality and presence for a moment. He would raise his eyes slowly in smiling emphasis of something, and she was fixed by their magnetism. He would draw out, with the easiest grace, her approval. Once he touched her hand for emphasis and she only smiled. He seemed to radiate an atmosphere which suffused her being. He was never dull for a minute, and seemed to make her clever. At least, she brightened under his influence until all her best side was exhibited. She felt that she was more clever with him than with others. At least, he seemed to find so much in her to applaud. There was not the slightest touch of patronage. Drouet was full of it."}, {"size": 721, "text": "There had been something so personal, so subtle, in each meeting between them, both when Drouet was present and when he was absent, that Carrie could not speak of it without feeling a sense of difficulty.

Each time there had been no sentence of importance which she could relate, and as for the glances and sensations, what woman would reveal them? Such things had never been between her and Drouet. As a matter of fact, they could never be. She had been dominated by distress and the enthusiastic forces of relief which Drouet represented at an opportune moment when she yielded to him."}, {"size": 682, "text": "Now she was persuaded by secret current feelings which Drouet had never understood. Hurstwood\u2019s glance was as effective as the spoken words of a lover, and more. They called for no immediate decision, and could not be answered. People in general attach too much importance to words. They are under the illusion that talking effects great results. As a matter of fact, words are, as a rule, the shallowest portion of all the argument. They but dimly represent the great surging feelings and desires which lie behind.

She did not need to tremble at all, because it was invisible; she did not need to worry over what other people would say\u2014what she herself would say\u2014because it had no tangibility. She was being pleaded with, persuaded, led into denying old rights and assuming new ones, and yet there were no words to prove it.

HIS CREDENTIALS ACCEPTED: A BABEL OF TONGUES It was not quite two days after the scene between Carrie and Hurstwood in the Ogden Place parlour before he again put in his appearance. He had been thinking almost uninterruptedly of her. Her leniency had, in a way, inflamed his regard. He felt that he must succeed with her, and that speedily.The reason for his interest, not to say fascination, was deeper than mere desire. It was a flowering out of feelings which had been withering in dry and almost barren soil for many years. It is probable that Carrie represented a better order of woman than had ever attracted him before."}, {"size": 680, "text": "He had had no love affair since that which culminated in his marriage, and since then time and the world had taught him how raw and erroneous was his original judgment. Whenever he thought of it, he told himself that, if he had it to do over again, he would never marry such a woman. At the same time, his experience with women in general had lessened his respect for the sex. He maintained a cynical attitude, well grounded on numerous experiences. Such women as he had known were of nearly one type, selfish, ignorant, flashy. The wives of his friends were not inspiring to look upon. His own wife had developed a cold, commonplace nature which to him was anything but pleasing."}, {"size": 720, "text": "What he knew of that under-world where grovel the beat-men of society (and he knew a great deal) had hardened his nature.

At the same time, he was not so dull but that a good woman commanded his respect. Personally, he did not attempt to analyse the marvel of a saintly woman. He would take off his hat, and would silence the light-tongued and the vicious in her presence\u2014much as the Irish keeper of a Bowery hall will humble himself before a Sister of Mercy, and pay toll to charity with a willing and reverent hand. But he would not think much upon the question of why he did so."}, {"size": 816, "text": "A man in his situation who comes, after a long round of worthless or hardening experiences, upon a young, unsophisticated, innocent soul, is apt either to hold aloof, out of a sense of his own remoteness, or to draw near and become fascinated and elated by his discovery. It is only by a roundabout process that such men ever do draw near such a girl. They have no method, no understanding of how to ingratiate themselves in youthful favour, save when they find virtue in the toils. If, unfortunately, the fly has got caught in the net, the spider can come forth and talk business upon its own terms. So when maidenhood has wandered into the moil of the city, when it is brought within the circle of the \u201crounder\u201d and the rou\u00e9, even though it be at the outermost rim, they can come forth and use their alluring arts."}, {"size": 883, "text": "Hurstwood had gone, at Drouet\u2019s invitation, to meet a new baggage of fine clothes and pretty features.

In the mild light of Carrie\u2019s eye was nothing of the calculation of the mistress. In the diffident manner was nothing of the art of the courtesan. He saw at once that a mistake had been made, that some difficult conditions had pushed this troubled creature into his presence, and his interest was enlisted. Here sympathy sprang to the rescue, but it was not unmixed with selfishness. He wanted to win Carrie because he thought her fate mingled with his was better than if it were united with Drouet\u2019s.

She still looked about her upon the great maze of the city without understanding. Hurstwood felt the bloom and the youth. He picked her as he would the fresh fruit of a tree.

Such anxiety and enthusiasm had not affected him for years. He was a youth again in feeling\u2014a cavalier in action. In his position opportunity for taking his evenings out was excellent.

Bartenders and assistants might come and go, singly or in groups, but, so long as he was present, the host of old-time customers would barely notice the change. He gave the place the atmosphere to which they were used.

The Boulevard at that time was little more than a country road. The part he intended showing her was much farther out on this same West Side, where there was scarcely a house.

She troubled herself no more upon the matter. She only basked in the warmth of his feeling, which was as a grateful blaze to one who is cold. Hurstwood glowed with his own intensity, and the heat of his passion was already melting the wax of his companion\u2019s scruples. \u201cYou think,\u201d he said, \u201cI am happy; that I ought not to complain?"}, {"size": 663, "text": "If you were to meet all day with people who care absolutely nothing about you, if you went day after day to a place where there was nothing but show and indifference, if there was not one person in all those you knew to whom you could appeal for sympathy or talk to with pleasure, perhaps you would be unhappy too.\u201d He was striking a chord now which found sympathetic response in her own situation.

I have been rather reckless, but I could easily come out of that. I need you to draw me back, if my life ever amounts to anything.\u201d Carrie looked at him with the tenderness which virtue ever feels in its hope of reclaiming vice. How could such a man need reclaiming? His errors, what were they, that she could correct? Small they must be, where all was so fine. At worst, they were gilded affairs, and with what leniency are gilded errors viewed."}, {"size": 645, "text": "He put himself in such a lonely light that she was deeply moved. \u201cIs it that way?\u201d she mused.

WITH EYES AND NOT SEEING: ONE INFLUENCE WANES Carrie in her rooms that evening was in a fine glow, physically and mentally. She was deeply rejoicing in her affection for Hurstwood and his love, and looked forward with fine fancy to their next meeting Sunday night. They had agreed, without any feeling of enforced secrecy, that she should come down town and meet him, though, after all, the need of it was the cause. Mrs. Hale, from her upper window, saw her come in. \u201cUm,\u201d she thought to herself, \u201cshe goes riding with another man when her husband is out of the city. He had better keep an eye on her.\u201d"}, {"size": 876, "text": "The truth is that Mrs. Hale was not the only one who had a thought on this score. The housemaid who had welcomed Hurstwood had her opinion also. She had no particular regard for Carrie, whom she took to be cold and disagreeable. At the same time, she had a fancy for the merry and easy-mannered Drouet, who threw her a pleasant remark now and then, and in other ways extended her the evidence of that regard which he had for all members of the sex. Hurstwood was more reserved and critical in his manner. He did not appeal to this bodiced functionary in the same pleasant way. She wondered that he came so frequently, that Mrs. Drouet should go out with him this afternoon when Mr. Drouet was absent. She gave vent to her opinions in the kitchen where the cook was. As a result, a hum of gossip was set going which moved about the house in that secret manner common to gossip."}, {"size": 637, "text": "Carrie, now that she had yielded sufficiently to Hurstwood to confess her affection, no longer troubled about her attitude towards him. Temporarily she gave little thought to Drouet, thinking only of the dignity and grace of her lover and of his consuming affection for her. On the first evening, she did little but go over the details of the afternoon. It was the first time her sympathies had ever been thoroughly aroused, and they threw a new light on her character. She had some power of initiative, latent before, which now began to exert itself. She looked more practically upon her state and began to see glimmerings of a way out."}, {"size": 627, "text": "Hurstwood seemed a drag in the direction of honour. Her feelings were exceedingly creditable, in that they constructed out of these recent developments something which conquered freedom from dishonour. She had no idea what Hurstwood\u2019s next word would be. She only took his affection to be a fine thing, and appended better, more generous results accordingly. As yet, Hurstwood had only a thought of pleasure without responsibility. He did not feel that he was doing anything to complicate his life. His position was secure, his home-life, if not satisfactory, was at least undisturbed, his personal liberty rather untrammelled."}, {"size": 702, "text": "Carrie\u2019s love represented only so much added pleasure. He would enjoy this new gift over and above his ordinary allowance of pleasure. He would be happy with her and his own affairs would go on as they had, undisturbed. On Sunday evening Carrie dined with him at a place he had selected in East Adams Street, and thereafter they took a cab to what was then a pleasant evening resort out on Cottage Grove Avenue near 39th Street. In the process of his declaration he soon realised that Carrie took his love upon a higher basis than he had anticipated. She kept him at a distance in a rather earnest way, and submitted only to those tender tokens of affection which better become the inexperienced lover."}, {"size": 482, "text": "Hurstwood saw that she was not to be possessed for the asking, and deferred pressing his suit too warmly.

Could you call next Tuesday?\u201d The cab stopped one door out of the way according to his call. \u201cGood-night,\u201d he whispered, as the cab rolled away.

He paid, if anything, more attention to his old friend than usual, and yet in no way held him up to that subtle ridicule which a lover in favour may so secretly practise before the mistress of his heart.

THE IRK OF THE OLD TIES: THE MAGIC OF YOUTH The complete ignoring by Hurstwood of his own home came with the growth of his affection for Carrie.

Now that Carrie had come, he was in a fair way to be blissful again."}, {"size": 761, "text": "There was delight in going down town evenings.

For one thing, one of her neighbours, a certain Mr. and Mrs. Ramsey, who were possessors of money, made out of the coal business, had done so.

He heard the carts go lumbering by upon the neighbouring streets, but they were far off, and only buzzed upon his ear.

She tried to console herself with the thought that a score of other persons, men and women, were equally tremulous concerning the outcome of their efforts, but she could not disassociate the general danger from her own individual liability. She feared that she would forget her lines, that she might be unable to master the feeling which she now felt concerning her own movements in the play. At times she wished that she had never gone into the affair; at others, she trembled lest she should be paralysed with fear and stand white and gasping, not knowing what to say and spoiling the entire performance."}, {"size": 724, "text": "In the matter of the company, Mr. Bamberger had disappeared.

A loafing professional had been called in to assume the role of Ray, and, while he was a poor stick of his kind, he was not troubled by any of those qualms which attack the spirit of those who have never faced an audience.

They had regard for the ability which could amass a small fortune, own a nice home, keep a barouche or carriage, perhaps, wear fine clothes, and maintain a good mercantile position.

The professional, whose name was Patton, had little to recommend him outside of his assurance, but this at the present moment was most palpably needed. Mrs. Morgan, as Pearl, was stiff with fright. Mrs. Hoagland was husky in the throat. The whole company was so weak-kneed that the lines were merely spoken, and nothing more.

After the first rush of fright, however, the players got over the danger of collapse. They rambled weakly forward, losing nearly all the expression which was intended, and making the thing dull in the extreme, when Carrie came in. One glance at her, and both Hurstwood and Drouet saw plainly that she also was weak-kneed.

There was another place in which Laura was to rise and, with a sense of impending disaster, say, sadly: \u201cI wish you hadn\u2019t said that, Pearl.

He was pouring determination of his own in her direction. He felt sorry for her. In a few more minutes it fell to her to read the letter sent in by the strange villain.

THE BLAZE OF THE TINDER: FLESH WARS WITH THE FLESHThe misfortune of the Hurstwood household was due to the fact that jealousy, having been born of love, did not perish with it. Mrs. Hurstwood retained this in such form that subsequent influences could transform it into hate. Hurstwood was still worthy, in a physical sense, of the affection his wife had once bestowed upon him, but in a social sense he fell short. With his regard died his power to be attentive to her, and this, to a woman, is much greater than outright crime toward another. Our self-love dictates our appreciation of the good or evil in another. In Mrs. Hurstwood it discoloured the very hue of her husband\u2019s indifferent nature. She saw design in deeds and phrases which sprung only from a faded appreciation of her presence."}, {"size": 622, "text": "As a consequence, she was resentful and suspicious.

These little rows were really precipitated by an atmosphere which was surcharged with dissension.

In the last six weeks he had become strangely irritable\u2014strangely satisfied to pick up and go out, whether things were right or wrong in the house. Why?

A thousand chances the subject of the performance had never been brought up had Jessica not been so engaged by the attentions of her young companion, who usurped as much time as possible.

You can tell me or not, just as you want to, but I won\u2019t fool any longer!\u201d He shoved the last few remaining things he had laid out into his valise and snapped it with a vengeance.

It burns as a will-o\u2019-the-wisp, dancing onward to fairylands of delight. It roars as a furnace. Too often jealousy is the quality upon which it feeds."}, {"size": 675, "text": "Chapter XXIV. ASHES OF TINDER: A FACE AT THE WINDOWThat night Hurstwood remained down town entirely, going to the Palmer House for a bed after his work was through. He was in a fevered state of mind, owing to the blight his wife\u2019s action threatened to cast upon his entire future. While he was not sure how much significance might be attached to the threat she had made, he was sure that her attitude, if long continued, would cause him no end of trouble. She was determined, and had worsted him in a very important contest. How would it be from now on? He walked the floor of his little office, and later that of his room, putting one thing and another together to no avail."}, {"size": 610, "text": "Mrs. Hurstwood, on the contrary, had decided not to lose her advantage by inaction. Now that she had practically cowed him, she would follow up her work with demands, the acknowledgment of which would make her word _law_ in the future. He would have to pay her the money which she would now regularly demand or there would be trouble. It did not matter what he did. She really did not care whether he came home any more or not. The household would move along much more pleasantly without him, and she could do as she wished without consulting any one. Now she proposed to consult a lawyer and hire a detective."}, {"size": 893, "text": "She would find out at once just what advantages she could gain.

What a fool move that was.\u201d He also thought of his managerial position. \u201cIf she raises a row now I\u2019ll lose this thing. They won\u2019t have me around if my name gets in the papers. My friends, too!\u201d He grew more angry as he thought of the talk any action on her part would create. How would the papers talk about it? Every man he knew would be wondering. He would have to explain and deny and make a general mark of himself. Then Moy would come and confer with him and there would be the devil to pay.

He saw no solution of anything\u2014not a loophole left."}, {"size": 690, "text": "Through all this thoughts of Carrie flashed upon him, and the approaching affair of Saturday. Tangled as all his matters were, he did not worry over that. It was the one pleasing thing in this whole rout of trouble. He could arrange that satisfactorily, for Carrie would be glad to wait, if necessary. He would see how things turned out to-morrow, and then he would talk to her. They were going to meet as usual. He saw only her pretty face and neat figure and wondered why life was not arranged so that such joy as he found with her could be steadily maintained. How much more pleasant it would be. Then he would take up his wife\u2019s threat again, and the wrinkles and moisture would return."}, {"size": 755, "text": "In the morning he came over from the hotel and opened his mail, but there was nothing in it outside the ordinary run.

While the danger had not lessened, it had not as yet materialised, and with him no news was good news. If he could only get plenty of time to think, perhaps something would turn up. Surely, surely, this thing would not drift along to catastrophe and he not find a way out."}, {"size": 608, "text": "His spirits fell, however, when, upon reaching the park, he waited and waited and Carrie did not come. He held his favourite post for an hour or more, then arose and began to walk about restlessly. Could something have happened out there to keep her away? Could she have been reached by his wife? Surely not. So little did he consider Drouet that it never once occurred to him to worry about his finding out. He grew restless as he ruminated, and then decided that perhaps it was nothing. She had not been able to get away this morning. That was why no letter notifying him had come. He would get one to-day."}, {"size": 613, "text": "It would probably be on his desk when he got back. He would look for it at once. After a time he gave up waiting and drearily headed for the Madison car. To add to his distress, the bright blue sky became overcast with little fleecy clouds which shut out the sun. The wind veered to the east, and by the time he reached his office it was threatening to drizzle all afternoon. He went in and examined his letters, but there was nothing from Carrie.

He tore it open and read without a show of feeling. It began in the most formal manner and was sharply and coldly worded throughout. \u201cI want you to send the money I asked for at once. I need it to carry out my plans. You can stay away if you want to. It doesn\u2019t matter in the least. But I must have some money.

Then he sat down in his chair and gazed without seeing, contemplating the result of his work. What would she do about that? The confounded wretch!

She was carrying things with too high a hand."}, {"size": 632, "text": "These were his first thoughts. Later, however, his old discretion asserted itself. Something had to be done. A climax was near and she would not sit idle. He knew her well enough to know that when she had decided upon a plan she would follow it up.

The street looked like a sea of round black cloth roofs, twisting, bobbing, moving. Trucks and vans were rattling in a noisy line and everywhere men were shielding themselves as best they could.

He would have some arrangement of this thing. He called a cab and was driven through the dreary rain to the North Side. On the way his temper cooled as he thought of the details of the case. What did she know? What had she done? Maybe she\u2019d got hold of Carrie, who knows\u2014or\u2014or Drouet. Perhaps she really had evidence, and was prepared to fell him as a man does another from secret ambush. She was shrewd.

He alighted and went up the steps to the front door, but it was with a nervous palpitation of the heart. He pulled out his key and tried to insert it, but another key was on the inside.

There was a door which opened under the steps into the kitchen, protected by an iron grating, intended as a safeguard against burglars. When he reached this he noticed that it also was bolted and that the kitchen windows were down. What could it mean? He rang the bell and then waited. Finally, seeing that no one was coming, he turned and went back to his cab. \u201cI guess they\u2019ve gone out,\u201d he said apologetically to the individual who was hiding his red face in a loose tarpaulin raincoat."}, {"size": 267, "text": "\u201cI saw a young girl up in that winder,\u201d returned the cabby.

It seemed a monstrous, unnatural, unwarranted condition which had suddenly descended upon him without his let or hindrance.Meanwhile he gave a thought now and then to Carrie. What could be the trouble in that quarter? No letter had come, no word of any kind, and yet here it was late in the evening and she had agreed to meet him that morning."}, {"size": 633, "text": "To-morrow they were to have met and gone off\u2014where?

Supposing she, too, wrote him and told him that she knew all\u2014that she would have nothing more to do with him? It would be just like this to happen as things were going now.

He strolled up and down the polished floor of the resort, his hands in his pockets, his brow wrinkled, his mouth set."}, {"size": 750, "text": "He was getting some vague comfort out of a good cigar, but it was no panacea for the ill which affected him. Every once in a while he would clinch his fingers and tap his foot\u2014signs of the stirring mental process he was undergoing.

He was altogether a fine example of great mental perturbation. For all his study nothing came of the evening except this\u2014he sent the money. It was with great opposition, after two or three hours of the most urgent mental affirmation and denial, that at last he got an envelope, placed in it the requested amount, and slowly sealed it up."}, {"size": 222, "text": "Then he called Harry, the boy of all work around the place. \u201cYou take this to this address,\u201d he said, handing him the envelope, \u201cand give it to Mrs. Hurstwood.\u201d \u201cYes, sir,\u201d said the boy. \u201cIf she isn\u2019t there bring it back.\u201d"}, {"size": 635, "text": "\u201cYou\u2019ve seen my wife?\u201d he asked as a precautionary measure as the boy turned to go. \u201cOh, yes, sir.

He was beaten for to-night and he might just as well make the best of it. But, oh, the wretchedness of being forced this way! He could see her meeting the boy at the door and smiling sardonically.

He breathed heavily and wiped the moisture from his face."}, {"size": 529, "text": "For relief, he arose and joined in conversation with a few friends who were drinking. He tried to get the interest of things about him, but it was not to be. All the time his thoughts would run out to his home and see the scene being therein enacted.

No word from Carrie. Nothing from his wife, which was pleasant. The fact that he had sent the money and that she had received it worked to the ease of his mind, for, as the thought that he had done it receded, his chagrin at it grew less and his hope of peace more."}, {"size": 852, "text": "He fancied, as he sat at his desk, that nothing would be done for a week or two. Meanwhile, he would have time to think. This process of _thinking_ began by a reversion to Carrie and the arrangement by which he was to get her away from Drouet. How about that now? His pain at her failure to meet or write him rapidly increased as he devoted himself to this subject. He decided to write her care of the West Side Post-office and ask for an explanation, as well as to have her meet him. The thought that this letter would probably not reach her until Monday chafed him exceedingly. He must get some speedier method\u2014but how? He thought upon it for a half-hour, not contemplating a messenger or a cab direct to the house, owing to the exposure of it, but finding that time was slipping away to no purpose, he wrote the letter and then began to think again."}, {"size": 648, "text": "The hours slipped by, and with them the possibility of the union he had contemplated. He had thought to be joyously aiding Carrie by now in the task of joining her interests to his, and here it was afternoon and nothing done. Three o\u2019clock came, four, five, six, and no letter. The helpless manager paced the floor and grimly endured the gloom of defeat. He saw a busy Saturday ushered out, the Sabbath in, and nothing done. All day, the bar being closed, he brooded alone, shut out from home, from the excitement of his resort, from Carrie, and without the ability to alter his condition one iota. It was the worst Sunday he had spent in his life."}, {"size": 697, "text": "In Monday\u2019s second mail he encountered a very legal-looking letter, which held his interest for some time. It bore the imprint of the law offices of McGregor, James and Hay, and with a very formal \u201cDear Sir,\u201d and \u201cWe beg to state,\u201d went on to inform him briefly that they had been retained by Mrs. Julia Hurstwood to adjust certain matters which related to her sustenance and property rights, and would he kindly call and see them about the matter at once. He read it through carefully several times, and then merely shook his head. It seemed as if his family troubles were just beginning. \u201cWell!\u201d he said after a time, quite audibly, \u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d Then he folded it up and put it in his pocket."}, {"size": 600, "text": "To add to his misery there was no word from Carrie. He was quite certain now that she knew he was married and was angered at his perfidy. His loss seemed all the more bitter now that he needed her most. He thought he would go out and insist on seeing her if she did not send him word of some sort soon. He was really affected most miserably of all by this desertion. He had loved her earnestly enough, but now that the possibility of losing her stared him in the face she seemed much more attractive. He really pined for a word, and looked out upon her with his mind\u2019s eye in the most wistful manner."}, {"size": 607, "text": "He did not propose to lose her, whatever she might think. Come what might, he would adjust this matter, and soon. He would go to her and tell her all his family complications. He would explain to her just where he stood and how much he needed her. Surely she couldn\u2019t go back on him now? It wasn\u2019t possible. He would plead until her anger would melt\u2014until she would forgive him. Suddenly he thought: \u201cSupposing she isn\u2019t out there\u2014suppose she has gone?\u201d He was forced to take his feet. It was too much to think of and sit still. Nevertheless, his rousing availed him nothing. On Tuesday it was the same way."}, {"size": 620, "text": "He did manage to bring himself into the mood to go out to Carrie, but when he got in Ogden Place he thought he saw a man watching him and went away. He did not go within a block of the house. One of the galling incidents of this visit was that he came back on a Randolph Street car, and without noticing arrived almost opposite the building of the concern with which his son was connected. This sent a pang through his heart. He had called on his boy there several times. Now the lad had not sent him a word. His absence did not seem to be noticed by either of his children. Well, well, fortune plays a man queer tricks."}, {"size": 736, "text": "He got back to his office and joined in a conversation with friends. It was as if idle chatter deadened the sense of misery. That night he dined at Rector\u2019s and returned at once to his office. In the bustle and show of the latter was his only relief. He troubled over many little details and talked perfunctorily to everybody. He stayed at his desk long after all others had gone, and only quitted it when the night watchman on his round pulled at the front door to see if it was safely locked. On Wednesday he received another polite note from McGregor, James and Hay. It read: \u201c_Dear Sir:_ We beg to inform you that we are instructed to wait until to-morrow (Thursday) at one o\u2019clock, before filing suit against you, on behalf of Mrs."}, {"size": 206, "text": "Julia Hurstwood, for divorce and alimony.

If he did, he would be offered terms that would make his blood boil. He folded the letter and put it with the other one. Then he put on his hat and went for a turn about the block. Chapter XXVI. THE AMBASSADOR FALLEN: A SEARCH FOR THE GATE Carrie, left alone by Drouet, listened to his retreating steps, scarcely realising what had happened. She knew that he had stormed out. It was some moments before she questioned whether he would return, not now exactly, but ever."}, {"size": 621, "text": "She looked around her upon the rooms, out of which the evening light was dying, and wondered why she did not feel quite the same towards them. She went over to the dresser and struck a match, lighting the gas. Then she went back to the rocker to think. It was some time before she could collect her thoughts, but when she did, this truth began to take on importance. She was quite alone. Suppose Drouet did not come back? Suppose she should never hear anything more of him? This fine arrangement of chambers would not last long. She would have to quit them. To her credit, be it said, she never once counted on Hurstwood."}, {"size": 628, "text": "She could only approach that subject with a pang of sorrow and regret. For a truth, she was rather shocked and frightened by this evidence of human depravity. He would have tricked her without turning an eyelash. She would have been led into a newer and worse situation. And yet she could not keep out the pictures of his looks and manners. Only this one deed seemed strange and miserable. It contrasted sharply with all she felt and knew concerning the man. But she was alone. That was the greater thought just at present. How about that? Would she go out to work again? Would she begin to look around in the business district?"}, {"size": 653, "text": "The stage! Oh, yes. Drouet had spoken about that. Was there any hope there? She moved to and fro, in deep and varied thoughts, while the minutes slipped away and night fell completely. She had had nothing to eat, and yet there she sat, thinking it over. She remembered that she was hungry and went to the little cupboard in the rear room where were the remains of one of their breakfasts. She looked at these things with certain misgivings. The contemplation of food had more significance than usual. While she was eating she began to wonder how much money she had. It struck her as exceedingly important, and without ado she went to look for her purse."}, {"size": 602, "text": "It was on the dresser, and in it were seven dollars in bills and some change. She quailed as she thought of the insignificance of the amount and rejoiced because the rent was paid until the end of the month. She began also to think what she would have done if she had gone out into the street when she first started. By the side of that situation, as she looked at it now, the present seemed agreeable. She had a little time at least, and then, perhaps, everything would come out all right, after all. Drouet had gone, but what of it? He did not seem seriously angry. He only acted as if he were huffy."}, {"size": 759, "text": "He would come back\u2014of course he would. There was his cane in the corner. Here was one of his collars. He had left his light overcoat in the wardrobe. She looked about and tried to assure herself with the sight of a dozen such details, but, alas, the secondary thought arrived. Supposing he did come back. Then what? Here was another proposition nearly, if not quite, as disturbing. She would have to talk with and explain to him. He would want her to admit that he was right. It would be impossible for her to live with him. On Friday Carrie remembered her appointment with Hurstwood, and the passing of the hour when she should, by all right of promise, have been in his company served to keep the calamity which had befallen her exceedingly fresh and clear."}, {"size": 606, "text": "In her nervousness and stress of mind she felt it necessary to act, and consequently put on a brown street dress, and at eleven o\u2019clock started to visit the business portion once again. She must look for work. The rain, which threatened at twelve and began at one, served equally well to cause her to retrace her steps and remain within doors as it did to reduce Hurstwood\u2019s spirits and give him a wretched day.

She could not help feeling, as she looked across the lovely park, that life was a joyous thing for those who did not need to worry, and she wished over and over that something might interfere now to preserve for her the comfortable state which she had occupied. She did not want Drouet or his money when she thought of it, nor anything more to do with Hurstwood, but only the content and ease of mind she had experienced, for, after all, she had been happy\u2014happier, at least, than she was now when confronted by the necessity of making her way alone."}, {"size": 629, "text": "When she arrived in the business part it was quite eleven o\u2019clock, and the business had little longer to run. She did not realise this at first, being affected by some of the old distress which was a result of her earlier adventure into this strenuous and exacting quarter. She wandered about, assuring herself that she was making up her mind to look for something, and at the same time feeling that perhaps it was not necessary to be in such haste about it. The thing was difficult to encounter, and she had a few days. Besides, she was not sure that she was really face to face again with the bitter problem of self-sustenance."}, {"size": 638, "text": "Anyhow, there was one change for the better. She knew that she had improved in appearance. Her manner had vastly changed. Her clothes were becoming, and men\u2014well-dressed men, some of the kind who before had gazed at her indifferently from behind their polished railings and imposing office partitions\u2014now gazed into her face with a soft light in their eyes. In a way, she felt the power and satisfaction of the thing, but it did not wholly reassure her. She looked for nothing save what might come legitimately and without the appearance of special favour.

She could not help smiling. \u201cLet me be everything to you from now on,\u201d he said. \u201cDon\u2019t make me worry any more. I\u2019ll be true to you.

She felt rather sorry for him\u2014a sorrow born of what had only recently been a great admiration. True love she had never felt for him. She would have known as much if she could have analysed her feelings, but this thing which she now felt aroused by his great feeling broke down the barriers between them. \u201cYou\u2019ll stay with me, won\u2019t you?\u201d he asked. \u201cYes,\u201d she said, nodding her head. He gathered her to himself, imprinting kisses upon her lips and cheeks. \u201cYou must marry me, though,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019ll get a license to-day,\u201d he answered."}, {"size": 654, "text": "\u201cUnder a new name,\u201d he answered. \u201cI\u2019ll take a new name and live a new life.

As for his returning, or their restoring him to his former position, they had not quite decided what the effect of it would be. They would think it over and correspond with him later, possibly, after a little time, and so on. The sum and substance of it was that there was no hope, and they wanted the money with the least trouble possible. Hurstwood read his doom. He decided to pay $9,500 to the agent whom they said they would send, keeping $1,300 for his own use. He telegraphed his acquiescence, explained to the representative who called at the hotel the same day, took a certificate of payment, and told Carrie to pack her trunk."}, {"size": 638, "text": "He was slightly depressed over this newest move at the time he began to make it, but eventually restored himself. He feared that even yet he might be seized and taken back, so he tried to conceal his movements, but it was scarcely possible. He ordered Carrie\u2019s trunk sent to the depot, where he had it sent by express to New York. No one seemed to be observing him, but he left at night. He was greatly agitated lest at the first station across the border or at the depot in New York there should be waiting for him an officer of the law. Carrie, ignorant of his theft and his fears, enjoyed the entry into the latter city in the morning."}, {"size": 815, "text": "The round green hills sentinelling the broad, expansive bosom of the Hudson held her attention by their beauty as the train followed the line of the stream. She had heard of the Hudson River, the great city of New York, and now she looked out, filling her mind with the wonder of it. As the train turned east at Spuyten Duyvil and followed the east bank of the Harlem River, Hurstwood nervously called her attention to the fact that they were on the edge of the city. After her experience with Chicago, she expected long lines of cars\u2014a great highway of tracks\u2014and noted the difference. The sight of a few boats in the Harlem and more in the East River tickled her young heart. It was the first sign of the great sea. Next came a plain street with five-story brick flats, and then the train plunged into the tunnel."}, {"size": 610, "text": "\u201cGrand Central Station!\u201d called the trainman, as, after a few minutes of darkness and smoke, daylight reappeared.

No one approached him, but he glanced furtively to and fro as he made for the street entrance. So excited was he that he forgot all about Carrie, who fell behind, wondering at his self-absorption. As he passed through the depot proper the strain reached its climax and began to wane. All at once he was on the sidewalk, and none but cabmen hailed him."}, {"size": 610, "text": "He heaved a great breath and turned, remembering Carrie. \u201cI thought you were going to run off and leave me,\u201d she said. \u201cI was trying to remember which car takes us to the Gilsey,\u201d he answered. Carrie hardly heard him, so interested was she in the busy scene. \u201cHow large is New York?\u201d she asked. \u201cOh a million or more,\u201d said Hurstwood. He looked around and hailed a cab, but he did so in a changed way. For the first time in years the thought that he must count these little expenses flashed through his mind. It was a disagreeable thing. He decided he would lose no time living in hotels but would rent a flat."}, {"size": 713, "text": "Accordingly he told Carrie, and she agreed. \u201cWe\u2019ll look to-day, if you want to,\u201d she said.

He stood up and spoke to the driver. \u201cTake me to the Belford,\u201d he said, knowing it to be less frequented by those whom he knew. Then he sat down. \u201cWhere is the residence part?\u201d asked Carrie, who did not take the tall five-story walls on either hand to be the abodes of families. \u201cEverywhere,\u201d said Hurstwood, who knew the city fairly well. \u201cThere are no lawns in New York. All these are houses.\u201d \u201cWell, then, I don\u2019t like it,\u201d said Carrie, who was coming to have a few opinions of her own."}, {"size": 621, "text": "Chapter XXX. THE KINGDOM OF GREATNESS: THE PILGRIM ADREAMWhatever a man like Hurstwood could be in Chicago, it is very evident that he would be but an inconspicuous drop in an ocean like New York. In Chicago, whose population still ranged about 500,000, millionaires were not numerous. The rich had not become so conspicuously rich as to drown all moderate incomes in obscurity. The attention of the inhabitants was not so distracted by local celebrities in the dramatic, artistic, social, and religious fields as to shut the well-positioned man from view. In Chicago the two roads to distinction were politics and trade."}, {"size": 756, "text": "In New York the roads were any one of a half-hundred, and each had been diligently pursued by hundreds, so that celebrities were numerous. The sea was already full of whales. A common fish must needs disappear wholly from view\u2014remain unseen. In other words, Hurstwood was nothing. There is a more subtle result of such a situation as this, which, though not always taken into account, produces the tragedies of the world. The great create an atmosphere which reacts badly upon the small. This atmosphere is easily and quickly felt. Walk among the magnificent residences, the splendid equipages, the gilded shops, restaurants, resorts of all kinds; scent the flowers, the silks, the wines; drink of the laughter springing from the soul of luxurious content,"}, {"size": 605, "text": "of the glances which gleam like light from defiant spears; feel the quality of the smiles which cut like glistening swords and of strides born of place, and you shall know of what is the atmosphere of the high and mighty. Little use to argue that of such is not the kingdom of greatness, but so long as the world is attracted by this and the human heart views this as the one desirable realm which it must attain, so long, to that heart, will this remain the realm of greatness. So long, also, will the atmosphere of this realm work its desperate results in the soul of man. It is like a chemical reagent."}, {"size": 690, "text": "One day of it, like one drop of the other, will so affect and discolour the views, the aims, the desire of the mind, that it will thereafter remain forever dyed.

Aye! dreams unfulfilled\u2014gnawing, luring, idle phantoms which beckon and lead, beckon and lead, until death and dissolution dissolve their power and restore us blind to nature\u2019s heart.

He could not fail to notice the signs of affluence and luxury on every hand. He had been to New York before and knew the resources of its folly. In part it was an awesome place to him, for here gathered all that he most respected on this earth\u2014wealth, place, and fame. The majority of the celebrities with whom he had tipped glasses in his day as manager hailed from this self-centred and populous spot. The most inviting stories of pleasure and luxury had been told of places and individuals here."}, {"size": 738, "text": "He knew it to be true that unconsciously he was brushing elbows with fortune the livelong day; that a hundred or five hundred thousand gave no one the privilege of living more than comfortably in so wealthy a place. Fashion and pomp required more ample sums, so that the poor man was nowhere. All this he realised, now quite sharply, as he faced the city, cut off from his friends, despoiled of his modest fortune, and even his name, and forced to begin the battle for place and comfort all over again. He was not old, but he was not so dull but that he could feel he soon would be. Of a sudden, then, this show of fine clothes, place, and power took on peculiar significance. It was emphasised by contrast with his own distressing state."}, {"size": 717, "text": "And it was distressing. He soon found that freedom from fear of arrest was not the _sine qua non_ of his existence. That danger dissolved, the next necessity became the grievous thing. The paltry sum of thirteen hundred and some odd dollars set against the need of rent, clothing, food, and pleasure for years to come was a spectacle little calculated to induce peace of mind in one who had been accustomed to spend five times that sum in the course of a year. He thought upon the subject rather actively the first few days he was in New York, and decided that he must act quickly. As a consequence, he consulted the business opportunities advertised in the morning papers and began investigations on his own account."}, {"size": 662, "text": "That was not before he had become settled, however. Carrie and he went looking for a flat, as arranged, and found one in Seventy-eighth Street near Amsterdam Avenue. It was a five-story building, and their flat was on the third floor. Owing to the fact that the street was not yet built up solidly, it was possible to see east to the green tops of the trees in Central Park and west to the broad waters of the Hudson, a glimpse of which was to be had out of the west windows. For the privilege of six rooms and a bath, running in a straight line, they were compelled to pay thirty-five dollars a month\u2014an average, and yet exorbitant, rent for a home at the time."}, {"size": 638, "text": "Carrie noticed the difference between the size of the rooms here and in Chicago and mentioned it. \u201cYou\u2019ll not find anything better, dear,\u201d said Hurstwood, \u201cunless you go into one of the old-fashioned houses, and then you won\u2019t have any of these conveniences.\u201d Carrie picked out the new abode because of its newness and bright wood-work. It was one of the very new ones supplied with steam heat, which was a great advantage. The stationary range, hot and cold water, dumb-waiter, speaking tubes, and call-bell for the janitor pleased her very much. She had enough of the instincts of a housewife to take great satisfaction in these things."}, {"size": 680, "text": "Hurstwood made arrangements with one of the instalment houses whereby they furnished the flat complete and accepted fifty dollars down and ten dollars a month. He then had a little plate, bearing the name G. W. Wheeler, made, which he placed on his letter-box in the hall. It sounded exceedingly odd to Carrie to be called Mrs. Wheeler by the janitor, but in time she became used to it and looked upon the name as her own. These house details settled, Hurstwood visited some of the advertised opportunities to purchase an interest in some flourishing down-town bar. After the palatial resort in Adams Street, he could not stomach the commonplace saloons which he found advertised."}, {"size": 688, "text": "He lost a number of days looking up these and finding them disagreeable. He did, however, gain considerable knowledge by talking, for he discovered the influence of Tammany Hall and the value of standing in with the police. The most profitable and flourishing places he found to be those which conducted anything but a legitimate business, such as that controlled by Fitzgerald and Moy. Elegant back rooms and private drinking booths on the second floor were usually adjuncts of very profitable places. He saw by portly keepers, whose shirt fronts shone with large diamonds, and whose clothes were properly cut, that the liquor business here, as elsewhere, yielded the same golden profit."}, {"size": 627, "text": "At last he found an individual who had a resort in Warren Street, which seemed an excellent venture. It was fairly well-appearing and susceptible of improvement. The owner claimed the business to be excellent, and it certainly looked so. \u201cWe deal with a very good class of people,\u201d he told Hurstwood. \u201cMerchants, salesmen, and professionals. It\u2019s a well-dressed class. No bums. We don\u2019t allow \u2019em in the place.\u201d Hurstwood listened to the cash-register ring, and watched the trade for a while. \u201cIt\u2019s profitable enough for two, is it?\u201d he asked. \u201cYou can see for yourself if you\u2019re any judge of the liquor trade,\u201d said the owner."}, {"size": 699, "text": "\u201cThis is only one of the two places I have.

If I had some one who knew the business thoroughly I wouldn\u2019t mind sharing with him in this one and letting him manage it.\u201d \u201cI\u2019ve had experience enough,\u201d said Hurstwood blandly, but he felt a little diffident about referring to Fitzgerald and Moy. \u201cWell, you can suit yourself, Mr. Wheeler,\u201d said the proprietor. He only offered a third interest in the stock, fixtures, and good-will, and this in return for a thousand dollars and managerial ability on the part of the one who should come in. There was no property involved, because the owner of the saloon merely rented from an estate."}, {"size": 603, "text": "The offer was genuine enough, but it was a question with Hurstwood whether a third interest in that locality could be made to yield one hundred and fifty dollars a month, which he figured he must have in order to meet the ordinary family expenses and be comfortable. It was not the time, however, after many failures to find what he wanted, to hesitate. It looked as though a third would pay a hundred a month now. By judicious management and improvement, it might be made to pay more. Accordingly he agreed to enter into partnership, and made over his thousand dollars, preparing to enter the next day."}, {"size": 730, "text": "His first inclination was to be elated, and he confided to Carrie that he thought he had made an excellent arrangement. Time, however, introduced food for reflection. He found his partner to be very disagreeable. Frequently he was the worse for liquor, which made him surly. This was the last thing which Hurstwood was used to in business. Besides, the business varied. It was nothing like the class of patronage which he had enjoyed in Chicago. He found that it would take a long time to make friends. These people hurried in and out without seeking the pleasures of friendship. It was no gathering or lounging place. Whole days and weeks passed without one such hearty greeting as he had been wont to enjoy every day in Chicago."}, {"size": 690, "text": "For another thing, Hurstwood missed the celebrities\u2014those well-dressed, _\u00e9lite_ individuals who lend grace to the average bars and bring news from far-off and exclusive circles. He did not see one such in a month. Evenings, when still at his post, he would occasionally read in the evening papers incidents concerning celebrities whom he knew\u2014whom he had drunk a glass with many a time. They would visit a bar like Fitzgerald and Moy\u2019s in Chicago, or the Hoffman House, uptown, but he knew that he would never see them down here. Again, the business did not pay as well as he thought. It increased a little, but he found he would have to watch his household expenses, which was humiliating."}, {"size": 619, "text": "In the very beginning it was a delight to go home late at night, as he did, and find Carrie. He managed to run up and take dinner with her between six and seven, and to remain home until nine o\u2019clock in the morning, but the novelty of this waned after a time, and he began to feel the drag of his duties. The first month had scarcely passed before Carrie said in a very natural way: \u201cI think I\u2019ll go down this week and buy a dress.\u2019 \u201cWhat kind?\u201d said Hurstwood. \u201cOh, something for street wear.\u201d \u201cAll right,\u201d he answered, smiling, although he noted mentally that it would be more agreeable to his finances if she didn\u2019t."}, {"size": 611, "text": "Nothing was said about it the next day, but the following morning he asked: \u201cHave you done anything about your dress?\u201d \u201cNot yet,\u201d said Carrie. He paused a few moments, as if in thought, and then said: \u201cWould you mind putting it off a few days?\u201d \u201cNo,\u201d replied Carrie, who did not catch the drift of his remarks. She had never thought of him in connection with money troubles before. \u201cWhy?\u201d \u201cWell, I\u2019ll tell you,\u201d said Hurstwood. \u201cThis investment of mine is taking a lot of money just now. I expect to get it all back shortly, but just at present I am running close.\u201d \u201cOh!\u201d answered Carrie. \u201cWhy, certainly, dear."}, {"size": 626, "text": "Why didn\u2019t you tell me before?\u201d \u201cIt wasn\u2019t necessary,\u201d said Hurstwood. For all her acquiescence, there was something about the way Hurstwood spoke which reminded Carrie of Drouet and his little deal which he was always about to put through. It was only the thought of a second, but it was a beginning. It was something new in her thinking of Hurstwood. Other things followed from time to time, little things of the same sort, which in their cumulative effect were eventually equal to a full revelation. Carrie was not dull by any means. Two persons cannot long dwell together without coming to an understanding of one another."}, {"size": 626, "text": "The mental difficulties of an individual reveal themselves whether he voluntarily confesses them or not. Trouble gets in the air and contributes gloom, which speaks for itself. Hurstwood dressed as nicely as usual, but they were the same clothes he had in Canada. Carrie noticed that he did not install a large wardrobe, though his own was anything but large. She noticed, also, that he did not suggest many amusements, said nothing about the food, seemed concerned about his business. This was not the easy Hurstwood of Chicago\u2014not the liberal, opulent Hurstwood she had known. The change was too obvious to escape detection."}, {"size": 752, "text": "In time she began to feel that a change had come about, and that she was not in his confidence. He was evidently secretive and kept his own counsel. She found herself asking him questions about little things. This is a disagreeable state to a woman. Great love makes it seem reasonable, sometimes plausible, but never satisfactory. Where great love is not, a more definite and less satisfactory conclusion is reached. As for Hurstwood, he was making a great fight against the difficulties of a changed condition. He was too shrewd not to realise the tremendous mistake he had made, and appreciate that he had done well in getting where he was, and yet he could not help contrasting his present state with his former, hour after hour, and day after day."}, {"size": 621, "text": "Besides, he had the disagreeable fear of meeting old-time friends, ever since one such encounter which he made shortly after his arrival in the city. It was in Broadway that he saw a man approaching him whom he knew. There was no time for simulating non-recognition. The exchange of glances had been too sharp, the knowledge of each other too apparent. So the friend, a buyer for one of the Chicago wholesale houses, felt, perforce, the necessity of stopping. \u201cHow are you?\u201d he said, extending his hand with an evident mixture of feeling and a lack of plausible interest. \u201cVery well,\u201d said Hurstwood, equally embarrassed."}, {"size": 620, "text": "\u201cHow is it with you?\u201d \u201cAll right; I\u2019m down here doing a little buying.

I\u2019ll come down and see you.\u201d \u201cDo,\u201d said Hurstwood. \u201cSo long,\u201d said the other, smiling affably and going on. \u201cHe never asked for my number,\u201d thought Hurstwood; \u201che wouldn\u2019t think of coming.\u201d He wiped his forehead, which had grown damp, and hoped sincerely he would meet no one else. These things told upon his good-nature, such as it was. His one hope was that things would change for the better in a money way."}, {"size": 770, "text": "He had Carrie. His furniture was being paid for. He was maintaining his position. As for Carrie, the amusements he could give her would have to do for the present. He could probably keep up his pretensions sufficiently long without exposure to make good, and then all would be well. He failed therein to take account of the frailties of human nature\u2014the difficulties of matrimonial life. Carrie was young. With him and with her varying mental states were common. At any moment the extremes of feeling might be anti-polarised at the dinner table. This often happens in the best regulated families. Little things brought out on such occasions need great love to obliterate them afterward. Where that is not, both parties count two and two and make a problem after a while."}, {"size": 621, "text": "Chapter XXXI. A PET OF GOOD FORTUNE: BROADWAY FLAUNTS ITS JOYSThe effect of the city and his own situation on Hurstwood was paralleled in the case of Carrie, who accepted the things which fortune provided with the most genial good-nature. New York, despite her first expression of disapproval, soon interested her exceedingly. Its clear atmosphere, more populous thoroughfares, and peculiar indifference struck her forcibly. She had never seen such a little flat as hers, and yet it soon enlisted her affection. The new furniture made an excellent showing, the sideboard which Hurstwood himself arranged gleamed brightly."}, {"size": 748, "text": "The furniture for each room was appropriate, and in the so-called parlour, or front room, was installed a piano, because Carrie said she would like to learn to play. She kept a servant and developed rapidly in household tactics and information. For the first time in her life she felt settled, and somewhat justified in the eyes of society as she conceived of it. Her thoughts were merry and innocent enough. For a long while she concerned herself over the arrangement of New York flats, and wondered at ten families living in one building and all remaining strange and indifferent to each other. She also marvelled at the whistles of the hundreds of vessels in the harbour\u2014the long, low cries of the Sound steamers and ferry-boats when fog was on."}, {"size": 703, "text": "The mere fact that these things spoke from the sea made them wonderful. She looked much at what she could see of the Hudson from her west windows and of the great city building up rapidly on either hand. It was much to ponder over, and sufficed to entertain her for more than a year without becoming stale. For another thing, Hurstwood was exceedingly interesting in his affection for her. Troubled as he was, he never exposed his difficulties to her. He carried himself with the same self-important air, took his new state with easy familiarity, and rejoiced in Carrie\u2019s proclivities and successes. Each evening he arrived promptly to dinner, and found the little dining-room a most inviting spectacle."}, {"size": 660, "text": "In a way, the smallness of the room added to its luxury. It looked full and replete. The white-covered table was arrayed with pretty dishes and lighted with a four-armed candelabra, each light of which was topped with a red shade. Between Carrie and the girl the steaks and chops came out all right, and canned goods did the rest for a while. Carrie studied the art of making biscuit, and soon reached the stage where she could show a plate of light, palatable morsels for her labour. In this manner the second, third, and fourth months passed. Winter came, and with it a feeling that indoors was best, so that the attending of theatres was not much talked of."}, {"size": 618, "text": "Hurstwood made great efforts to meet all expenditures without a show of feeling one way or the other. He pretended that he was reinvesting his money in strengthening the business for greater ends in the future. He contented himself with a very moderate allowance of personal apparel, and rarely suggested anything for Carrie. Thus the first winter passed. In the second year, the business which Hurstwood managed did increase somewhat. He got out of it regularly the $150 per month which he had anticipated. Unfortunately, by this time Carrie had reached certain conclusions, and he had scraped up a few acquaintances."}, {"size": 605, "text": "Being of a passive and receptive rather than an active and aggressive nature, Carrie accepted the situation. Her state seemed satisfactory enough. Once in a while they would go to a theatre together, occasionally in season to the beaches and different points about the city, but they picked up no acquaintances. Hurstwood naturally abandoned his show of fine manners with her and modified his attitude to one of easy familiarity. There were no misunderstandings, no apparent differences of opinion. In fact, without money or visiting friends, he led a life which could neither arouse jealousy nor comment."}, {"size": 608, "text": "Carrie rather sympathised with his efforts and thought nothing upon her lack of entertainment such as she had enjoyed in Chicago. New York as a corporate entity and her flat temporarily seemed sufficient. However, as Hurstwood\u2019s business increased, he, as stated, began to pick up acquaintances. He also began to allow himself more clothes. He convinced himself that his home life was very precious to him, but allowed that he could occasionally stay away from dinner. The first time he did this he sent a message saying that he would be detained. Carrie ate alone, and wished that it might not happen again."}, {"size": 814, "text": "The second time, also, he sent word, but at the last moment.

Notwithstanding the fact that he had observed her act in Chicago, and that during the past year he had only seen her limited in her relations to her flat and him by conditions which he made, and that she had not gained any friends or associates, he drew this peculiar conclusion. With it came a feeling of satisfaction in having a wife who could thus be content, and this satisfaction worked its natural result."}, {"size": 671, "text": "That is, since he imagined he saw her satisfied, he felt called upon to give only that which contributed to such satisfaction.

Now, Carrie began to feel this in various sensory ways. She was not the kind to be seriously disturbed by his actions. Not loving him greatly, she could not be jealous in a disturbing way. In fact, she was not jealous at all. Hurstwood was pleased with her placid manner, when he should have duly considered it. When he did not come home it did not seem anything like a terrible thing to her.

All she did observe was that Hurstwood was somewhat different. Some time in the second year of their residence in Seventy-eighth Street the flat across the hall from Carrie became vacant, and into it moved a very handsome young woman and her husband, with both of whom Carrie afterwards became acquainted. This was brought about solely by the arrangement of the flats, which were united in one place, as it were, by the dumb-waiter.

She was in a night-robe and dressing-gown, with her hair very much tousled, but she looked so pretty and good-natured that Carrie instantly conceived a liking for her. The newcomer did no more than smile shamefacedly, but it was sufficient. Carrie felt that she would like to know her, and a similar feeling stirred in the mind of the other, who admired Carrie\u2019s innocent face."}, {"size": 678, "text": "\u201cThat\u2019s a real pretty woman who has moved in next door,\u201d said Carrie to Hurstwood at the breakfast table. \u201cWho are they?\u201d asked Hurstwood. \u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d said Carrie. \u201cThe name on the bell is Vance. Some one over there plays beautifully. I guess it must be she.\u201d \u201cWell, you never can tell what sort of people you\u2019re living next to in this town, can you?\u201d said Hurstwood, expressing the customary New York opinion about neighbours. \u201cJust think,\u201d said Carrie, \u201cI have been in this house with nine other families for over a year and I don\u2019t know a soul.

The conversation turned to other things, and Carrie thought no more upon the subject until a day or two later, when, going out to market, she encountered Mrs. Vance coming in. The latter recognised her and nodded, for which Carrie returned a smile. This settled the probability of acquaintanceship. If there had been no faint recognition on this occasion, there would have been no future association.

Everything she had seen and heard thus far\u2014the merest scraps and shadows\u2014indicated that these people were, in a measure, refined and in comfortable circumstances. So Carrie was ready for any extension of the friendship which might follow. One day Carrie\u2019s bell rang and the servant, who was in the kitchen, pressed the button which caused the front door of the general entrance on the ground floor to be electrically unlatched.

Carrie felt that she needed more and better clothes to compare with this woman, and that any one looking at the two would pick Mrs. Vance for her raiment alone. It was a trying, though rather unjust thought, for Carrie had now developed an equally pleasing figure, and had grown in comeliness until she was a thoroughly attractive type of her colour of beauty.

Women appeared in their very best hats, shoes, and gloves, and walked arm in arm on their way to the fine shops or theatres strung along from Fourteenth to Thirty-fourth Streets.

In all her stay in the city, Carrie had never heard of this showy parade; had never even been on Broadway when it was taking place. On the other hand, it was a familiar thing to Mrs. Vance, who not only knew of it as an entity, but had often been in it, going purposely to see and be seen, to create a stir with her beauty and dispel any tendency to fall short in dressiness by contrasting herself with the beauty and fashion of the town."}, {"size": 671, "text": "Carrie stepped along easily enough after they got out of the car at Thirty-fourth Street, but soon fixed her eyes upon the lovely company which swarmed by and with them as they proceeded.

To stare seemed the proper and natural thing. Carrie found herself stared at and ogled.

This was in the mere matter of the halt his career had received when he departed from Chicago. A man\u2019s fortune or material progress is very much the same as his bodily growth.

This removes it at once beyond the special care of the founder. It needs not so much foresight now as direction.

Not trained to reason or introspect himself, he could not analyse the change that was taking place in his mind, and hence his body, but he felt the depression of it. Constant comparison between his old state and his new showed a balance for the worse, which produced a constant state of gloom or, at least, depression."}, {"size": 872, "text": "Now, it has been shown experimentally that a constantly subdued frame of mind produces certain poisons in the blood, called katastates, just as virtuous feelings of pleasure and delight produce helpful chemicals called anastates.

His eye no longer possessed that buoyant, searching shrewdness which had characterised it in Adams Street. His step was not as sharp and firm. He was given to thinking, thinking, thinking. The new friends he made were not celebrities. They were of a cheaper, a slightly more sensual and cruder, grade.

It had seemed very easy for any one to get up there and have ample raiment and money to spend, but now that he was out of it, how far off it became. He began to see as one sees a city with a wall about it. Men were posted at the gates. You could not get in. Those inside did not care to come out to see who you were.

Then we could arrange to live as you want to.\u201d \u201cIt would suit me all right,\u201d said Carrie, who, nevertheless, felt badly to think it had come to this.

She began to look upon Hurstwood wholly as a man, and not as a lover or husband.

The new flat was located in Thirteenth Street, a half block west of Sixth Avenue, and contained only four rooms. The new neighbourhood did not appeal to Carrie as much.

Her mind went back to her early venture in Chicago, the Hansons and their flat, and her heart revolted. That was terrible! Everything about poverty was terrible. She wished she knew a way out.

The more circumscribed became her state, the more entrancing seemed this other. And now poverty threatened to seize her entirely and to remove this other world far upward like a heaven to which any Lazarus might extend, appealingly, his hands.

Now, these things were like grey clouds hovering along the horizon of a clear day. They threatened to cover and obscure his life with chilly greyness.

Would he have to go personally and ask; wait outside an office door, and, then, distinguished and affluent looking, announce that he was looking for something to do?

The least wrinkle crept into his brow as he remembered that this was February 2d, the time the man always called.

This busy, distracting, suggestive scene was shut out. He could read his papers. Accordingly, he went home. Carrie was reading, quite alone. It was rather dark in the flat, shut in as it was. \u201cYou\u2019ll hurt your eyes,\u201d he said when he saw her.

He drew up his chair near the radiator and lighted the gas. Then it was as the evening before. His difficulties vanished in the items he so well loved to read.

They had an arrangement by which he placed twelve dollars a week in her hands, out of which to pay current expenses. He heaved a little sigh as she said this, and drew out his purse. Again he felt the dread of the thing. Here he was taking off, taking off, and nothing coming in. \u201cLord!\u201d he said, in his own thoughts, \u201cthis can\u2019t go on.\u201d To Carrie he said nothing whatsoever.

He was cold after his twenty blocks\u2019 walk. \u201cI\u2019ll go in their barber shop and get a shave,\u201d he thought. Thus he justified himself in sitting down in here after his tonsorial treatment.

From out the front windows one could see a deep, soft bedding. \u201cI guess I\u2019ll not try to go out to-day,\u201d he said to Carrie at breakfast. \u201cIt\u2019s going to be awful bad, so the papers say.\u201d \u201cThe man hasn\u2019t brought my coal, either,\u201d said Carrie, who ordered by the bushel. \u201cI\u2019ll go over and see about it,\u201d said Hurstwood.

Great attention was given to the details of the storm by the newspapers, which played up the distress of the poor in large type. Hurstwood sat and read by his radiator in the corner. He did not try to think about his need of work. This storm being so terrific, and tying up all things, robbed him of the need. He made himself wholly comfortable and toasted his feet. Carrie observed his ease with some misgiving. For all the fury of the storm she doubted his comfort. He took his situation too philosophically."}, {"size": 649, "text": "Hurstwood, however, read on and on. He did not pay much attention to Carrie. She fulfilled her household duties and said little to disturb him. The next day it was still snowing, and the next, bitter cold. Hurstwood took the alarm of the paper and sat still. Now he volunteered to do a few other little things. One was to go to the butcher, another to the grocery. He really thought nothing of these little services in connection with their true significance. He felt as if he were not wholly useless\u2014indeed, in such a stress of weather, quite worth while about the house. On the fourth day, however, it cleared, and he read that the storm was over."}, {"size": 672, "text": "Now, however, he idled, thinking how sloppy the streets would be. It was noon before he finally abandoned his papers and got under way. Owing to the slightly warmer temperature the streets were bad.

When he reached the Broadway Central, however, he changed his mind. \u201cWhat\u2019s the use?\u201d he thought, looking out upon the slop and snow. \u201cI couldn\u2019t buy into it.

Hurstwood recognised Cargill, the owner of the large stables in Chicago of the same name, whom he had last seen at Avery Hall, the night Carrie appeared there. The remembrance of how this individual brought up his wife to shake hands on that occasion was also on the instant clear. Hurstwood was greatly abashed.

I was wondering what had become of you.\u201d \u201cOh, I\u2019m here now,\u201d answered Hurstwood, anxious to get away. \u201cDoing well, I suppose?\u201d"}, {"size": 637, "text": "They looked at one another, rather embarrassed. \u201cWell, I have an engagement with a friend upstairs.

His watch only registered 1.30. He tried to think of some place to go or something to do. The day was so bad he wanted only to be inside. Finally his feet began to feel wet and cold, and he boarded a car. This took him to Fifty-ninth Street, which was as good as anywhere else. Landed here, he turned to walk back along Seventh Avenue, but the slush was too much."}, {"size": 603, "text": "The misery of lounging about with nowhere to go became intolerable. He felt as if he were catching cold. Stopping at a corner, he waited for a car south bound. This was no day to be out; he would go home. Carrie was surprised to see him at a quarter of three. \u201cIt\u2019s a miserable day out,\u201d was all he said. Then he took off his coat and changed his shoes. That night he felt a cold coming on and took quinine. He was feverish until morning, and sat about the next day while Carrie waited on him. He was a helpless creature in sickness, not very handsome in a dull-coloured bath gown and his hair uncombed."}, {"size": 634, "text": "He looked haggard about the eyes and quite old. Carrie noticed this, and it did not appeal to her. She wanted to be good-natured and sympathetic, but something about the man held her aloof.

I\u2019ll open your bed for you now.\u201d \u201cAll right,\u201d he said. As she did all these things, she was in a most despondent state. \u201cWhat a life! What a life!\u201d was her one thought. Once during the day, when he sat near the radiator, hunched up and reading, she passed through, and seeing him, wrinkled her brows."}, {"size": 619, "text": "In the front room, where it was not so warm, she sat by the window and cried. This was the life cut out for her, was it? To live cooped up in a small flat with some one who was out of work, idle, and indifferent to her. She was merely a servant to him now, nothing more. This crying made her eyes red, and when, in preparing his bed, she lighted the gas, and, having prepared it, called him in, he noticed the fact. \u201cWhat\u2019s the matter with you?\u201d he asked, looking into her face. His voice was hoarse and his unkempt head only added to its grewsome quality. \u201cNothing,\u201d said Carrie, weakly. \u201cYou\u2019ve been crying,\u201d he said."}, {"size": 649, "text": "\u201cI haven\u2019t, either,\u201d she answered.

The Italian newsdealer now delivered the morning papers, and these he read assiduously. A few times after that he ventured out, but meeting another of his old-time friends, he began to feel uneasy sitting about hotel corridors. Every day he came home early, and at last made no pretence of going anywhere. Winter was no time to look for anything. Naturally, being about the house, he noticed the way Carrie did things."}, {"size": 694, "text": "She was far from perfect in household methods and economy, and her little deviations on this score first caught his eye. Not, however, before her regular demand for her allowance became a grievous thing. Sitting around as he did, the weeks seemed to pass very quickly. Every Tuesday Carrie asked for her money. \u201cDo you think we live as cheaply as we might?\u201d he asked one Tuesday morning. \u201cI do the best I can,\u201d said Carrie. Nothing was added to this at the moment, but the next day he said: \u201cDo you ever go to the Gansevoort Market over here?\u201d \u201cI didn\u2019t know there was such a market,\u201d said Carrie. \u201cThey say you can get things lots cheaper there.\u201d Carrie was very indifferent to the suggestion."}, {"size": 602, "text": "These were things which she did not like at all. \u201cHow much do you pay for a pound of meat?\u201d he asked one day. \u201cOh, there are different prices,\u201d said Carrie. \u201cSirloin steak is twenty-two cents.\u201d \u201cThat\u2019s steep, isn\u2019t it?\u201d he answered. So he asked about other things, until finally, with the passing days, it seemed to become a mania with him. He learned the prices and remembered them. His errand-running capacity also improved. It began in a small way, of course. Carrie, going to get her hat one morning, was stopped by him. \u201cWhere are you going, Carrie?\u201d he asked. \u201cOver to the baker\u2019s,\u201d she answered."}, {"size": 657, "text": "\u201cI\u2019d just as leave go for you,\u201d he said.

Doing this, however, she lost the weekly payment of twelve dollars. \u201cYou want to pay me to-day,\u201d she said one Tuesday, about this time. \u201cHow much?\u201d he asked. She understood well enough what it meant. \u201cWell, about five dollars,\u201d she answered. \u201cI owe the coal man.\u201d The same day he said: \u201cI think this Italian up here on the corner sells coal at twenty-five cents a bushel.

They blackened her days and grieved her soul. Oh, how this man had changed! All day and all day, here he sat, reading his papers. The world seemed to have no attraction. Once in a while he would go out, in fine weather, it might be four or five hours, between eleven and four."}, {"size": 649, "text": "She could do nothing but view him with gnawing contempt. It was apathy with Hurstwood, resulting from his inability to see his way out. Each month drew from his small store. Now, he had only five hundred dollars left, and this he hugged, half feeling as if he could stave off absolute necessity for an indefinite period. Sitting around the house, he decided to wear some old clothes he had. This came first with the bad days. Only once he apologised in the very beginning: \u201cIt\u2019s so bad to-day, I\u2019ll just wear these around.\u201d Eventually these became the permanent thing. Also, he had been wont to pay fifteen cents for a shave, and a tip of ten cents."}, {"size": 674, "text": "In his first distress, he cut down the tip to five, then to nothing. Later, he tried a ten-cent barber shop, and, finding that the shave was satisfactory, patronised regularly. Later still, he put off shaving to every other day, then to every third, and so on, until once a week became the rule. On Saturday he was a sight to see. Of course, as his own self-respect vanished, it perished for him in Carrie. She could not understand what had gotten into the man. He had some money, he had a decent suit remaining, he was not bad looking when dressed up. She did not forget her own difficult struggle in Chicago, but she did not forget either that she had never ceased trying."}, {"size": 615, "text": "He never tried. He did not even consult the ads in the papers any more. Finally, a distinct impression escaped from her. \u201cWhat makes you put so much butter on the steak?\u201d he asked her one evening, standing around in the kitchen. \u201cTo make it good, of course,\u201d she answered. \u201cButter is awful dear these days,\u201d he suggested. \u201cYou wouldn\u2019t mind it if you were working,\u201d she answered. He shut up after this, and went in to his paper, but the retort rankled in his mind. It was the first cutting remark that had come from her. That same evening, Carrie, after reading, went off to the front room to bed. This was unusual."}, {"size": 679, "text": "When Hurstwood decided to go, he retired, as usual, without a light.

In the morning she was not beside him. Strange to say, this passed without comment. Night approaching, and a slightly more conversational feeling prevailing, Carrie said: \u201cI think I\u2019ll sleep alone to-night. I have a headache.\u201d \u201cAll right,\u201d said Hurstwood. The third night she went to her front bed without apologies. This was a grim blow to Hurstwood, but he never mentioned it. \u201cAll right,\u201d he said to himself, with an irrepressible frown, \u201clet her sleep alone.\u201d"}, {"size": 697, "text": "Chapter XXXVI.

True to her nature, she corresponded with Mrs. Vance as long as she still lived in Seventy-eighth Street, but when she was compelled to move into Thirteenth, her fear that the latter would take it as an indication of reduced circumstances caused her to study some way of avoiding the necessity of giving her address.

There was a better hand across the table, held by a pugnacious Irish youth, who was a political hanger-on of the Tammany district in which they were located. Hurstwood was surprised at the persistence of this individual, whose bets came with a _sang-froid_ which, if a bluff, was excellent art.

She knew there was no need of calling there now. He would not be in. Nothing remained but to employ the intermediate hours in search. The dismal story of ventures in other places is quickly told. Mr. Daly saw no one save by appointment. Carrie waited an hour in a dingy office, quite in spite of obstacles, to learn this fact of the placid, indifferent Mr. Dorney. \u201cYou will have to write and ask him to see you.\u201d At the Empire Theatre she found a hive of peculiarly listless and indifferent individuals."}, {"size": 691, "text": "Everything ornately upholstered, everything carefully finished, everything remarkably reserved.

Tell us what it is you require. Tell it quickly, nervously, and without a vestige of self-respect.

She might be put in even if she did not have any experience. One of the proprietors had suggested that the chorus was a little weak on looks. The first of next week was some days off yet.

This was a bitter thought. Carrie came in after he did. \u201cI went to see some of the variety managers,\u201d she said, aimlessly. \u201cYou have to have an act. They don\u2019t want anybody that hasn\u2019t.\u201d \u201cI saw some of the brewery people to-day,\u201d said Hurstwood. \u201cOne man told me he\u2019d try to make a place for me in two or three weeks.\u201d In the face of so much distress on Carrie\u2019s part, he had to make some showing, and it was thus he did so."}, {"size": 628, "text": "It was lassitude\u2019s apology to energy.

Carrie owned to ignorance. He looked her over again as he stirred among some papers. He was secretly pleased with this pretty, disturbed-looking young woman. \u201cCome around to the theatre to-morrow morning.\u201d Carrie\u2019s heart bounded to her throat. \u201cI will,\u201d she said with difficulty.

She did not quarrel now with Hurstwood\u2019s idleness. She had a place\u2014she had a place! This sang in her ears. In her delight she was almost anxious to tell Hurstwood.

At last Hurstwood said: \u201cDo you know how much you\u2019ll get?\u201d \u201cNo, I didn\u2019t want to ask,\u201d said Carrie. \u201cI guess they pay twelve or fourteen dollars a week.\u201d \u201cAbout that, I guess,\u201d said Hurstwood.

On the morrow Carrie reported promptly and was given a place in the line. She saw a large, empty, shadowy play-house, still redolent of the perfumes and blazonry of the night, and notable for its rich, oriental appearance. The wonder of it awed and delighted her.

As the drilling proceeded, he seemed to wax exceedingly wroth over trifles, and to increase his lung power in proportion. It was very evident that he had a great contempt for any assumption of dignity or innocence on the part of these young women. \u201cClark,\u201d he would call\u2014meaning, of course, Miss Clark\u2014\u201cwhy don\u2019t you catch step there?\u201d \u201cBy fours, right!"}, {"size": 382, "text": "Right, I said, right!

How would it do if we had liver and bacon?\u201d \u201cSuits me,\u201d said Hurstwood. \u201cBetter get a half or three-quarters of a pound of that.\u201d \u201cHalf \u2019ll be enough,\u201d volunteered Hurstwood. She opened her purse and laid down a half dollar. He pretended not to notice it. Hurstwood bought the flour\u2014which all grocers sold in 3\u00bd-pound packages\u2014for thirteen cents and paid fifteen cents for a half-pound of liver and bacon."}, {"size": 600, "text": "He left the packages, together with the balance of twenty-two cents, upon the kitchen table, where Carrie found it. It did not escape her that the change was accurate. There was something sad in realising that, after all, all that he wanted of her was something to eat. She felt as if hard thoughts were unjust. Maybe he would get something yet. He had no vices. That very evening, however, on going into the theatre, one of the chorus girls passed her all newly arrayed in a pretty mottled tweed suit, which took Carrie\u2019s eye. The young woman wore a fine bunch of violets and seemed in high spirits."}, {"size": 668, "text": "She smiled at Carrie good-naturedly as she passed, showing pretty, even teeth, and Carrie smiled back. \u201cShe can afford to dress well,\u201d thought Carrie, \u201cand so could I, if I could only keep my money. I haven\u2019t a decent tie of any kind to wear.\u201d She put out her foot and looked at her shoe reflectively. \u201cI\u2019ll get a pair of shoes Saturday, anyhow; I don\u2019t care what happens.\u201d One of the sweetest and most sympathetic little chorus girls in the company made friends with her because in Carrie she found nothing to frighten her away.

She also carried a shining shield. \u201cYes; it is,\u201d said Carrie, pleased that some one should talk to her. \u201cI\u2019m almost roasting,\u201d said the girl. Carrie looked into her pretty face, with its large blue eyes, and saw little beads of moisture. \u201cThere\u2019s more marching in this opera than ever I did before,\u201d added the girl. \u201cHave you been in others?\u201d asked Carrie, surprised at her experience."}, {"size": 699, "text": "\u201cLots of them,\u201d said the girl; \u201chaven\u2019t you?\u201d \u201cThis is my first experience.\u201d \u201cOh, is it?

Still, in the morning, when her household duties would infringe upon her and Hurstwood sat there, a perfect load to contemplate, her fate seemed dismal and unrelieved.

This entanglement made Carrie anxious for a change of some sort. Hurstwood did not seem to realise that she had a right to anything. He schemed to make what she earned cover all expenses, but seemed not to trouble over adding anything himself. \u201cHe talks about worrying,\u201d thought Carrie."}, {"size": 699, "text": "\u201cIf he worried enough he couldn\u2019t sit there and wait for me.

Twice a week there were matin\u00e9es, and then Hurstwood ate a cold snack, which he prepared himself. Two other days there were rehearsals beginning at ten in the morning and lasting usually until one. Now, to this Carrie added a few visits to one or two chorus girls, including the blue-eyed soldier of the golden helmet.

She had talked so much about getting more salary and confessed to so much anxiety about her future, that now, when the direct question of fact was waiting, she could not tell this girl. \u201cWith some relatives,\u201d she answered. Miss Osborne took it for granted that, like herself, Carrie\u2019s time was her own. She invariably asked her to stay, proposing little outings and other things of that sort until Carrie began neglecting her dinner hours.

Miss Osborne and she had gone to the office of the manager who was to produce the new opera at the Broadway and returned straight to the former\u2019s room, where they had been since three o\u2019clock.

He could not help clinging and protesting in a mild, irritating, and ineffectual way, however\u2014a way that simply widened the breach by slow degrees.

She forgot that if she were alone she would have to pay for a room and board, and imagined that every cent of her eighteen could be spent for clothes and things that she liked. At last she picked upon something, which not only used up all her surplus above twelve, but invaded that sum.

There had been appearing in the papers about this time rumours and notices of an approaching strike on the trolley lines in Brooklyn. There was general dissatisfaction as to the hours of labour required and the wages paid. As usual\u2014and for some inexplicable reason\u2014the men chose the winter for the forcing of the hand of their employers and the settlement of their difficulties.

On a cold afternoon, when everything was grey and it threatened to snow, the papers announced that the men had been called out on all the lines. Being so utterly idle, and his mind filled with the numerous predictions which had been made concerning the scarcity of labour this winter and the panicky state of the financial market, Hurstwood read this with interest. He noted the claims of the striking motormen and conductors, who said that they had been wont to receive two dollars a day in times past, but that for a year or more \u201ctrippers\u201d had been introduced, which cut down their chance of livelihood one-half, and increased their hours of servitude from ten to twelve, and even fourteen."}, {"size": 714, "text": "These \u201ctrippers\u201d were men put on during the busy and _rush_ hours, to take a car out for one trip.

He must come to the barns in the morning and wait around in fair and foul weather until such time as he was needed. Two trips were an average reward for so much waiting\u2014a little over three hours\u2019 work for fifty cents. The work of waiting was not counted.

More than once he stopped and looked at these, gazing at the pretty face in a sullen sort of way. His clothes were shabby, and he presented a marked contrast to all that she now seemed to be. Somehow, so long as he knew she was at the Casino, though he had never any intention of going near her, there was a subconscious comfort for him\u2014he was not quite alone. The show seemed such a fixture that, after a month or two, he began to take it for granted that it was still running. In September it went on the road and he did not notice it."}, {"size": 646, "text": "When all but twenty dollars of his money was gone, he moved to a fifteen-cent lodging-house in the Bowery, where there was a bare lounging-room filled with tables and benches as well as some chairs. Here his preference was to close his eyes and dream of other days, a habit which grew upon him. It was not sleep at first, but a mental hearkening back to scenes and incidents in his Chicago life. As the present became darker, the past grew brighter, and all that concerned it stood in relief. He was unconscious of just how much this habit had hold of him until one day he found his lips repeating an old answer he had made to one of his friends."}, {"size": 659, "text": "They were in Fitzgerald and Moy\u2019s.

He wondered whether he had really spoken. The next time he noticed anything of the sort he really did talk. \u201cWhy don\u2019t you jump, you bloody fool?\u201d he was saying. \u201cJump!\u201d It was a funny English story he was telling to a company of actors."}, {"size": 607, "text": "Even as his voice recalled him, he was smiling. A crusty old codger, sitting near by, seemed disturbed; at least, he stared in a most pointed way. Hurstwood straightened up. The humour of the memory fled in an instant and he felt ashamed.

Instantly, he came to a mental halt. Carrie had gone! He remembered seeing a poster of her only yesterday, but no doubt it was one left uncovered by the new signs.

He wondered how this important fact had skipped him. Goodness knows when she would be back now. Impelled by a nervous fear, he rose and went into the dingy hall, where he counted his remaining money, unseen. There were but ten dollars in all. He wondered how all these other lodging-house people around him got along. They didn\u2019t seem to do anything. Perhaps they begged\u2014unquestionably they did. Many was the dime he had given to such as they in his day. He had seen other men asking for money on the streets."}, {"size": 632, "text": "Maybe he could get some that way. There was horror in this thought. Sitting in the lodging-house room, he came to his last fifty cents. He had saved and counted until his health was affected. His stoutness had gone.

Now he decided he must do something, and, walking about, saw another day go by, bringing him down to his last twenty cents\u2014not enough to eat for the morrow.

This simple announcement was modest in the extreme, covering, as it did, a charity so broad."}, {"size": 618, "text": "Institutions and charities are so large and so numerous in New York that such things as this are not often noticed by the more comfortably situated. But to one whose mind is upon the matter, they grow exceedingly under inspection. Unless one were looking up this matter in particular, he could have stood at Sixth Avenue and Fifteenth Street for days around the noon hour and never have noticed that out of the vast crowd that surged along that busy thoroughfare there turned out, every few seconds, some weather-beaten, heavy-footed specimen of humanity, gaunt in countenance and dilapidated in the matter of clothes."}, {"size": 719, "text": "The fact is none the less true, however, and the colder the day the more apparent it became. Space and a lack of culinary room in the mission-house, compelled an arrangement which permitted of only twenty-five or thirty eating at one time, so that a line had to be formed outside and an orderly entrance effected. This caused a daily spectacle which, however, had become so common by repetition during a number of years that now nothing was thought of it. The men waited patiently, like cattle, in the coldest weather\u2014waited for several hours before they could be admitted. No questions were asked and no service rendered. They ate and went away again, some of them returning regularly day after day the winter through."}, {"size": 663, "text": "A big, motherly looking woman invariably stood guard at the door during the entire operation and counted the admissible number. The men moved up in solemn order. There was no haste and no eagerness displayed. It was almost a dumb procession. In the bitterest weather this line was to be found here. Under an icy wind there was a prodigious slapping of hands and a dancing of feet. Fingers and the features of the face looked as if severely nipped by the cold. A study of these men in broad light proved them to be nearly all of a type. They belonged to the class that sit on the park benches during the endurable days and sleep upon them during the summer nights."}, {"size": 828, "text": "They frequent the Bowery and those down-at-the-heels East Side streets where poor clothes and shrunken features are not singled out as curious. They are the men who are in the lodging-house sitting-rooms during bleak and bitter weather and who swarm about the cheaper shelters which only open at six in a number of the lower East Side streets. Miserable food, ill-timed and greedily eaten, had played havoc with bone and muscle. They were all pale, flabby, sunken-eyed, hollow-chested, with eyes that glinted and shone and lips that were a sickly red by contrast. Their hair was but half attended to, their ears an\u00e6mic in hue, and their shoes broken in leather and run down at heel and toe. They were of the class which simply floats and drifts, every wave of people washing up one, as breakers do driftwood upon a stormy shore."}, {"size": 691, "text": "For nearly a quarter of a century, in another section of the city, Fleischmann, the baker, had given a loaf of bread to any one who would come for it to the side door of his restaurant at the corner of Broadway and Tenth Street, at midnight. Every night during twenty years about three hundred men had formed in line and at the appointed time marched past the doorway, picked their loaf from a great box placed just outside, and vanished again into the night. From the beginning to the present time there had been little change in the character or number of these men. There were two or three figures that had grown familiar to those who had seen this little procession pass year after year."}, {"size": 750, "text": "Two of them had missed scarcely a night in fifteen years. There were about forty, more or less, regular callers. The remainder of the line was formed of strangers. In times of panic and unusual hardships there were seldom more than three hundred. In times of prosperity, when little is heard of the unemployed, there were seldom less. The same number, winter and summer, in storm or calm, in good times and bad, held this melancholy midnight rendezvous at Fleischmann\u2019s bread box. At both of these two charities, during the severe winter which was now on, Hurstwood was a frequent visitor. On one occasion it was peculiarly cold, and finding no comfort in begging about the streets, he waited until noon before seeking this free offering to the poor."}, {"size": 639, "text": "Already, at eleven o\u2019clock of this morning, several such as he had shambled forward out of Sixth Avenue, their thin clothes flapping and fluttering in the wind. They leaned against the iron railing which protects the walls of the Ninth Regiment Armory, which fronts upon that section of Fifteenth Street, having come early in order to be first in. Having an hour to wait, they at first lingered at a respectful distance; but others coming up, they moved closer in order to protect their right of precedence. To this collection Hurstwood came up from the west out of Seventh Avenue and stopped close to the door, nearer than all the others."}, {"size": 602, "text": "Those who had been waiting before him, but farther away, now drew near, and by a certain stolidity of demeanour, no words being spoken, indicated that they were first. Seeing the opposition to his action, he looked sullenly along the line, then moved out, taking his place at the foot. When order had been restored, the animal feeling of opposition relaxed. \u201cMust be pretty near noon,\u201d ventured one. \u201cIt is,\u201d said another. \u201cI\u2019ve been waiting nearly an hour.\u201d \u201cGee, but it\u2019s cold!\u201d They peered eagerly at the door, where all must enter. A grocery man drove up and carried in several baskets of eatables."}, {"size": 643, "text": "This started some words upon grocery men and the cost of food in general. \u201cI see meat\u2019s gone up,\u201d said one. \u201cIf there wuz war, it would help this country a lot.\u201d The line was growing rapidly. Already there were fifty or more, and those at the head, by their demeanour, evidently congratulated themselves upon not having so long to wait as those at the foot. There was much jerking of heads, and looking down the line. \u201cIt don\u2019t matter how near you get to the front, so long as you\u2019re in the first twenty-five,\u201d commented one of the first twenty-five. \u201cYou all go in together.\u201d \u201cHumph!\u201d ejaculated Hurstwood, who had been so sturdily displaced."}, {"size": 693, "text": "\u201cThis here Single Tax is the thing,\u201d said another. \u201cThere ain\u2019t going to be no order till it comes.\u201d For the most part there was silence; gaunt men shuffling, glancing, and beating their arms. At last the door opened and the motherly-looking sister appeared. She only looked an order. Slowly the line moved up and, one by one, passed in, until twenty-five were counted. Then she interposed a stout arm, and the line halted, with six men on the steps. Of these the ex-manager was one. Waiting thus, some talked, some ejaculated concerning the misery of it; some brooded, as did Hurstwood. At last he was admitted, and, having eaten, came away, almost angered because of his pains in getting it."}, {"size": 666, "text": "At eleven o\u2019clock of another evening, perhaps two weeks later, he was at the midnight offering of a loaf\u2014waiting patiently. It had been an unfortunate day with him, but now he took his fate with a touch of philosophy. If he could secure no supper, or was hungry late in the evening, here was a place he could come. A few minutes before twelve, a great box of bread was pushed out, and exactly on the hour a portly, round-faced German took position by it, calling \u201cReady.\u201d The whole line at once moved forward each taking his loaf in turn and going his separate way. On this occasion, the ex-manager ate his as he went plodding the dark streets in silence to his bed."}, {"size": 744, "text": "By January he had about concluded that the game was up with him. Life had always seemed a precious thing, but now constant want and weakened vitality had made the charms of earth rather dull and inconspicuous. Several times, when fortune pressed most harshly, he thought he would end his troubles; but with a change of weather, or the arrival of a quarter or a dime, his mood would change, and he would wait. Each day he would find some old paper lying about and look into it, to see if there was any trace of Carrie, but all summer and fall he had looked in vain. Then he noticed that his eyes were beginning to hurt him, and this ailment rapidly increased until, in the dark chambers of the lodgings he frequented, he did not attempt to read."}, {"size": 691, "text": "Bad and irregular eating was weakening every function of his body. The one recourse left him was to doze when a place offered and he could get the money to occupy it. He was beginning to find, in his wretched clothing and meagre state of body, that people took him for a chronic type of bum and beggar. Police hustled him along, restaurant and lodging-house keepers turned him out promptly the moment he had his due; pedestrians waved him off. He found it more and more difficult to get anything from anybody. At last he admitted to himself that the game was up. It was after a long series of appeals to pedestrians, in which he had been refused and refused\u2014every one hastening from contact."}, {"size": 717, "text": "\u201cGive me a little something, will you, mister?\u201d he said to the last one. \u201cFor God\u2019s sake, do; I\u2019m starving.\u201d \u201cAw, get out,\u201d said the man, who happened to be a common type himself. \u201cYou\u2019re no good. I\u2019ll give you nawthin\u2019.\u201d Hurstwood put his hands, red from cold, down in his pockets. Tears came into his eyes. \u201cThat\u2019s right,\u201d he said; \u201cI\u2019m no good now. I was all right. I had money. I\u2019m going to quit this,\u201d and, with death in his heart, he started down toward the Bowery. People had turned on the gas before and died; why shouldn\u2019t he? He remembered a lodging-house where there were little, close rooms, with gas-jets in them, almost pre-arranged, he thought, for what he wanted to do, which rented for fifteen cents."}, {"size": 702, "text": "Then he remembered that he had no fifteen cents. On the way he met a comfortable-looking gentleman, coming, clean-shaven, out of a fine barber shop. \u201cWould you mind giving me a little something?\u201d he asked this man boldly. The gentleman looked him over and fished for a dime. Nothing but quarters were in his pocket. \u201cHere,\u201d he said, handing him one, to be rid of him. \u201cBe off, now.\u201d Hurstwood moved on, wondering. The sight of the large, bright coin pleased him a little. He remembered that he was hungry and that he could get a bed for ten cents. With this, the idea of death passed, for the time being, out of his mind. It was only when he could get nothing but insults that death seemed worth while."}, {"size": 646, "text": "One day, in the middle of the winter, the sharpest spell of the season set in. It broke grey and cold in the first day, and on the second snowed. Poor luck pursuing him, he had secured but ten cents by nightfall, and this he had spent for food. At evening he found himself at the Boulevard and Sixty-seventh Street, where he finally turned his face Bowery-ward. Especially fatigued because of the wandering propensity which had seized him in the morning, he now half dragged his wet feet, shuffling the soles upon the sidewalk. An old, thin coat was turned up about his red ears\u2014his cracked derby hat was pulled down until it turned them outward."}, {"size": 608, "text": "His hands were in his pockets. \u201cI\u2019ll just go down Broadway,\u201d he said to himself. When he reached Forty-second Street, the fire signs were already blazing brightly. Crowds were hastening to dine. Through bright windows, at every corner, might be seen gay companies in luxuriant restaurants. There were coaches and crowded cable cars. In his weary and hungry state, he should never have come here. The contrast was too sharp. Even he was recalled keenly to better things. \u201cWhat\u2019s the use?\u201d he thought. \u201cIt\u2019s all up with me. I\u2019ll quit this.\u201d People turned to look after him, so uncouth was his shambling figure."}, {"size": 609, "text": "Several officers followed him with their eyes, to see that he did not beg of anybody. Once he paused in an aimless, incoherent sort of way and looked through the windows of an imposing restaurant, before which blazed a fire sign, and through the large, plate windows of which could be seen the red and gold decorations, the palms, the white napery, and shining glassware, and, above all, the comfortable crowd. Weak as his mind had become, his hunger was sharp enough to show the importance of this. He stopped stock still, his frayed trousers soaking in the slush, and peered foolishly in. \u201cEat,\u201d he mumbled."}, {"size": 636, "text": "\u201cThat\u2019s right, eat. Nobody else wants any.\u201d Then his voice dropped even lower, and his mind half lost the fancy it had. \u201cIt\u2019s mighty cold,\u201d he said. \u201cAwful cold.\u201d At Broadway and Thirty-ninth Street was blazing, in incandescent fire, Carrie\u2019s name. \u201cCarrie Madenda,\u201d it read, \u201cand the Casino Company.\u201d All the wet, snowy sidewalk was bright with this radiated fire. It was so bright that it attracted Hurstwood\u2019s gaze. He looked up, and then at a large, gilt-framed posterboard, on which was a fine lithograph of Carrie, lifesize. Hurstwood gazed at it a moment, snuffling and hunching one shoulder, as if something were scratching him."}, {"size": 619, "text": "He was so run down, however, that his mind was not exactly clear. He approached that entrance and went in. \u201cWell?\u201d said the attendant, staring at him.

Hurstwood had no strength to resist. \u201cI want to see Miss Madenda,\u201d he tried to explain, even as he was being hustled away. \u201cI\u2019m all right.

The streets were bedded with it\u2014six inches of cold, soft carpet, churned to a dirty brown by the crush of teams and the feet of men. Along Broadway men picked their way in ulsters and umbrellas. Along the Bowery, men slouched through it with collars and hats pulled over their ears. In the former thoroughfare businessmen and travellers were making for comfortable hotels.

It was so strong, and Ames\u2019s mere recommendation had so aroused her interest, that she caught nearly the full sympathetic significance of it.

There was a face in the thick of the collection which was as white as drained veal. There was another red as brick.

Ever hearkening to the sound of beauty, straining for the flash of its distant wings, he watches to follow, wearying his feet in travelling."}, {"size": 603, "text": "So watched Carrie, so followed, rocking and singing. And it must be remembered that reason had little part in this. Chicago dawning, she saw the city offering more of loveliness than she had ever known, and instinctively, by force of her moods alone, clung to it. In fine raiment and elegant surroundings, men seemed to be contented. Hence, she drew near these things. Chicago, New York; Drouet, Hurstwood; the world of fashion and the world of stage\u2014these were but incidents. Not them, but that which they represented, she longed for. Time proved the representation false. Oh, the tangle of human life!"}, {"size": 696, "text": "How dimly as yet we see. Here was Carrie, in the beginning poor, unsophisticated, emotional; responding with desire to everything most lovely in life, yet finding herself turned as by a wall. Laws to say: \u201cBe allured, if you will, by everything lovely, but draw not nigh unless by righteousness.\u201d Convention to say: \u201cYou shall not better your situation save by honest labour.\u201d If honest labour be unremunerative and difficult to endure; if it be the long, long road which never reaches beauty, but wearies the feet and the heart; if the drag to follow beauty be such that one abandons the admired way, taking rather the despised path leading to her dreams quickly, who shall cast the first stone?"}, {"size": 644, "text": "Not evil, but longing for that which is better, more often directs the steps of the erring. Not evil, but goodness more often allures the feeling mind unused to reason. Amid the tinsel and shine of her state walked Carrie, unhappy. As when Drouet took her, she had thought: \u201cNow I am lifted into that which is best\u201d; as when Hurstwood seemingly offered her the better way: \u201cNow am I happy.\u201d But since the world goes its way past all who will not partake of its folly, she now found herself alone. Her purse was open to him whose need was greatest. In her walks on Broadway, she no longer thought of the elegance of the creatures who passed her."}, {"size": 744, "text": "Had they more of that peace and beauty which glimmered afar off, then were they to be envied. Drouet abandoned his claim and was seen no more. Of Hurstwood\u2019s death she was not even aware. A slow, black boat setting out from the pier at Twenty-seventh Street upon its weekly errand bore, with many others, his nameless body to the Potter\u2019s Field. Thus passed all that was of interest concerning these twain in their relation to her. Their influence upon her life is explicable alone by the nature of her longings. Time was when both represented for her all that was most potent in earthly success. They were the personal representatives of a state most blessed to attain\u2014the titled ambassadors of comfort and peace, aglow with their credentials."}, {"size": 787, "text": "It is but natural that when the world which they represented no longer allured her, its ambassadors should be discredited. Even had Hurstwood returned in his original beauty and glory, he could not now have allured her. She had learned that in his world, as in her own present state, was not happiness. Sitting alone, she was now an illustration of the devious ways by which one who feels, rather than reasons, may be led in the pursuit of beauty. Though often disillusioned, she was still waiting for that halcyon day when she would be led forth among dreams become real. Ames had pointed out a farther step, but on and on beyond that, if accomplished, would lie others for her. It was forever to be the pursuit of that radiance of delight which tints the distant hilltops of the world."}, {"size": 639, "text": "Oh, Carrie, Carrie! Oh, blind strivings of the human heart! Onward onward, it saith, and where beauty leads, there it follows. Whether it be the tinkle of a lone sheep bell o\u2019er some quiet landscape, or the glimmer of beauty in sylvan places, or the show of soul in some passing eye, the heart knows and makes answer, following. It is when the feet weary and hope seems vain that the heartaches and the longings arise. Know, then, that for you is neither surfeit nor content. In your rocking-chair, by your window dreaming, shall you long, alone. In your rocking-chair, by your window, shall you dream such happiness as you may never feel."}]}
