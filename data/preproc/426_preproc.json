He was of a fat habit, even from boyhood, and inclined to a cheerful and cursory reading of the face of life; and possibly this attitude of mind was the original cause of his misfortunes. Beyond this hint philosophy is silent on his career, and superstition steps in with the more ready explanation that he was detested of the gods.His father\u2014that iron gentleman\u2014had long ago enthroned himself on the heights of the Disruption Principles."}, {"size": 702, "text": "What these are (and in spite of their grim name they are quite innocent) no array of terms would render thinkable to the merely English intelligence; but to the Scot they often prove unctuously nourishing, and Mr. Nicholson found in them the milk of lions. About the period when the churches convene at Edinburgh in their annual assemblies, he was to be seen descending the Mound in the company of divers red-headed clergymen: these voluble, he only contributing oracular nods, brief negatives, and the austere spectacle of his stretched upper lip. The names of Candlish and Begg were frequent in these interviews, and occasionally the talk ran on the Residuary Establishment and the doings of one Lee."}, {"size": 650, "text": "A stranger to the tight little theological kingdom of Scotland might have listened and gathered literally nothing. And Mr. Nicholson (who was not a dull man) knew this, and raged at it. He knew there was a vast world outside, to whom Disruption Principles were as the chatter of tree-top apes; the paper brought him chill whiffs from it; he had met Englishmen who had asked lightly if he did not belong to the Church of Scotland, and then had failed to be much interested by his elucidation of that nice point; it was an evil, wild, rebellious world, lying sunk in _dozenedness_, for nothing short of a Scots word will paint this Scotsman\u2019s feelings."}, {"size": 786, "text": "And when he entered into his own house in Randolph Crescent (south side), and shut the door behind him, his heart swelled with security. Here, at least, was a citadel impregnable by right-hand defections or left-hand extremes. Here was a family where prayers came at the same hour, where the Sabbath literature was unimpeachably selected, where the guest who should have leaned to any false opinion was instantly set down, and over which there reigned all week, and grew denser on Sundays, a silence that was agreeable to his ear, and a gloom that he found comfortable. Mrs. Nicholson had died about thirty, and left him with three children: a daughter two years, and a son about eight years younger than John; and John himself, the unlucky bearer of a name infamous in English history."}, {"size": 750, "text": "The daughter, Maria, was a good girl\u2014dutiful, pious, dull, but so easily startled that to speak to her was quite a perilous enterprise. \u2018I don\u2019t think I care to talk about that, if you please,\u2019 she would say, and strike the boldest speechless by her unmistakable pain; this upon all topics\u2014dress, pleasure, morality, politics, in which the formula was changed to \u2018my papa thinks otherwise,\u2019 and even religion, unless it was approached with a particular whining tone of voice.

Mr. Nicholson himself had a great fund of humour, of the Scots order\u2014intellectual, turning on the observation of men; his own character, for instance\u2014if he could have seen it in another\u2014would have been a rare feast to him; but his son\u2019s empty guffaws over a broken plate, and empty, almost light-hearted remarks, struck him with pain as the indices of a weak mind. Outside the family John had early attached himself (much as a dog may follow a marquis) to the steps of Alan Houston, a lad about a year older than himself, idle, a"}, {"size": 720, "text": "trifle wild, the heir to a good estate which was still in the hands of a rigorous trustee, and so royally content with himself that he took John\u2019s devotion as a thing of course. The intimacy was gall to Mr. Nicholson; it took his son from the house, and he was a jealous parent; it kept him from the office, and he was a martinet; lastly, Mr. Nicholson was ambitious for his family (in which, and the Disruption Principles, he entirely lived), and he hated to see a son of his play second fiddle to an idler. After some hesitation, he ordered that the friendship should cease\u2014an unfair command, though seemingly inspired by the spirit of prophecy; and John, saying nothing, continued to disobey the order under the rose."}, {"size": 703, "text": "John was nearly nineteen when he was one day dismissed rather earlier than usual from his father\u2019s office, where he was studying the practice of the law. It was Saturday; and except that he had a matter of four hundred pounds in his pocket which it was his duty to hand over to the British Linen Company\u2019s Bank, he had the whole afternoon at his disposal. He went by Princes Street enjoying the mild sunshine, and the little thrill of easterly wind that tossed the flags along that terrace of palaces, and tumbled the green trees in the garden. The band was playing down in the valley under the castle; and when it came to the turn of the pipers, he heard their wild sounds with a stirring of the blood."}, {"size": 602, "text": "Something distantly martial woke in him; and he thought of Miss Mackenzie, whom he was to meet that day at dinner. Now, it is undeniable that he should have gone directly to the bank, but right in the way stood the billiard-room of the hotel where Alan was almost certain to be found; and the temptation proved too strong. He entered the billiard-room, and was instantly greeted by his friend, cue in hand. \u2018Nicholson,\u2019 said he, \u2018I want you to lend me a pound or two till Monday.\u2019 \u2018You\u2019ve come to the right shop, haven\u2019t you?\u2019 returned John. \u2018I have twopence.\u2019 \u2018Nonsense,\u2019 said Alan. \u2018You can get some."}, {"size": 612, "text": "Go and borrow at your tailor\u2019s; they all do it. Or I\u2019ll tell you what: pop your watch.\u2019 \u2018Oh, yes, I dare say,\u2019 said John. \u2018And how about my father?\u2019 \u2018How is he to know? He doesn\u2019t wind it up for you at night, does he?\u2019 inquired Alan, at which John guffawed. \u2018No, seriously; I am in a fix,\u2019 continued the tempter. \u2018I have lost some money to a man here. I\u2019ll give it you to-night, and you can get the heir-loom out again on Monday. Come; it\u2019s a small service, after all. I would do a good deal more for you.\u2019 Whereupon John went forth, and pawned his gold watch under the assumed name of John Froggs, 85 Pleasance."}, {"size": 844, "text": "But the nervousness that assailed him at the door of that inglorious haunt\u2014a pawnshop\u2014and the effort necessary to invent the pseudonym (which, somehow, seemed to him a necessary part of the procedure), had taken more time than he imagined: and when he returned to the billiard-room with the spoils, the bank had already closed its doors. This was a shrewd knock. \u2018A piece of business had been neglected.\u2019 He heard these words in his father\u2019s trenchant voice, and trembled, and then dodged the thought. After all, who was to know? He must carry four hundred pounds about with him till Monday, when the neglect could be surreptitiously repaired; and meanwhile, he was free to pass the afternoon on the encircling divan of the billiard-room, smoking his pipe, sipping a pint of ale, and enjoying to the masthead the modest pleasures of admiration."}, {"size": 752, "text": "None can admire like a young man. Of all youth\u2019s passions and pleasures, this is the most common and least alloyed; and every flash of Alan\u2019s black eyes; every aspect of his curly head; every graceful reach, every easy, stand-off attitude of waiting; ay, and down to his shirt-sleeves and wrist-links, were seen by John through a luxurious glory. He valued himself by the possession of that royal friend, hugged himself upon the thought, and swam in warm azure; his own defects, like vanquished difficulties, becoming things on which to plume himself. Only when he thought of Miss Mackenzie there fell upon his mind a shadow of regret; that young lady was worthy of better things than plain John Nicholson, still known among schoolmates by the derisive"}, {"size": 671, "text": "name of \u2018Fatty\u2019; and he felt, if he could chalk a cue, or stand at ease, with such a careless grace as Alan, he could approach the object of his sentiments with a less crushing sense of inferiority. Before they parted, Alan made a proposal that was startling in the extreme. He would be at Colette\u2019s that night about twelve, he said. Why should not John come there and get the money? To go to Colette\u2019s was to see life, indeed; it was wrong; it was against the laws; it partook, in a very dingy manner, of adventure. Were it known, it was the sort of exploit that disconsidered a young man for good with the more serious classes, but gave him a standing with the riotous."}, {"size": 676, "text": "And yet Colette\u2019s was not a hell; it could not come, without vaulting hyperbole, under the rubric of a gilded saloon; and, if it was a sin to go there, the sin was merely local and municipal. Colette (whose name I do not know how to spell, for I was never in epistolary communication with that hospitable outlaw) was simply an unlicensed publican, who gave suppers after eleven at night, the Edinburgh hour of closing. If you belonged to a club, you could get a much better supper at the same hour, and lose not a jot in public esteem. But if you lacked that qualification, and were an hungered, or inclined toward conviviality at unlawful hours, Colette\u2019s was your only port."}, {"size": 770, "text": "You were very ill-supplied. The company was not recruited from the Senate or the Church, though the Bar was very well represented on the only occasion on which I flew in the face of my country\u2019s laws, and, taking my reputation in my hand, penetrated into that grim supper-house. And Colette\u2019s frequenters, thrillingly conscious of wrong-doing and \u2018that two-handed engine (the policeman) at the door,\u2019 were perhaps inclined to somewhat feverish excess. But the place was in no sense a very bad one; and it is somewhat strange to me, at this distance of time, how it had acquired its dangerous repute. In precisely the same spirit as a man may debate a project to ascend the Matterhorn or to cross Africa, John considered Alan\u2019s proposal, and, greatly daring, accepted it."}, {"size": 667, "text": "As he walked home, the thoughts of this excursion out of the safe places of life into the wild and arduous, stirred and struggled in his imagination with the image of Miss Mackenzie\u2014incongruous and yet kindred thoughts, for did not each imply unusual tightening of the pegs of resolution? did not each woo him forth and warn him back again into himself? Between these two considerations, at least, he was more than usually moved; and when he got to Randolph Crescent, he quite forgot the four hundred pounds in the inner pocket of his greatcoat, hung up the coat, with its rich freight, upon his particular pin of the hatstand; and in the very action sealed his doom."}, {"size": 754, "text": "CHAPTER II\u2014IN WHICH JOHN REAPS THE WHIRLWINDABOUT half-past ten it was John\u2019s brave good fortune to offer his arm to Miss Mackenzie, and escort her home. The night was chill and starry; all the way eastward the trees of the different gardens rustled and looked black. Up the stone gully of Leith Walk, when they came to cross it, the breeze made a rush and set the flames of the street-lamps quavering; and when at last they had mounted to the Royal Terrace, where Captain Mackenzie lived, a great salt freshness came in their faces from the sea. These phases of the walk remained written on John\u2019s memory, each emphasised by the touch of that light hand on his arm; and behind all these aspects of the nocturnal city he saw, in his mind\u2019s-eye, a picture"}, {"size": 618, "text": "of the lighted drawing-room at home where he had sat talking with Flora; and his father, from the other end, had looked on with a kind and ironical smile. John had read the significance of that smile, which might have escaped a stranger. Mr. Nicholson had remarked his son\u2019s entanglement with satisfaction, tinged by humour; and his smile, if it still was a thought contemptuous, had implied consent. At the captain\u2019s door the girl held out her hand, with a certain emphasis; and John took it and kept it a little longer, and said, \u2018Good-night, Flora, dear,\u2019 and was instantly thrown into much fear by his presumption."}, {"size": 851, "text": "But she only laughed, ran up the steps, and rang the bell; and while she was waiting for the door to open, kept close in the porch, and talked to him from that point as out of a fortification. She had a knitted shawl over her head; her blue Highland eyes took the light from the neighbouring street-lamp and sparkled; and when the door opened and closed upon her, John felt cruelly alone. He proceeded slowly back along the terrace in a tender glow; and when he came to Greenside Church, he halted in a doubtful mind. Over the crown of the Calton Hill, to his left, lay the way to Colette\u2019s, where Alan would soon be looking for his arrival, and where he would now have no more consented to go than he would have wilfully wallowed in a bog; the touch of the girl\u2019s hand on his sleeve, and the kindly light in his father\u2019s eyes, both loudly forbidding."}, {"size": 687, "text": "But right before him was the way home, which pointed only to bed, a place of little ease for one whose fancy was strung to the lyrical pitch, and whose not very ardent heart was just then tumultuously moved. The hilltop, the cool air of the night, the company of the great monuments, the sight of the city under his feet, with its hills and valleys and crossing files of lamps, drew him by all he had of the poetic, and he turned that way; and by that quite innocent deflection, ripened the crop of his venial errors for the sickle of destiny. On a seat on the hill above Greenside he sat for perhaps half an hour, looking down upon the lamps of Edinburgh, and up at the lamps of heaven."}, {"size": 612, "text": "Wonderful were the resolves he formed; beautiful and kindly were the vistas of future life that sped before him. He uttered to himself the name of Flora in so many touching and dramatic keys, that he became at length fairly melted with tenderness, and could have sung aloud. At that juncture a certain creasing in his greatcoat caught his ear. He put his hand into his pocket, pulled forth the envelope that held the money, and sat stupefied. The Calton Hill, about this period, had an ill name of nights; and to be sitting there with four hundred pounds that did not belong to him was hardly wise. He looked up."}, {"size": 731, "text": "There was a man in a very bad hat a little on one side of him, apparently looking at the scenery; from a little on the other a second night-walker was drawing very quietly near. Up jumped John. The envelope fell from his hands; he stooped to get it, and at the same moment both men ran in and closed with him. A little after, he got to his feet very sore and shaken, the poorer by a purse which contained exactly one penny postage-stamp, by a cambric handkerchief, and by the all-important envelope. Here was a young man on whom, at the highest point of lovely exaltation, there had fallen a blow too sharp to be supported alone; and not many hundred yards away his greatest friend was sitting at supper\u2014ay, and even expecting him."}, {"size": 609, "text": "Was it not in the nature of man that he should run there? He went in quest of sympathy\u2014in quest of that droll article that we all suppose ourselves to want when in a strait, and have agreed to call advice; and he went, besides, with vague but rather splendid expectations of relief. Alan was rich, or would be so when he came of age. By a stroke of the pen he might remedy this misfortune, and avert that dreaded interview with Mr. Nicholson, from which John now shrunk in imagination as the hand draws back from fire. Close under the Calton Hill there runs a certain narrow avenue, part street, part by-road."}, {"size": 645, "text": "The head of it faces the doors of the prison; its tail descends into the sunless slums of the Low Calton. On one hand it is overhung by the crags of the hill, on the other by an old graveyard. Between these two the roadway runs in a trench, sparsely lighted at night, sparsely frequented by day, and bordered, when it was cleared the place of tombs, by dingy and ambiguous houses. One of these was the house of Colette; and at his door our ill-starred John was presently beating for admittance. In an evil hour he satisfied the jealous inquiries of the contraband hotel-keeper; in an evil hour he penetrated into the somewhat unsavoury interior."}, {"size": 724, "text": "Alan, to be sure, was there, seated in a room lighted by noisy gas-jets, beside a dirty table-cloth, engaged on a coarse meal, and in the company of several tipsy members of the junior bar. But Alan was not sober; he had lost a thousand pounds upon a horse-race, had received the news at dinner-time, and was now, in default of any possible means of extrication, drowning the memory of his predicament. He to help John! The thing was impossible; he couldn\u2019t help himself. \u2018If you have a beast of a father,\u2019 said he, \u2018I can tell you I have a brute of a trustee.\u2019 \u2018I\u2019m not going to hear my father called a beast,\u2019 said John with a beating heart, feeling that he risked the last sound rivet of the chain that bound him to life."}, {"size": 710, "text": "But Alan was quite good-natured. \u2018All right, old fellow,\u2019 said he. \u2018Mos\u2019 respec\u2019able man your father.\u2019 And he introduced his friend to his companions as \u2018old Nicholson the what-d\u2019ye-call-um\u2019s son.\u2019 John sat in dumb agony. Colette\u2019s foul walls and maculate table-linen, and even down to Colette\u2019s villainous casters, seemed like objects in a nightmare. And just then there came a knock and a scurrying; the police, so lamentably absent from the Calton Hill, appeared upon the scene; and the party, taken _flagrante delicto_, with their glasses at their elbow, were seized, marched up to the police office, and all duly summoned to appear as witnesses in the consequent case against that arch-shebeener, Colette."}, {"size": 785, "text": "It was a sorrowful and a mightily sobered company that came forth again. The vague terror of public opinion weighed generally on them all; but there were private and particular horrors on the minds of individuals. Alan stood in dread of his trustee, already sorely tried. One of the group was the son of a country minister, another of a judge; John, the unhappiest of all, had David Nicholson to father, the idea of facing whom on such a scandalous subject was physically sickening. They stood awhile consulting under the buttresses of Saint Giles; thence they adjourned to the lodgings of one of the number in North Castle Street, where (for that matter) they might have had quite as good a supper, and far better drink, than in the dangerous paradise from which they had been routed."}, {"size": 622, "text": "There, over an almost tearful glass, they debated their position. Each explained he had the world to lose if the affair went on, and he appeared as a witness. It was remarkable what bright prospects were just then in the very act of opening before each of that little company of youths, and what pious consideration for the feelings of their families began now to well from them. Each, moreover, was in an odd state of destitution. Not one could bear his share of the fine; not one but evinced a wonderful twinkle of hope that each of the others (in succession) was the very man who could step in to make good the deficit."}, {"size": 832, "text": "One took a high hand; he could not pay his share; if it went to a trial, he should bolt; he had always felt the English Bar to be his true sphere. Another branched out into touching details about his family, and was not listened to. John, in the midst of this disorderly competition of poverty and meanness, sat stunned, contemplating the mountain bulk of his misfortunes. At last, upon a pledge that each should apply to his family with a common frankness, this convention of unhappy young asses broke up, went down the common stair, and in the grey of the spring morning, with the streets lying dead empty all about them, the lamps burning on into the daylight in diminished lustre, and the birds beginning to sound premonitory notes from the groves of the town gardens, went each his own way with bowed head and echoing footfall."}, {"size": 832, "text": "The rooks were awake in Randolph Crescent; but the windows looked down, discreetly blinded, on the return of the prodigal. John\u2019s pass-key was a recent privilege; this was the first time it had been used; and, oh! with what a sickening sense of his unworthiness he now inserted it into the well-oiled lock and entered that citadel of the proprieties! All slept; the gas in the hall had been left faintly burning to light his return; a dreadful stillness reigned, broken by the deep ticking of the eight-day clock. He put the gas out, and sat on a chair in the hall, waiting and counting the minutes, longing for any human countenance. But when at last he heard the alarm spring its rattle in the lower story, and the servants begin to be about, he instantly lost heart, and fled to his own room, where he threw himself upon the bed."}, {"size": 709, "text": "CHAPTER III\u2014IN WHICH JOHN ENJOYS THE HARVEST HOME SHORTLY after breakfast, at which he assisted with a highly tragical countenance, John sought his father where he sat, presumably in religious meditation, on the Sabbath mornings. The old gentleman looked up with that sour, inquisitive expression that came so near to smiling and was so different in effect. \u2018This is a time when I do not like to be disturbed,\u2019 he said. \u2018I know that,\u2019 returned John; \u2018but I have\u2014I want\u2014I\u2019ve made a dreadful mess of it,\u2019 he broke out, and turned to the window. Mr. Nicholson sat silent for an appreciable time, while his unhappy son surveyed the poles in the back green, and a certain yellow cat that was perched upon the wall."}, {"size": 651, "text": "Despair sat upon John as he gazed; and he raged to think of the dreadful series of his misdeeds, and the essential innocence that lay behind them. \u2018Well,\u2019 said the father, with an obvious effort, but in very quiet tones, \u2018what is it?\u2019 \u2018Maclean gave me four hundred pounds to put in the bank, sir,\u2019 began John; \u2018and I\u2019m sorry to say that I\u2019ve been robbed of it!\u2019 \u2018Robbed of it?\u2019 cried Mr. Nicholson, with a strong rising inflection. \u2018Robbed? Be careful what you say, John!\u2019 \u2018I can\u2019t say anything else, sir; I was just robbed of it,\u2019 said John, in desperation, sullenly. \u2018And where and when did this extraordinary event take place?\u2019 inquired the father."}, {"size": 624, "text": "\u2018On the Calton Hill about twelve last night.\u2019 \u2018The Calton Hill?\u2019 repeated Mr. Nicholson. \u2018And what were you doing there at such a time of the night?\u2019 \u2018Nothing, sir,\u2019 says John. Mr. Nicholson drew in his breath. \u2018And how came the money in your hands at twelve last night?\u2019 he asked, sharply. \u2018I neglected that piece of business,\u2019 said John, anticipating comment; and then in his own dialect: \u2018I clean forgot all about it.\u2019 \u2018Well,\u2019 said his father, \u2018it\u2019s a most extraordinary story. Have you communicated with the police?\u2019 \u2018I have,\u2019 answered poor John, the blood leaping to his face. \u2018They think they know the men that did it."}, {"size": 712, "text": "I dare say the money will be recovered, if that was all,\u2019 said he, with a desperate indifference, which his father set down to levity; but which sprung from the consciousness of worse behind. \u2018Your mother\u2019s watch, too?\u2019 asked Mr. Nicholson. \u2018Oh, the watch is all right!\u2019 cried John. \u2018At least, I mean I was coming to the watch\u2014the fact is, I am ashamed to say, I\u2014I had pawned the watch before. Here is the ticket; they didn\u2019t find that; the watch can be redeemed; they don\u2019t sell pledges.\u2019 The lad panted out these phrases, one after another, like minute guns; but at the last word, which rang in that stately chamber like an oath, his heart failed him utterly; and the dreaded silence settled on father and son."}, {"size": 635, "text": "It was broken by Mr. Nicholson picking up the pawn-ticket: \u2018John Froggs, 85 Pleasance,\u2019 he read; and then turning upon John, with a brief flash of passion and disgust, \u2018Who is John Froggs?\u2019 he cried. \u2018Nobody,\u2019 said John. \u2018It was just a name.\u2019 \u2018An _alias_,\u2019 his father commented. \u2018Oh! I think scarcely quite that,\u2019 said the culprit; \u2018it\u2019s a form, they all do it, the man seemed to understand, we had a great deal of fun over the name\u2014\u2019 He paused at that, for he saw his father wince at the picture like a man physically struck; and again there was silence. \u2018I do not think,\u2019 said Mr. Nicholson, at last, \u2018that I am an ungenerous father."}, {"size": 611, "text": "I have never grudged you money within reason, for any avowable purpose; you had just to come to me and speak. And now I find that you have forgotten all decency and all natural feeling, and actually pawned\u2014pawned\u2014your mother\u2019s watch. You must have had some temptation; I will do you the justice to suppose it was a strong one. What did you want with this money?\u2019 \u2018I would rather not tell you, sir,\u2019 said John. \u2018It will only make you angry.\u2019 \u2018I will not be fenced with,\u2019 cried his father. \u2018There must be an end of disingenuous answers. What did you want with this money?\u2019 \u2018To lend it to Houston, sir,\u2019 says John."}, {"size": 888, "text": "\u2018I thought I had forbidden you to speak to that young man?\u2019 asked the father. \u2018Yes, sir,\u2019 said John; \u2018but I only met him.\u2019 \u2018Where?\u2019 came the deadly question. And \u2018In a billiard-room\u2019 was the damning answer. Thus, had John\u2019s single departure from the truth brought instant punishment.

But here he was on Regent Terrace; there was nothing to prevent him going round the end of the hill, and looking from without on the Mackenzies\u2019 house.

And then the figure he made, with his decent portliness, his whiskers, the money in his purse, the excellent cigar that he now lighted, recurred to his mind in consolatory comparison with that of a certain maddened lad who, on a certain spring Sunday ten years before, and in the hour of church-time silence, had stolen from that city by the Glasgow road."}, {"size": 750, "text": "In the face of these changes, it were impious to doubt fortune\u2019s kindness.

He turned, not merely to the man as a friend, but to his house as a place of refuge.

To the south it adjoined another house, but standing in so large a garden as to be well out of cry; on all other sides, open fields stretched upward to the woods of Corstorphine Hill, or backward to the dells of Ravelston, or downward toward the valley of the Leith. The effect of seclusion was aided by the great height of the garden walls, which were, indeed, conventual, and, as John had tested in former days, defied the climbing schoolboy."}, {"size": 768, "text": "The lamp of the cab threw a gleam upon the door and the not brilliant handle of the bell. \u2018Shall I ring for ye?\u2019 said the cabman, who had descended from his perch, and was slapping his chest, for the night was bitter. \u2018I wish you would,\u2019 said John, putting his hand to his brow in one of his accesses of giddiness. The man pulled at the handle, and the clanking of the bell replied from further in the garden; twice and thrice he did it, with sufficient intervals; in the great frosty silence of the night the sounds fell sharp and small. \u2018Does he expect ye?\u2019 asked the driver, with that manner of familiar interest that well became his port-wine face; and when John had told him no, \u2018Well, then,\u2019 said the cabman, \u2018if ye\u2019ll tak\u2019 my advice of it, we\u2019ll just gang back."}, {"size": 692, "text": "And that\u2019s disinterested, mind ye, for my stables are in the Glesgie Road.\u2019 \u2018The servants must hear,\u2019 said John. \u2018Hout!\u2019 said the driver. \u2018He keeps no servants here, man.

The clamour had not yet subsided before they heard steps upon the gravel, and a voice of singular nervous irritability cried to them through the door, \u2018Who are you, and what do you want?\u2019 \u2018Alan,\u2019 said John, \u2018it\u2019s me\u2014it\u2019s Fatty\u2014John, you know.

A candle stood on the gravel walk, winking a little in the draughts; it threw inconstant sparkles on the clumped holly, struck the light and darkness to and fro like a veil on Alan\u2019s features, and sent his shadow hovering behind him.

I\u2019ll go right away to bed if you have anything to do. I seem to have been drinking; I was that knocked over. I wouldn\u2019t turn you away, Alan, if you were down on your luck.\u2019 \u2018No?\u2019 returned Alan. \u2018Neither will you, then. Come and let\u2019s get your portmanteau.\u2019 The cabman was paid, and drove off down the long, lamp-lighted hill, and the two friends stood on the side-walk beside the portmanteau till the last rumble of the wheels had died in silence."}, {"size": 652, "text": "It seemed to John as though Alan attached importance to this departure of the cab; and John, who was in no state to criticise, shared profoundly in the feeling.

And he rose at once, reshouldered the portmanteau, and taking the candle in his other hand, moved forward to the Lodge. This was a long, low building, smothered in creepers; and now, except for some chinks of light between the dining-room shutters, it was plunged in darkness and silence."}, {"size": 654, "text": "In the hall Alan lighted another candle, gave it to John, and opened the door of a bedroom. \u2018Here,\u2019 said he; \u2018go to bed.

Let\u2019s go into the dining-room a minute. Just one glass to warm me, Alan.\u2019 On the table in the hall stood a glass, and a bottle with a whisky label on a tray. It was plain the bottle had been just opened, for the cork and corkscrew lay beside it. \u2018Take that,\u2019 said Alan, passing John the whisky, and then with a certain roughness pushed his friend into the bedroom, and closed the door behind him."}, {"size": 669, "text": "John stood amazed; then he shook the bottle, and, to his further wonder, found it partly empty. Three or four glasses were gone. Alan must have uncorked a bottle of whisky and drank three or four glasses one after the other, without sitting down, for there was no chair, and that in his own cold lobby on this freezing night! It fully explained his eccentricities, John reflected sagely, as he mixed himself a grog. Poor Alan! He was drunk; and what a dreadful thing was drink, and what a slave to it poor Alan was, to drink in this unsociable, uncomfortable fashion! The man who would drink alone, except for health\u2019s sake\u2014as John was now doing\u2014was a man utterly lost."}, {"size": 705, "text": "He took the grog out, and felt hazier, but warmer.

There\u2019s no sense in getting ill with all this other trouble.\u2019 And presently dreamless slumber buried him. When John awoke it was day. The low winter sun was already in the heavens, but his watch had stopped, and it was impossible to tell the hour exactly. Ten, he guessed it, and made haste to dress, dismal reflections crowding on his mind. But it was less from terror than from regret that he now suffered; and with his regret there were mingled cutting pangs of penitence."}, {"size": 726, "text": "There had fallen upon him a blow, cruel, indeed, but yet only the punishment of old misdoing; and he had rebelled and plunged into fresh sin. The rod had been used to chasten, and he had bit the chastening fingers. His father was right; John had justified him; John was no guest for decent people\u2019s houses, and no fit associate for decent people\u2019s children. And had a broader hint been needed, there was the case of his old friend. John was no drunkard, though he could at times exceed; and the picture of Houston drinking neat spirits at his hall-table struck him with something like disgust. He hung back from meeting his old friend. He could have wished he had not come to him; and yet, even now, where else was he to turn?"}, {"size": 803, "text": "These musings occupied him while he dressed, and accompanied him into the lobby of the house. The door stood open on the garden; doubtless, Alan had stepped forth; and John did as he supposed his friend had done. The ground was hard as iron, the frost still rigorous; as he brushed among the hollies, icicles jingled and glittered in their fall; and wherever he went, a volley of eager sparrows followed him. Here were Christmas weather and Christmas morning duly met, to the delight of children. This was the day of reunited families, the day to which he had so long looked forward, thinking to awake in his own bed in Randolph Crescent, reconciled with all men and repeating the footprints of his youth; and here he was alone, pacing the alleys of a wintry garden and filled with penitential thoughts."}, {"size": 716, "text": "And that reminded him: why was he alone? and where was Alan? The thought of the festal morning and the due salutations reawakened his desire for his friend, and he began to call for him by name. As the sound of his voice died away, he was aware of the greatness of the silence that environed him. But for the twittering of the sparrows and the crunching of his own feet upon the frozen snow, the whole windless world of air hung over him entranced, and the stillness weighed upon his mind with a horror of solitude. Still calling at intervals, but now with a moderated voice, he made the hasty circuit of the garden, and finding neither man nor trace of man in all its evergreen coverts, turned at last to the house."}, {"size": 746, "text": "About the house the silence seemed to deepen strangely. The door, indeed, stood open as before; but the windows were still shuttered, the chimneys breathed no stain into the bright air, there sounded abroad none of that low stir (perhaps audible rather to the ear of the spirit than to the ear of the flesh) by which a house announces and betrays its human lodgers. And yet Alan must be there\u2014Alan locked in drunken slumbers, forgetful of the return of day, of the holy season, and of the friend whom he had so coldly received and was now so churlishly neglecting. John\u2019s disgust redoubled at the thought, but hunger was beginning to grow stronger than repulsion, and as a step to breakfast, if nothing else, he must find and arouse this sleeper."}, {"size": 781, "text": "He made the circuit of the bedroom quarters. All, until he came to Alan\u2019s chamber, were locked from without, and bore the marks of a prolonged disuse. But Alan\u2019s was a room in commission, filled with clothes, knickknacks, letters, books, and the conveniences of a solitary man. The fire had been lighted; but it had long ago burned out, and the ashes were stone cold. The bed had been made, but it had not been slept in. Worse and worse, then; Alan must have fallen where he sat, and now sprawled brutishly, no doubt, upon the dining-room floor. The dining-room was a very long apartment, and was reached through a passage; so that John, upon his entrance, brought but little light with him, and must move toward the windows with spread arms, groping and knocking on the furniture."}, {"size": 707, "text": "Suddenly he tripped and fell his length over a prostrate body. It was what he had looked for, yet it shocked him; and he marvelled that so rough an impact should not have kicked a groan out of the drunkard. Men had killed themselves ere now in such excesses, a dreary and degraded end that made John shudder. What if Alan were dead? There would be a Christmas-day! By this, John had his hand upon the shutters, and flinging them back, beheld once again the blessed face of the day. Even by that light the room had a discomfortable air. The chairs were scattered, and one had been overthrown; the table-cloth, laid as if for dinner, was twitched upon one side, and some of the dishes had fallen to the floor."}, {"size": 727, "text": "Behind the table lay the drunkard, still unaroused, only one foot visible to John. But now that light was in the room, the worst seemed over; it was a disgusting business, but not more than disgusting; and it was with no great apprehension that John proceeded to make the circuit of the table: his last comparatively tranquil moment for that day. No sooner had he turned the corner, no sooner had his eyes alighted on the body, than he gave a smothered, breathless cry, and fled out of the room and out of the house. It was not Alan who lay there, but a man well up in years, of stern countenance and iron-grey locks; and it was no drunkard, for the body lay in a black pool of blood, and the open eyes stared upon the ceiling."}, {"size": 709, "text": "To and fro walked John before the door. The extreme sharpness of the air acted on his nerves like an astringent, and braced them swiftly. Presently, he not relaxing in his disordered walk, the images began to come clearer and stay longer in his fancy; and next the power of thought came back to him, and the horror and danger of his situation rooted him to the ground. He grasped his forehead, and staring on one spot of gravel, pieced together what he knew and what he suspected. Alan had murdered some one: possibly \u2018that man\u2019 against whom the butler chained the door in Regent Terrace; possibly another; some one at least: a human soul, whom it was death to slay and whose blood lay spilled upon the floor."}, {"size": 897, "text": "This was the reason of the whisky drinking in the passage, of his unwillingness to welcome John, of his strange behaviour and bewildered words; this was why he had started at and harped upon the name of murder; this was why he had stood and hearkened, or sat and covered his eyes, in the black night. And now he was gone, now he had basely fled; and to all his perplexities and dangers John stood heir. \u2018Let me think\u2014let me think,\u2019 he said, aloud, impatiently, even pleadingly, as if to some merciless interrupter. In the turmoil of his wits, a thousand hints and hopes and threats and terrors dinning continuously in his ears, he was like one plunged in the hubbub of a crowd. How was he to remember\u2014he, who had not a thought to spare\u2014that he was himself the author, as well as the theatre, of so much confusion? But in hours of trial the junto of man\u2019s nature is dissolved, and anarchy succeeds."}, {"size": 617, "text": "It was plain he must stay no longer where he was, for here was a new Judicial Error in the very making. It was not so plain where he must go, for the old Judicial Error, vague as a cloud, appeared to fill the habitable world; whatever it might be, it watched for him, full-grown, in Edinburgh; it must have had its birth in San Francisco; it stood guard, no doubt, like a dragon, at the bank where he should cash his credit; and though there were doubtless many other places, who should say in which of them it was not ambushed? No, he could not tell where he was to go; he must not lose time on these insolubilities."}, {"size": 622, "text": "Let him go back to the beginning. It was plain he must stay no longer where he was. It was plain, too, that he must not flee as he was, for he could not carry his portmanteau, and to flee and leave it was to plunge deeper in the mire. He must go, leave the house unguarded, find a cab, and return\u2014return after an absence? Had he courage for that? And just then he spied a stain about a hand\u2019s-breadth on his trouser-leg, and reached his finger down to touch it. The finger was stained red: it was blood; he stared upon it with disgust, and awe, and terror, and in the sharpness of the new sensation, fell instantly to act."}, {"size": 785, "text": "He cleansed his finger in the snow, returned into the house, drew near with hushed footsteps to the dining-room door, and shut and locked it. Then he breathed a little freer, for here at least was an oaken barrier between himself and what he feared. Next, he hastened to his room, tore off the spotted trousers which seemed in his eyes a link to bind him to the gallows, flung them in a corner, donned another pair, breathlessly crammed his night things into his portmanteau, locked it, swung it with an effort from the ground, and with a rush of relief, came forth again under the open heavens. The portmanteau, being of occidental build, was no feather-weight; it had distressed the powerful Alan; and as for John, he was crushed under its bulk, and the sweat broke upon him thickly."}, {"size": 637, "text": "Twice he must set it down to rest before he reached the gate; and when he had come so far, he must do as Alan did, and take his seat upon one corner. Here then, he sat a while and panted; but now his thoughts were sensibly lightened; now, with the trunk standing just inside the door, some part of his dissociation from the house of crime had been effected, and the cabman need not pass the garden wall. It was wonderful how that relieved him; for the house, in his eyes, was a place to strike the most cursory beholder with suspicion, as though the very windows had cried murder. But there was to be no remission of the strokes of fate."}, {"size": 641, "text": "As he thus sat, taking breath in the shadow of the wall and hopped about by sparrows, it chanced that his eye roved to the fastening of the door; and what he saw plucked him to his feet.

He saw himself obliged to one of two distasteful and perilous alternatives; either to shut the door altogether and set his portmanteau out upon the wayside, a wonder to all beholders; or to leave the door ajar, so that any thievish tramp or holiday schoolboy might stray in and stumble on the grisly secret."}, {"size": 698, "text": "To the last, as the least desperate, his mind inclined; but he must first insure himself that he was unobserved. He peered out, and down the long road; it lay dead empty. He went to the corner of the by-road that comes by way of Dean; there also not a passenger was stirring. Plainly it was, now or never, the high tide of his affairs; and he drew the door as close as he durst, slipped a pebble in the chink, and made off downhill to find a cab. Half-way down a gate opened, and a troop of Christmas children sallied forth in the most cheerful humour, followed more soberly by a smiling mother. \u2018And this is Christmas-day!\u2019 thought John; and could have laughed aloud in tragic bitterness of heart."}, {"size": 610, "text": "CHAPTER VII\u2014A TRAGI-COMEDY IN A CABIN front of Donaldson\u2019s Hospital, John counted it good fortune to perceive a cab a great way of, and by much shouting and waving of his arm, to catch the notice of the driver. He counted it good fortune, for the time was long to him till he should have done for ever with the Lodge; and the further he must go to find a cab, the greater the chance that the inevitable discovery had taken place, and that he should return to find the garden full of angry neighbours.

There were Baigreys about Gilmerton; ye\u2019ll be one of that lot? Then this\u2019ll be a friend\u2019s portmantie, like? Why? Because the name upon it\u2019s Nucholson! Oh, if ye\u2019re in a hurry, that\u2019s another job. Waverley Brig? Are ye for away?\u2019 So the friendly toper prated and questioned and kept John\u2019s heart in a flutter. But to this also, as to other evils under the sun, there came a period; and the victim of circumstances began at last to rumble toward the railway terminus at Waverley Bridge."}, {"size": 750, "text": "During the transit, he sat with raised glasses in the frosty chill and mouldy fetor of his chariot, and glanced out sidelong on the holiday face of things, the shuttered shops, and the crowds along the pavement, much as the rider in the Tyburn cart may have observed the concourse gathering to his execution. At the station his spirits rose again; another stage of his escape was fortunately ended\u2014he began to spy blue water. He called a railway porter, and bade him carry the portmanteau to the cloak-room: not that he had any notion of delay; flight, instant flight was his design, no matter whither; but he had determined to dismiss the cabman ere he named, or even chose, his destination, thus possibly balking the Judicial Error of another link."}, {"size": 746, "text": "This was his cunning aim, and now with one foot on the roadway, and one still on the coach-step, he made haste to put the thing in practice, and plunged his hand into his trousers pocket.

Make the most of his error, and then compare it with the punishment! Conceive his new position, for I lack words to picture it; conceive him condemned to return to that house, from the very thought of which his soul revolted, and once more to expose himself to capture on the very scene of the misdeed: conceive him linked to the mouldy cab and the familiar cabman."}, {"size": 690, "text": "John cursed the cabman silently, and then it occurred to him that he must stop the incarceration of his portmanteau; that, at least, he must keep close at hand, and he turned to recall the porter. But his reflections, brief as they had appeared, must have occupied him longer than he supposed, and there was the man already returning with the receipt. Well, that was settled; he had lost his portmanteau also; for the sixpence with which he had paid the Murrayfield Toll was one that had strayed alone into his waistcoat pocket, and unless he once more successfully achieved the adventure of the house of crime, his portmanteau lay in the cloakroom in eternal pawn, for lack of a penny fee."}, {"size": 696, "text": "And then he remembered the porter, who stood suggestively attentive, words of gratitude hanging on his lips. John hunted right and left; he found a coin\u2014prayed God that it was a sovereign\u2014drew it out, beheld a halfpenny, and offered it to the porter.

He wore a broad-folded tie, white and speckled with lilac, and he carried on his arm a comfortable driving-coat of fur. There was no doubt but he became his years, breathing, as he did, of wealth and consideration; and it was a surprising contrast to see our parlour sot\u2014bald, dirty, pimpled, and robed in his old camlet cloak\u2014confront him at the bottom of the stairs."}, {"size": 650, "text": "\u2018Macfarlane!\u2019 he said somewhat loudly, more like a herald than a friend.

The presence of so many witnesses decided him at once to flee. He crouched together, brushing on the wainscot, and made a dart like a serpent, striking for the door.

It is no great boast, but I believe I was a better hand at worming out a story than either of my fellows at the George; and perhaps there is now no other man alive who could narrate to you the following foul and unnatural events. In his young days Fettes studied medicine in the schools of Edinburgh."}, {"size": 735, "text": "He had talent of a kind, the talent that picks up swiftly what it hears and readily retails it for its own. He worked little at home; but he was civil, attentive, and intelligent in the presence of his masters. They soon picked him out as a lad who listened closely and remembered well; nay, strange as it seemed to me when I first heard it, he was in those days well favoured, and pleased by his exterior. There was, at that period, a certain extramural teacher of anatomy, whom I shall here designate by the letter K. His name was subsequently too well known. The man who bore it skulked through the streets of Edinburgh in disguise, while the mob that applauded at the execution of Burke called loudly for the blood of his employer."}, {"size": 690, "text": "But Mr. K\u2014 was then at the top of his vogue; he enjoyed a popularity due partly to his own talent and address, partly to the incapacity of his rival, the university professor. The students, at least, swore by his name, and Fettes believed himself, and was believed by others, to have laid the foundations of success when he had acquired the favour of this meteorically famous man. Mr. K\u2014 was a _bon vivant_ as well as an accomplished teacher; he liked a sly illusion no less than a careful preparation. In both capacities Fettes enjoyed and deserved his notice, and by the second year of his attendance he held the half-regular position of second demonstrator or sub-assistant in his class."}, {"size": 694, "text": "In this capacity the charge of the theatre and lecture-room devolved in particular upon his shoulders. He had to answer for the cleanliness of the premises and the conduct of the other students, and it was a part of his duty to supply, receive, and divide the various subjects. It was with a view to this last\u2014at that time very delicate\u2014affair that he was lodged by Mr. K\u2014 in the same wynd, and at last in the same building, with the dissecting-rooms. Here, after a night of turbulent pleasures, his hand still tottering, his sight still misty and confused, he would be called out of bed in the black hours before the winter dawn by the unclean and desperate interlopers who supplied the table."}, {"size": 668, "text": "He would open the door to these men, since infamous throughout the land. He would help them with their tragic burden, pay them their sordid price, and remain alone, when they were gone, with the unfriendly relics of humanity. From such a scene he would return to snatch another hour or two of slumber, to repair the abuses of the night, and refresh himself for the labours of the day. Few lads could have been more insensible to the impressions of a life thus passed among the ensigns of mortality. His mind was closed against all general considerations. He was incapable of interest in the fate and fortunes of another, the slave of his own desires and low ambitions."}, {"size": 669, "text": "Cold, light, and selfish in the last resort, he had that modicum of prudence, miscalled morality, which keeps a man from inconvenient drunkenness or punishable theft. He coveted, besides, a measure of consideration from his masters and his fellow-pupils, and he had no desire to fail conspicuously in the external parts of life. Thus he made it his pleasure to gain some distinction in his studies, and day after day rendered unimpeachable eye-service to his employer, Mr. K\u2014. For his day of work he indemnified himself by nights of roaring, blackguardly enjoyment; and when that balance had been struck, the organ that he called his conscience declared itself content."}, {"size": 696, "text": "The supply of subjects was a continual trouble to him as well as to his master. In that large and busy class, the raw material of the anatomists kept perpetually running out; and the business thus rendered necessary was not only unpleasant in itself, but threatened dangerous consequences to all who were concerned. It was the policy of Mr. K\u2014 to ask no questions in his dealings with the trade. \u2018They bring the body, and we pay the price,\u2019 he used to say, dwelling on the alliteration\u2014\u2018_quid pro quo_.\u2019 And, again, and somewhat profanely, \u2018Ask no questions,\u2019 he would tell his assistants, \u2018for conscience\u2019 sake.\u2019 There was no understanding that the subjects were provided by the crime of murder."}, {"size": 760, "text": "Had that idea been broached to him in words, he would have recoiled in horror; but the lightness of his speech upon so grave a matter was, in itself, an offence against good manners, and a temptation to the men with whom he dealt. Fettes, for instance, had often remarked to himself upon the singular freshness of the bodies. He had been struck again and again by the hang-dog, abominable looks of the ruffians who came to him before the dawn; and putting things together clearly in his private thoughts, he perhaps attributed a meaning too immoral and too categorical to the unguarded counsels of his master. He understood his duty, in short, to have three branches: to take what was brought, to pay the price, and to avert the eye from any evidence of crime."}, {"size": 657, "text": "One November morning this policy of silence was put sharply to the test. He had been awake all night with a racking toothache\u2014pacing his room like a caged beast or throwing himself in fury on his bed\u2014and had fallen at last into that profound, uneasy slumber that so often follows on a night of pain, when he was awakened by the third or fourth angry repetition of the concerted signal. There was a thin, bright moonshine; it was bitter cold, windy, and frosty; the town had not yet awakened, but an indefinable stir already preluded the noise and business of the day. The ghouls had come later than usual, and they seemed more than usually eager to be gone."}, {"size": 806, "text": "Fettes, sick with sleep, lighted them upstairs. He heard their grumbling Irish voices through a dream; and as they stripped the sack from their sad merchandise he leaned dozing, with his shoulder propped against the wall; he had to shake himself to find the men their money.

He started; he took two steps nearer, with the candle raised. \u2018God Almighty!\u2019 he cried. \u2018That is Jane Galbraith!\u2019 The men answered nothing, but they shuffled nearer the door. \u2018I know her, I tell you,\u2019 he continued. \u2018She was alive and hearty yesterday. It\u2019s impossible she can be dead; it\u2019s impossible you should have got this body fairly.\u2019 \u2018Sure, sir, you\u2019re mistaken entirely,\u2019 said one of the men.

The lad\u2019s heart failed him. He stammered some excuses, counted out the sum, and saw his hateful visitors depart. No sooner were they gone than he hastened to confirm his doubts. By a dozen unquestionable marks he identified the girl he had jested with the day before. He saw, with horror, marks upon her body that might well betoken violence. A panic seized him, and he took refuge in his room. There he reflected at length over the discovery that he had made; considered soberly the bearing of Mr. K\u2014\u2019s instructions and the danger to himself of interference in so serious a business, and at last, in sore perplexity, determined to wait for the advice of his immediate superior, the class assistant."}, {"size": 769, "text": "This was a young doctor, Wolfe Macfarlane, a high favourite among all the reckless students, clever, dissipated, and unscrupulous to the last degree.

He was an authority on the stage, skilful on the ice or the links with skate or golf-club; he dressed with nice audacity, and, to put the finishing touch upon his glory, he kept a gig and a strong trotting-horse. With Fettes he was on terms of intimacy; indeed, their relative positions called for some community of life; and when subjects were scarce the pair would drive far into the country in Macfarlane\u2019s gig, visit and desecrate some lonely graveyard, and return before dawn with their booty to the door of the dissecting-room."}, {"size": 613, "text": "On that particular morning Macfarlane arrived somewhat earlier than his wont.

Least said soonest mended, I should say.\u2019 \u2018Some one else might recognise her,\u2019 objected Fettes. \u2018She was as well known as the Castle Rock.\u2019 \u2018We\u2019ll hope not,\u2019 said Macfarlane, \u2018and if anybody does\u2014well, you didn\u2019t, don\u2019t you see, and there\u2019s an end."}, {"size": 676, "text": "The fact is, this has been going on too long.

The question is, Why did he choose us two for his assistants? And I answer, because he didn\u2019t want old wives.\u2019 This was the tone of all others to affect the mind of a lad like Fettes. He agreed to imitate Macfarlane. The body of the unfortunate girl was duly dissected, and no one remarked or appeared to recognise her.

The cut of his features gave a promise of intellect and refinement which was but feebly realised in his manners, for he proved, upon a nearer acquaintance, coarse, vulgar, and stupid. He exercised, however, a very remarkable control over Macfarlane; issued orders like the Great Bashaw; became inflamed at the least discussion or delay, and commented rudely on the servility with which he was obeyed.

Toddy, order your friend another glass.\u2019 Or it might be, \u2018Toddy, you jump up and shut the door.\u2019 \u2018Toddy hates me,\u2019 he said again. \u2018Oh yes, Toddy, you do!\u2019 \u2018Don\u2019t you call me that confounded name,\u2019 growled Macfarlane. \u2018Hear him! Did you ever see the lads play knife? He would like to do that all over my body,\u2019 remarked the stranger. \u2018We medicals have a better way than that,\u2019 said Fettes. \u2018When we dislike a dead friend of ours, we dissect him.\u2019 Macfarlane looked up sharply, as though this jest were scarcely to his mind."}, {"size": 718, "text": "The afternoon passed. Gray, for that was the stranger\u2019s name, invited Fettes to join them at dinner, ordered a feast so sumptuous that the tavern was thrown into commotion, and when all was done commanded Macfarlane to settle the bill. It was late before they separated; the man Gray was incapably drunk. Macfarlane, sobered by his fury, chewed the cud of the money he had been forced to squander and the slights he had been obliged to swallow. Fettes, with various liquors singing in his head, returned home with devious footsteps and a mind entirely in abeyance. Next day Macfarlane was absent from the class, and Fettes smiled to himself as he imagined him still squiring the intolerable Gray from tavern to tavern."}, {"size": 612, "text": "As soon as the hour of liberty had struck he posted from place to place in quest of his last night\u2019s companions.

Descending to the door, he was filled with astonishment to find Macfarlane with his gig, and in the gig one of those long and ghastly packages with which he was so well acquainted. \u2018What?\u2019 he cried. \u2018Have you been out alone? How did you manage?\u2019 But Macfarlane silenced him roughly, bidding him turn to business."}, {"size": 660, "text": "When they had got the body upstairs and laid it on the table, Macfarlane made at first as if he were going away.

Fettes was staggered; strange doubts assailed him. He looked from the young doctor to the body, and then back again. At last, with a start, he did as he was bidden.

There was an instant\u2019s hesitation, and the die was cast. Macfarlane could not suppress a nervous twitch, the infinitesimal mark of an immense relief, as he felt the key between his fingers.

To bodies that had been laid in earth, in joyful expectation of a far different awakening, there came that hasty, lamp-lit, terror-haunted resurrection of the spade and mattock."}, {"size": 809, "text": "The coffin was forced, the cerements torn, and the melancholy relics, clad in sackcloth, after being rattled for hours on moonless byways, were at length exposed to uttermost indignities before a class of gaping boys. Somewhat as two vultures may swoop upon a dying lamb, Fettes and Macfarlane were to be let loose upon a grave in that green and quiet resting-place. The wife of a farmer, a woman who had lived for sixty years, and been known for nothing but good butter and a godly conversation, was to be rooted from her grave at midnight and carried, dead and naked, to that far-away city that she had always honoured with her Sunday\u2019s best; the place beside her family was to be empty till the crack of doom; her innocent and almost venerable members to be exposed to that last curiosity of the anatomist."}, {"size": 770, "text": "Late one afternoon the pair set forth, well wrapped in cloaks and furnished with a formidable bottle. It rained without remission\u2014a cold, dense, lashing rain. Now and again there blew a puff of wind, but these sheets of falling water kept it down. Bottle and all, it was a sad and silent drive as far as Penicuik, where they were to spend the evening. They stopped once, to hide their implements in a thick bush not far from the churchyard, and once again at the Fisher\u2019s Tryst, to have a toast before the kitchen fire and vary their nips of whisky with a glass of ale. When they reached their journey\u2019s end the gig was housed, the horse was fed and comforted, and the two young doctors in a private room sat down to the best dinner and the best wine the house afforded."}, {"size": 612, "text": "The lights, the fire, the beating rain upon the window, the cold, incongruous work that lay before them, added zest to their enjoyment of the meal. With every glass their cordiality increased. Soon Macfarlane handed a little pile of gold to his companion. \u2018A compliment,\u2019 he said. \u2018Between friends these little d-d accommodations ought to fly like pipe-lights.\u2019 Fettes pocketed the money, and applauded the sentiment to the echo. \u2018You are a philosopher,\u2019 he cried. \u2018I was an ass till I knew you. You and K\u2014 between you, by the Lord Harry! but you\u2019ll make a man of me.\u2019 \u2018Of course we shall,\u2019 applauded Macfarlane."}, {"size": 766, "text": "\u2018A man?

I watched you.\u2019 \u2018Well, and why not?\u2019 Fettes thus vaunted himself. \u2018It was no affair of mine. There was nothing to gain on the one side but disturbance, and on the other I could count on your gratitude, don\u2019t you see?\u2019 And he slapped his pocket till the gold pieces rang. Macfarlane somehow felt a certain touch of alarm at these unpleasant words. He may have regretted that he had taught his young companion so successfully, but he had no time to interfere, for the other noisily continued in this boastful strain:\u2014 \u2018The great thing is not to be afraid."}, {"size": 737, "text": "Now, between you and me, I don\u2019t want to hang\u2014that\u2019s practical; but for all cant, Macfarlane, I was born with a contempt.

Here\u2019s to the memory of Gray!\u2019 It was by this time growing somewhat late. The gig, according to order, was brought round to the door with both lamps brightly shining, and the young men had to pay their bill and take the road. They announced that they were bound for Peebles, and drove in that direction till they were clear of the last houses of the town; then, extinguishing the lamps, returned upon their course, and followed a by-road toward Glencorse."}, {"size": 708, "text": "There was no sound but that of their own passage, and the incessant, strident pouring of the rain. It was pitch dark; here and there a white gate or a white stone in the wall guided them for a short space across the night; but for the most part it was at a foot pace, and almost groping, that they picked their way through that resonant blackness to their solemn and isolated destination. In the sunken woods that traverse the neighbourhood of the burying-ground the last glimmer failed them, and it became necessary to kindle a match and re-illumine one of the lanterns of the gig. Thus, under the dripping trees, and environed by huge and moving shadows, they reached the scene of their unhallowed labours."}, {"size": 611, "text": "They were both experienced in such affairs, and powerful with the spade; and they had scarce been twenty minutes at their task before they were rewarded by a dull rattle on the coffin lid. At the same moment Macfarlane, having hurt his hand upon a stone, flung it carelessly above his head. The grave, in which they now stood almost to the shoulders, was close to the edge of the plateau of the graveyard; and the gig lamp had been propped, the better to illuminate their labours, against a tree, and on the immediate verge of the steep bank descending to the stream. Chance had taken a sure aim with the stone."}, {"size": 628, "text": "Then came a clang of broken glass; night fell upon them; sounds alternately dull and ringing announced the bounding of the lantern down the bank, and its occasional collision with the trees. A stone or two, which it had dislodged in its descent, rattled behind it into the profundities of the glen; and then silence, like night, resumed its sway; and they might bend their hearing to its utmost pitch, but naught was to be heard except the rain, now marching to the wind, now steadily falling over miles of open country. They were so nearly at an end of their abhorred task that they judged it wisest to complete it in the dark."}, {"size": 659, "text": "The coffin was exhumed and broken open; the body inserted in the dripping sack and carried between them to the gig; one mounted to keep it in its place, and the other, taking the horse by the mouth, groped along by wall and bush until they reached the wider road by the Fisher\u2019s Tryst. Here was a faint, diffused radiancy, which they hailed like daylight; by that they pushed the horse to a good pace and began to rattle along merrily in the direction of the town. They had both been wetted to the skin during their operations, and now, as the gig jumped among the deep ruts, the thing that stood propped between them fell now upon one and now upon the other."}, {"size": 645, "text": "At every repetition of the horrid contact each instinctively repelled it with the greater haste; and the process, natural although it was, began to tell upon the nerves of the companions. Macfarlane made some ill-favoured jest about the farmer\u2019s wife, but it came hollowly from his lips, and was allowed to drop in silence. Still their unnatural burden bumped from side to side; and now the head would be laid, as if in confidence, upon their shoulders, and now the drenching sack-cloth would flap icily about their faces. A creeping chill began to possess the soul of Fettes. He peered at the bundle, and it seemed somehow larger than at first."}, {"size": 646, "text": "All over the country-side, and from every degree of distance, the farm dogs accompanied their passage with tragic ululations; and it grew and grew upon his mind that some unnatural miracle had been accomplished, that some nameless change had befallen the dead body, and that it was in fear of their unholy burden that the dogs were howling. \u2018For God\u2019s sake,\u2019 said he, making a great effort to arrive at speech, \u2018for God\u2019s sake, let\u2019s have a light!\u2019 Seemingly Macfarlane was affected in the same direction; for, though he made no reply, he stopped the horse, passed the reins to his companion, got down, and proceeded to kindle the remaining lamp."}, {"size": 724, "text": "They had by that time got no farther than the cross-road down to Auchenclinny. The rain still poured as though the deluge were returning, and it was no easy matter to make a light in such a world of wet and darkness. When at last the flickering blue flame had been transferred to the wick and began to expand and clarify, and shed a wide circle of misty brightness round the gig, it became possible for the two young men to see each other and the thing they had along with them. The rain had moulded the rough sacking to the outlines of the body underneath; the head was distinct from the trunk, the shoulders plainly modelled; something at once spectral and human riveted their eyes upon the ghastly comrade of their drive."}, {"size": 634, "text": "For some time Macfarlane stood motionless, holding up the lamp. A nameless dread was swathed, like a wet sheet, about the body, and tightened the white skin upon the face of Fettes; a fear that was meaningless, a horror of what could not be, kept mounting to his brain. Another beat of the watch, and he had spoken. But his comrade forestalled him. \u2018That is not a woman,\u2019 said Macfarlane, in a hushed voice. \u2018It was a woman when we put her in,\u2019 whispered Fettes. \u2018Hold that lamp,\u2019 said the other. \u2018I must see her face.\u2019 And as Fettes took the lamp his companion untied the fastenings of the sack and drew down the cover from the head."}, {"size": 495, "text": "The light fell very clear upon the dark, well-moulded features and smooth-shaven cheeks of a too familiar countenance, often beheld in dreams of both of these young men. A wild yell rang up into the night; each leaped from his own side into the roadway: the lamp fell, broke, and was extinguished; and the horse, terrified by this unusual commotion, bounded and went off toward Edinburgh at a gallop, bearing along with it, sole occupant of the gig, the body of the dead and long-dissected Gray."}, {"size": 868, "text": "CHAPTER I\u2014INTRODUCES THE ADMIRALWHEN Dick Naseby was in Paris he made some odd acquaintances; for he was one of those who have ears to hear, and can use their eyes no less than their intelligence. He made as many thoughts as Stuart Mill; but his philosophy concerned flesh and blood, and was experimental as to its method. He was a type-hunter among mankind. He despised small game and insignificant personalities, whether in the shape of dukes or bagmen, letting them go by like sea-weed; but show him a refined or powerful face, let him hear a plangent or a penetrating voice, fish for him with a living look in some one\u2019s eye, a passionate gesture, a meaning and ambiguous smile, and his mind was instantaneously awakened. \u2018There was a man, there was a woman,\u2019 he seemed to say, and he stood up to the task of comprehension with the delight of an artist in his art."}, {"size": 629, "text": "And indeed, rightly considered, this interest of his was an artistic interest. There is no science in the personal study of human nature. All comprehension is creation; the woman I love is somewhat of my handiwork; and the great lover, like the great painter, is he that can so embellish his subject as to make her more than human, whilst yet by a cunning art he has so based his apotheosis on the nature of the case that the woman can go on being a true woman, and give her character free play, and show littleness, or cherish spite, or be greedy of common pleasures, and he continue to worship without a thought of incongruity."}, {"size": 766, "text": "To love a character is only the heroic way of understanding it. When we love, by some noble method of our own or some nobility of mien or nature in the other, we apprehend the loved one by what is noblest in ourselves. When we are merely studying an eccentricity, the method of our study is but a series of allowances. To begin to understand is to begin to sympathise; for comprehension comes only when we have stated another\u2019s faults and virtues in terms of our own. Hence the proverbial toleration of artists for their own evil creations. Hence, too, it came about that Dick Naseby, a high-minded creature, and as scrupulous and brave a gentleman as you would want to meet, held in a sort of affection the various human creeping things whom he had met and studied."}, {"size": 652, "text": "One of these was Mr. Peter Van Tromp, an English-speaking, two-legged animal of the international genus, and by profession of general and more than equivocal utility. Years before he had been a painter of some standing in a colony, and portraits signed \u2018Van Tromp\u2019 had celebrated the greatness of colonial governors and judges. In those days he had been married, and driven his wife and infant daughter in a pony trap. What were the steps of his declension? No one exactly knew. Here he was at least, and had been any time these past ten years, a sort of dismal parasite upon the foreigner in Paris. It would be hazardous to specify his exact industry."}, {"size": 644, "text": "Coarsely followed, it would have merited a name grown somewhat unfamiliar to our ears. Followed as he followed it, with a skilful reticence, in a kind of social chiaroscuro, it was still possible for the polite to call him a professional painter. His lair was in the Grand Hotel and the gaudiest caf\u00e9s. There he might be seen jotting off a sketch with an air of some inspiration; and he was always affable, and one of the easiest of men to fall in talk withal. A conversation usually ripened into a peculiar sort of intimacy, and it was extraordinary how many little services Van Tromp contrived to render in the course of six-and-thirty hours."}, {"size": 855, "text": "He occupied a position between a friend and a courier, which made him worse than embarrassing to repay. But those whom he obliged could always buy one of his villainous little pictures, or, where the favours had been prolonged and more than usually delicate, might order and pay for a large canvas, with perfect certainty that they would hear no more of the transaction. Among resident artists he enjoyed celebrity of a non-professional sort. He had spent more money\u2014no less than three individual fortunes, it was whispered\u2014than any of his associates could ever hope to gain. Apart from his colonial career, he had been to Greece in a brigantine with four brass carronades; he had travelled Europe in a chaise and four, drawing bridle at the palace-doors of German princes; queens of song and dance had followed him like sheep and paid his tailor\u2019s bills."}, {"size": 712, "text": "And to behold him now, seeking small loans with plaintive condescension, sponging for breakfast on an art-student of nineteen, a fallen Don Juan who had neglected to die at the propitious hour, had a colour of romance for young imaginations. His name and his bright past, seen through the prism of whispered gossip, had gained him the nickname of _The Admiral_. Dick found him one day at the receipt of custom, rapidly painting a pair of hens and a cock in a little water-colour sketching box, and now and then glancing at the ceiling like a man who should seek inspiration from the muse. Dick thought it remarkable that a painter should choose to work over an absinthe in a public caf\u00e9, and looked the man over."}, {"size": 776, "text": "The aged rakishness of his appearance was set off by a youthful costume; he had disreputable grey hair and a disreputable sore, red nose; but the coat and the gesture, the outworks of the man, were still designed for show.

No one was so delighted as the Admiral. \u2018A bit of a thing,\u2019 said he. \u2018I just dash them off like that. I\u2014I dash them off,\u2019 he added with a gesture. \u2018Quite so,\u2019 said Dick, who was appalled by the feebleness of the production. \u2018Understand me,\u2019 continued Van Tromp; \u2018I am a man of the world. And yet\u2014once an artist always an artist.

He seemed tickled with him as an elderly fellow about town might be tickled by a pleasant and witty lad; he indicated that he was no precision, but in his wildest times had never been such a blade as he thought Dick. Dick protested, but in vain. This manner of carrying an intimacy at the bayonet\u2019s point was Van Tromp\u2019s stock-in-trade. With an older man he insinuated himself; with youth he imposed himself, and in the same breath imposed an ideal on his victim, who saw that he must work up to it or lose the esteem of this old and vicious patron."}, {"size": 740, "text": "And what young man can bear to lose a character for vice? At last, as it grew towards dinner-time, \u2018Do you know Paris?\u2019 asked Van Tromp. \u2018Not so well as you, I am convinced,\u2019 said Dick. \u2018And so am I,\u2019 returned Van Tromp gaily. \u2018Paris! My young friend\u2014you will allow me?\u2014when you know Paris as I do, you will have seen Strange Things. I say no more; all I say is, Strange Things. We are men of the world, you and I, and in Paris, in the heart of civilised existence. This is an opportunity, Mr. Naseby. Let us dine. Let me show you where to dine.\u2019 Dick consented. On the way to dinner the Admiral showed him where to buy gloves, and made him buy them; where to buy cigars, and made him buy a vast store, some of which he obligingly accepted."}, {"size": 664, "text": "At the restaurant he showed him what to order, with surprising consequences in the bill. What he made that night by his percentages it would be hard to estimate. And all the while Dick smilingly consented, understanding well that he was being done, but taking his losses in the pursuit of character as a hunter sacrifices his dogs. As for the Strange Things, the reader will be relieved to hear that they were no stranger than might have been expected, and he may find things quite as strange without the expense of a Van Tromp for guide. Yet he was a guide of no mean order, who made up for the poverty of what he had to show by a copious, imaginative commentary."}, {"size": 806, "text": "\u2018And such,\u2019 said he, with a hiccup, \u2018such is Paris.\u2019 \u2018Pooh!\u2019 said Dick, who was tired of the performance.

After that they two not unfrequently fell in each other\u2019s way, and Dick would often treat the old boy to breakfast on a moderate scale and in a restaurant of his own selection. Often, too, he would lend Van Tromp the matter of a pound, in view of that gentleman\u2019s contemplated departure for Australia; there would be a scene of farewell almost touching in character, and a week or a month later they would meet on the same boulevard without surprise or embarrassment."}, {"size": 644, "text": "And in the meantime Dick learned more about his acquaintance on all sides: heard of his yacht, his chaise and four, his brief season of celebrity amid a more confiding population, his daughter, of whom he loved to whimper in his cups, his sponging, parasitical, nameless way of life; and with each new detail something that was not merely interest nor yet altogether affection grew up in his mind towards this disreputable stepson of the arts. Ere he left Paris Van Tromp was one of those whom he entertained to a farewell supper; and the old gentleman made the speech of the evening, and then fell below the table, weeping, smiling, paralysed."}, {"size": 741, "text": "CHAPTER II\u2014A LETTER TO THE PAPERSOLD Mr. Naseby had the sturdy, untutored nature of the upper middle class.

There was a contained, prophetic energy in his utterances, even on the slightest affairs; he _saw_ the damned thing; if you did not, it must be from perversity of will; and this sent the blood to his head. Apart from this, which made him an exacting companion, he was one of the most upright, hot-tempered, hot-headed old gentlemen in England. Florid, with white hair, the face of an old Jupiter, and the figure of an old fox-hunter, he enlivened the vale of Thyme from end to end on his big, cantering chestnut."}, {"size": 657, "text": "He had a hearty respect for Dick as a lad of parts. Dick had a respect for his father as the best of men, tempered by the politic revolt of a youth who has to see to his own independence. Whenever the pair argued, they came to an open rupture; and arguments were frequent, for they were both positive, and both loved the work of the intelligence. It was a treat to hear Mr. Naseby defending the Church of England in a volley of oaths, or supporting ascetic morals with an enthusiasm not entirely innocent of port wine. Dick used to wax indignant, and none the less so because, as his father was a skilful disputant, he found himself not seldom in the wrong."}, {"size": 692, "text": "On these occasions, he would redouble in energy, and declare that black was white, and blue yellow, with much conviction and heat of manner; but in the morning such a licence of debate weighed upon him like a crime, and he would seek out his father, where he walked before breakfast on a terrace overlooking all the vale of Thyme. \u2018I have to apologise, sir, for last night\u2014\u2019 he would begin. \u2018Of course you have,\u2019 the old gentleman would cut in cheerfully. \u2018You spoke like a fool. Say no more about it.\u2019 \u2018You do not understand me, sir. I refer to a particular point.

Only,\u2019 he would add, \u2018bear this in mind, and do remember that a man of my age and experience knows more about what he is saying than a raw boy.\u2019 He would utter the word \u2018boy\u2019 even more offensively than the average of fathers, and the light way in which he accepted these apologies cut Richard to the heart. The latter drew slighting comparisons, and remembered that he was the only one who ever apologised.

The old man did not mean to say what was untrue, you may be sure; but he had rashly picked up gossip, as his prejudice suggested, and now rashly launched it on the public with the sanction of his name. \u2018The Liberal candidate,\u2019 he concluded, \u2018is thus a public turncoat."}, {"size": 720, "text": "Is that the sort of man we want?

He could hear the cottage clock deliberately measure out the seconds; time stood still with him; an almost superstitious terror took command of his faculties; at last, he could bear no more, and, springing through the little garden in two bounds, he put his face against the window."}, {"size": 669, "text": "The blind, which had not been drawn fully down, left an open chink about an inch in height along the bottom of the glass, and the whole parlour was thus exposed to Dick\u2019s investigation.

Her brows were slightly bent, her mouth slightly open; her whole attitude so still and settled that Dick could hardly fancy that she breathed. She had not stirred at the sound of Dick\u2019s arrival. Soon after, making a considerable disturbance amid the vast silence of the night, the clock lifted up its voice, whined for a while like a partridge, and then eleven times hooted like a cuckoo."}, {"size": 644, "text": "Still Esther continued immovable and gazed upon the candle.

Nor did she offer him her hand. \u2018Here I am,\u2019 said he. \u2018Yes,\u2019 she replied; and then, without a pause or any change of voice, \u2018I want you to take me away,\u2019 she added. \u2018Away?\u2019 he repeated. \u2018How?

Wild words uttered, as these were, with perfect quiet of manner and voice, exercise a double influence on the hearer\u2019s mind. Dick was confounded; he recovered from astonishment only to fall into doubt and alarm. He looked upon her frozen attitude, so discouraging for a lover to behold, and recoiled from the thoughts which it suggested. \u2018To me?\u2019 he asked. \u2018Are you coming to me, Esther?\u2019 \u2018I want you to take me away,\u2019 she repeated with weary impatience. \u2018Take me away\u2014take me away from here.\u2019"}, {"size": 627, "text": "The situation was not sufficiently defined.

To take her away, to marry her, to work off his hands for her support, Dick was content to do all this; yet he required some show of love upon her part. He was not one of those tough-hided and small-hearted males who would marry their love at the point of the bayonet rather than not marry her at all. He desired that a woman should come to his arms with an attractive willingness, if not with ardour. And Esther\u2019s bearing was more that of despair than that of love.

To-night you shall be in London. I am yours so wholly that no words can make me more so; and, besides, you know it, and the words are needless. May God help me to be good to you, Esther\u2014may God help me! for I see that you will not.\u2019 So, without more speech, they set out together, and were already got some distance from the spot, ere he observed that she was still carrying the hand-bag."}, {"size": 798, "text": "She gave it up to him, passively, but when he offered her his arm, merely shook her head and pursed up her lips.

As they went down into the valley of the Thyme, the babble of the stream rose into the air like a perennial laughter. On the far-away hills, sun-burst and shadow raced along the slopes and leaped from peak to peak. Earth, air and water, each seemed in better health and had more of the shrewd salt of life in them than upon ordinary mornings; and from east to west, from the lowest glen to the height of heaven, from every look and touch and scent, a human creature could gather the most encouraging intelligence as to the durability and spirit of the universe."}, {"size": 648, "text": "Through all this walked Esther, picking her small steps like a bird, but silent and with a cloud under her thick eyebrows. She seemed insensible, not only of nature, but of the presence of her companion. She was altogether engrossed in herself, and looked neither to right nor to left, but straight before her on the road. When they came to the bridge, however, she halted, leaned on the parapet, and stared for a moment at the clear, brown pool, and swift, transient snowdrift of the rapids. \u2018I am going to drink,\u2019 she said; and descended the winding footpath to the margin.

Her thoughts were all secret; her heart was locked and bolted; and he stood without, vainly wooing her with his eves."}, {"size": 750, "text": "\u2018Do you feel better?\u2019 asked Dick, as she at last rejoined him; and after the constraint of so long a silence, his voice sounded foreign to his own ears.

His words died away on his tongue. Even his eyes, despairing of encouragement, ceased to attend on hers. And they went on in silence through Kirton hamlet, where an old man followed them with his eyes, and perhaps envied them their youth and love; and across the Ivy beck where the mill was splashing and grumbling low thunder to itself in the chequered shadow of the dell, and the miller before the door was beating flour from"}, {"size": 641, "text": "his hands as he whistled a modulation; and up by the high spinney, whence they saw the mountains upon either hand; and down the hill again to the back courts and offices of Naseby House.

He would have preferred her to await him in the road while he went on and brought the carriage back, but after so many repulses and rebuffs he lacked courage to offer the suggestion. Perhaps, too, he felt it wiser to keep his convoy within sight. So they entered the yard in Indian file, like a tramp and his wife."}, {"size": 664, "text": "The grooms eyebrows rose as he received the order for the pony-phaeton, and kept rising during all his preparations. Esther stood bolt upright and looked steadily at some chickens in the corner of the yard. Master Richard himself, thought the groom, was not in his ordinary; for in truth, he carried the hand-bag like a talisman, and either stood listless, or set off suddenly walking in one direction after another with brisk, decisive footsteps. Moreover he had apparently neglected to wash his hands, and bore the air of one returning from a prolonged nutting ramble. Upon the groom\u2019s countenance there began to grow up an expression as of one about to whistle."}, {"size": 626, "text": "And hardly had the carriage turned the corner and rattled into the high road with this inexplicable pair, than the whistle broke forth\u2014prolonged, and low and tremulous; and the groom, already so far relieved, vented the rest of his surprise in one simple English word, friendly to the mouth of Jack-tar and the sooty pitman, and hurried to spread the news round the servants\u2019 hall of Naseby House. Luncheon would be on the table in little beyond an hour; and the Squire, on sitting down, would hardly fail to ask for Master Richard. Hence, as the intelligent reader can foresee, this groom has a part to play in the imbroglio."}, {"size": 622, "text": "Meantime, Dick had been thinking deeply and bitterly. It seemed to him as if his love had gone from him, indeed, yet gone but a little way; as if he needed but to find the right touch or intonation, and her heart would recognise him and be melted. Yet he durst not open his mouth, and drove in silence till they had passed the main park-gates and turned into the cross-cut lane along the wall. Then it seemed to him as if it must be now, or never. \u2018Can\u2019t you see you are killing me?\u2019 he cried. \u2018Speak to me, look at me, treat me like a human man.\u2019 She turned slowly and looked him in the face with eyes that seemed kinder."}, {"size": 843, "text": "He dropped the reins and caught her hand, and she made no resistance, although her touch was unresponsive.

Then there was no room left for doubt, and Dick saw, as clear as sunlight, that she had a distaste or nourished a grudge against him. \u2018Then you don\u2019t love me?\u2019 he said, drawing back from her, he also, as though her touch had burnt him; and then, as she made no answer, he repeated with another intonation, imperious and yet still pathetic, \u2018You don\u2019t love me, _do_ you, _do_ you?\u2019 \u2018I don\u2019t know,\u2019 she replied."}, {"size": 699, "text": "\u2018Why do you ask me?

This was a station isolated in the midst of moorlands, yet lying on the great up line to London. The nearest town, Thymebury itself, was seven miles distant along the branch they call the Vale of Thyme Railway.

Before the phaeton had driven off, the girl had entered the station and seated herself upon a bench.
