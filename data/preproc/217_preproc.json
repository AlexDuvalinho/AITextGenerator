Derelict THE EARLY MARRIED LIFE OF THE MORELS\u201cThe Bottoms\u201d succeeded to \u201cHell Row\u201d. Hell Row was a block of thatched, bulging cottages that stood by the brookside on Greenhill Lane. There lived the colliers who worked in the little gin-pits two fields away."}, {"size": 620, "text": "The brook ran under the alder trees, scarcely soiled by these small mines, whose coal was drawn to the surface by donkeys that plodded wearily in a circle round a gin. And all over the countryside were these same pits, some of which had been worked in the time of Charles II., the few colliers and the donkeys burrowing down like ants into the earth, making queer mounds and little black places among the corn-fields and the meadows. And the cottages of these coal-miners, in blocks and pairs here and there, together with odd farms and homes of the stockingers, straying over the parish, formed the village of Bestwood."}, {"size": 693, "text": "Then, some sixty years ago, a sudden change took place, gin-pits were elbowed aside by the large mines of the financiers. The coal and iron field of Nottinghamshire and Derbyshire was discovered. Carston, Waite and Co. appeared. Amid tremendous excitement, Lord Palmerston formally opened the company\u2019s first mine at Spinney Park, on the edge of Sherwood Forest. About this time the notorious Hell Row, which through growing old had acquired an evil reputation, was burned down, and much dirt was cleansed away. Carston, Waite and Co. found they had struck on a good thing, so, down the valleys of the brooks from Selby and Nuttall, new mines were sunk, until soon there were six pits working."}, {"size": 717, "text": "From Nuttall, high up on the sandstone among the woods, the railway ran, past the ruined priory of the Carthusians and past Robin Hood\u2019s Well, down to Spinney Park, then on to Minton, a large mine among corn-fields; from Minton across the farmlands of the valleyside to Bunker\u2019s Hill, branching off there, and running north to Beggarlee and Selby, that looks over at Crich and the hills of Derbyshire; six mines like black studs on the countryside, linked by a loop of fine chain, the railway. To accommodate the regiments of miners, Carston, Waite and Co. built the Squares, great quadrangles of dwellings on the hillside of Bestwood, and then, in the brook valley, on the site of Hell Row, they erected the Bottoms."}, {"size": 648, "text": "The Bottoms consisted of six blocks of miners\u2019 dwellings, two rows of three, like the dots on a blank-six domino, and twelve houses in a block. This double row of dwellings sat at the foot of the rather sharp slope from Bestwood, and looked out, from the attic windows at least, on the slow climb of the valley towards Selby. The houses themselves were substantial and very decent. One could walk all round, seeing little front gardens with auriculas and saxifrage in the shadow of the bottom block, sweet-williams and pinks in the sunny top block; seeing neat front windows, little porches, little privet hedges, and dormer windows for the attics."}, {"size": 619, "text": "But that was outside; that was the view on to the uninhabited parlours of all the colliers\u2019 wives. The dwelling-room, the kitchen, was at the back of the house, facing inward between the blocks, looking at a scrubby back garden, and then at the ash-pits. And between the rows, between the long lines of ash-pits, went the alley, where the children played and the women gossiped and the men smoked. So, the actual conditions of living in the Bottoms, that was so well built and that looked so nice, were quite unsavoury because people must live in the kitchen, and the kitchens opened on to that nasty alley of ash-pits."}, {"size": 647, "text": "Mrs. Morel was not anxious to move into the Bottoms, which was already twelve years old and on the downward path, when she descended to it from Bestwood. But it was the best she could do. Moreover, she had an end house in one of the top blocks, and thus had only one neighbour; on the other side an extra strip of garden. And, having an end house, she enjoyed a kind of aristocracy among the other women of the \u201cbetween\u201d houses, because her rent was five shillings and sixpence instead of five shillings a week. But this superiority in station was not much consolation to Mrs. Morel. She was thirty-one years old, and had been married eight years."}, {"size": 621, "text": "A rather small woman, of delicate mould but resolute bearing, she shrank a little from the first contact with the Bottoms women. She came down in the July, and in the September expected her third baby. Her husband was a miner. They had only been in their new home three weeks when the wakes, or fair, began. Morel, she knew, was sure to make a holiday of it. He went off early on the Monday morning, the day of the fair. The two children were highly excited. William, a boy of seven, fled off immediately after breakfast, to prowl round the wakes ground, leaving Annie, who was only five, to whine all morning to go also."}, {"size": 630, "text": "Mrs. Morel did her work. She scarcely knew her neighbours yet, and knew no one with whom to trust the little girl. So she promised to take her to the wakes after dinner. William appeared at half-past twelve. He was a very active lad, fair-haired, freckled, with a touch of the Dane or Norwegian about him. \u201cCan I have my dinner, mother?\u201d he cried, rushing in with his cap on. \u201c\u2019Cause it begins at half-past one, the man says so.\u201d \u201cYou can have your dinner as soon as it\u2019s done,\u201d replied the mother. \u201cIsn\u2019t it done?\u201d he cried, his blue eyes staring at her in indignation. \u201cThen I\u2019m goin\u2019 be-out it.\u201d \u201cYou\u2019ll do nothing of the sort."}, {"size": 613, "text": "It will be done in five minutes. It is only half-past twelve.\u201d \u201cThey\u2019ll be beginnin\u2019,\u201d the boy half cried, half shouted. \u201cYou won\u2019t die if they do,\u201d said the mother. \u201cBesides, it\u2019s only half-past twelve, so you\u2019ve a full hour.\u201d The lad began hastily to lay the table, and directly the three sat down. They were eating batter-pudding and jam, when the boy jumped off his chair and stood perfectly stiff. Some distance away could be heard the first small braying of a merry-go-round, and the tooting of a horn. His face quivered as he looked at his mother. \u201cI told you!\u201d he said, running to the dresser for his cap."}, {"size": 855, "text": "\u201cTake your pudding in your hand\u2014and it\u2019s only five past one, so you were wrong\u2014you haven\u2019t got your twopence,\u201d cried the mother in a breath. The boy came back, bitterly disappointed, for his twopence, then went off without a word. \u201cI want to go, I want to go,\u201d said Annie, beginning to cry. \u201cWell, and you shall go, whining, wizzening little stick!\u201d said the mother. And later in the afternoon she trudged up the hill under the tall hedge with her child. The hay was gathered from the fields, and cattle were turned on to the eddish. It was warm, peaceful. Mrs. Morel did not like the wakes. There were two sets of horses, one going by steam, one pulled round by a pony; three organs were grinding, and there came odd cracks of pistol-shots, fearful screeching of the cocoanut man\u2019s rattle, shouts of the Aunt Sally man, screeches from the peep-show lady."}, {"size": 648, "text": "The mother perceived her son gazing enraptured outside the Lion Wallace booth, at the pictures of this famous lion that had killed a negro and maimed for life two white men. She left him alone, and went to get Annie a spin of toffee. Presently the lad stood in front of her, wildly excited. \u201cYou never said you was coming\u2014isn\u2019t the\u2019 a lot of things?\u2014that lion\u2019s killed three men\u2014I\u2019ve spent my tuppence\u2014an\u2019 look here.\u201d He pulled from his pocket two egg-cups, with pink moss-roses on them. \u201cI got these from that stall where y\u2019ave ter get them marbles in them holes. An\u2019 I got these two in two goes-\u2019aepenny a go-they\u2019ve got moss-roses on, look here."}, {"size": 739, "text": "I wanted these.\u201d She knew he wanted them for her. \u201cH\u2019m!\u201d she said, pleased. \u201cThey _are_ pretty!\u201d \u201cShall you carry \u2019em, \u2019cause I\u2019m frightened o\u2019 breakin\u2019 \u2019em?\u201d He was tipful of excitement now she had come, led her about the ground, showed her everything. Then, at the peep-show, she explained the pictures, in a sort of story, to which he listened as if spellbound. He would not leave her. All the time he stuck close to her, bristling with a small boy\u2019s pride of her. For no other woman looked such a lady as she did, in her little black bonnet and her cloak. She smiled when she saw women she knew. When she was tired she said to her son: \u201cWell, are you coming now, or later?\u201d \u201cAre you goin\u2019 a\u2019ready?\u201d he cried, his face full of reproach."}, {"size": 624, "text": "\u201cAlready? It is past four, _I_ know.\u201d \u201cWhat are you goin\u2019 a\u2019ready for?\u201d he lamented. \u201cYou needn\u2019t come if you don\u2019t want,\u201d she said. And she went slowly away with her little girl, whilst her son stood watching her, cut to the heart to let her go, and yet unable to leave the wakes. As she crossed the open ground in front of the Moon and Stars she heard men shouting, and smelled the beer, and hurried a little, thinking her husband was probably in the bar. At about half-past six her son came home, tired now, rather pale, and somewhat wretched. He was miserable, though he did not know it, because he had let her go alone."}, {"size": 617, "text": "Since she had gone, he had not enjoyed his wakes. \u201cHas my dad been?\u201d he asked. \u201cNo,\u201d said the mother. \u201cHe\u2019s helping to wait at the Moon and Stars. I seed him through that black tin stuff wi\u2019 holes in, on the window, wi\u2019 his sleeves rolled up.\u201d \u201cHa!\u201d exclaimed the mother shortly. \u201cHe\u2019s got no money. An\u2019 he\u2019ll be satisfied if he gets his \u2019lowance, whether they give him more or not.\u201d When the light was fading, and Mrs. Morel could see no more to sew, she rose and went to the door. Everywhere was the sound of excitement, the restlessness of the holiday, that at last infected her. She went out into the side garden."}, {"size": 623, "text": "Women were coming home from the wakes, the children hugging a white lamb with green legs, or a wooden horse. Occasionally a man lurched past, almost as full as he could carry. Sometimes a good husband came along with his family, peacefully. But usually the women and children were alone. The stay-at-home mothers stood gossiping at the corners of the alley, as the twilight sank, folding their arms under their white aprons. Mrs. Morel was alone, but she was used to it. Her son and her little girl slept upstairs; so, it seemed, her home was there behind her, fixed and stable. But she felt wretched with the coming child."}, {"size": 622, "text": "The world seemed a dreary place, where nothing else would happen for her\u2014at least until William grew up. But for herself, nothing but this dreary endurance\u2014till the children grew up. And the children! She could not afford to have this third. She did not want it. The father was serving beer in a public house, swilling himself drunk. She despised him, and was tied to him. This coming child was too much for her. If it were not for William and Annie, she was sick of it, the struggle with poverty and ugliness and meanness. She went into the front garden, feeling too heavy to take herself out, yet unable to stay indoors."}, {"size": 632, "text": "The heat suffocated her. And looking ahead, the prospect of her life made her feel as if she were buried alive. The front garden was a small square with a privet hedge. There she stood, trying to soothe herself with the scent of flowers and the fading, beautiful evening. Opposite her small gate was the stile that led uphill, under the tall hedge between the burning glow of the cut pastures. The sky overhead throbbed and pulsed with light. The glow sank quickly off the field; the earth and the hedges smoked dusk. As it grew dark, a ruddy glare came out on the hilltop, and out of the glare the diminished commotion of the fair."}, {"size": 670, "text": "Sometimes, down the trough of darkness formed by the path under the hedges, men came lurching home. One young man lapsed into a run down the steep bit that ended the hill, and went with a crash into the stile. Mrs. Morel shuddered. He picked himself up, swearing viciously, rather pathetically, as if he thought the stile had wanted to hurt him. She went indoors, wondering if things were never going to alter. She was beginning by now to realise that they would not. She seemed so far away from her girlhood, she wondered if it were the same person walking heavily up the back garden at the Bottoms as had run so lightly up the breakwater at Sheerness ten years before."}, {"size": 644, "text": "\u201cWhat have _I_ to do with it?\u201d she said to herself. \u201cWhat have I to do with all this? Even the child I am going to have! It doesn\u2019t seem as if _I_ were taken into account.\u201d Sometimes life takes hold of one, carries the body along, accomplishes one\u2019s history, and yet is not real, but leaves oneself as it were slurred over. \u201cI wait,\u201d Mrs. Morel said to herself\u2014\u201cI wait, and what I wait for can never come.\u201d Then she straightened the kitchen, lit the lamp, mended the fire, looked out the washing for the next day, and put it to soak. After which she sat down to her sewing. Through the long hours her needle flashed regularly through the stuff."}, {"size": 631, "text": "Occasionally she sighed, moving to relieve herself. And all the time she was thinking how to make the most of what she had, for the children\u2019s sakes. At half-past eleven her husband came. His cheeks were very red and very shiny above his black moustache. His head nodded slightly. He was pleased with himself. \u201cOh! Oh! waitin\u2019 for me, lass?

He was extraordinarily pleased with himself, because of his day\u2019s helping to wait in the Moon and Stars. He chattered on. Mrs. Morel, very tired, and sick of his babble, went to bed as quickly as possible, while he raked the fire.

Gertrude resembled her mother in her small build. But her temper, proud and unyielding, she had from the Coppards. George Coppard was bitterly galled by his own poverty. He became foreman of the engineers in the dockyard at Sheerness. Mrs. Morel\u2014Gertrude\u2014was the second daughter.

She remembered the funny old mistress, whose assistant she had become, whom she had loved to help in the private school. And she still had the Bible that John Field had given her. She used to walk home from chapel with John Field when she was nineteen. He was the son of a well-to-do tradesman, had been to college in London, and was to devote himself to business."}, {"size": 680, "text": "She could always recall in detail a September Sunday afternoon, when they had sat under the vine at the back of her father\u2019s house.

She did not hear of him until, two years later, she made determined inquiry. He had married his landlady, a woman of forty, a widow with property.

His cheeks were ruddy, and his red, moist mouth was noticeable because he laughed so often and so heartily. He had that rare thing, a rich, ringing laugh.

What she liked most of all was an argument on religion or philosophy or politics with some educated man. This she did not often enjoy. So she always had people tell her about themselves, finding her pleasure so. In her person she was rather small and delicate, with a large brow, and dropping bunches of brown silk curls."}, {"size": 658, "text": "Her blue eyes were very straight, honest, and searching.

And George Coppard, proud in his bearing, handsome, and rather bitter; who preferred theology in reading, and who drew near in sympathy only to one man, the Apostle Paul; who was harsh in government, and in familiarity ironic; who ignored all sensuous pleasure:\u2014he was very different from the miner."}, {"size": 638, "text": "Gertrude herself was rather contemptuous of dancing; she had not the slightest inclination towards that accomplishment, and had never learned even a Roger de Coverley.

And out of so much, he scarcely spared the children an extra penny or bought them a pound of apples. It all went in drink.

If they had not helped her so generously in those times, Mrs. Morel would never have pulled through, without incurring debts that would have dragged her down. The weeks passed.

His wife was casting him off, half regretfully, but relentlessly; casting him off and turning now for love and life to the children. Henceforward he was more or less a husk.

Often she hurried him on, giving him a phrase in anticipation. And then he took her words humbly. The silences between them were peculiar. There would be the swift, slight \u201ccluck\u201d of her needle, the sharp \u201cpop\u201d of his lips as he let out the smoke, the warmth, the sizzle on the bars as he spat in the fire.

His soul would reach out in its blind way to her and find her gone. He felt a sort of emptiness, almost like a vacuum in his soul. He was unsettled and restless. Soon he could not live in that atmosphere, and he affected his wife. Both felt an oppression on their breathing when they were left together for some time."}, {"size": 610, "text": "Then he went to bed and she settled down to enjoy herself alone, working, thinking, living.

I sh\u2019ll come to thee in a minute.\u201d And as soon as he had taken off his pit-coat, Mrs. Morel would put an apron round the child, and give him to his father. \u201cWhat a sight the lad looks!\u201d she would exclaim sometimes, taking back the baby, that was smutted on the face from his father\u2019s kisses and play."}, {"size": 618, "text": "Then Morel laughed joyfully. \u201cHe\u2019s a little collier, bless his bit o\u2019 mutton!\u201d he exclaimed.

Meanwhile William grew bigger and stronger and more active, while Paul, always rather delicate and quiet, got slimmer, and trotted after his mother like her shadow. He was usually active and interested, but sometimes he would have fits of depression. Then the mother would find the boy of three or four crying on the sofa. \u201cWhat\u2019s the matter?\u201d she asked, and got no answer. \u201cWhat\u2019s the matter?\u201d she insisted, getting cross."}, {"size": 602, "text": "\u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d sobbed the child.

From some of them he had read extracts to his mother. Some of them she had taken the trouble to read herself. But most were too trivial.

And always Paul flew beside her, living her share of the game, having as yet no part of his own. He was quiet and not noticeable. But his sister adored him.

When William was growing up, the family moved from the Bottoms to a house on the brow of the hill, commanding a view of the valley, which spread out like a convex cockle-shell, or a clamp-shell, before it. In front of the house was a huge old ash-tree. The west wind, sweeping from Derbyshire, caught the houses with full force, and the tree shrieked again.

The winter of their first year in the new house their father was very bad. The children played in the street, on the brim of the wide, dark valley, until eight o\u2019clock. Then they went to bed. Their mother sat sewing below. Having such a great space in front of the house gave the children a feeling of night, of vastness, and of terror. This terror came in from the shrieking of the tree and the anguish of the home discord. Often Paul would wake up, after he had been asleep a long time, aware of thuds downstairs. Instantly he was wide awake. Then he heard the booming shouts of his father, come home nearly drunk, then the sharp replies of his mother, then the bang, bang of his father\u2019s fist on the table, and the nasty snarling shout as the man\u2019s voice got higher."}, {"size": 608, "text": "And then the whole was drowned in a piercing medley of shrieks and cries from the great, wind-swept ash-tree.

The women and children usually loitered about on the red gravel paths. Paul always examined the grass border, and the big grass bank, because in it grew tiny pansies and tiny forget-me-nots.

Paul divined that his master\u2019s bark was worse than his bite. Indeed, the little manufacturer, although he spoke bad English, was quite gentleman enough to leave his men alone and to take no notice of trifles.

She had such a short body on her high stool that her head, with its great bands of bright brown hair, seemed over large, as did her pale, heavy face. She wore a dress of green-black cashmere, and her wrists, coming out of the narrow cuffs, were thin and flat, as she put down her work nervously.

There was a titter of laughter. Paul went out, blushing deeply, not having spoken a word.The day was very long. All morning the work-people were coming to speak to Mr. Pappleworth. Paul was writing or learning to make up parcels, ready for the midday post. At one o\u2019clock, or, rather, at a quarter to one, Mr. Pappleworth disappeared to catch his train: he lived in the suburbs.

The brightness and the freedom of the streets made him feel adventurous and happy. But at two o\u2019clock he was back in the corner of the big room. Soon the work-girls went trooping past, making remarks. It was the commoner girls who worked upstairs at the heavy tasks of truss-making and the finishing of artificial limbs. He waited for Mr. Pappleworth, not knowing what to do, sitting scribbling on the yellow order-paper. Mr. Pappleworth came at twenty minutes to three. Then he sat and gossiped with Paul, treating the boy entirely as an equal, even in age.

And yet upstairs the atmosphere among them was always jolly and clear. The cellar and the trestles affected them. After tea, when all the gases were lighted, _work_ went more briskly. There was the big evening post to get off. The hose came up warm and newly pressed from the workrooms. Paul had made out the invoices. Now he had the packing up and addressing to do, then he had to weigh his stock of parcels on the scales."}, {"size": 698, "text": "Everywhere voices were calling weights, there was the chink of metal, the rapid snapping of string, the hurrying to old Mr. Melling for stamps.

The day in the factory was just twelve hours long. His mother sat waiting for him rather anxiously. He had to walk from Keston, so was not home until about twenty past nine. And he left the house before seven in the morning. Mrs. Morel was rather anxious about his health. But she herself had had to put up with so much that she expected her children to take the same odds."}, {"size": 607, "text": "They must go through with what came.

Sometimes the \u201cSpiral boss\u201d was irritable, and chewed more lozenges than ever. Even then, however, he was not offensive, but one of those people who hurt themselves by their own irritability more than they hurt other people. \u201cHaven\u2019t you done that _yet?_\u201d he would cry. \u201cGo on, be a month of Sundays.\u201d Again, and Paul could understand him least then, he was jocular and in high spirits. \u201cI\u2019m going to bring my little Yorkshire terrier bitch to-morrow,\u201d he said jubilantly to Paul."}, {"size": 655, "text": "\u201cWhat\u2019s a Yorkshire terrier?\u201d \u201c_Don\u2019t_ know what a Yorkshire terrier is? _Don\u2019t know a Yorkshire_\u2014\u201d Mr. Pappleworth was aghast. \u201cIs it a little silky one\u2014colours of iron and rusty silver?\u201d \u201c_That\u2019s_ it, my lad. She\u2019s a gem. She\u2019s had five pounds\u2019 worth of pups already, and she\u2019s worth over seven pounds herself; and she doesn\u2019t weigh twenty ounces.\u201d The next day the bitch came. She was a shivering, miserable morsel. Paul did not care for her; she seemed so like a wet rag that would never dry. Then a man called for her, and began to make coarse jokes. But Mr. Pappleworth nodded his head in the direction of the boy, and the talk went on _sotto voce_."}, {"size": 674, "text": "Mr. Jordan only made one more excursion to watch Paul, and then the only fault he found was seeing the boy lay his pen on the counter. \u201cPut your pen in your ear, if you\u2019re going to be a clerk.

Come down here,\u201d when he took him into the glass office and fitted him with special braces for keeping the shoulders square. But Paul liked the girls best. The men seemed common and rather dull. He liked them all, but they were uninteresting.

He was not very tall, and pale, with thick chestnut hair, irregular features, and a wide, full mouth. She was like a small bird. He often called her a \u201crobinet\u201d.

Polly he felt he belonged to. Then Connie, with her mane of red hair, her face of apple-blossom, her murmuring voice, such a lady in her shabby black frock, appealed to his romantic side. \u201cWhen you sit winding,\u201d he said, \u201cit looks as if you were spinning at a spinning-wheel\u2014it looks ever so nice.

With Louie, handsome and brazen, who always seemed to thrust her hip at him, he usually joked. Emma was rather plain, rather old, and condescending.

Marlpool and Heanor scattered the far-off darkness with brilliance. And occasionally the black valley space between was traced, violated by a great train rushing south to London or north to Scotland.

His dark brown hair and fresh colouring, and his exquisite dark blue eyes shaded with long lashes, together with his generous manner and fiery temper, made him a favourite.

Again, going down the hedgeside with the girl, he noticed the celandines, scalloped splashes of gold, on the side of the ditch. \u201cI like them,\u201d he said, \u201cwhen their petals go flat back with the sunshine.

So it was in this atmosphere of subtle intimacy, this meeting in their common feeling for something in Nature, that their love started. Personally, he was a long time before he realised her.

They kindled him and made him glow to his work, whereas his mother\u2019s influence was to make him quietly determined, patient, dogged, unwearied. He soon was friends with the boys, whose rudeness was only superficial. They had all, when they could trust themselves, a strange gentleness and lovableness. \u201cWill you come with me on to the fallow?\u201d asked Edgar, rather hesitatingly."}, {"size": 734, "text": "Paul went joyfully, and spent the afternoon helping to hoe or to single turnips with his friend.

By the time they came to the pine-trees Miriam was getting very eager and very tense. Her bush might be gone. She might not be able to find it; and she wanted it so much.

The men did all the discussing of farm matters outside.

He was a prayer along with her."}, {"size": 689, "text": "Miriam very rarely talked to the other lads. They at once became awkward in conversation with her. So usually she was silent. It was past midday when they climbed the steep path to the manor. All things shone softly in the sun, which was wonderfully warm and enlivening. Celandines and violets were out. Everybody was tip-top full with happiness. The glitter of the ivy, the soft, atmospheric grey of the castle walls, the gentleness of everything near the ruin, was perfect.

Here on the pavement, where the hall had been, an old thorn tree was budding. All kinds of strange openings and broken rooms were in the shadow around them. After lunch they set off once more to explore the ruin. This time the girls went with the boys, who could act as guides and expositors.

As they were crossing a large meadow that sloped away from the sun, along a path embedded with innumerable tiny glittering points, Paul, walking alongside, laced his fingers in the strings of the bag Miriam was carrying, and instantly she felt Annie behind, watchful and jealous.

Great expanse of country spread around and below. The lads were eager to get to the top of the hill.

The lads were eager to spy out the church of Bestwood, far away among the rather crowded country on the left. They were disgusted that it seemed to stand on a plain.

She had an elder sister, Agatha, who was a school-teacher. Between the two girls was a feud. Miriam considered Agatha worldly. And she wanted herself to be a school-teacher.

The two sisters did not talk much to each other. Agatha, who was fair and small and determined, had rebelled against the home atmosphere, against the doctrine of \u201cthe other cheek\u201d.

And he had a similar defiance in his bearing and manner. But then came the difference. His eyes, dark brown and quick-shifting, were dissolute.

The boy glanced away. But the smith used to stand behind the counter and talk to Mr. Pappleworth. His speech was dirty, with a kind of rottenness.

She had a fire in the parlour, and was waiting for him. The others, except her father and mother and the young children, had gone out, so the two had the parlour together.

She looked rather stately and reserved. \u201cYou have gone to live down Sneinton Boulevard?\u201d said Mrs. Morel. \u201cWhen I was a girl\u2014girl, I say!\u2014when I was a young woman _we_ lived in Minerva Terrace.\u201d \u201cOh, did you!\u201d said Clara."}, {"size": 721, "text": "\u201cI have a friend in number 6.\u201d And the conversation had started.

But they were going to get on well together, Paul saw. Mrs. Morel measured herself against the younger woman, and found herself easily stronger. Clara was deferential. She knew Paul\u2019s surprising regard for his mother, and she had dreaded the meeting, expecting someone rather hard and cold.

At tea Clara felt the refinement and sang-froid of the household. Mrs. Morel was perfectly at her ease. The pouring out the tea and attending to the people went on unconsciously, without interrupting her in her talk. There was a lot of room at the oval table; the china of dark blue willow-pattern looked pretty on the glossy cloth."}, {"size": 647, "text": "There was a little bowl of small, yellow chrysanthemums.

It was a cool, clear atmosphere, where everyone was himself, and in harmony. Clara enjoyed it, but there was a fear deep at the bottom of her.

Clara glanced through the window after him as he loitered among the chrysanthemums.

He was so humble before her. She kissed him fervently on the eyes, first one, then the other, and she folded herself to him. She gave herself. He held her fast.

Her sacrifice, then, was useless. He lay there aloof, careless about her. Suddenly she saw again his lack of religion, his restless instability. He would destroy himself like a perverse child. Well, then, he would! \u201cI think I must go,\u201d she said softly. By her tone he knew she was despising him. He rose quietly. \u201cI\u2019ll come along with you,\u201d he answered. She stood before the mirror pinning on her hat. How bitter, how unutterably bitter, it made her that he rejected her sacrifice! Life ahead looked dead, as if the glow were gone out."}, {"size": 630, "text": "She bowed her face over the flowers\u2014the freesias so sweet and spring-like, the scarlet anemones flaunting over the table. It was like him to have those flowers. He moved about the room with a certain sureness of touch, swift and relentless and quiet. She knew she could not cope with him. He would escape like a weasel out of her hands. Yet without him her life would trail on lifeless. Brooding, she touched the flowers. \u201cHave them!\u201d he said; and he took them out of the jar, dripping as they were, and went quickly into the kitchen. She waited for him, took the flowers, and they went out together, he talking, she feeling dead."}, {"size": 630, "text": "She was going from him now. In her misery she leaned against him as they sat on the car. He was unresponsive. Where would he go? What would be the end of him? She could not bear it, the vacant feeling where he should be. He was so foolish, so wasteful, never at peace with himself. And now where would he go? And what did he care that he wasted her? He had no religion; it was all for the moment\u2019s attraction that he cared, nothing else, nothing deeper. Well, she would wait and see how it turned out with him. When he had had enough he would give in and come to her. He shook hands and left her at the door of her cousin\u2019s house."}, {"size": 652, "text": "When he turned away he felt the last hold for him had gone. The town, as he sat upon the car, stretched away over the bay of railway, a level fume of lights. Beyond the town the country, little smouldering spots for more towns\u2014the sea\u2014the night\u2014on and on! And he had no place in it! Whatever spot he stood on, there he stood alone. From his breast, from his mouth, sprang the endless space, and it was there behind him, everywhere. The people hurrying along the streets offered no obstruction to the void in which he found himself. They were small shadows whose footsteps and voices could be heard, but in each of them the same night, the same silence."}, {"size": 637, "text": "He got off the car. In the country all was dead still. Little stars shone high up; little stars spread far away in the flood-waters, a firmament below. Everywhere the vastness and terror of the immense night which is roused and stirred for a brief while by the day, but which returns, and will remain at last eternal, holding everything in its silence and its living gloom. There was no Time, only Space. Who could say his mother had lived and did not live? She had been in one place, and was in another; that was all. And his soul could not leave her, wherever she was. Now she was gone abroad into the night, and he was with her still."}, {"size": 657, "text": "They were together. But yet there was his body, his chest, that leaned against the stile, his hands on the wooden bar. They seemed something. Where was he?\u2014one tiny upright speck of flesh, less than an ear of wheat lost in the field. He could not bear it. On every side the immense dark silence seemed pressing him, so tiny a spark, into extinction, and yet, almost nothing, he could not be extinct. Night, in which everything was lost, went reaching out, beyond stars and sun. Stars and sun, a few bright grains, went spinning round for terror, and holding each other in embrace, there in a darkness that outpassed them all, and left them tiny and daunted."}, {"size": 546, "text": "So much, and himself, infinitesimal, at the core a nothingness, and yet not nothing. \u201cMother!\u201d he whimpered\u2014\u201cmother!\u201d She was the only thing that held him up, himself, amid all this. And she was gone, intermingled herself. He wanted her to touch him, have him alongside with her. But no, he would not give in. Turning sharply, he walked towards the city\u2019s gold phosphorescence. His fists were shut, his mouth set fast. He would not take that direction, to the darkness, to follow her. He walked towards the faintly humming, glowing town, quickly."}]}
