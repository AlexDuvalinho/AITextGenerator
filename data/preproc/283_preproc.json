Please don\u2019t come till thirtieth. Anna.\u201dAll the way from Charing Cross to Dover the train had hammered the words of the telegram into George Darrow\u2019s ears, ringing every change of irony on its commonplace syllables: rattling them out like a discharge of musketry, letting them, one by one, drip slowly and coldly into his brain, or shaking, tossing, transposing them like the dice in some game of the gods of malice; and now, as he emerged from his compartment at the pier, and stood facing the wind-swept platform and the angry sea beyond, they leapt out at him as if from the crest of the waves, stung and blinded him with a fresh fury of derision."}, {"size": 790, "text": "\u201cUnexpected obstacle. Please don\u2019t come till thirtieth. Anna.\u201d She had put him off at the very last moment, and for the second time: put him off with all her sweet reasonableness, and for one of her usual \u201cgood\u201d reasons--he was certain that this reason, like the other, (the visit of her husband\u2019s uncle\u2019s widow) would be \u201cgood\u201d! But it was that very certainty which chilled him. The fact of her dealing so reasonably with their case shed an ironic light on the idea that there had been any exceptional warmth in the greeting she had given him after their twelve years apart. They had found each other again, in London, some three months previously, at a dinner at the American Embassy, and when she had caught sight of him her smile had been like a red rose pinned on her widow\u2019s mourning."}, {"size": 774, "text": "He still felt the throb of surprise with which, among the stereotyped faces of the season\u2019s diners, he had come upon her unexpected face, with the dark hair banded above grave eyes; eyes in which he had recognized every little curve and shadow as he would have recognized, after half a life-time, the details of a room he had played in as a child. And as, in the plumed starred crowd, she had stood out for him, slender, secluded and different, so he had felt, the instant their glances met, that he as sharply detached himself for her. All that and more her smile had said; had said not merely \u201cI remember,\u201d but \u201cI remember just what you remember\u201d; almost, indeed, as though her memory had aided his, her glance flung back on their recaptured moment its morning brightness."}, {"size": 729, "text": "Certainly, when their distracted Ambassadress--with the cry: \u201cOh, you know Mrs. Leath? That\u2019s perfect, for General Farnham has failed me\u201d--had waved them together for the march to the dining-room, Darrow had felt a slight pressure of the arm on his, a pressure faintly but unmistakably emphasizing the exclamation: \u201cIsn\u2019t it wonderful?--In London--in the season--in a mob?\u201d Little enough, on the part of most women; but it was a sign of Mrs. Leath\u2019s quality that every movement, every syllable, told with her. Even in the old days, as an intent grave-eyed girl, she had seldom misplaced her light strokes; and Darrow, on meeting her again, had immediately felt how much finer and surer an instrument of expression she had become."}, {"size": 736, "text": "Their evening together had been a long confirmation of this feeling. She had talked to him, shyly yet frankly, of what had happened to her during the years when they had so strangely failed to meet. She had told him of her marriage to Fraser Leath, and of her subsequent life in France, where her husband\u2019s mother, left a widow in his youth, had been re-married to the Marquis de Chantelle, and where, partly in consequence of this second union, the son had permanently settled himself. She had spoken also, with an intense eagerness of affection, of her little girl Effie, who was now nine years old, and, in a strain hardly less tender, of Owen Leath, the charming clever young stepson whom her husband\u2019s death had left to her care..."}, {"size": 694, "text": "A porter, stumbling against Darrow\u2019s bags, roused him to the fact that he still obstructed the platform, inert and encumbering as his luggage. Was he crossing? He really didn\u2019t know; but for lack of any more compelling impulse he followed the porter to the luggage van, singled out his property, and turned to march behind it down the gang-way. As the fierce wind shouldered him, building up a crystal wall against his efforts, he felt anew the derision of his case. \u201cNasty weather to cross, sir,\u201d the porter threw back at him as they beat their way down the narrow walk to the pier. Nasty weather, indeed; but luckily, as it had turned out, there was no earthly reason why Darrow should cross."}, {"size": 818, "text": "While he pushed on in the wake of his luggage his thoughts slipped back into the old groove. He had once or twice run across the man whom Anna Summers had preferred to him, and since he had met her again he had been exercising his imagination on the picture of what her married life must have been. Her husband had struck him as a characteristic specimen of the kind of American as to whom one is not quite clear whether he lives in Europe in order to cultivate an art, or cultivates an art as a pretext for living in Europe. Mr. Leath\u2019s art was water-colour painting, but he practised it furtively, almost clandestinely, with the disdain of a man of the world for anything bordering on the professional, while he devoted himself more openly, and with religious seriousness, to the collection of enamelled snuff-boxes."}, {"size": 813, "text": "He was blond and well-dressed, with the physical distinction that comes from having a straight figure, a thin nose, and the habit of looking slightly disgusted--as who should not, in a world where authentic snuff-boxes were growing daily harder to find, and the market was flooded with flagrant forgeries? Darrow had often wondered what possibilities of communion there could have been between Mr. Leath and his wife. Now he concluded that there had probably been none. Mrs. Leath\u2019s words gave no hint of her husband\u2019s having failed to justify her choice; but her very reticence betrayed her. She spoke of him with a kind of impersonal seriousness, as if he had been a character in a novel or a figure in history; and what she said sounded as though it had been learned by heart and slightly dulled by repetition."}, {"size": 619, "text": "This fact immensely increased Darrow\u2019s impression that his meeting with her had annihilated the intervening years. She, who was always so elusive and inaccessible, had grown suddenly communicative and kind: had opened the doors of her past, and tacitly left him to draw his own conclusions. As a result, he had taken leave of her with the sense that he was a being singled out and privileged, to whom she had entrusted something precious to keep. It was her happiness in their meeting that she had given him, had frankly left him to do with as he willed; and the frankness of the gesture doubled the beauty of the gift."}, {"size": 885, "text": "Their next meeting had prolonged and deepened the impression. They had found each other again, a few days later, in an old country house full of books and pictures, in the soft landscape of southern England. The presence of a large party, with all its aimless and agitated displacements, had served only to isolate the pair and give them (at least to the young man\u2019s fancy) a deeper feeling of communion, and their days there had been like some musical prelude, where the instruments, breathing low, seem to hold back the waves of sound that press against them. Mrs. Leath, on this occasion, was no less kind than before; but she contrived to make him understand that what was so inevitably coming was not to come too soon. It was not that she showed any hesitation as to the issue, but rather that she seemed to wish not to miss any stage in the gradual reflowering of their intimacy."}, {"size": 790, "text": "Darrow, for his part, was content to wait if she wished it. He remembered that once, in America, when she was a girl, and he had gone to stay with her family in the country, she had been out when he arrived, and her mother had told him to look for her in the garden. She was not in the garden, but beyond it he had seen her approaching down a long shady path. Without hastening her step she had smiled and signed to him to wait; and charmed by the lights and shadows that played upon her as she moved, and by the pleasure of watching her slow advance toward him, he had obeyed her and stood still. And so she seemed now to be walking to him down the years, the light and shade of old memories and new hopes playing variously on her, and each step giving him the vision of a different grace."}, {"size": 800, "text": "She did not waver or turn aside; he knew she would come straight to where he stood; but something in her eyes said \u201cWait\u201d, and again he obeyed and waited. On the fourth day an unexpected event threw out his calculations. Summoned to town by the arrival in England of her husband\u2019s mother, she left without giving Darrow the chance he had counted on, and he cursed himself for a dilatory blunderer. Still, his disappointment was tempered by the certainty of being with her again before she left for France; and they did in fact see each other in London. There, however, the atmosphere had changed with the conditions. He could not say that she avoided him, or even that she was a shade less glad to see him; but she was beset by family duties and, as he thought, a little too readily resigned to them."}, {"size": 626, "text": "The Marquise de Chantelle, as Darrow soon perceived, had the same mild formidableness as the late Mr. Leath: a sort of insistent self-effacement before which every one about her gave way. It was perhaps the shadow of this lady\u2019s presence--pervasive even during her actual brief eclipses--that subdued and silenced Mrs. Leath. The latter was, moreover, preoccupied about her stepson, who, soon after receiving his degree at Harvard, had been rescued from a stormy love-affair, and finally, after some months of troubled drifting, had yielded to his step-mother\u2019s counsel and gone up to Oxford for a year of supplementary study."}, {"size": 614, "text": "Thither Mrs. Leath went once or twice to visit him, and her remaining days were packed with family obligations: getting, as she phrased it, \u201cfrocks and governesses\u201d for her little girl, who had been left in France, and having to devote the remaining hours to long shopping expeditions with her mother-in-law. Nevertheless, during her brief escapes from duty, Darrow had had time to feel her safe in the custody of his devotion, set apart for some inevitable hour; and the last evening, at the theatre, between the overshadowing Marquise and the unsuspicious Owen, they had had an almost decisive exchange of words."}, {"size": 665, "text": "Now, in the rattle of the wind about his ears, Darrow continued to hear the mocking echo of her message: \u201cUnexpected obstacle.\u201d In such an existence as Mrs. Leath\u2019s, at once so ordered and so exposed, he knew how small a complication might assume the magnitude of an \u201cobstacle;\u201d yet, even allowing as impartially as his state of mind permitted for the fact that, with her mother-in-law always, and her stepson intermittently, under her roof, her lot involved a hundred small accommodations generally foreign to the freedom of widowhood--even so, he could not but think that the very ingenuity bred of such conditions might have helped her to find a way out of them."}, {"size": 796, "text": "No, her \u201creason\u201d, whatever it was, could, in this case, be nothing but a pretext; unless he leaned to the less flattering alternative that any reason seemed good enough for postponing him! Certainly, if her welcome had meant what he imagined, she could not, for the second time within a few weeks, have submitted so tamely to the disarrangement of their plans; a disarrangement which--his official duties considered--might, for all she knew, result in his not being able to go to her for months. \u201cPlease don\u2019t come till thirtieth.\u201d The thirtieth--and it was now the fifteenth! She flung back the fortnight on his hands as if he had been an idler indifferent to dates, instead of an active young diplomatist who, to respond to her call, had had to hew his way through a very jungle of engagements!"}, {"size": 685, "text": "\u201cPlease don\u2019t come till thirtieth.\u201d That was all. Not the shadow of an excuse or a regret; not even the perfunctory \u201chave written\u201d with which it is usual to soften such blows. She didn\u2019t want him, and had taken the shortest way to tell him so. Even in his first moment of exasperation it struck him as characteristic that she should not have padded her postponement with a fib. Certainly her moral angles were not draped! \u201cIf I asked her to marry me, she\u2019d have refused in the same language. But thank heaven I haven\u2019t!\u201d he reflected. These considerations, which had been with him every yard of the way from London, reached a climax of irony as he was drawn into the crowd on the pier."}, {"size": 824, "text": "It did not soften his feelings to remember that, but for her lack of forethought, he might, at this harsh end of the stormy May day, have been sitting before his club fire in London instead of shivering in the damp human herd on the pier. Admitting the sex\u2019s traditional right to change, she might at least have advised him of hers by telegraphing directly to his rooms. But in spite of their exchange of letters she had apparently failed to note his address, and a breathless emissary had rushed from the Embassy to pitch her telegram into his compartment as the train was moving from the station. Yes, he had given her chance enough to learn where he lived; and this minor proof of her indifference became, as he jammed his way through the crowd, the main point of his grievance against her and of his derision of himself."}, {"size": 741, "text": "Half way down the pier the prod of an umbrella increased his exasperation by rousing him to the fact that it was raining. Instantly the narrow ledge became a battle-ground of thrusting, slanting, parrying domes. The wind rose with the rain, and the harried wretches exposed to this double assault wreaked on their neighbours the vengeance they could not take on the elements. Darrow, whose healthy enjoyment of life made him in general a good traveller, tolerant of agglutinated humanity, felt himself obscurely outraged by these promiscuous contacts. It was as though all the people about him had taken his measure and known his plight; as though they were contemptuously bumping and shoving him like the inconsiderable thing he had become."}, {"size": 694, "text": "\u201cShe doesn\u2019t want you, doesn\u2019t want you, doesn\u2019t want you,\u201d their umbrellas and their elbows seemed to say. He had rashly vowed, when the telegram was flung into his window: \u201cAt any rate I won\u2019t turn back\u201d--as though it might cause the sender a malicious joy to have him retrace his steps rather than keep on to Paris! Now he perceived the absurdity of the vow, and thanked his stars that he need not plunge, to no purpose, into the fury of waves outside the harbour. With this thought in his mind he turned back to look for his porter; but the contiguity of dripping umbrellas made signalling impossible and, perceiving that he had lost sight of the man, he scrambled up again to the platform."}, {"size": 824, "text": "As he reached it, a descending umbrella caught him in the collar-bone; and the next moment, bent sideways by the wind, it turned inside out and soared up, kite-wise, at the end of a helpless female arm. Darrow caught the umbrella, lowered its inverted ribs, and looked up at the face it exposed to him. \u201cWait a minute,\u201d he said; \u201cyou can\u2019t stay here.\u201d As he spoke, a surge of the crowd drove the owner of the umbrella abruptly down on him. Darrow steadied her with extended arms, and regaining her footing she cried out: \u201cOh, dear, oh, dear! It\u2019s in ribbons!\u201d Her lifted face, fresh and flushed in the driving rain, woke in him a memory of having seen it at a distant time and in a vaguely unsympathetic setting; but it was no moment to follow up such clues, and the face was obviously one to make its way on its own merits."}, {"size": 605, "text": "Its possessor had dropped her bag and bundles to clutch at the tattered umbrella. \u201cI bought it only yesterday at the Stores; and--yes--it\u2019s utterly done for!\u201d she lamented. Darrow smiled at the intensity of her distress. It was food for the moralist that, side by side with such catastrophes as his, human nature was still agitating itself over its microscopic woes! \u201cHere\u2019s mine if you want it!\u201d he shouted back at her through the shouting of the gale. The offer caused the young lady to look at him more intently. \u201cWhy, it\u2019s Mr. Darrow!\u201d she exclaimed; and then, all radiant recognition: \u201cOh, thank you!"}, {"size": 645, "text": "We\u2019ll share it, if you will.\u201d She knew him, then; and he knew her; but how and where had they met? He put aside the problem for subsequent solution, and drawing her into a more sheltered corner, bade her wait till he could find his porter. When, a few minutes later, he came back with his recovered property, and the news that the boat would not leave till the tide had turned, she showed no concern. \u201cNot for two hours? How lucky--then I can find my trunk!\u201d Ordinarily Darrow would have felt little disposed to involve himself in the adventure of a young female who had lost her trunk; but at the moment he was glad of any pretext for activity."}, {"size": 609, "text": "Even should he decide to take the next up train from Dover he still had a yawning hour to fill; and the obvious remedy was to devote it to the loveliness in distress under his umbrella. \u201cYou\u2019ve lost a trunk?

He had immediately classed her as a compatriot; her small nose, her clear tints, a kind of sketchy delicacy in her face, as though she had been brightly but lightly washed in with water-colour, all confirmed the evidence of her high sweet voice and of her quick incessant gestures."}, {"size": 777, "text": "She was clearly an American, but with the loose native quality strained through a closer woof of manners: the composite product of an enquiring and adaptable race. All this, however, did not help him to fit a name to her, for just such instances were perpetually pouring through the London Embassy, and the etched and angular American was becoming rarer than the fluid type. More puzzling than the fact of his being unable to identify her was the persistent sense connecting her with something uncomfortable and distasteful. So pleasant a vision as that gleaming up at him between wet brown hair and wet brown boa should have evoked only associations as pleasing; but each effort to fit her image into his past resulted in the same memories of boredom and a vague discomfort..."}, {"size": 854, "text": "\u201cDon\u2019t you remember me now--at Mrs. Murrett\u2019s?\u201d She threw the question at Darrow across a table of the quiet coffee-room to which, after a vainly prolonged quest for her trunk, he had suggested taking her for a cup of tea.In this musty retreat she had removed her dripping hat, hung it on the fender to dry, and stretched herself on tiptoe in front of the round eagle-crowned mirror, above the mantel vases of dyed immortelles, while she ran her fingers comb-wise through her hair. The gesture had acted on Darrow\u2019s numb feelings as the glow of the fire acted on his circulation; and when he had asked: \u201cAren\u2019t your feet wet, too?\u201d and, after frank inspection of a stout-shod sole, she had answered cheerfully: \u201cNo--luckily I had on my new boots,\u201d he began to feel that human intercourse would still be tolerable if it were always as free from formality."}, {"size": 696, "text": "The removal of his companion\u2019s hat, besides provoking this reflection, gave him his first full sight of her face; and this was so favourable that the name she now pronounced fell on him with a quite disproportionate shock of dismay. \u201cOh, Mrs. Murrett\u2019s--was it THERE?\u201d He remembered her now, of course: remembered her as one of the shadowy sidling presences in the background of that awful house in Chelsea, one of the dumb appendages of the shrieking unescapable Mrs. Murrett, into whose talons he had fallen in the course of his head-long pursuit of Lady Ulrica Crispin. Oh, the taste of stale follies! How insipid it was, yet how it clung! \u201cI used to pass you on the stairs,\u201d she reminded him."}, {"size": 638, "text": "Yes: he had seen her slip by--he recalled it now--as he dashed up to the drawing-room in quest of Lady Ulrica. The thought made him steal a longer look. How could such a face have been merged in the Murrett mob? Its fugitive slanting lines, that lent themselves to all manner of tender tilts and foreshortenings, had the freakish grace of some young head of the Italian comedy. The hair stood up from her forehead in a boyish elf-lock, and its colour matched her auburn eyes flecked with black, and the little brown spot on her cheek, between the ear that was meant to have a rose behind it and the chin that should have rested on a ruff."}, {"size": 687, "text": "When she smiled, the left corner of her mouth went up a little higher than the right; and her smile began in her eyes and ran down to her lips in two lines of light.

Her youthful history might, in fact, have been summed up in the statement that everybody had been too busy to look after her. Her guardian, a drudge in a big banking house, was absorbed by \u201cthe office\u201d; the guardian\u2019s wife, by her health and her religion; and an elder sister, Laura, married, unmarried, remarried, and pursuing,"}, {"size": 889, "text": "through all these alternating phases, some vaguely \u201cartistic\u201d ideal on which the guardian and his wife looked askance, had (as Darrow conjectured) taken their disapproval as a pretext for not troubling herself about poor Sophy, to whom--perhaps for this reason--she had remained the incarnation of remote romantic possibilities. In the course of time a sudden \u201cstroke\u201d of the guardian\u2019s had thrown his personal affairs into a state of confusion from which--after his widely lamented death--it became evident that it would not be possible to extricate his ward\u2019s inheritance.

She had first landed--thanks to the intervention of the ladies who had directed her education--in a Fifth Avenue school-room where, for a few months, she acted as a buffer between three autocratic infants and their bodyguard of nurses and teachers. The too-pressing attentions of their father\u2019s valet had caused her to fly this sheltered spot, against the express advice of her educational superiors, who implied that, in their own case, refinement and self-respect had always sufficed to keep the most ungovernable passions at bay."}, {"size": 888, "text": "The experience of the guardian\u2019s widow having been precisely similar, and the deplorable precedent of Laura\u2019s career being present to all their minds, none of these ladies felt any obligation to intervene farther in Sophy\u2019s affairs; and she was accordingly left to her own resources. A schoolmate from the Rocky Mountains, who was taking her father and mother to Europe, had suggested Sophy\u2019s accompanying them, and \u201cgoing round\u201d with her while her progenitors, in the care of the courier, nursed their ailments at a fashionable bath. Darrow gathered that the \u201cgoing round\u201d with Mamie Hoke was a varied and diverting process; but this relatively brilliant phase of Sophy\u2019s career was cut short by the elopement of the inconsiderate Mamie with a \u201cmatinee idol\u201d who had followed her from New York, and by the precipitate return of her parents to negotiate for the repurchase of their child."}, {"size": 766, "text": "It was then--after an interval of repose with compassionate but impecunious American friends in Paris--that Miss Viner had been drawn into the turbid current of Mrs. Murrett\u2019s career.

The Farlows, she explained to Darrow, were the best friends she had ever had (and the only ones who had ever \u201cbeen decent\u201d about Laura, whom they had seen once, and intensely admired); but even after twenty years of Paris they were the most incorrigibly inexperienced angels, and quite persuaded that Mrs."}, {"size": 614, "text": "Murrett was a woman of great intellectual eminence, and the house at Chelsea \u201cthe last of the salons\u201d--Darrow knew what she meant?

She did not even turn her head to look out; her eyes continued to rest on him with a vague smile which appeared to light her face from within, while her lips kept their sleepy droop.

Miss Viner\u2019s head sank back against the cushion, pushing out a dusky wave of hair above her forehead.

As he looked back at their few days together he saw that their intercourse had been marked, on her part, by the same hesitations and reserves which had chilled their earlier intimacy.

Why had it happened thus, when the least shifting of influences might have made it all so different?

Musing thus, he had the sense of waste that is the bitterest harvest of experience. A love like his might have given her the divine gift of self-renewal; and now he saw her fated to wane into old age repeating the same gestures, echoing the words she had always heard, and perhaps never guessing that, just outside her glazed and curtained consciousness, life rolled away, a vast blackness starred with lights, like the night landscape beyond the windows of the train."}, {"size": 519, "text": "The engine lowered its speed for the passage through a sleeping station.

At the theatre her vivacity sank into a breathless hush, and she sat intent in her corner of their baignoire, with the gaze of a neophyte about to be initiated into the sacred mysteries.

His interest in it had hitherto been merely that of the cultivated young man curious of all forms of artistic expression; but in reply to her questions he found things to say about it which evidently struck his listener as impressive and original, and with which he himself was not, on the whole, dissatisfied. Miss Viner was much more concerned to hear his views than to express her own, and the deference with which she received his comments called from him more ideas about the theatre than he had ever supposed himself to possess."}, {"size": 761, "text": "With the second act she began to give more attention to the development of the play, though her interest was excited rather by what she called \u201cthe story\u201d than by the conflict of character producing it.

On the latter point some of her enquiries were of a kind that it is not in the habit of young girls to make, or even to know how to make; but her apparent unconsciousness of the fact seemed rather to reflect on her past associates than on herself.

Sophy\u2019s face came back to him insistently. It was as vivid now as Mrs. Leath\u2019s had been a moment earlier.

His own case was irremediable, but it was easy enough to give her a few more hours of pleasure. And did she not perhaps secretly expect it of him? After all, if she had been very anxious to join her friends she would have telegraphed them on reaching Paris, instead of writing. He wondered now that he had not been struck at the moment by so artless a device to gain more time. The fact of her having practised it did not make him think less well of her; it merely strengthened the impulse to use his opportunity.

He dropped back into his chair, lit a cigar, and smiled a little at the image of her smiling face.

He leaned back impatiently, stifling another yawn, and trying to fix his attention on the stage. Great things were going forward there, and he was not insensible to the stern beauties of the ancient drama. But the interpretation of the play seemed to him as airless and lifeless as the atmosphere of the theatre."}, {"size": 714, "text": "The players were the same whom he had often applauded in those very parts, and perhaps that fact added to the impression of staleness and conventionality produced by their performance. Surely it was time to infuse new blood into the veins of the moribund art. He had the impression that the ghosts of actors were giving a spectral performance on the shores of Styx. Certainly it was not the most profitable way for a young man with a pretty companion to pass the golden hours of a spring afternoon. The freshness of the face at his side, reflecting the freshness of the season, suggested dapplings of sunlight through new leaves, the sound of a brook in the grass, the ripple of tree-shadows over breezy meadows..."}, {"size": 670, "text": "When at length the fateful march of the cothurns was stayed by the single pause in the play, and Darrow had led Miss Viner out on the balcony overhanging the square before the theatre, he turned to see if she shared his feelings.

But she was evidently unused to analyzing her aesthetic emotions, and the tumultuous rush of the drama seemed to have left her in a state of panting wonder, as though it had been a storm or some other natural cataclysm. She had no literary or historic associations to which to attach her impressions: her education had evidently not comprised a course in Greek literature. But she felt what would probably have been unperceived by many a young lady who had taken a first in classics: the ineluctable fatality of the tale, the dread sway in it of the same mysterious \u201cluck\u201d which pulled the threads of her own small destiny."}, {"size": 750, "text": "It was not literature to her, it was fact: as actual, as near by, as what was happening to her at the moment and what the next hour held in store. Seen in this light, the play regained for Darrow its supreme and poignant reality. He pierced to the heart of its significance through all the artificial accretions with which his theories of art and the conventions of the stage had clothed it, and saw it as he had never seen it: as life. After this there could be no question of flight, and he took her back to the theatre, content to receive his own sensations through the medium of hers. But with the continuation of the play, and the oppression of the heavy air, his attention again began to wander, straying back over the incidents of the morning."}, {"size": 704, "text": "He had been with Sophy Viner all day, and he was surprised to find how quickly the time had gone. She had hardly attempted, as the hours passed, to conceal her satisfaction on finding that no telegram came from the Farlows. \u201cThey\u2019ll have written,\u201d she had simply said; and her mind had at once flown on to the golden prospect of an afternoon at the theatre. The intervening hours had been disposed of in a stroll through the lively streets, and a repast, luxuriously lingered over, under the chestnut-boughs of a restaurant in the Champs Elysees. Everything entertained and interested her, and Darrow remarked, with an amused detachment, that she was not insensible to the impression her charms produced."}, {"size": 767, "text": "Yet there was no hard edge of vanity in her sense of her prettiness: she seemed simply to be aware of it as a note in the general harmony, and to enjoy sounding the note as a singer enjoys singing. After luncheon, as they sat over their coffee, she had again asked an immense number of questions and delivered herself of a remarkable variety of opinions. Her questions testified to a wholesome and comprehensive human curiosity, and her comments showed, like her face and her whole attitude, an odd mingling of precocious wisdom and disarming ignorance. When she talked to him about \u201clife\u201d--the word was often on her lips--she seemed to him like a child playing with a tiger\u2019s cub; and he said to himself that some day the child would grow up--and so would the tiger."}, {"size": 616, "text": "Meanwhile, such expertness qualified by such candour made it impossible to guess the extent of her personal experience, or to estimate its effect on her character. She might be any one of a dozen definable types, or she might--more disconcertingly to her companion and more perilously to herself--be a shifting and uncrystallized mixture of them all. Her talk, as usual, had promptly reverted to the stage. She was eager to learn about every form of dramatic expression which the metropolis of things theatrical had to offer, and her curiosity ranged from the official temples of the art to its less hallowed haunts."}, {"size": 653, "text": "Her searching enquiries about a play whose production, on one of the latter scenes, had provoked a considerable amount of scandal, led Darrow to throw out laughingly: \u201cTo see THAT you\u2019ll have to wait till you\u2019re married!\u201d and his answer had sent her off at a tangent. \u201cOh, I never mean to marry,\u201d she had rejoined in a tone of youthful finality. \u201cI seem to have heard that before!\u201d \u201cYes; from girls who\u2019ve only got to choose!\u201d Her eyes had grown suddenly almost old. \u201cI\u2019d like you to see the only men who\u2019ve ever wanted to marry me!

He did not believe there were ever any echoes in her soul... There was no question, however, that what she felt was felt with intensity: to the actual, the immediate, she spread vibrating strings.

There may be a message--at any rate I must decide on something.\u201d Darrow saw that the reality of the situation had suddenly forced itself upon her. \u201cI MUST decide on something,\u201d she repeated. He would have liked to postpone the return, to persuade her to drive directly to the Bois for dinner. It would have been easy enough to remind her that she could not start for Joigny that evening, and that therefore it was of no moment whether she received the Farlows\u2019 answer then or a few hours later; but for some reason he hesitated to use this argument, which had come so naturally to him the day before."}, {"size": 629, "text": "After all, he knew she would find nothing at the hotel--so what did it matter if they went there?

Was she not almost too ready to take his word, and dismiss once for all the tiresome question of the letter?

Is it really going to happen to ME?\u201d He felt like answering: \u201cYou\u2019re the very creature to whom it was bound to happen\u201d; but the words had a double sense that made him wince, and instead he caught her proffered hands and stood looking at her across the length of her arms, without attempting to bend them or to draw her closer."}, {"size": 305, "text": "He wanted her to know how her words had moved him; but his thoughts were blurred by the rush of the same emotion that possessed her, and his own words came with an effort.

It streamed against Darrow\u2019s high-perched windows, reduced their vast prospect of roofs and chimneys to a black oily huddle, and filled the room with the drab twilight of an underground aquarium. The streams descended with the regularity of a third day\u2019s rain, when trimming and shuffling are over, and the weather has settled down to do its worst. There were no variations of rhythm, no lyrical ups and downs: the grey lines streaking the panes were as dense and uniform as a page of unparagraphed narrative. George Darrow had drawn his armchair to the fire. The time-table he had been studying lay on the floor, and he sat staring with dull acquiescence into the boundless blur of rain, which affected him like a vast projection of his own state of mind. Then his eyes travelled slowly about the room."}, {"size": 801, "text": "It was exactly ten days since his hurried unpacking had strewn it with the contents of his portmanteaux. His brushes and razors were spread out on the blotched marble of the chest of drawers. A stack of newspapers had accumulated on the centre table under the \u201celectrolier\u201d, and half a dozen paper novels lay on the mantelpiece among cigar-cases and toilet bottles; but these traces of his passage had made no mark on the featureless dulness of the room, its look of being the makeshift setting of innumerable transient collocations. There was something sardonic, almost sinister, in its appearance of having deliberately \u201cmade up\u201d for its anonymous part, all in noncommittal drabs and browns, with a carpet and paper that nobody would remember, and chairs and tables as impersonal as railway porters."}, {"size": 606, "text": "Darrow picked up the time-table and tossed it on to the table. Then he rose to his feet, lit a cigar and went to the window. Through the rain he could just discover the face of a clock in a tall building beyond the railway roofs. He pulled out his watch, compared the two time-pieces, and started the hands of his with such a rush that they flew past the hour and he had to make them repeat the circuit more deliberately. He felt a quite disproportionate irritation at the trifling blunder. When he had corrected it he went back to his chair and threw himself down, leaning back his head against his hands."}, {"size": 668, "text": "Presently his cigar went out, and he got up, hunted for the matches, lit it again and returned to his seat. The room was getting on his nerves. During the first few days, while the skies were clear, he had not noticed it, or had felt for it only the contemptuous indifference of the traveller toward a provisional shelter. But now that he was leaving it, was looking at it for the last time, it seemed to have taken complete possession of his mind, to be soaking itself into him like an ugly indelible blot. Every detail pressed itself on his notice with the familiarity of an accidental confidant: whichever way he turned, he felt the nudge of a transient intimacy..."}, {"size": 609, "text": "The one fixed point in his immediate future was that his leave was over and that he must be back at his post in London the next morning. Within twenty-four hours he would again be in a daylight world of recognized activities, himself a busy, responsible, relatively necessary factor in the big whirring social and official machine. That fixed obligation was the fact he could think of with the least discomfort, yet for some unaccountable reason it was the one on which he found it most difficult to fix his thoughts. Whenever he did so, the room jerked him back into the circle of its insistent associations."}, {"size": 739, "text": "It was extraordinary with what a microscopic minuteness of loathing he hated it all: the grimy carpet and wallpaper, the black marble mantel-piece, the clock with a gilt allegory under a dusty bell, the high-bolstered brown-counterpaned bed, the framed card of printed rules under the electric light switch, and the door of communication with the next room. He hated the door most of all... At the outset, he had felt no special sense of responsibility. He was satisfied that he had struck the right note, and convinced of his power of sustaining it. The whole incident had somehow seemed, in spite of its vulgar setting and its inevitable prosaic propinquities, to be enacting itself in some unmapped region outside the pale of the usual."}, {"size": 739, "text": "It was not like anything that had ever happened to him before, or in which he had ever pictured himself as likely to be involved; but that, at first, had seemed no argument against his fitness to deal with it. Perhaps but for the three days\u2019 rain he might have got away without a doubt as to his adequacy. The rain had made all the difference. It had thrown the whole picture out of perspective, blotted out the mystery of the remoter planes and the enchantment of the middle distance, and thrust into prominence every commonplace fact of the foreground. It was the kind of situation that was not helped by being thought over; and by the perversity of circumstance he had been forced into the unwilling contemplation of its every aspect..."}, {"size": 735, "text": "His cigar had gone out again, and he threw it into the fire and vaguely meditated getting up to find another. But the mere act of leaving his chair seemed to call for a greater exertion of the will than he was capable of, and he leaned his head back with closed eyes and listened to the drumming of the rain. A different noise aroused him. It was the opening and closing of the door leading from the corridor into the adjoining room. He sat motionless, without opening his eyes; but now another sight forced itself under his lowered lids. It was the precise photographic picture of that other room. Everything in it rose before him and pressed itself upon his vision with the same acuity of distinctness as the objects surrounding him."}, {"size": 667, "text": "A step sounded on the floor, and he knew which way the step was directed, what pieces of furniture it had to skirt, where it would probably pause, and what was likely to arrest it. He heard another sound, and recognized it as that of a wet umbrella placed in the black marble jamb of the chimney-piece, against the hearth. He caught the creak of a hinge, and instantly differentiated it as that of the wardrobe against the opposite wall. Then he heard the mouse-like squeal of a reluctant drawer, and knew it was the upper one in the chest of drawers beside the bed: the clatter which followed was caused by the mahogany toilet-glass jumping on its loosened pivots..."}, {"size": 719, "text": "The step crossed the floor again. It was strange how much better he knew it than the person to whom it belonged! Now it was drawing near the door of communication between the two rooms. He opened his eyes and looked. The step had ceased and for a moment there was silence. Then he heard a low knock. He made no response, and after an interval he saw that the door handle was being tentatively turned. He closed his eyes once more... The door opened, and the step was in the room, coming cautiously toward him. He kept his eyes shut, relaxing his body to feign sleep. There was another pause, then a wavering soft advance, the rustle of a dress behind his chair, the warmth of two hands pressed for a moment on his lids."}, {"size": 615, "text": "The palms of the hands had the lingering scent of some stuff that he had bought on the Boulevard...He looked up and saw a letter falling over his shoulder to his knee... \u201cDid I disturb you? I\u2019m so sorry! They gave me this just now when I came in.\u201d The letter, before he could catch it, had slipped between his knees to the floor. It lay there, address upward, at his feet, and while he sat staring down at the strong slender characters on the blue-gray envelope an arm reached out from behind to pick it up. \u201cOh, don\u2019t--DON\u2019T\u201d broke from him, and he bent over and caught the arm. The face above it was close to his."}, {"size": 662, "text": "----\u201ctake the trouble,\u201d he stammered. He dropped the arm and stooped down. His grasp closed over the letter, he fingered its thickness and weight and calculated the number of sheets it must contain.

He bent forward first and threw the unopened letter into the middle of the fire.

In the court, half-way between house and drive, a lady stood. She held a parasol above her head, and looked now at the house-front, with its double flight of steps meeting before a glazed door under sculptured trophies, now down the drive toward the grassy cutting through the wood. Her air was less of expectancy than of contemplation: she seemed not so much to be watching for any one, or listening for an approaching sound, as letting the whole aspect of the place sink into her while she held herself open to its influence."}, {"size": 761, "text": "Yet it was no less apparent that the scene was not new to her. There was no eagerness of investigation in her survey: she seemed rather to be looking about her with eyes to which, for some intimate inward reason, details long since familiar had suddenly acquired an unwonted freshness. This was in fact the exact sensation of which Mrs. Leath was conscious as she came forth from the house and descended into the sunlit court. She had come to meet her step-son, who was likely to be returning at that hour from an afternoon\u2019s shooting in one of the more distant plantations, and she carried in her hand the letter which had sent her in search of him; but with her first step out of the house all thought of him had been effaced by another series of impressions."}, {"size": 753, "text": "The scene about her was known to satiety.

The possibilities which the place had then represented were still vividly present to her. The mere phrase \u201ca French chateau\u201d had called up to her youthful fancy a throng of romantic associations, poetic, pictorial and emotional; and the serene face of the old house seated in its park among the poplar-bordered meadows of middle France, had seemed, on her first sight of it, to hold out to her a fate as noble and dignified as its own mien."}, {"size": 799, "text": "Though she could still call up that phase of feeling it had long since passed, and the house had for a time become to her the very symbol of narrowness and monotony. Then, with the passing of years, it had gradually acquired a less inimical character, had become, not again a castle of dreams, evoker of fair images and romantic legend, but the shell of a life slowly adjusted to its dwelling: the place one came back to, the place where one had one\u2019s duties, one\u2019s habits and one\u2019s books, the place one would naturally live in till one died: a dull house, an inconvenient house, of which one knew all the defects, the shabbinesses, the discomforts, but to which one was so used that one could hardly, after so long a time, think one\u2019s self away from it without suffering a certain loss of identity."}, {"size": 678, "text": "Now, as it lay before her in the autumn mildness, its mistress was surprised at her own insensibility. She had been trying to see the house through the eyes of an old friend who, the next morning, would be driving up to it for the first time; and in so doing she seemed to be opening her own eyes upon it after a long interval of blindness. The court was very still, yet full of a latent life: the wheeling and rustling of pigeons about the rectangular yews and across the sunny gravel; the sweep of rooks above the lustrous greyish-purple slates of the roof, and the stir of the tree-tops as they met the breeze which every day, at that hour, came punctually up from the river."}, {"size": 680, "text": "Just such a latent animation glowed in Anna Leath. In every nerve and vein she was conscious of that equipoise of bliss which the fearful human heart scarce dares acknowledge. She was not used to strong or full emotions; but she had always known that she should not be afraid of them. She was not afraid now; but she felt a deep inward stillness. The immediate effect of the feeling had been to send her forth in quest of her step-son. She wanted to stroll back with him and have a quiet talk before they re-entered the house. It was always easy to talk to him, and at this moment he was the one person to whom she could have spoken without fear of disturbing her inner stillness."}, {"size": 692, "text": "She was glad, for all sorts of reasons, that Madame de Chantelle and Effie were still at Ouchy with the governess, and that she and Owen had the house to themselves. And she was glad that even he was not yet in sight. She wanted to be alone a little longer; not to think, but to let the long slow waves of joy break over her one by one. She walked out of the court and sat down on one of the benches that bordered the drive. From her seat she had a diagonal view of the long house-front and of the domed chapel terminating one of the wings. Beyond a gate in the court-yard wall the flower-garden drew its dark-green squares and raised its statues against the yellowing background of the park."}, {"size": 766, "text": "In the borders only a few late pinks and crimsons smouldered, but a peacock strutting in the sun seemed to have gathered into his out-spread fan all the summer glories of the place. In Mrs. Leath\u2019s hand was the letter which had opened her eyes to these things, and a smile rose to her lips at the mere feeling of the paper between her fingers. The thrill it sent through her gave a keener edge to every sense. She felt, saw, breathed the shining world as though a thin impenetrable veil had suddenly been removed from it. Just such a veil, she now perceived, had always hung between herself and life. It had been like the stage gauze which gives an illusive air of reality to the painted scene behind it, yet proves it, after all, to be no more than a painted scene."}, {"size": 612, "text": "She had been hardly aware, in her girlhood, of differing from others in this respect. In the well-regulated well-fed Summers world the unusual was regarded as either immoral or ill-bred, and people with emotions were not visited. Sometimes, with a sense of groping in a topsy-turvy universe, Anna had wondered why everybody about her seemed to ignore all the passions and sensations which formed the stuff of great poetry and memorable action. In a community composed entirely of people like her parents and her parents\u2019 friends she did not see how the magnificent things one read about could ever have happened."}, {"size": 801, "text": "She was sure that if anything of the kind had occurred in her immediate circle her mother would have consulted the family clergyman, and her father perhaps even have rung up the police; and her sense of humour compelled her to own that, in the given conditions, these precautions might not have been unjustified. Little by little the conditions conquered her, and she learned to regard the substance of life as a mere canvas for the embroideries of poet and painter, and its little swept and fenced and tended surface as its actual substance. It was in the visioned region of action and emotion that her fullest hours were spent; but it hardly occurred to her that they might be translated into experience, or connected with anything likely to happen to a young lady living in West Fifty-fifth Street."}, {"size": 848, "text": "She perceived, indeed, that other girls, leading outwardly the same life as herself, and seemingly unaware of her world of hidden beauty, were yet possessed of some vital secret which escaped her. There seemed to be a kind of freemasonry between them; they were wider awake than she, more alert, and surer of their wants if not of their opinions. She supposed they were \u201ccleverer\u201d, and accepted her inferiority good-humouredly, half aware, within herself, of a reserve of unused power which the others gave no sign of possessing. This partly consoled her for missing so much of what made their \u201cgood time\u201d; but the resulting sense of exclusion, of being somehow laughingly but firmly debarred from a share of their privileges, threw her back on herself and deepened the reserve which made envious mothers cite her as a model of ladylike repression."}, {"size": 759, "text": "Love, she told herself, would one day release her from this spell of unreality. She was persuaded that the sublime passion was the key to the enigma; but it was difficult to relate her conception of love to the forms it wore in her experience. Two or three of the girls she had envied for their superior acquaintance with the arts of life had contracted, in the course of time, what were variously described as \u201cromantic\u201d or \u201cfoolish\u201d marriages; one even made a runaway match, and languished for a while under a cloud of social reprobation.

Some day she would find the magic bridge between West Fifty-fifth Street and life; once or twice she had even fancied that the clue was in her hand. The first time was when she had met young Darrow.

He was extraordinarily intelligent and agreeable, and her heart beat faster when he was with her.

Whenever they were apart a reaction set in. She wondered how she could have been so cold, called herself a prude and an idiot, questioned if any man could really care for her, and got up in the dead of night to try new ways of doing her hair. But as soon as he reappeared her head straightened itself on her slim neck and she sped her little shafts of irony, or flew her little kites of erudition, while hot and cold waves swept over her, and the things she really wanted to say choked in her throat and burned the palms of her hands."}, {"size": 609, "text": "Often she told herself that any silly girl who had waltzed through a season would know better than she how to attract a man and hold him; but when she said \u201ca man\u201d she did not really mean George Darrow.

He permitted himself no other comments, but these conveyed with sufficient directness that he thought her worthy of a different setting. That she should be so regarded by a man living in an atmosphere of art and beauty, and esteeming them the vital elements of life, made her feel for the first time that she was understood.

There had been a time when the walls on which her gaze now rested had shed a glare of irony on these early dreams.

He exacted a rigid conformity to his rules of non-conformity and his scepticism had the absolute accent of a dogma. He even cherished certain exceptions to his rules as the book-collector prizes a \u201cdefective\u201d first edition.

With the exception of the little girl herself, everything connected with that time had grown curiously remote and unimportant. The days that had moved so slowly as they passed seemed now to have plunged down head-long steeps of time; and as she sat in the autumn sun, with Darrow\u2019s letter in her hand, the history of Anna Leath appeared to its heroine like some grey shadowy tale that she might have read in an old book, one night as she was falling asleep..."}, {"size": 738, "text": "Two brown blurs emerging from the farther end of the wood-vista gradually defined themselves as her step-son and an attendant game-keeper.

From the first days of her marriage she had been drawn to the boy, but it was not until after Effie\u2019s birth that she had really begun to know him.

She even pushed the analogy farther, and descried in her step-son\u2019s mind a quaintly-twisted reflection of her husband\u2019s. With his bursts of door-slamming activity, his fits of bookish indolence, his crude revolutionary dogmatizing and his flashes of precocious irony, the boy was not unlike a boisterous embodiment of his father\u2019s theories."}, {"size": 702, "text": "It was as though Fraser Leath\u2019s ideas, accustomed to hang like marionettes on their pegs, should suddenly come down and walk.

As he had the courage she had lacked, so she meant him to have the chances she had missed; and every effort she made for him helped to keep her own hopes alive.

She had a fancy that if his credit had been in the ascendant the first Mrs. Leath might have continued to throne over the drawing-room mantel-piece, even to the exclusion of her successor\u2019s effigy.

He recalled every detail of her face, the fine veinings of the temples, the bluish-brown shadows in her upper lids, and the way the reflections of two stars seemed to form and break up in her eyes when he held her close to him... If he had had any doubt as to the nature of her feeling for him those dissolving stars would have allayed it.

The thought flattered his sense of possessorship...He felt that the smile on his lips would have been fatuous had it had a witness. He was thinking of her look when she had questioned him about his meeting with Owen at the theatre: less of her words than of her look, and of the effort the question cost her: the reddening of her cheek, the deepening of the strained line between her brows, the way her eyes sought shelter and then turned and drew on him. Pride and passion were in the conflict--magnificent qualities in a wife!"}, {"size": 657, "text": "The sight almost made up for his momentary embarrassment at the rousing of a memory which had no place in his present picture of himself. Yes! It was worth a good deal to watch that fight between her instinct and her intelligence, and know one\u2019s self the object of the struggle... Mingled with these sensations were considerations of another order. He reflected with satisfaction that she was the kind of woman with whom one would like to be seen in public. It would be distinctly agreeable to follow her into drawing-rooms, to walk after her down the aisle of a theatre, to get in and out of trains with her, to say \u201cmy wife\u201d of her to all sorts of people."}, {"size": 436, "text": "He draped these details in the handsome phrase \u201cShe\u2019s a woman to be proud of\u201d, and felt that this fact somehow justified and ennobled his instinctive boyish satisfaction in loving her.

It was as if, after a swim through bright opposing waves, with a dazzle of sun in their eyes, they had gained an inlet in the shades of a cliff, where they could float on the still surface and gaze far down into the depths. Now and then, as they walked and talked, he felt a thrill of youthful wonder at the coincidence of their views and their experiences, at the way their minds leapt to the same point in the same instant. \u201cThe old delusion, I suppose,\u201d he smiled to himself. \u201cWill Nature never tire of the trick?\u201d But he knew it was more than that."}, {"size": 711, "text": "There were moments in their talk when he felt, distinctly and unmistakably, the solid ground of friendship underneath the whirling dance of his sensations. \u201cHow I should like her if I didn\u2019t love her!\u201d he summed it up, wondering at the miracle of such a union. In the course of the morning a telegram had come from Owen Leath, announcing that he, his grandmother and Effie would arrive from Dijon that afternoon at four. The station of the main line was eight or ten miles from Givre, and Anna, soon after three, left in the motor to meet the travellers.

In the hall, coming down the stairs, he encountered Anna. Her face was serene, and his first glance showed him that Owen had kept his word and that none of her forebodings had been fulfilled. She had just come down from the school-room, where Effie and the governess were having supper; the little girl, she told him, looked immensely better for her Swiss holiday, but was dropping with sleep after the journey, and too tired to make her habitual appearance in the drawing-room before being put to bed."}, {"size": 633, "text": "Madame de Chantelle was resting, but would be down for dinner; and as for Owen, Anna supposed he was off somewhere in the park--he had a passion for prowling about the park at nightfall...

He declined her offer of tea, but she lingered a moment to tell him that Owen had in fact kept his word, and that Madame de Chantelle had come back in the best of humours, and unsuspicious of the blow about to fall. \u201cShe has enjoyed her month at Ouchy, and it has given her a lot to talk about--her symptoms, and the rival doctors, and the people at the hotel."}, {"size": 794, "text": "It seems she met your Ambassadress there, and Lady Wantley, and some other London friends of yours, and she\u2019s heard what she calls \u2018delightful things\u2019 about you: she told me to tell you so.

He had guessed that Owen\u2019s rebellion symbolized for his step-mother her own long struggle against the Leath conventions, and he understood that if Anna so passionately abetted him it was partly because, as she owned, she wanted his liberation to coincide with hers.The lady who was to represent, in the impending struggle, the forces of order and tradition was seated by the fire when Darrow entered."}, {"size": 650, "text": "Among the flowers and old furniture of the large pale-panelled room, Madame de Chantelle had the inanimate elegance of a figure introduced into a \u201cstill-life\u201d to give the scale. And this, Darrow reflected, was exactly what she doubtless regarded as her chief obligation: he was sure she thought a great deal of \u201cmeasure\u201d, and approved of most things only up to a certain point. She was a woman of sixty, with a figure at once young and old-fashioned. Her fair faded tints, her quaint corseting, the passementerie on her tight-waisted dress, the velvet band on her tapering arm, made her resemble a \u201ccarte de visite\u201d photograph of the middle \u2019sixties."}, {"size": 792, "text": "One saw her, younger but no less invincibly lady-like, leaning on a chair with a fringed back, a curl in her neck, a locket on her tuckered bosom, toward the end of an embossed morocco album beginning with The Beauties of the Second Empire. She received her daughter-in-law\u2019s suitor with an affability which implied her knowledge and approval of his suit. Darrow had already guessed her to be a person who would instinctively oppose any suggested changes, and then, after one had exhausted one\u2019s main arguments, unexpectedly yield to some small incidental reason, and adhere doggedly to her new position. She boasted of her old-fashioned prejudices, talked a good deal of being a grandmother, and made a show of reaching up to tap Owen\u2019s shoulder, though his height was little more than hers."}, {"size": 621, "text": "She was full of a small pale prattle about the people she had seen at Ouchy, as to whom she had the minute statistical information of a gazetteer, without any apparent sense of personal differences.

There, too, there was a falling off, she said. \u201cI don t know, of course; but people say it\u2019s owing to the Americans. Certainly my waiter had a way of slapping down the dishes ... they tell me that many of them are Anarchists ... belong to Unions, you know.\u201d She appealed to Darrow\u2019s reported knowledge of economic conditions to confirm this ominous rumour."}, {"size": 746, "text": "After dinner Owen Leath wandered into the next room, where the piano stood, and began to play among the shadows. His step-mother presently joined him, and Darrow sat alone with Madame de Chantelle. She took up the thread of her mild chat and carried it on at the same pace as her knitting. Her conversation resembled the large loose-stranded web between her fingers: now and then she dropped a stitch, and went on regardless of the gap in the pattern. Darrow listened with a lazy sense of well-being. In the mental lull of the after-dinner hour, with harmonious memories murmuring through his mind, and the soft tints and shadowy spaces of the fine old room charming his eyes to indolence, Madame de Chantelle\u2019s discourse seemed not out of place."}, {"size": 648, "text": "He could understand that, in the long run, the atmosphere of Givre might be suffocating; but in his present mood its very limitations had a grace. Presently he found the chance to say a word in his own behalf; and thereupon measured the advantage, never before particularly apparent to him, of being related to the Everards of Albany. Madame de Chantelle\u2019s conception of her native country--to which she had not returned since her twentieth year--reminded him of an ancient geographer\u2019s map of the Hyperborean regions. It was all a foggy blank, from which only one or two fixed outlines emerged; and one of these belonged to the Everards of Albany."}, {"size": 754, "text": "The fact that they offered such firm footing--formed, so to speak, a friendly territory on which the opposing powers could meet and treat--helped him through the task of explaining and justifying himself as the successor of Fraser Leath. Madame de Chantelle could not resist such incontestable claims. She seemed to feel her son\u2019s hovering and discriminating presence, and she gave Darrow the sense that he was being tested and approved as a last addition to the Leath Collection. She also made him aware of the immense advantage he possessed in belonging to the diplomatic profession. She spoke of this humdrum calling as a Career, and gave Darrow to understand that she supposed him to have been seducing Duchesses when he was not negotiating Treaties."}, {"size": 668, "text": "He heard again quaint phrases which romantic old ladies had used in his youth: \u201cBrilliant diplomatic society ... social advantages ... the entree everywhere ... nothing else FORMS a young man in the same way...\u201d and she sighingly added that she could have wished her grandson had chosen the same path to glory. Darrow prudently suppressed his own view of the profession, as well as the fact that he had adopted it provisionally, and for reasons less social than sociological; and the talk presently passed on to the subject of his future plans. Here again, Madame de Chantelle\u2019s awe of the Career made her admit the necessity of Anna\u2019s consenting to an early marriage."}, {"size": 609, "text": "The fact that Darrow was \u201cordered\u201d to South America seemed to put him in the romantic light of a young soldier charged to lead a forlorn hope: she sighed and said: \u201cAt such moments a wife\u2019s duty is at her husband\u2019s side.\u201d The problem of Effie\u2019s future might have disturbed her, she added; but since Anna, for a time, consented to leave the little girl with her, that problem was at any rate deferred.

Has Anna told you about our little governess? After all the worry we had last year, with one impossible creature after another, it seems providential, just now, to have found her. At first we were afraid she was too young; but now we\u2019ve the greatest confidence in her. So clever and amusing--and SUCH a lady!

It gave him an odd feeling of discomfort to think that she should have any of the characteristics of the late Fraser Leath: he had, somehow, fantastically pictured her as the mystical offspring of the early tenderness between himself and Anna Summers. His encounter with Effie took place the next morning, on the lawn below the terrace, where he found her, in the early sunshine, knocking about golf balls with her brother."}, {"size": 728, "text": "Almost at once, and with infinite relief, he saw that the resemblance of which Madame de Chantelle boasted was mainly external. Even that discovery was slightly distasteful, though Darrow was forced to own that Fraser Leath\u2019s straight-featured fairness had lent itself to the production of a peculiarly finished image of childish purity. But it was evident that other elements had also gone to the making of Effie, and that another spirit sat in her eyes. Her serious handshake, her \u201cpretty\u201d greeting, were worthy of the Leath tradition, and he guessed her to be more malleable than Owen, more subject to the influences of Givre; but the shout with which she returned to her romp had in it the note of her mother\u2019s emancipation."}, {"size": 632, "text": "He had begged a holiday for her, and when Mrs. Leath appeared he and she and the little girl went off for a ramble.

Effie, who was attended by a shaggy terrier, had picked up two or three subordinate dogs at the stable; and as she trotted on ahead with her yapping escort, Anna hung back to throw a look at Darrow. \u201cYes,\u201d he answered it, \u201cshe\u2019s exquisite...Oh, I see what I\u2019m asking of you!"}, {"size": 693, "text": "But she\u2019ll be quite happy here, won\u2019t she?

She\u2019ll apply herself to it, conscientiously, as she does to her lessons, and to what she calls \u2018being good\u2019...In a way, you see, that\u2019s just what worries me. Her idea of \u2018being good\u2019 is to please the person she\u2019s with--she puts her whole dear little mind on it!

In his eyes lingered the vision of the dark-haired mother mounting the stairs with her little fair daughter. The contrast between them seemed a last touch of grace in the complex harmony of things.

He was roused by Effie\u2019s voice and the scamper of her feet down the long floors behind him. \u201cHere he is! Here he is!\u201d she cried, flying over the threshold.

The figure in the doorway came forward and Darrow, looking up, found himself face to face with Sophy Viner. They stood still, a yard or two apart, and looked at each other without speaking. As they paused there, a shadow fell across one of the terrace windows, and Owen Leath stepped whistling into the room. In his rough shooting clothes, with the glow of exercise under his fair skin, he looked extraordinarily light-hearted and happy.

He went forward and held out his hand. \u201cHow do you do, Miss Viner?\u201d She answered: \u201cHow do you do?\u201d in a voice that sounded clear and natural; and the next moment he again became aware of steps behind him, and knew that Mrs. Leath was in the room.

Darrow was not an ardent sportsman, but any pretext for physical activity would have been acceptable at the moment; and he was glad both to get away from the house and not to be left to himself. When he came downstairs the motor was at the door, and Anna stood before the hall mirror, swathing her hat in veils."}, {"size": 686, "text": "She turned at the sound of his step and smiled at him for a long full moment. \u201cI\u2019d no idea you knew Miss Viner,\u201d she said, as he helped her into her long coat. \u201cIt came back to me, luckily, that I\u2019d seen her two or three times in London, several years ago. She was secretary, or something of the sort, in the background of a house where I used to dine.\u201d He loathed the slighting indifference of the phrase, but he had uttered it deliberately, had been secretly practising it all through the interminable hour at the luncheon-table.

Try and remember everything you can.\u201d As he tramped through the woods at his young host\u2019s side, Darrow felt the partial relief from thought produced by exercise and the obligation to talk. Little as he cared for shooting, he had the habit of concentration which makes it natural for a man to throw himself wholly into whatever business he has in hand, and there were moments of the afternoon when a sudden whirr in the undergrowth, a vivider gleam against the hazy browns and greys of the woods, was enough to fill the foreground of his attention."}, {"size": 773, "text": "But all the while, behind these voluntarily emphasized sensations, his secret consciousness continued to revolve on a loud wheel of thought.

Snatches of his companion\u2019s talk drifted to him intermittently through the confusion of his thoughts.

Young Leath, it appeared, felt that he had reached a turning-point in his career, a height from which he could impartially survey his past progress and projected endeavour.

Then his steps died away and Darrow sat leaning his head on his locked hands. Presently another step sounded on the stairs, wavered a moment and then moved past the threshold of the study.

His five minutes with Sophy Viner had flashed strange lights into the shadowy corners of his consciousness. The girl\u2019s absolute candour, her hard ardent honesty, was for the moment the vividest point in his thoughts.

He understood then, for the first time, how vague, in comparison with hers, had been his own vision of the part he had played in the brief episode of their relation.

But now he sat motionless, as if spell-bound by the play of Madame de Chantelle\u2019s needles and the pulsations of Owen\u2019s fitful music. \u201cShe will want to ask me about the girl,\u201d he repeated to himself, with a fresh sense of the insidious taint that embittered all his thoughts; the hand of the slender-columned clock on the mantel-piece had spanned a half-hour before shame at his own indecision finally drew him to his feet."}, {"size": 783, "text": "From her writing-table, where she sat over a pile of letters, Anna lifted her happy smile.

Her long residence on Gallic soil had not mitigated her hostility toward the creed and customs of the race, but though she always referred to the Catholic Church as the Scarlet Woman and took the darkest views of French private life, Madame de Chantelle placed great reliance on her judgment and experience, and in every domestic crisis the irreducible Adelaide was immediately summoned to Givre."}, {"size": 654, "text": "\u201cIt\u2019s all the odder because my mother-in-law, since her second marriage, has lived so much in the country that she\u2019s practically lost sight of all her other American friends.

This obscured, if it narrowed, the field of conjecture; and Darrow\u2019s gropings threw him back on the conclusion that he was probably reading too much significance into the moods of a lad he hardly knew, and who had been described to him as subject to sudden changes of humour."}, {"size": 773, "text": "As to Anna\u2019s fancied perturbation, it might simply be due to the fact that she had decided to plead Owen\u2019s cause the next day, and had perhaps already had a glimpse of the difficulties awaiting her.

It might be, after all, that the variations he felt in the currents of communication were caused by his own inward tremor. Such, at any rate, was the conclusion he had reached when, shortly after the two ladies left the drawing-room, he bade Owen good-night and went up to his room.

It had been his first business to convince the girl that their secret was safe with him; but it was far from easy to square this with the equally urgent obligation of safe-guarding Anna\u2019s responsibility toward her child."}, {"size": 658, "text": "Darrow was not much afraid of accidental disclosures. Both he and Sophy Viner had too much at stake not to be on their guard. The fear that beset him was of another kind, and had a profounder source. He wanted to do all he could for the girl, but the fact of having had to urge Anna to confide Effie to her was peculiarly repugnant to him. His own ideas about Sophy Viner were too mixed and indeterminate for him not to feel the risk of such an experiment; yet he found himself in the intolerable position of appearing to press it on the woman he desired above all others to protect... Till late in the night his thoughts revolved in a turmoil of indecision."}, {"size": 734, "text": "His pride was humbled by the discrepancy between what Sophy Viner had been to him and what he had thought of her. This discrepancy, which at the time had seemed to simplify the incident, now turned out to be its most galling complication. The bare truth, indeed, was that he had hardly thought of her at all, either at the time or since, and that he was ashamed to base his judgement of her on his meagre memory of their adventure. The essential cheapness of the whole affair--as far as his share in it was concerned--came home to him with humiliating distinctness. He would have liked to be able to feel that, at the time at least, he had staked something more on it, and had somehow, in the sequel, had a more palpable loss to show."}, {"size": 687, "text": "But the plain fact was that he hadn\u2019t spent a penny on it; which was no doubt the reason of the prodigious score it had since been rolling up.

The night brought no aid to the solving of this problem; but it gave him, at any rate, the clear conviction that no time was to be lost. His first step must be to obtain from Miss Viner the chance of another and calmer talk; and he resolved to seek it at the earliest hour."}, {"size": 695, "text": "He had gathered that Effie\u2019s lessons were preceded by an early scamper in the park, and conjecturing that her governess might be with her he betook himself the next morning to the terrace, whence he wandered on to the gardens and the walks beyond.

Darrow was struck, and vaguely troubled, by the change in her look and tone. There was in them an undefinable appeal, whether for help or forbearance he could not tell.

In moments of excitement his odd irregular features seemed to grow fluid, to unmake and remake themselves like the shadows of clouds on a stream.

The thought was so disturbing that, as the three turned back to the house, he was on the point of saying to Owen: \u201cI came out to look for your mother.\u201d But, in the contingency he feared, even so simple a phrase might seem like an awkward attempt at explanation; and he walked on in silence at Miss Viner\u2019s side.

She went on with these directions regardless of Darrow\u2019s entrance, merely fixing her small pale eyes on him while she proceeded, in a deep contralto voice, and a fluent French pronounced with the purest Boston accent, to specify the destination of her bags; and this enabled Darrow to give her back a gaze protracted enough to take in all the details of her plain thick-set person, from the square sallow face beneath bands of grey hair to the blunt boot-toes protruding under her wide walking skirt."}, {"size": 751, "text": "She submitted to this scrutiny with no more evidence of surprise than a monument examined by a tourist; but when the fate of her luggage had been settled she turned suddenly to Darrow and, dropping her eyes from his face to his feet, asked in trenchant accents: \u201cWhat sort of boots have you got on?\u201d Before he could summon his wits to the consideration of this question she continued in a tone of suppressed indignation: \u201cUntil Americans get used to the fact that France is under water for half the year they\u2019re perpetually risking their lives by not being properly protected.

Perhaps, after all, it was in the fact of her blank insensibility, an insensibility so devoid of egotism that it had no hardness and no grimaces, but rather the freshness of a simpler mental state. After living, as he had, as they all had, for the last few days, in an atmosphere perpetually tremulous with echoes and implications, it was restful and fortifying merely to walk into the big blank area of Miss Painter\u2019s mind, so vacuous for all its accumulated items, so echoless for all its vacuity."}, {"size": 772, "text": "His hope of a word with Anna before dinner was dispelled by her rising to take Miss Painter up to Madame de Chantelle; and he wandered away to his own room, leaving Owen and Miss Viner engaged in working out a picture-puzzle for Effie.

Was it because she had been so incurious that it had worn that look to her? It struck her with amazement that she had never given a thought to her husband\u2019s past, or wondered what he did and where he went when he was away from her.

On reaching London, he told her, he had found that the secretary he was to have replaced was detained there by the illness of his wife.

There was no possible reason why he should invent a false account of his return, and every probability that the version he gave was the real one.

She had not spoken of this to Darrow because it appeared to her a subject to be debated within her own conscience. The question, then, was not as to his fitness to become the guide and guardian of her child; nor did she fear that her love for him would deprive Effie of the least fraction of her tenderness, since she did not think of love as something measured and exhaustible but as a treasure perpetually renewed."}, {"size": 484, "text": "What she questioned was her right to introduce into her life any interests and duties which might rob Effie of a part of her time, or lessen the closeness of their daily intercourse.

In her dread of giving it a more tangible shape she tried to devise means of keeping the little girl with her, and, when the latter had been called away by the nurse, found an excuse for following Madame de Chantelle upstairs to the purple sitting-room.

She was resolved to keep on her course as though nothing had happened: to marry Darrow and never let the consciousness of the past intrude itself between them; but she was beginning to feel that the only way of attaining to this state of detachment from the irreparable was once for all to turn back with him to its contemplation."}, {"size": 706, "text": "As soon as this desire had germinated it became so strong in her that she regretted having promised Effie to take her out for the afternoon.

The luminous grey air gave vividness to its dying colours, and veiled the distant glimpses of the landscape in soft uncertainty.

The same experience repeated itself several times that day and the next. When she and Darrow were apart she exhausted herself in appeal and interrogation, she formulated with a fervent lucidity every point in her imaginary argument.

A flame shot out of it, and in the upward glare she saw his pale face, stern with misery."}, {"size": 701, "text": "\u201cIs that all?\u201d he asked. She made a slight sign with her head and he came slowly back to her. \u201cThen is this to be good-bye?\u201d Again she signed a faint assent, and he made no effort to touch her or draw nearer. \u201cYou understand that I sha\u2019n\u2019t come back?\u201d He was looking at her, and she tried to return his look, but her eyes were blind with tears, and in dread of his seeing them she got up and walked away. He did not follow her, and she stood with her back to him, staring at a bowl of carnations on a little table strewn with books. Her tears magnified everything she looked at, and the streaked petals of the carnations, their fringed edges and frail curled stamens, pressed upon her, huge and vivid."}, {"size": 254, "text": "She noticed among the books a volume of verse he had sent her from England, and tried to remember whether it was before or after...

She saw his hand on the door, and his seal ring in its setting of twisted silver; and the sense of the end of all things came to her. They walked down the drawing-rooms, between the shadowy reflections of screens and cabinets, and mounted the stairs side by side. At the end of the gallery, a lamp brought out turbid gleams in the smoky battle-piece above it. On the landing Darrow stopped; his room was the nearest to the stairs. \u201cGood night,\u201d he said, holding out his hand. As Anna gave him hers the springs of grief broke loose in her. She struggled with her sobs, and subdued them; but her breath came unevenly, and to hide her agitation she leaned on him and pressed her face against his arm."}, {"size": 663, "text": "\u201cDon\u2019t--don\u2019t,\u201d he whispered, soothing her.

The door shut behind her and she sat down on the lounge at the foot of the bed. The pulsations in her throat had ceased, but she knew they would begin again if she tried to speak. Darrow walked away and leaned against the mantelpiece.

It was the first time she had ever been in a room he lived in, among his personal possessions and the traces of his daily usage.

Suddenly she thought: \u201cThis is what Sophy Viner knew\u201d...and with a torturing precision she pictured them alone in such a scene...Had he taken the girl to an hotel ... where did people go in such cases? Wherever they were, the silence of night had been around them, and the things he used had been strewn about the room...Anna, ashamed of dwelling on the detested vision, stood up with a confused impulse of flight; then a wave of contrary feeling arrested her and she paused with lowered head."}, {"size": 774, "text": "Darrow had come forward as she rose, and she perceived that he was waiting for her to bid him good night. It was clear that no other possibility had even brushed his mind; and the fact, for some dim reason, humiliated her. \u201cWhy not ... why not?\u201d something whispered in her, as though his forbearance, his tacit recognition of her pride, were a slight on other qualities she wanted him to feel in her. \u201cIn the morning, then?\u201d she heard him say. \u201cYes, in the morning,\u201d she repeated. She continued to stand in the same place, looking vaguely about the room. For once before they parted--since part they must--she longed to be to him all that Sophy Viner had been; but she remained rooted to the floor, unable to find a word or imagine a gesture that should express her meaning."}, {"size": 617, "text": "Exasperated by her helplessness, she thought: \u201cDon\u2019t I feel things as other women do?\u201d Her eye fell on a note-case she had given him.

All that he and she had ever felt or seen, their close encounters of word and look, and the closer contact of their silences, trembled through her at the touch. She remembered things he had said that had been like new skies above her head: ways he had that seemed a part of the air she breathed."}, {"size": 623, "text": "The faint warmth of her girlish love came back to her, gathering heat as it passed through her thoughts; and her heart rocked like a boat on the surge of its long long memories. \u201cIt\u2019s because I love him in too many ways,\u201d she thought; and slowly she turned to the door. She was aware that Darrow was still silently watching her, but he neither stirred nor spoke till she had reached the threshold. Then he met her there and caught her in his arms. \u201cNot to-night--don\u2019t tell me to-night!\u201d he whispered; and she leaned away from him, closing her eyes for an instant, and then slowly opening them to the flood of light in his."}, {"size": 695, "text": "Anna and Darrow, the next day, sat alone in a compartment of the Paris train.Anna, when they entered it, had put herself in the farthest corner and placed her bag on the adjoining seat.

She had an intense longing to be with him, an almost morbid terror of losing sight of him for a moment: when he jumped out of the train and ran back along the platform to buy a newspaper for her she felt as though she should never see him again, and shivered with the cold misery of her last journey to Paris, when she had thought herself parted from him forever."}, {"size": 670, "text": "Yet she wanted to keep him at a distance, on the other side of the compartment, and as the train moved out of the station she drew from her bag the letters she had thrust in it as she left the house, and began to glance over them so that her lowered lids should hide her eyes from him. She was his now, his for life: there could never again be any question of sacrificing herself to Effie\u2019s welfare, or to any other abstract conception of duty. Effie of course would not suffer; Anna would pay for her bliss as a wife by redoubled devotion as a mother. Her scruples were not overcome; but for the time their voices were drowned in the tumultuous rumour of her happiness."}, {"size": 690, "text": "As she opened her letters she was conscious that Darrow\u2019s gaze was fixed on her, and gradually it drew her eyes upward, and she drank deep of the passionate tenderness in his.

Her heart began to beat oppressively: she was in a mood when the simplest things seemed ominous. What could Owen have to say to her? Only the first page was covered, and it contained simply the announcement that, in the company of a young compatriot who was studying at the Beaux Arts, he had planned to leave for Spain the following evening."}, {"size": 605, "text": "\u201cHe hasn\u2019t seen her, then!\u201d was Anna\u2019s instant thought; and her feeling was a strange compound of humiliation and relief.

She did not reproach herself with her failure; but she would have been happier if there had been less discrepancy between her words to Sophy Viner and the act which had followed them. It irritated her obscurely that the girl should have been so much surer of her power to carry out her purpose... Anna looked up and saw that Darrow\u2019s eyes were on the newspaper."}, {"size": 611, "text": "He seemed calm and secure, almost indifferent to her presence. \u201cWill it become a matter of course to him so soon?\u201d she wondered with a twinge of jealousy.

It surprised and shamed her to detect a new element in her love for him: a sort of suspicious tyrannical tenderness that seemed to deprive it of all serenity.

She was aware of a faint current of relief silently circulating between them. They were both glad that Owen was going, that for a while he would be out of their way; and it seemed to her horrible that so much of the stuff of their happiness should be made of such unavowed feelings... \u201cI shall see him this evening,\u201d she said, wishing Darrow to feel that she was not afraid of meeting her step-son."}, {"size": 777, "text": "\u201cYes, of course; perhaps he might dine with you.\u201d The words struck her as strangely obtuse. Darrow was to meet his Ambassador at the station on the latter\u2019s arrival, and would in all probability have to spend the evening with him, and Anna knew he had been concerned at the thought of having to leave her alone. But how could he speak in that careless tone of her dining with Owen? She lowered her voice to say: \u201cI\u2019m afraid he\u2019s desperately unhappy.\u201d He answered, with a tinge of impatience: \u201cIt\u2019s much the best thing that he should travel.\u201d \u201cYes--but don\u2019t you feel...\u201d She broke off.

He handed back Owen\u2019s letter and returned to his newspaper; and when he looked up from it a few minutes later it was with a clear brow and a smile that irresistibly drew her back to happier thoughts.

She asked Darrow to open the window, to place her bag in the net, to roll her rug into a cushion for her feet; and while he was thus busied with her she was conscious of a new devotion in his tone, in his way of bending over her and meeting her eyes. He went back to his seat, and they looked at each other like lovers smiling at a happy secret. Anna, before going back to Givre, had suggested Owen\u2019s moving into her apartment, but he had preferred to remain at the hotel to which he had sent his luggage, and on arriving in Paris she decided to drive there at once."}, {"size": 649, "text": "She was impatient to have the meeting over, and glad that Darrow was obliged to leave her at the station in order to look up a colleague at the Embassy.

The next instant, with a pang of self-reproach, she remembered Sophy Viner\u2019s cry: \u201cI knew all the while he didn\u2019t care...\u201d \u201cPoor thing, oh poor thing!\u201d Anna murmured..."}, {"size": 618, "text": "At Owen\u2019s hotel she waited in a tremor while the porter went in search of him.

Owen sat at a table writing, his back to the door; and when he stood up the window was behind him, so that, in the rainy afternoon light, his features were barely discernible. \u201cDearest--so you\u2019re really off?\u201d she said, hesitating a moment on the threshold. He pushed a chair forward, and they sat down, each waiting for the other to speak."}, {"size": 798, "text": "Finally she put some random question about his travelling-companion, a slow shy meditative youth whom he had once or twice brought down to Givre.

Anna noticed that, though ready enough to impart his own plans, Owen studiously abstained from putting any questions about hers.

I\u2019m not worth what I\u2019m costing you.\u201d She continued to gaze at him through tear-dilated eyes; and suddenly she flung out the question: \u201cWasn\u2019t it the Athenee you took her to that evening?\u201d"}, {"size": 630, "text": "\u201cYes; I want to know now: to know everything.

Why not?\u201d \u201cIf I did, do you suppose you\u2019d forget THAT?\u201d \u201cOh--\u201d she moaned, and turned away from him. \u201cYou see it\u2019s impossible,\u201d he went on. \u201cI\u2019ve done a thing I loathe, and to atone for it you ask me to do another. What sort of satisfaction would that give you? It would put something irremediable between us.\u201d She leaned her elbow against the mantel-shelf and hid her face in her hands. She had the sense that she was vainly throwing away her last hope of happiness, yet she could do nothing, think of nothing, to save it."}, {"size": 688, "text": "The conjecture flashed through her: \u201cShould I be at peace if I gave him up?\u201d and she remembered the desolation of the days after she had sent him away, and understood that that hope was vain. The tears welled through her lids and ran slowly down between her fingers. \u201cGood-bye,\u201d she heard him say, and his footsteps turned to the door. She tried to raise her head, but the weight of her despair bowed it down. She said to herself: \u201cThis is the end ... he won\u2019t try to appeal to me again...\u201d and she remained in a sort of tranced rigidity, perceiving without feeling the fateful lapse of the seconds.

He\u2019s no one else\u2019s!\u201d His face was turned to her and the look in his eyes swept away all her terrors. She no longer understood what had prompted her senseless outcry; and the mortal sweetness of loving him became again the one real fact in the world."}, {"size": 671, "text": "Anna, the next day, woke to a humiliated memory of the previous evening.Darrow had been right in saying that their sacrifice would benefit no one; yet she seemed dimly to discern that there were obligations not to be tested by that standard. She owed it, at any rate, as much to his pride as to hers to abstain from the repetition of such scenes; and she had learned that it was beyond her power to do so while they were together. Yet when he had given her the chance to free herself, everything had vanished from her mind but the blind fear of losing him; and she saw that he and she were as profoundly and inextricably bound together as two trees with interwoven roots."}, {"size": 600, "text": "For a long time she brooded on her plight, vaguely conscious that the only escape from it must come from some external chance. And slowly the occasion shaped itself in her mind. It was Sophy Viner only who could save her--Sophy Viner only who could give her back her lost serenity. She would seek the girl out and tell her that she had given Darrow up; and that step once taken there would be no retracing it, and she would perforce have to go forward alone. Any pretext for action was a kind of anodyne, and she despatched her maid to the Farlows\u2019 with a note asking if Miss Viner would receive her."}, {"size": 688, "text": "There was a long delay before the maid returned, and when at last she appeared it was with a slip of paper on which an address was written, and a verbal message to the effect that Miss Viner had left some days previously, and was staying with her sister in a hotel near the Place de l\u2019Etoile. The maid added that Mrs. Farlow, on the plea that Miss Viner\u2019s plans were uncertain, had at first made some difficulty about giving this information; and Anna guessed that the girl had left her friends\u2019 roof, and instructed them to withhold her address, with the object of avoiding Owen. \u201cShe\u2019s kept faith with herself and I haven\u2019t,\u201d Anna mused; and the thought was a fresh incentive to action."}, {"size": 797, "text": "Darrow had announced his intention of coming soon after luncheon, and the morning was already so far advanced that Anna, still mistrustful of her strength, decided to drive immediately to the address Mrs. Farlow had given. On the way there she tried to recall what she had heard of Sophy Viner\u2019s sister, but beyond the girl\u2019s enthusiastic report of the absent Laura\u2019s loveliness she could remember only certain vague allusions of Mrs. Farlow\u2019s to her artistic endowments and matrimonial vicissitudes. Darrow had mentioned her but once, and in the briefest terms, as having apparently very little concern for Sophy\u2019s welfare, and being, at any rate, too geographically remote to give her any practical support; and Anna wondered what chance had brought her to her sister\u2019s side at this conjunction."}, {"size": 741, "text": "Mrs. Farlow had spoken of her as a celebrity (in what line Anna failed to recall); but Mrs. Farlow\u2019s celebrities were legion, and the name on the slip of paper--Mrs. McTarvie-Birch--did not seem to have any definite association with fame. While Anna waited in the dingy vestibule of the Hotel Chicago she had so distinct a vision of what she meant to say to Sophy Viner that the girl seemed already to be before her; and her heart dropped from all the height of its courage when the porter, after a long delay, returned with the announcement that Miss Viner was no longer in the hotel. Anna, doubtful if she understood, asked if he merely meant that the young lady was out at the moment; but he replied that she had gone away the day before."}, {"size": 778, "text": "Beyond this he had no information to impart, and after a moment\u2019s hesitation Anna sent him back to enquire if Mrs. McTarvie-Birch would receive her. She reflected that Sophy had probably pledged her sister to the same secrecy as Mrs. Farlow, and that a personal appeal to Mrs. Birch might lead to less negative results. There was another long interval of suspense before the porter reappeared with an affirmative answer; and a third while an exiguous and hesitating lift bore her up past a succession of shabby landings. When the last was reached, and her guide had directed her down a winding passage that smelt of sea-going luggage, she found herself before a door through which a strong odour of tobacco reached her simultaneously with the sounds of a suppressed altercation."}, {"size": 710, "text": "Her knock was followed by a silence, and after a minute or two the door was opened by a handsome young man whose ruffled hair and general air of creased disorder led her to conclude that he had just risen from a long-limbed sprawl on a sofa strewn with tumbled cushions. This sofa, and a grand piano bearing a basket of faded roses, a biscuit-tin and a devastated breakfast tray, almost filled the narrow sitting-room, in the remaining corner of which another man, short, swarthy and humble, sat examining the lining of his hat. Anna paused in doubt; but on her naming Mrs. Birch the young man politely invited her to enter, at the same time casting an impatient glance at the mute spectator in the background."}, {"size": 706, "text": "The latter, raising his eyes, which were round and bulging, fixed them, not on the young man but on Anna, whom, for a moment, he scrutinized as searchingly as the interior of his hat. Under his gaze she had the sense of being minutely catalogued and valued; and the impression, when he finally rose and moved toward the door, of having been accepted as a better guarantee than he had had any reason to hope for. On the threshold his glance crossed that of the young man in an exchange of intelligence as full as it was rapid; and this brief scene left Anna so oddly enlightened that she felt no surprise when her companion, pushing an arm-chair forward, sociably asked her if she wouldn\u2019t have a cigarette."}, {"size": 684, "text": "Her polite refusal provoked the remark that he would, if she\u2019d no objection; and while he groped for matches in his loose pockets, and behind the photographs and letters crowding the narrow mantel-shelf, she ventured another enquiry for Mrs. Birch. \u201cJust a minute,\u201d he smiled; \u201cI think the masseur\u2019s with her.\u201d He spoke in a smooth denationalized English, which, like the look in his long-lashed eyes and the promptness of his charming smile, suggested a long training in all the arts of expediency. Having finally discovered a match-box on the floor beside the sofa, he lit his cigarette and dropped back among the cushions; and on Anna\u2019s remarking that she was sorry to disturb Mrs."}, {"size": 755, "text": "Birch he replied that that was all right, and that she always kept everybody waiting. After this, through the haze of his perpetually renewed cigarettes, they continued to chat for some time of indifferent topics; but when at last Anna again suggested the possibility of her seeing Mrs. Birch he rose from his corner with a slight shrug, and murmuring: \u201cShe\u2019s perfectly hopeless,\u201d lounged off through an inner door. Anna was still wondering when and in what conjunction of circumstances the much-married Laura had acquired a partner so conspicuous for his personal charms, when the young man returned to announce: \u201cShe says it\u2019s all right, if you don\u2019t mind seeing her in bed.\u201d He drew aside to let Anna pass, and she found herself in a dim untidy scented"}, {"size": 667, "text": "room, with a pink curtain pinned across its single window, and a lady with a great deal of fair hair and uncovered neck smiling at her from a pink bed on which an immense powder-puff trailed. \u201cYou don\u2019t mind, do you? He costs such a frightful lot that I can\u2019t afford to send him off,\u201d Mrs. Birch explained, extending a thickly-ringed hand to Anna, and leaving her in doubt as to whether the person alluded to were her masseur or her husband. Before a reply was possible there was a convulsive stir beneath the pink expanse, and something that resembled another powder-puff hurled itself at Anna with a volley of sounds like the popping of Lilliputian champagne corks."}, {"size": 708, "text": "Mrs. Birch, flinging herself forward, gasped out: \u201cIf you\u2019d just give him a caramel ... there, in that box on the dressing-table ... it\u2019s the only earthly thing to stop him...\u201d and when Anna had proffered this sop to her assailant, and he had withdrawn with it beneath the bedspread, his mistress sank back with a laugh. \u201cIsn\u2019t he a beauty? The Prince gave him to me down at Nice the other day--but he\u2019s perfectly awful,\u201d she confessed, beaming intimately on her visitor. In the roseate penumbra of the bed-curtains she presented to Anna\u2019s startled gaze an odd chromo-like resemblance to Sophy Viner, or a suggestion, rather, of what Sophy Viner might, with the years and in spite of the powder-puff, become."}, {"size": 621, "text": "Larger, blonder, heavier-featured, she yet had glances and movements that disturbingly suggested what was freshest and most engaging in the girl; and as she stretched her bare plump arm across the bed she seemed to be pulling back the veil from dingy distances of family history. \u201cDo sit down, if there\u2019s a place to sit on,\u201d she cordially advised; adding, as Anna took the edge of a chair hung with miscellaneous raiment: \u201cMy singing takes so much time that I don\u2019t get a chance to walk the fat off--that\u2019s the worst of being an artist.\u201d Anna murmured an assent. \u201cI hope it hasn\u2019t inconvenienced you to see me; I told Mr."}, {"size": 608, "text": "Birch--\u201d \u201cMr. WHO?\u201d the recumbent beauty asked; and then: \u201cOh, JIMMY!\u201d she faintly laughed, as if more for her own enlightenment than Anna\u2019s. The latter continued eagerly: \u201cI understand from Mrs. Farlow that your sister was with you, and I ventured to come up because I wanted to ask you when I should have a chance of finding her.\u201d Mrs. McTarvie-Birch threw back her head with a long stare. \u201cDo you mean to say the idiot at the door didn\u2019t tell you?
