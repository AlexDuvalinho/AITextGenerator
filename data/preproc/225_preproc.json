THE HAY-LOFT I HAVE been asked to tell you about the back of the north wind. An old Greek writer mentions a people who lived there, and were so comfortable that they could not bear it any longer, and drowned themselves. My story is not the same as his. I do not think Herodotus had got the right account of the place. I am going to tell you how it fared with a boy who went there.He lived in a low room over a coach-house; and that was not by any means at the back of the north wind, as his mother very well knew."}, {"size": 712, "text": "For one side of the room was built only of boards, and the boards were so old that you might run a penknife through into the north wind. And then let them settle between them which was the sharper! I know that when you pulled it out again the wind would be after it like a cat after a mouse, and you would know soon enough you were not at the back of the north wind. Still, this room was not very cold, except when the north wind blew stronger than usual: the room I have to do with now was always cold, except in summer, when the sun took the matter into his own hands. Indeed, I am not sure whether I ought to call it a room at all; for it was just a loft where they kept hay and straw and oats for the horses."}, {"size": 627, "text": "And when little Diamond--but stop: I must tell you that his father, who was a coachman, had named him after a favourite horse, and his mother had had no objection:--when little Diamond, then, lay there in bed, he could hear the horses under him munching away in the dark, or moving sleepily in their dreams. For Diamond's father had built him a bed in the loft with boards all round it, because they had so little room in their own end over the coach-house; and Diamond's father put old Diamond in the stall under the bed, because he was a quiet horse, and did not go to sleep standing, but lay down like a reasonable creature."}, {"size": 606, "text": "But, although he was a surprisingly reasonable creature, yet, when young Diamond woke in the middle of the night, and felt the bed shaking in the blasts of the north wind, he could not help wondering whether, if the wind should blow the house down, and he were to fall through into the manger, old Diamond mightn't eat him up before he knew him in his night-gown. And although old Diamond was very quiet all night long, yet when he woke he got up like an earthquake, and then young Diamond knew what o'clock it was, or at least what was to be done next, which was--to go to sleep again as fast as he could."}, {"size": 758, "text": "There was hay at his feet and hay at his head, piled up in great trusses to the very roof. Indeed it was sometimes only through a little lane with several turnings, which looked as if it had been sawn out for him, that he could reach his bed at all. For the stock of hay was, of course, always in a state either of slow ebb or of sudden flow. Sometimes the whole space of the loft, with the little panes in the roof for the stars to look in, would lie open before his open eyes as he lay in bed; sometimes a yellow wall of sweet-smelling fibres closed up his view at the distance of half a yard. Sometimes, when his mother had undressed him in her room, and told him to trot to bed by himself, he would creep into the heart of the hay, and lie there thinking"}, {"size": 602, "text": "how cold it was outside in the wind, and how warm it was inside there in his bed, and how he could go to it when he pleased, only he wouldn't just yet; he would get a little colder first. And ever as he grew colder, his bed would grow warmer, till at last he would scramble out of the hay, shoot like an arrow into his bed, cover himself up, and snuggle down, thinking what a happy boy he was. He had not the least idea that the wind got in at a chink in the wall, and blew about him all night. For the back of his bed was only of boards an inch thick, and on the other side of them was the north wind."}, {"size": 654, "text": "Now, as I have already said, these boards were soft and crumbly. To be sure, they were tarred on the outside, yet in many places they were more like tinder than timber. Hence it happened that the soft part having worn away from about it, little Diamond found one night, after he lay down, that a knot had come out of one of them, and that the wind was blowing in upon him in a cold and rather imperious fashion. Now he had no fancy for leaving things wrong that might be set right; so he jumped out of bed again, got a little strike of hay, twisted it up, folded it in the middle, and, having thus made it into a cork, stuck it into the hole in the wall."}, {"size": 632, "text": "But the wind began to blow loud and angrily, and, as Diamond was falling asleep, out blew his cork and hit him on the nose, just hard enough to wake him up quite, and let him hear the wind whistling shrill in the hole. He searched for his hay-cork, found it, stuck it in harder, and was just dropping off once more, when, pop! with an angry whistle behind it, the cork struck him again, this time on the cheek. Up he rose once more, made a fresh stopple of hay, and corked the hole severely. But he was hardly down again before--pop! it came on his forehead. He gave it up, drew the clothes above his head, and was soon fast asleep."}, {"size": 622, "text": "Although the next day was very stormy, Diamond forgot all about the hole, for he was busy making a cave by the side of his mother's fire with a broken chair, a three-legged stool, and a blanket, and then sitting in it. His mother, however, discovered it, and pasted a bit of brown paper over it, so that, when Diamond had snuggled down the next night, he had no occasion to think of it. Presently, however, he lifted his head and listened. Who could that be talking to him? The wind was rising again, and getting very loud, and full of rushes and whistles. He was sure some one was talking--and very near him, too, it was."}, {"size": 610, "text": "But he was not frightened, for he had not yet learned how to be; so he sat up and hearkened. At last the voice, which, though quite gentle, sounded a little angry, appeared to come from the back of the bed. He crept nearer to it, and laid his ear against the wall. Then he heard nothing but the wind, which sounded very loud indeed. The moment, however, that he moved his head from the wall, he heard the voice again, close to his ear. He felt about with his hand, and came upon the piece of paper his mother had pasted over the hole. Against this he laid his ear, and then he heard the voice quite distinctly."}, {"size": 618, "text": "There was, in fact, a little corner of the paper loose, and through that, as from a mouth in the wall, the voice came. \u201cWhat do you mean, little boy--closing up my window?\u201d \u201cWhat window?\u201d asked Diamond. \u201cYou stuffed hay into it three times last night. I had to blow it out again three times.\u201d \u201cYou can't mean this little hole! It isn't a window; it's a hole in my bed.\u201d \u201cI did not say it was a window: I said it was my window.\u201d \u201cBut it can't be a window, because windows are holes to see out of.\u201d \u201cWell, that's just what I made this window for.\u201d \u201cBut you are outside: you can't want a window.\u201d \u201cYou are quite mistaken."}, {"size": 394, "text": "Windows are to see out of, you say. Well, I'm in my house, and I want windows to see out of it.\u201d \u201cBut you've made a window into my bed.\u201d \u201cWell, your mother has got three windows into my dancing room, and you have three into my garret.\u201d \u201cBut I heard father say, when my mother wanted him to make a window through the wall, that it was against the law, for it would look into Mr. Dyves's garden.\u201d"}, {"size": 850, "text": "\u201cThe law would have some trouble to catch me!\u201d it said. \u201cBut if it's not right, you know,\u201d said Diamond, \u201cthat's no matter. You shouldn't do it.\u201d \u201cI am so tall I am above that law,\u201d said the voice. \u201cYou must have a tall house, then,\u201d said Diamond. \u201cYes; a tall house: the clouds are inside it.\u201d \u201cDear me!\u201d said Diamond, and thought a minute. \u201cI think, then, you can hardly expect me to keep a window in my bed for you. Why don't you make a window into Mr. Dyves's bed?\u201d \u201cNobody makes a window into an ash-pit,\u201d said the voice, rather sadly. \u201cI like to see nice things out of my windows.\u201d \u201cBut he must have a nicer bed than I have, though mine is very nice--so nice that I couldn't wish a better.\u201d \u201cIt's not the bed I care about: it's what is in it.--But you just open that window.\u201d \u201cWell, mother says I shouldn't be disobliging; but it's rather hard."}, {"size": 727, "text": "You see the north wind will blow right in my face if I do.\u201d \u201cI am the North Wind.\u201d \u201cO-o-oh!\u201d said Diamond, thoughtfully. \u201cThen will you promise not to blow on my face if I open your window?\u201d \u201cI can't promise that.\u201d \u201cBut you'll give me the toothache. Mother's got it already.\u201d \u201cBut what's to become of me without a window?\u201d \u201cI'm sure I don't know. All I say is, it will be worse for me than for you.\u201d \u201cNo; it will not. You shall not be the worse for it--I promise you that. You will be much the better for it. Just you believe what I say, and do as I tell you.\u201d \u201cWell, I can pull the clothes over my head,\u201d said Diamond, and feeling with his little sharp nails, he got hold of the open edge of the paper and tore it off at once."}, {"size": 816, "text": "In came a long whistling spear of cold, and struck his little naked chest. He scrambled and tumbled in under the bedclothes, and covered himself up: there was no paper now between him and the voice, and he felt a little--not frightened exactly--I told you he had not learned that yet--but rather queer; for what a strange person this North Wind must be that lived in the great house--\u201ccalled Out-of-Doors, I suppose,\u201d thought Diamond--and made windows into people's beds! But the voice began again; and he could hear it quite plainly, even with his head under the bed-clothes. It was a still more gentle voice now, although six times as large and loud as it had been, and he thought it sounded a little like his mother's. \u201cWhat is your name, little boy?\u201d it asked. \u201cDiamond,\u201d answered Diamond, under the bed-clothes."}, {"size": 647, "text": "\u201cIt's a very nice name,\u201d returned its owner. \u201cI don't know that,\u201d said the voice. \u201cWell, I do,\u201d retorted Diamond, a little rudely. \u201cDo you know to whom you are speaking!\u201d And indeed he did not. For to know a person's name is not always to know the person's self. \u201cThen I must not be angry with you.--You had better look and see, though.\u201d \u201cDiamond is a very pretty name,\u201d persisted the boy, vexed that it should not give satisfaction. \u201cDiamond is a useless thing rather,\u201d said the voice. \u201cThat's not true. Diamond is very nice--as big as two--and so quiet all night! And doesn't he make a jolly row in the morning, getting upon his four great legs!"}, {"size": 859, "text": "It's like thunder.\u201d \u201cYou don't seem to know what a diamond is.\u201d \u201cOh, don't I just! Diamond is a great and good horse; and he sleeps right under me. He is old Diamond, and I am young Diamond; or, if you like it better, for you're very particular, Mr. North Wind, he's big Diamond, and I'm little Diamond; and I don't know which of us my father likes best.\u201d A beautiful laugh, large but very soft and musical, sounded somewhere beside him, but Diamond kept his head under the clothes. \u201cI'm not Mr. North Wind,\u201d said the voice. \u201cYou told me that you were the North Wind,\u201d insisted Diamond. \u201cI did not say Mister North Wind,\u201d said the voice. \u201cWell, then, I do; for mother tells me I ought to be polite.\u201d \u201cThen let me tell you I don't think it at all polite of you to say Mister to me.\u201d \u201cWell, I didn't know better. I'm very sorry.\u201d \u201cBut you ought to know better.\u201d"}, {"size": 624, "text": "\u201cI do. You can't say it's polite to lie there talking--with your head under the bed-clothes, and never look up to see what kind of person you are talking to.--I want you to come out with me.\u201d \u201cI want to go to sleep,\u201d said Diamond, very nearly crying, for he did not like to be scolded, even when he deserved it. \u201cYou shall sleep all the better to-morrow night.\u201d \u201cBesides,\u201d said Diamond, \u201cyou are out in Mr. Dyves's garden, and I can't get there. I can only get into our own yard.\u201d \u201cWill you take your head out of the bed-clothes?\u201d said the voice, just a little angrily. \u201cNo!\u201d answered Diamond, half peevish, half frightened."}, {"size": 831, "text": "The instant he said the word, a tremendous blast of wind crashed in a board of the wall, and swept the clothes off Diamond. He started up in terror. Leaning over him was the large, beautiful, pale face of a woman. Her dark eyes looked a little angry, for they had just begun to flash; but a quivering in her sweet upper lip made her look as if she were going to cry. What was the most strange was that away from her head streamed out her black hair in every direction, so that the darkness in the hay-loft looked as if it were made of her hair but as Diamond gazed at her in speechless amazement, mingled with confidence--for the boy was entranced with her mighty beauty--her hair began to gather itself out of the darkness, and fell down all about her again, till her face looked out of the midst of it like a moon out of a cloud."}, {"size": 619, "text": "From her eyes came all the light by which Diamond saw her face and her hair; and that was all he did see of her yet. The wind was over and gone. \u201cWill you go with me now, you little Diamond? I am sorry I was forced to be so rough with you,\u201d said the lady. \u201cI will; yes, I will,\u201d answered Diamond, holding out both his arms. \u201cBut,\u201d he added, dropping them, \u201chow shall I get my clothes? They are in mother's room, and the door is locked.\u201d \u201cOh, never mind your clothes. You will not be cold. I shall take care of that. Nobody is cold with the north wind.\u201d \u201cI thought everybody was,\u201d said Diamond. \u201cThat is a great mistake."}, {"size": 695, "text": "Most people make it, however. They are cold because they are not with the north wind, but without it.\u201d If Diamond had been a little older, and had supposed himself a good deal wiser, he would have thought the lady was joking. But he was not older, and did not fancy himself wiser, and therefore understood her well enough. Again he stretched out his arms. The lady's face drew back a little. \u201cFollow me, Diamond,\u201d she said. \u201cYes,\u201d said Diamond, only a little ruefully. \u201cYou're not afraid?\u201d said the North Wind. \u201cNo, ma'am; but mother never would let me go without shoes: she never said anything about clothes, so I dare say she wouldn't mind that.\u201d \u201cI know your mother very well,\u201d said the lady."}, {"size": 882, "text": "\u201cShe is a good woman. I have visited her often. I was with her when you were born. I saw her laugh and cry both at once. I love your mother, Diamond.\u201d \u201cHow was it you did not know my name, then, ma'am? Please am I to say ma'am to you, ma'am?\u201d \u201cOne question at a time, dear boy. I knew your name quite well, but I wanted to hear what you would say for it. Don't you remember that day when the man was finding fault with your name--how I blew the window in?\u201d \u201cYes, yes,\u201d answered Diamond, eagerly. \u201cOur window opens like a door, right over the coach-house door. And the wind--you, ma'am--came in, and blew the Bible out of the man's hands, and the leaves went all flutter, flutter on the floor, and my mother picked it up and gave it back to him open, and there----\u201d \u201cWas your name in the Bible--the sixth stone in the high priest's breastplate.\u201d \u201cOh!--a stone, was it?\u201d said Diamond."}, {"size": 669, "text": "\u201cI thought it had been a horse--I did.\u201d \u201cNever mind. A horse is better than a stone any day. Well, you see, I know all about you and your mother.\u201d \u201cYes. I will go with you.\u201d \u201cNow for the next question: you're not to call me ma'am. You must call me just my own name--respectfully, you know--just North Wind.\u201d \u201cWell, please, North Wind, you are so beautiful, I am quite ready to go with you.\u201d \u201cYou must not be ready to go with everything beautiful all at once, Diamond.\u201d \u201cBut what's beautiful can't be bad. You're not bad, North Wind?\u201d \u201cNo; I'm not bad. But sometimes beautiful things grow bad by doing bad, and it takes some time for their badness to spoil their beauty."}, {"size": 688, "text": "So little boys may be mistaken if they go after things because they are beautiful.\u201d \u201cWell, I will go with you because you are beautiful and good, too.\u201d \u201cAh, but there's another thing, Diamond:--What if I should look ugly without being bad--look ugly myself because I am making ugly things beautiful?--What then?\u201d \u201cI don't quite understand you, North Wind. You tell me what then.\u201d \u201cWell, I will tell you. If you see me with my face all black, don't be frightened. If you see me flapping wings like a bat's, as big as the whole sky, don't be frightened. If you hear me raging ten times worse than Mrs. Bill, the blacksmith's wife--even if you see me looking in at people's windows like Mrs."}, {"size": 571, "text": "Eve Dropper, the gardener's wife--you must believe that I am doing my work. Nay, Diamond, if I change into a serpent or a tiger, you must not let go your hold of me, for my hand will never change in yours if you keep a good hold. If you keep a hold, you will know who I am all the time, even when you look at me and can't see me the least like the North Wind. I may look something very awful. Do you understand?\u201d \u201cQuite well,\u201d said little Diamond. \u201cCome along, then,\u201d said North Wind, and disappeared behind the mountain of hay. Diamond crept out of bed and followed her."}, {"size": 618, "text": "WHEN Diamond got round the corner of the hay, for a moment he hesitated. The stair by which he would naturally have gone down to the door was at the other side of the loft, and looked very black indeed; for it was full of North Wind's hair, as she descended before him. And just beside him was the ladder going straight down into the stable, up which his father always came to fetch the hay for Diamond's dinner. Through the opening in the floor the faint gleam of the-stable lantern was enticing, and Diamond thought he would run down that way.The stair went close past the loose-box in which Diamond the horse lived."}, {"size": 696, "text": "When Diamond the boy was half-way down, he remembered that it was of no use to go this way, for the stable-door was locked. But at the same moment there was horse Diamond's great head poked out of his box on to the ladder, for he knew boy Diamond although he was in his night-gown, and wanted him to pull his ears for him. This Diamond did very gently for a minute or so, and patted and stroked his neck too, and kissed the big horse, and had begun to take the bits of straw and hay out of his mane, when all at once he recollected that the Lady North Wind was waiting for him in the yard. \u201cGood night, Diamond,\u201d he said, and darted up the ladder, across the loft, and down the stair to the door."}, {"size": 656, "text": "But when he got out into the yard, there was no lady. Now it is always a dreadful thing to think there is somebody and find nobody. Children in particular have not made up their minds to it; they generally cry at nobody, especially when they wake up at night. But it was an especial disappointment to Diamond, for his little heart had been beating with joy: the face of the North Wind was so grand! To have a lady like that for a friend--with such long hair, too! Why, it was longer than twenty Diamonds' tails! She was gone. And there he stood, with his bare feet on the stones of the paved yard. It was a clear night overhead, and the stars were shining."}, {"size": 730, "text": "Orion in particular was making the most of his bright belt and golden sword. But the moon was only a poor thin crescent. There was just one great, jagged, black and gray cloud in the sky, with a steep side to it like a precipice; and the moon was against this side, and looked as if she had tumbled off the top of the cloud-hill, and broken herself in rolling down the precipice. She did not seem comfortable, for she was looking down into the deep pit waiting for her. At least that was what Diamond thought as he stood for a moment staring at her. But he was quite wrong, for the moon was not afraid, and there was no pit she was going down into, for there were no sides to it, and a pit without sides to it is not a pit at all."}, {"size": 666, "text": "Diamond, however, had not been out so late before in all his life, and things looked so strange about him!--just as if he had got into Fairyland, of which he knew quite as much as anybody; for his mother had no money to buy books to set him wrong on the subject. I have seen this world--only sometimes, just now and then, you know--look as strange as ever I saw Fairyland. But I confess that I have not yet seen Fairyland at its best. I am always going to see it so some time. But if you had been out in the face and not at the back of the North Wind, on a cold rather frosty night, and in your night-gown, you would have felt it all quite as strange as Diamond did."}, {"size": 737, "text": "He cried a little, just a little, he was so disappointed to lose the lady: of course, you, little man, wouldn't have done that! But for my part, I don't mind people crying so much as I mind what they cry about, and how they cry--whether they cry quietly like ladies and gentlemen, or go shrieking like vulgar emperors, or ill-natured cooks; for all emperors are not gentlemen, and all cooks are not ladies--nor all queens and princesses for that matter, either. But it can't be denied that a little gentle crying does one good. It did Diamond good; for as soon as it was over he was a brave boy again. \u201cShe shan't say it was my fault, anyhow!\u201d said Diamond. \u201cI daresay she is hiding somewhere to see what I will do. I will look for her.\u201d"}, {"size": 627, "text": "So he went round the end of the stable towards the kitchen-garden. But the moment he was clear of the shelter of the stable, sharp as a knife came the wind against his little chest and his bare legs. Still he would look in the kitchen-garden, and went on. But when he got round the weeping-ash that stood in the corner, the wind blew much stronger, and it grew stronger and stronger till he could hardly fight against it. And it was so cold! All the flashy spikes of the stars seemed to have got somehow into the wind. Then he thought of what the lady had said about people being cold because they were not with the North Wind."}, {"size": 762, "text": "How it was that he should have guessed what she meant at that very moment I cannot tell, but I have observed that the most wonderful thing in the world is how people come to understand anything. He turned his back to the wind, and trotted again towards the yard; whereupon, strange to say, it blew so much more gently against his calves than it had blown against his shins that he began to feel almost warm by contrast. You must not think it was cowardly of Diamond to turn his back to the wind: he did so only because he thought Lady North Wind had said something like telling him to do so. If she had said to him that he must hold his face to it, Diamond would have held his face to it. But the most foolish thing is to fight for no good, and to please nobody."}, {"size": 642, "text": "Well, it was just as if the wind was pushing Diamond along. If he turned round, it grew very sharp on his legs especially, and so he thought the wind might really be Lady North Wind, though he could not see her, and he had better let her blow him wherever she pleased. So she blew and blew, and he went and went, until he found himself standing at a door in a wall, which door led from the yard into a little belt of shrubbery, flanking Mr. Coleman's house. Mr. Coleman was his father's master, and the owner of Diamond. He opened the door, and went through the shrubbery, and out into the middle of the lawn, still hoping to find North Wind."}, {"size": 642, "text": "The soft grass was very pleasant to his bare feet, and felt warm after the stones of the yard; but the lady was nowhere to be seen. Then he began to think that after all he must have done wrong, and she was offended with him for not following close after her, but staying to talk to the horse, which certainly was neither wise nor polite. There he stood in the middle of the lawn, the wind blowing his night-gown till it flapped like a loose sail. The stars were very shiny over his head; but they did not give light enough to show that the grass was green; and Diamond stood alone in the strange night, which looked half solid all about him."}, {"size": 654, "text": "He began to wonder whether he was in a dream or not. It was important to determine this; \u201cfor,\u201d thought Diamond, \u201cif I am in a dream, I am safe in my bed, and I needn't cry. But if I'm not in a dream, I'm out here, and perhaps I had better cry, or, at least, I'm not sure whether I can help it.\u201d He came to the conclusion, however, that, whether he was in a dream or not, there could be no harm in not crying for a little while longer: he could begin whenever he liked. The back of Mr. Coleman's house was to the lawn, and one of the drawing-room windows looked out upon it. The ladies had not gone to bed; for the light was still shining in that window."}, {"size": 662, "text": "But they had no idea that a little boy was standing on the lawn in his night-gown, or they would have run out in a moment. And as long as he saw that light, Diamond could not feel quite lonely. He stood staring, not at the great warrior Orion in the sky, nor yet at the disconsolate, neglected moon going down in the west, but at the drawing-room window with the light shining through its green curtains. He had been in that room once or twice that he could remember at Christmas times; for the Colemans were kind people, though they did not care much about children. All at once the light went nearly out: he could only see a glimmer of the shape of the window."}, {"size": 698, "text": "Then, indeed, he felt that he was left alone. It was so dreadful to be out in the night after everybody was gone to bed! That was more than he could bear. He burst out crying in good earnest, beginning with a wail like that of the wind when it is waking up. Perhaps you think this was very foolish; for could he not go home to his own bed again when he liked? Yes; but it looked dreadful to him to creep up that stair again and lie down in his bed again, and know that North Wind's window was open beside him, and she gone, and he might never see her again. He would be just as lonely there as here. Nay, it would be much worse if he had to think that the window was nothing but a hole in the wall."}, {"size": 744, "text": "At the very moment when he burst out crying, the old nurse who had grown to be one of the family, for she had not gone away when Miss Coleman did not want any more nursing, came to the back door, which was of glass, to close the shutters. She thought she heard a cry, and, peering out with a hand on each side of her eyes like Diamond's blinkers, she saw something white on the lawn. Too old and too wise to be frightened, she opened the door, and went straight towards the white thing to see what it was. And when Diamond saw her coming he was not frightened either, though Mrs. Crump was a little cross sometimes; for there is a good kind of crossness that is only disagreeable, and there is a bad kind of crossness that is very nasty indeed."}, {"size": 777, "text": "So she came up with her neck stretched out, and her head at the end of it, and her eyes foremost of all, like a snail's, peering into the night to see what it could be that went on glimmering white before her. When she did see, she made a great exclamation, and threw up her hands. Then without a word, for she thought Diamond was walking in his sleep, she caught hold of him, and led him towards the house. He made no objection, for he was just in the mood to be grateful for notice of any sort, and Mrs. Crump led him straight into the drawing-room. Now, from the neglect of the new housemaid, the fire in Miss Coleman's bedroom had gone out, and her mother had told her to brush her hair by the drawing-room fire--a disorderly proceeding which a mother's wish could justify."}, {"size": 681, "text": "The young lady was very lovely, though not nearly so beautiful as North Wind; and her hair was extremely long, for it came down to her knees--though that was nothing at all to North Wind's hair. Yet when she looked round, with her hair all about her, as Diamond entered, he thought for one moment that it was North Wind, and, pulling his hand from Mrs. Crump's, he stretched out his arms and ran towards Miss Coleman. She was so pleased that she threw down her brush, and almost knelt on the floor to receive him in her arms. He saw the next moment that she was not Lady North Wind, but she looked so like her he could not help running into her arms and bursting into tears afresh."}, {"size": 719, "text": "Mrs. Crump said the poor child had walked out in his sleep, and Diamond thought she ought to know, and did not contradict her for anything he knew, it might be so indeed. He let them talk on about him, and said nothing; and when, after their astonishment was over, and Miss Coleman had given him a sponge-cake, it was decreed that Mrs. Crump should take him to his mother, he was quite satisfied. His mother had to get out of bed to open the door when Mrs. Crump knocked. She was indeed surprised to see her, boy; and having taken him in her arms and carried him to his bed, returned and had a long confabulation with Mrs. Crump, for they were still talking when Diamond fell fast asleep, and could hear them no longer."}, {"size": 810, "text": "CHAPTER III. OLD DIAMONDDIAMOND woke very early in the morning, and thought what a curious dream he had had. But the memory grew brighter and brighter in his head, until it did not look altogether like a dream, and he began to doubt whether he had not really been abroad in the wind last night. He came to the conclusion that, if he had really been brought home to his mother by Mrs. Crump, she would say something to him about it, and that would settle the matter. Then he got up and dressed himself, but, finding that his father and mother were not yet stirring, he went down the ladder to the stable. There he found that even old Diamond was not awake yet, for he, as well as young Diamond, always got up the moment he woke, and now he was lying as flat as a horse could lie upon his nice trim bed of straw."}, {"size": 626, "text": "\u201cI'll give old Diamond a surprise,\u201d thought the boy; and creeping up very softly, before the horse knew, he was astride of his back. Then it was young Diamond's turn to have more of a surprise than he had expected; for as with an earthquake, with a rumbling and a rocking hither and thither, a sprawling of legs and heaving as of many backs, young Diamond found himself hoisted up in the air, with both hands twisted in the horse's mane. The next instant old Diamond lashed out with both his hind legs, and giving one cry of terror young Diamond found himself lying on his neck, with his arms as far round it as they would go."}, {"size": 635, "text": "But then the horse stood as still as a stone, except that he lifted his head gently up to let the boy slip down to his back. For when he heard young Diamond's cry he knew that there was nothing to kick about; for young Diamond was a good boy, and old Diamond was a good horse, and the one was all right on the back of the other. As soon as Diamond had got himself comfortable on the saddle place, the horse began pulling at the hay, and the boy began thinking. He had never mounted Diamond himself before, and he had never got off him without being lifted down. So he sat, while the horse ate, wondering how he was to reach the ground."}, {"size": 368, "text": "But while he meditated, his mother woke, and her first thought was to see her boy. She had visited him twice during the night, and found him sleeping quietly. Now his bed was empty, and she was frightened. \u201cDiamond! Diamond! Where are you, Diamond?\u201d she called out. Diamond turned his head where he sat like a knight on his steed in enchanted stall, and cried aloud,--"}, {"size": 603, "text": "\u201cWhere, Diamond?\u201d she returned. \u201cHere, mother, on Diamond's back.\u201d She came running to the ladder, and peeping down, saw him aloft on the great horse. \u201cCome down, Diamond,\u201d she said. \u201cI can't,\u201d answered Diamond. \u201cHow did you get up?\u201d asked his mother. \u201cQuite easily,\u201d answered he; \u201cbut when I got up, Diamond would get up too, and so here I am.\u201d His mother thought he had been walking in his sleep again, and hurried down the ladder. She did not much like going up to the horse, for she had not been used to horses; but she would have gone into a lion's den, not to say a horse's stall, to help her boy."}, {"size": 624, "text": "So she went and lifted him off Diamond's back, and felt braver all her life after. She carried him in her arms up to her room; but, afraid of frightening him at his own sleep-walking, as she supposed it, said nothing about last night. Before the next day was over, Diamond had almost concluded the whole adventure a dream. For a week his mother watched him very carefully--going into the loft several times a night--as often, in fact, as she woke. Every time she found him fast asleep. All that week it was hard weather. The grass showed white in the morning with the hoar-frost which clung like tiny comfits to every blade."}, {"size": 638, "text": "And as Diamond's shoes were not good, and his mother had not quite saved up enough money to get him the new pair she so much wanted for him, she would not let him run out. He played all his games over and over indoors, especially that of driving two chairs harnessed to the baby's cradle; and if they did not go very fast, they went as fast as could be expected of the best chairs in the world, although one of them had only three legs, and the other only half a back. At length his mother brought home his new shoes, and no sooner did she find they fitted him than she told him he might run out in the yard and amuse himself for an hour."}, {"size": 731, "text": "The sun was going down when he flew from the door like a bird from its cage. All the world was new to him. A great fire of sunset burned on the top of the gate that led from the stables to the house; above the fire in the sky lay a large lake of green light, above that a golden cloud, and over that the blue of the wintry heavens. And Diamond thought that, next to his own home, he had never seen any place he would like so much to live in as that sky. For it is not fine things that make home a nice place, but your mother and your father. As he was looking at the lovely colours, the gates were thrown open, and there was old Diamond and his friend in the carriage, dancing with impatience to get at their stalls and their oats."}, {"size": 632, "text": "And in they came. Diamond was not in the least afraid of his father driving over him, but, careful not to spoil the grand show he made with his fine horses and his multitudinous cape, with a red edge to every fold, he slipped out of the way and let him dash right on to the stables. To be quite safe he had to step into the recess of the door that led from the yard to the shrubbery. As he stood there he remembered how the wind had driven him to this same spot on the night of his dream. And once more he was almost sure that it was no dream. At all events, he would go in and see whether things looked at all now as they did then."}, {"size": 635, "text": "He opened the door, and passed through the little belt of shrubbery. Not a flower was to be seen in the beds on the lawn. Even the brave old chrysanthemums and Christmas roses had passed away before the frost. What? Yes! There was one! He ran and knelt down to look at it. It was a primrose--a dwarfish thing, but perfect in shape--a baby-wonder. As he stooped his face to see it close, a little wind began to blow, and two or three long leaves that stood up behind the flower shook and waved and quivered, but the primrose lay still in the green hollow, looking up at the sky, and not seeming to know that the wind was blowing at all."}, {"size": 632, "text": "It was just a one eye that the dull black wintry earth had opened to look at the sky with. All at once Diamond thought it was saying its prayers, and he ought not to be staring at it so. He ran to the stable to see his father make Diamond's bed. Then his father took him in his arms, carried him up the ladder, and set him down at the table where they were going to have their tea. \u201cMiss is very poorly,\u201d said Diamond's father. \u201cMis'ess has been to the doctor with her to-day, and she looked very glum when she came out again. I was a-watching of them to see what doctor had said.\u201d \u201cAnd didn't Miss look glum too?\u201d asked his mother."}, {"size": 612, "text": "\u201cNot half as glum as Mis'ess,\u201d returned the coachman. \u201cYou see--\u201d But he lowered his voice, and Diamond could not make out more than a word here and there. For Diamond's father was not only one of the finest of coachmen to look at, and one of the best of drivers, but one of the most discreet of servants as well. Therefore he did not talk about family affairs to any one but his wife, whom he had proved better than himself long ago, and was careful that even Diamond should hear nothing he could repeat again concerning master and his family. It was bed-time soon, and Diamond went to bed and fell fast asleep."}, {"size": 627, "text": "He awoke all at once, in the dark. \u201cOpen the window, Diamond,\u201d said a voice. Now Diamond's mother had once more pasted up North Wind's window. \u201cAre you North Wind?\u201d said Diamond: \u201cI don't hear you blowing.\u201d \u201cNo; but you hear me talking. Open the window, for I haven't overmuch time.\u201d \u201cYes,\u201d returned Diamond. \u201cBut, please, North Wind, where's the use? You left me all alone last time.\u201d He had got up on his knees, and was busy with his nails once more at the paper over the hole in the wall. For now that North Wind spoke again, he remembered all that had taken place before as distinctly as if it had happened only last night."}, {"size": 821, "text": "\u201cYes, but that was your fault,\u201d returned North Wind. \u201cI had work to do; and, besides, a gentleman should never keep a lady waiting.\u201d \u201cBut I'm not a gentleman,\u201d said Diamond, scratching away at the paper. \u201cI hope you won't say so ten years after this.\u201d \u201cI'm going to be a coachman, and a coachman is not a gentleman,\u201d persisted Diamond. \u201cWe call your father a gentleman in our house,\u201d said North Wind. \u201cHe doesn't call himself one,\u201d said Diamond. \u201cThat's of no consequence: every man ought to be a gentleman, and your father is one.\u201d Diamond was so pleased to hear this that he scratched at the paper like ten mice, and getting hold of the edge of it, tore it off. The next instant a young girl glided across the bed, and stood upon the floor. \u201cOh dear!\u201d said Diamond, quite dismayed; \u201cI didn't know--who are you, please?\u201d"}, {"size": 714, "text": "\u201cBut you're no bigger than me.\u201d \u201cDo you think I care about how big or how little I am?

I think you are only Miss North Wind.\u201d \u201cI am big enough to show you the way, anyhow. But if you won't come, why, you must stay.\u201d \u201cI must dress myself. I didn't mind with a grown lady, but I couldn't go with a little girl in my night-gown.\u201d \u201cVery well. I'm not in such a hurry as I was the other night. Dress as fast as you can, and I'll go and shake the primrose leaves till you come.\u201d \u201cDon't hurt it,\u201d said Diamond."}, {"size": 649, "text": "North Wind broke out in a little laugh like the breaking of silver bubbles, and was gone in a moment. Diamond saw--for it was a starlit night, and the mass of hay was at a low ebb now--the gleam of something vanishing down the stair, and, springing out of bed, dressed himself as fast as ever he could. Then he crept out into the yard, through the door in the wall, and away to the primrose. Behind it stood North Wind, leaning over it, and looking at the flower as if she had been its mother. \u201cCome along,\u201d she said, jumping up and holding out her hand. Diamond took her hand. It was cold, but so pleasant and full of life, it was better than warm."}, {"size": 619, "text": "She led him across the garden. With one bound she was on the top of the wall.

She reached down, Diamond laid hold of her hand, gave a great spring, and stood beside her. \u201cThis is nice!\u201d he said. Another bound, and they stood in the road by the river. It was full tide, and the stars were shining clear in its depths, for it lay still, waiting for the turn to run down again to the sea."}, {"size": 636, "text": "They walked along its side. But they had not walked far before its surface was covered with ripples, and the stars had vanished from its bosom. And North Wind was now tall as a full-grown girl.

But she turned aside and went up a narrow lane, and as she went her hair fell down around her. \u201cI have some rather disagreeable work to do to-night,\u201d she said, \u201cbefore I get out to sea, and I must set about it at once. The disagreeable work must be looked after first.\u201d So saying, she laid hold of Diamond and began to run, gliding along faster and faster."}, {"size": 633, "text": "Diamond kept up with her as well as he could. She made many turnings and windings, apparently because it was not quite easy to get him over walls and houses. Once they ran through a hall where they found back and front doors open. At the foot of the stair North Wind stood still, and Diamond, hearing a great growl, started in terror, and there, instead of North Wind, was a huge wolf by his side. He let go his hold in dismay, and the wolf bounded up the stair. The windows of the house rattled and shook as if guns were firing, and the sound of a great fall came from above.

Before he reached the head of the stair, however, North Wind met him, took him by the hand, and hurried down and out of the house. \u201cI hope you haven't eaten a baby, North Wind!\u201d said Diamond, very solemnly.

You would not have had to ask that foolish question if you had not let go your hold of me. You would have seen how I served a nurse that was calling a child bad names, and telling her she was wicked. She had been drinking. I saw an ugly gin bottle in a cupboard.\u201d \u201cAnd you frightened her?\u201d said Diamond. \u201cI believe so!\u201d answered North Wind laughing merrily."}, {"size": 695, "text": "\u201cI flew at her throat, and she tumbled over on the floor with such a crash that they ran in.

Good people see good things; bad people, bad things.\u201d \u201cThen are you a bad thing?\u201d \u201cNo. For you see me, Diamond, dear,\u201d said the girl, and she looked down at him, and Diamond saw the loving eyes of the great lady beaming from the depths of her falling hair."}, {"size": 820, "text": "\u201cI had to make myself look like a bad thing before she could see me.

The moment they reached the top, North Wind stood and turned her face towards London The stars were still shining clear and cold overhead. There was not a cloud to be seen. The air was sharp, but Diamond did not find it cold. \u201cNow,\u201d said the lady, \u201cwhatever you do, do not let my hand go.

Those careless, greedy, untidy children make it in such a mess.\u201dAs she spoke he could have told by her voice, if he had not seen with his eyes, that she was growing larger and larger.

Come.\u201d Diamond held out his arms, for with that grand face looking at him, he believed like a baby.

The next moment he was rising in the air. North Wind grew towering up to the place of the clouds. Her hair went streaming out from her, till it spread like a mist over the stars. She flung herself abroad in space. Diamond held on by two of the twisted ropes which, parted and interwoven, formed his shelter, for he could not help being a little afraid.

And now there was nothing but the roofs of houses, sweeping along like a great torrent of stones and rocks. Chimney-pots fell, and tiles flew from the roofs; but it looked to him as if they were left behind by the roofs and the chimneys as they scudded away.

It was a grand thing to be able to guide a great beast like that. And another discovery he made was that, in order to guide the horse, he had in a measure to obey the horse first.

His hair blew one way, his night-gown another, his legs threatened to float from under him, and his head to grow dizzy with the swiftness of the invisible assailant. Cowering, he clung with the other hand to the huge hand which held his arm, and fear invaded his heart.\u201cOh, North Wind!\u201d he murmured, but the words vanished from his lips as he had seen the soap-bubbles that burst too soon vanish from the mouth of his pipe."}, {"size": 852, "text": "The wind caught them, and they were nowhere.

Her voice was like the bass of a deep organ, without the groan in it; like the most delicate of violin tones without the wail in it; like the most glorious of trumpet-ejaculations without the defiance in it; like the sound of falling water without the clatter and clash in it: it was like all of them and neither of them--all of them without their faults, each of them without its peculiarity: after all, it was more like his mother's voice than anything else in the world."}, {"size": 633, "text": "\u201cDiamond, dear,\u201d she said, \u201cbe a man.

You'll find me on the doorstep.\u201d As she spoke, her face too faded quite away, only Diamond thought he could still see her eyes shining through the blue."}, {"size": 671, "text": "When he went closer, however, he found that what he thought her eyes were only two hollows in the ice. North Wind was quite gone; and Diamond would have cried, if he had not trusted her so thoroughly. So he sat still in the blue air of the cavern listening to the wash and ripple of the water all about the base of the iceberg, as it sped on and on into the open sea northwards. It was an excellent craft to go with the current, for there was twice as much of it below water as above. But a light south wind was blowing too, and so it went fast. After a little while Diamond went out and sat on the edge of his floating island, and looked down into the ocean beneath him."}, {"size": 796, "text": "The white sides of the berg reflected so much light below the water, that he could see far down into the green abyss. Sometimes he fancied he saw the eyes of North Wind looking up at him from below, but the fancy never lasted beyond the moment of its birth. And the time passed he did not know how, for he felt as if he were in a dream. When he got tired of the green water, he went into the blue cave; and when he got tired of the blue cave he went out and gazed all about him on the blue sea, ever sparkling in the sun, which kept wheeling about the sky, never going below the horizon. But he chiefly gazed northwards, to see whether any land were appearing. All this time he never wanted to eat. He broke off little bits of the berg now and then and sucked them, and he thought them very nice."}, {"size": 672, "text": "At length, one time he came out of his cave, he spied far off on the horizon, a shining peak that rose into the sky like the top of some tremendous iceberg; and his vessel was bearing him straight towards it. As it went on the peak rose and rose higher and higher above the horizon; and other peaks rose after it, with sharp edges and jagged ridges connecting them. Diamond thought this must be the place he was going to; and he was right; for the mountains rose and rose, till he saw the line of the coast at their feet and at length the iceberg drove into a little bay, all around which were lofty precipices with snow on their tops, and streaks of ice down their sides."}, {"size": 616, "text": "The berg floated slowly up to a projecting rock. Diamond stepped on shore, and without looking behind him began to follow a natural path which led windingly towards the top of the precipice. When he reached it, he found himself on a broad table of ice, along which he could walk without much difficulty. Before him, at a considerable distance, rose a lofty ridge of ice, which shot up into fantastic pinnacles and towers and battlements. The air was very cold, and seemed somehow dead, for there was not the slightest breath of wind. In the centre of the ridge before him appeared a gap like the opening of a valley."}, {"size": 657, "text": "But as he walked towards it, gazing, and wondering whether that could be the way he had to take, he saw that what had appeared a gap was the form of a woman seated against the ice front of the ridge, leaning forwards with her hands in her lap, and her hair hanging down to the ground. \u201cIt is North Wind on her doorstep,\u201d said Diamond joyfully, and hurried on. He soon came up to the place, and there the form sat, like one of the great figures at the door of an Egyptian temple, motionless, with drooping arms and head. Then Diamond grew frightened, because she did not move nor speak. He was sure it was North Wind, but he thought she must be dead at last."}, {"size": 393, "text": "Her face was white as the snow, her eyes were blue as the air in the ice-cave, and her hair hung down straight, like icicles. She had on a greenish robe, like the colour in the hollows of a glacier seen from far off. He stood up before her, and gazed fearfully into her face for a few minutes before he ventured to speak. At length, with a great effort and a trembling voice, he faltered out--"}, {"size": 755, "text": "\u201cWell, child?\u201d said the form, without lifting its head. \u201cAre you ill, dear North Wind?\u201d \u201cYou don't care for me any more,\u201d said Diamond, almost crying now. \u201cYes I do. Only I can't show it. All my love is down at the bottom of my heart. But I feel it bubbling there.\u201d \u201cWhat do you want me to do next, dear North Wind?\u201d said Diamond, wishing to show his love by being obedient. \u201cWhat do you want to do yourself?\u201d \u201cI want to go into the country at your back.\u201d \u201cThen you must go through me.\u201d \u201cI don't know what you mean.\u201d \u201cI mean just what I say. You must walk on as if I were an open door, and go right through me.\u201d \u201cBut that will hurt you.\u201d \u201cNot in the least. It will hurt you, though.\u201d \u201cI don't mind that, if you tell me to do it.\u201d \u201cDo it,\u201d said North Wind."}, {"size": 654, "text": "Diamond walked towards her instantly. When he reached her knees, he put out his hand to lay it on her, but nothing was there save an intense cold. He walked on. Then all grew white about him; and the cold stung him like fire. He walked on still, groping through the whiteness. It thickened about him. At last, it got into his heart, and he lost all sense. I would say that he fainted--only whereas in common faints all grows black about you, he felt swallowed up in whiteness. It was when he reached North Wind's heart that he fainted and fell. But as he fell, he rolled over the threshold, and it was thus that Diamond got to the back of the north wind."}, {"size": 646, "text": "CHAPTER X. AT THE BACK OF THE NORTH WINDI HAVE now come to the most difficult part of my story. And why? Because I do not know enough about it. And why should I not know as much about this part as about any other part? For of course I could know nothing about the story except Diamond had told it; and why should not Diamond tell about the country at the back of the north wind, as well as about his adventures in getting there? Because, when he came back, he had forgotten a great deal, and what he did remember was very hard to tell. Things there are so different from things here! The people there do not speak the same language for one thing."}, {"size": 676, "text": "Indeed, Diamond insisted that there they do not speak at all. I do not think he was right, but it may well have appeared so to Diamond. The fact is, we have different reports of the place from the most trustworthy people. Therefore we are bound to believe that it appears somewhat different to different people. All, however, agree in a general way about it. I will tell you something of what two very different people have reported, both of whom knew more about it, I believe, than Herodotus. One of them speaks from his own experience, for he visited the country; the other from the testimony of a young peasant girl who came back from it for a month's visit to her friends."}, {"size": 711, "text": "The former was a great Italian of noble family, who died more than five hundred years ago; the latter a Scotch shepherd who died not forty years ago. The Italian, then, informs us that he had to enter that country through a fire so hot that he would have thrown himself into boiling glass to cool himself. This was not Diamond's experience, but then Durante--that was the name of the Italian, and it means Lasting, for his books will last as long as there are enough men in the world worthy of having them--Durante was an elderly man, and Diamond was a little boy, and so their experience must be a little different. The peasant girl, on the other hand, fell fast asleep in a wood, and woke in the same country."}, {"size": 741, "text": "In describing it, Durante says that the ground everywhere smelt sweetly, and that a gentle, even-tempered wind, which never blew faster or slower, breathed in his face as he went, making all the leaves point one way, not so as to disturb the birds in the tops of the trees, but, on the contrary, sounding a bass to their song. He describes also a little river which was so full that its little waves, as it hurried along, bent the grass, full of red and yellow flowers, through which it flowed. He says that the purest stream in the world beside this one would look as if it were mixed with something that did not belong to it, even although it was flowing ever in the brown shadow of the trees, and neither sun nor moon could shine upon it."}, {"size": 745, "text": "He seems to imply that it is always the month of May in that country. It would be out of place to describe here the wonderful sights he saw, for the music of them is in another key from that of this story, and I shall therefore only add from the account of this traveller, that the people there are so free and so just and so healthy, that every one of them has a crown like a king and a mitre like a priest. The peasant girl--Kilmeny was her name--could not report such grand things as Durante, for, as the shepherd says, telling her story as I tell Diamond's-- \u201cKilmeny had been she knew not where, And Kilmeny had seen what she could not declare; Kilmeny had been where the cock never crew, Where the rain never fell, and the wind never blew."}, {"size": 398, "text": "But it seemed as the harp of the sky had rung, And the airs of heaven played round her tongue, When she spoke of the lovely forms she had seen, And a land where sin had never been; A land of love and a land of light, Withouten sun, or moon, or night; Where the river swayed a living stream, And the light a pure and cloudless beam: The land of vision it would seem, And still an everlasting dream.\u201d"}, {"size": 644, "text": "The last two lines are the shepherd's own remark, and a matter of opinion. But it is clear, I think, that Kilmeny must have described the same country as Durante saw, though, not having his experience, she could neither understand nor describe it so well. Now I must give you such fragments of recollection as Diamond was able to bring back with him.When he came to himself after he fell, he found himself at the back of the north wind. North Wind herself was nowhere to be seen. Neither was there a vestige of snow or of ice within sight. The sun too had vanished; but that was no matter, for there was plenty of a certain still rayless light."}, {"size": 751, "text": "Where it came from he never found out; but he thought it belonged to the country itself. Sometimes he thought it came out of the flowers, which were very bright, but had no strong colour. He said the river--for all agree that there is a river there--flowed not only through, but over grass: its channel, instead of being rock, stones, pebbles, sand, or anything else, was of pure meadow grass, not over long. He insisted that if it did not sing tunes in people's ears, it sung tunes in their heads, in proof of which I may mention that, in the troubles which followed, Diamond was often heard singing; and when asked what he was singing, would answer, \u201cOne of the tunes the river at the back of the north wind sung.\u201d And I may as well say at once that"}, {"size": 694, "text": "Diamond never told these things to any one but--no, I had better not say who it was; but whoever it was told me, and I thought it would be well to write them for my child-readers. He could not say he was very happy there, for he had neither his father nor mother with him, but he felt so still and quiet and patient and contented, that, as far as the mere feeling went, it was something better than mere happiness. Nothing went wrong at the back of the north wind. Neither was anything quite right, he thought. Only everything was going to be right some day. His account disagreed with that of Durante, and agreed with that of Kilmeny, in this, that he protested there was no wind there at all."}, {"size": 564, "text": "I fancy he missed it. At all events we could not do without wind. It all depends on how big our lungs are whether the wind is too strong for us or not. When the person he told about it asked him whether he saw anybody he knew there, he answered, \u201cOnly a little girl belonging to the gardener, who thought he had lost her, but was quite mistaken, for there she was safe enough, and was to come back some day, as I came back, if they would only wait.\u201d \u201cDid you talk to her, Diamond?\u201d \u201cNo. Nobody talks there. They only look at each other, and understand everything.\u201d"}, {"size": 734, "text": "\u201cYou never think about such things there.\u201d \u201cWhat a queer place it must be!\u201d \u201cIt's a very good place.\u201d \u201cDo you want to go back again?\u201d \u201cNo; I don't think I have left it; I feel it here, somewhere.\u201d \u201cDid the people there look pleased?\u201d \u201cYes--quite pleased, only a little sad.\u201d \u201cThen they didn't look glad?\u201d \u201cThey looked as if they were waiting to be gladder some day.\u201d This was how Diamond used to answer questions about that country. And now I will take up the story again, and tell you how he got back to this country. CHAPTER XI. HOW DIAMOND GOT HOME AGAIN WHEN one at the back of the north wind wanted to know how things were going with any one he loved, he had to go to a certain tree, climb the stem, and sit down in the branches."}, {"size": 605, "text": "In a few minutes, if he kept very still, he would see something at least of what was going on with the people he loved. One day when Diamond was sitting in this tree, he began to long very much to get home again, and no wonder, for he saw his mother crying. Durante says that the people there may always follow their wishes, because they never wish but what is good. Diamond's wish was to get home, and he would fain follow his wish. But how was he to set about it? If he could only see North Wind! But the moment he had got to her back, she was gone altogether from his sight. He had never seen her back."}, {"size": 631, "text": "She might be sitting on her doorstep still, looking southwards, and waiting, white and thin and blue-eyed, until she was wanted. Or she might have again become a mighty creature, with power to do that which was demanded of her, and gone far away upon many missions. She must be somewhere, however. He could not go home without her, and therefore he must find her. She could never have intended to leave him always away from his mother. If there had been any danger of that, she would have told him, and given him his choice about going. For North Wind was right honest. How to find North Wind, therefore, occupied all his thoughts."}, {"size": 697, "text": "In his anxiety about his mother, he used to climb the tree every day, and sit in its branches. However many of the dwellers there did so, they never incommoded one another; for the moment one got into the tree, he became invisible to every one else; and it was such a wide-spreading tree that there was room for every one of the people of the country in it, without the least interference with each other. Sometimes, on getting down, two of them would meet at the root, and then they would smile to each other more sweetly than at any other time, as much as to say, \u201cAh, you've been up there too!\u201d One day he was sitting on one of the outer branches of the tree, looking southwards after his home."}, {"size": 669, "text": "Far away was a blue shining sea, dotted with gleaming and sparkling specks of white. Those were the icebergs. Nearer he saw a great range of snow-capped mountains, and down below him the lovely meadow-grass of the country, with the stream flowing and flowing through it, away towards the sea. As he looked he began to wonder, for the whole country lay beneath him like a map, and that which was near him looked just as small as that which he knew to be miles away. The ridge of ice which encircled it appeared but a few yards off, and no larger than the row of pebbles with which a child will mark out the boundaries of the kingdom he has appropriated on the sea-shore."}, {"size": 634, "text": "He thought he could distinguish the vapoury form of North Wind, seated as he had left her, on the other side. Hastily he descended the tree, and to his amazement found that the map or model of the country still lay at his feet. He stood in it. With one stride he had crossed the river; with another he had reached the ridge of ice; with the third he stepped over its peaks, and sank wearily down at North Wind's knees. For there she sat on her doorstep. The peaks of the great ridge of ice were as lofty as ever behind her, and the country at her back had vanished from Diamond's view. North Wind was as still as Diamond had left her."}, {"size": 697, "text": "Her pale face was white as the snow, and her motionless eyes were as blue as the caverns in the ice. But the instant Diamond touched her, her face began to change like that of one waking from sleep. Light began to glimmer from the blue of her eyes. A moment more, and she laid her hand on Diamond's head, and began playing with his hair. Diamond took hold of her hand, and laid his face to it. She gave a little start. \u201cHow very alive you are, child!\u201d she murmured. \u201cCome nearer to me.\u201d By the help of the stones all around he clambered up beside her, and laid himself against her bosom. She gave a great sigh, slowly lifted her arms, and slowly folded them about him, until she clasped him close."}, {"size": 693, "text": "Yet a moment, and she roused herself, and came quite awake; and the cold of her bosom, which had pierced Diamond's bones, vanished. \u201cHave you been sitting here ever since I went through you, dear North Wind?\u201d asked Diamond, stroking her hand. \u201cYes,\u201d she answered, looking at him with her old kindness. \u201cAin't you very tired?\u201d \u201cNo; I've often had to sit longer. Do you know how long you have been?\u201d \u201cOh! years and years,\u201d answered Diamond. \u201cYou have just been seven days,\u201d returned North Wind. \u201cI thought I had been a hundred years!\u201d exclaimed Diamond. \u201cYes, I daresay,\u201d replied North Wind. \u201cYou've been away from here seven days; but how long you may have been in there is quite another thing."}, {"size": 641, "text": "Behind my back and before my face things are so different! They don't go at all by the same rule.\u201d \u201cI'm very glad,\u201d said Diamond, after thinking a while. \u201cWhy?\u201d asked North Wind. \u201cBecause I've been such a long time there, and such a little while away from mother. Why, she won't be expecting me home from Sandwich yet!\u201d \u201cNo. But we mustn't talk any longer. I've got my orders now, and we must be off in a few minutes.\u201d Next moment Diamond found himself sitting alone on the rock. North Wind had vanished. A creature like a great humble-bee or cockchafer flew past his face; but it could be neither, for there were no insects amongst the ice."}, {"size": 610, "text": "It passed him again and again, flying in circles around him, and he concluded that it must be North Wind herself, no bigger than Tom Thumb when his mother put him in the nutshell lined with flannel. But she was no longer vapoury and thin. She was solid, although tiny. A moment more, and she perched on his shoulder. \u201cCome along, Diamond,\u201d she said in his ear, in the smallest and highest of treble voices; \u201cit is time we were setting out for Sandwich.\u201d Diamond could just see her, by turning his head towards his shoulder as far as he could, but only with one eye, for his nose came between her and the other."}, {"size": 678, "text": "\u201cWon't you take me in your arms and carry me?\u201d he said in a whisper, for he knew she did not like a loud voice when she was small. \u201cAh! you ungrateful boy,\u201d returned North Wind, smiling \u201chow dare you make game of me? Yes, I will carry you, but you shall walk a bit for your impertinence first. Come along.\u201d She jumped from his shoulder, but when Diamond looked for her upon the ground, he could see nothing but a little spider with long legs that made its way over the ice towards the south. It ran very fast indeed for a spider, but Diamond ran a long way before it, and then waited for it. It was up with him sooner than he had expected, however, and it had grown a good deal."}, {"size": 677, "text": "And the spider grew and grew and went faster and faster, till all at once Diamond discovered that it was not a spider, but a weasel; and away glided the weasel, and away went Diamond after it, and it took all the run there was in him to keep up with the weasel. And the weasel grew, and grew, and grew, till all at once Diamond saw that the weasel was not a weasel but a cat. And away went the cat, and Diamond after it. And when he had run half a mile, he found the cat waiting for him, sitting up and washing her face not to lose time. And away went the cat again, and Diamond after it. But the next time he came up with the cat, the cat was not a cat, but a hunting-leopard."}, {"size": 832, "text": "And the hunting-leopard grew to a jaguar, all covered with spots like eyes. And the jaguar grew to a Bengal tiger. And at none of them was Diamond afraid, for he had been at North Wind's back, and he could be afraid of her no longer whatever she did or grew. And the tiger flew over the snow in a straight line for the south, growing less and less to Diamond's eyes till it was only a black speck upon the whiteness; and then it vanished altogether. And now Diamond felt that he would rather not run any farther, and that the ice had got very rough. Besides, he was near the precipices that bounded the sea, so he slackened his pace to a walk, saying aloud to himself: \u201cWhen North Wind has punished me enough for making game of her, she will come back to me; I know she will, for I can't go much farther without her.\u201d \u201cYou dear boy!"}, {"size": 601, "text": "It was only in fun. Here I am!\u201d said North Wind's voice behind him. Diamond turned, and saw her as he liked best to see her, standing beside him, a tall lady. \u201cWhere's the tiger?\u201d he asked, for he knew all the creatures from a picture book that Miss Coleman had given him. \u201cBut, of course,\u201d he added, \u201cyou were the tiger. I was puzzled and forgot. I saw it such a long way off before me, and there you were behind me. It's so odd, you know.\u201d \u201cIt must look very odd to you, Diamond: I see that. But it is no more odd to me than to break an old pine in two.\u201d \u201cWell, that's odd enough,\u201d remarked Diamond."}, {"size": 875, "text": "\u201cSo it is! I forgot. Well, none of these things are odder to me than it is to you to eat bread and butter.\u201d \u201cWell, that's odd too, when I think of it,\u201d persisted Diamond. \u201cI should just like a slice of bread and butter! I'm afraid to say how long it is--how long it seems to me, that is--since I had anything to eat.\u201d \u201cCome then,\u201d said North Wind, stooping and holding out her arms. \u201cYou shall have some bread and butter very soon. I am glad to find you want some.\u201d Diamond held up his arms to meet hers, and was safe upon her bosom. North Wind bounded into the air. Her tresses began to lift and rise and spread and stream and flow and flutter; and with a roar from her hair and an answering roar from one of the great glaciers beside them, whose slow torrent tumbled two or three icebergs at once into the waves at their feet, North Wind and Diamond went flying southwards."}, {"size": 628, "text": "CHAPTER XII. WHO MET DIAMOND AT SANDWICH As THEY flew, so fast they went that the sea slid away from under them like a great web of shot silk, blue shot with grey, and green shot with purple. They went so fast that the stars themselves appeared to sail away past them overhead, \u201clike golden boats,\u201d on a blue sea turned upside down. And they went so fast that Diamond himself went the other way as fast--I mean he went fast asleep in North Wind's arms. When he woke, a face was bending over him; but it was not North Wind's; it was his mother's. He put out his arms to her, and she clasped him to her bosom and burst out crying."}, {"size": 618, "text": "Diamond kissed her again and again to make her stop. Perhaps kissing is the best thing for crying, but it will not always stop it. \u201cWhat is the matter, mother?\u201d he said. \u201cOh, Diamond, my darling! you have been so ill!\u201d she sobbed. \u201cNo, mother dear. I've only been at the back of the north wind,\u201d returned Diamond. \u201cI thought you were dead,\u201d said his mother. But that moment the doctor came in. \u201cOh! there!\u201d said the doctor with gentle cheerfulness; \u201cwe're better to-day, I see.\u201d Then he drew the mother aside, and told her not to talk to Diamond, or to mind what he might say; for he must be kept as quiet as possible."}, {"size": 679, "text": "And indeed Diamond was not much inclined to talk, for he felt very strange and weak, which was little wonder, seeing that all the time he had been away he had only sucked a few lumps of ice, and there could not be much nourishment in them. Now while he is lying there, getting strong again with chicken broth and other nice things, I will tell my readers what had been taking place at his home, for they ought to be told it. They may have forgotten that Miss Coleman was in a very poor state of health. Now there were three reasons for this. In the first place, her lungs were not strong. In the second place, there was a gentleman somewhere who had not behaved very well to her."}, {"size": 649, "text": "In the third place, she had not anything particular to do. These three nots together are enough to make a lady very ill indeed. Of course she could not help the first cause; but if the other two causes had not existed, that would have been of little consequence; she would only have to be a little careful. The second she could not help quite; but if she had had anything to do, and had done it well, it would have been very difficult for any man to behave badly to her. And for this third cause of her illness, if she had had anything to do that was worth doing, she might have borne his bad behaviour so that even that would not have made her ill."}, {"size": 605, "text": "It is not always easy, I confess, to find something to do that is worth doing, but the most difficult things are constantly being done, and she might have found something if she had tried. Her fault lay in this, that she had not tried. But, to be sure, her father and mother were to blame that they had never set her going. Only then again, nobody had told her father and mother that they ought to set her going in that direction. So as none of them would find it out of themselves, North Wind had to teach them. We know that North Wind was very busy that night on which she left Diamond in the cathedral."}, {"size": 696, "text": "She had in a sense been blowing through and through the Colemans' house the whole of the night. First, Miss Coleman's maid had left a chink of her mistress's window open, thinking she had shut it, and North Wind had wound a few of her hairs round the lady's throat. She was considerably worse the next morning. Again, the ship which North Wind had sunk that very night belonged to Mr. Coleman. Nor will my readers understand what a heavy loss this was to him until I have informed them that he had been getting poorer and poorer for some time. He was not so successful in his speculations as he had been, for he speculated a great deal more than was right, and it was time he should be pulled up."}, {"size": 681, "text": "It is a hard thing for a rich man to grow poor; but it is an awful thing for him to grow dishonest, and some kinds of speculation lead a man deep into dishonesty before he thinks what he is about. Poverty will not make a man worthless--he may be worth a great deal more when he is poor than he was when he was rich; but dishonesty goes very far indeed to make a man of no value--a thing to be thrown out in the dust-hole of the creation, like a bit of a broken basin, or a dirty rag. So North Wind had to look after Mr. Coleman, and try to make an honest man of him. So she sank the ship which was his last venture, and he was what himself and his wife and the world called ruined."}, {"size": 695, "text": "Nor was this all yet. For on board that vessel Miss Coleman's lover was a passenger; and when the news came that the vessel had gone down, and that all on board had perished, we may be sure she did not think the loss of their fine house and garden and furniture the greatest misfortune in the world. Of course, the trouble did not end with Mr. Coleman and his family. Nobody can suffer alone. When the cause of suffering is most deeply hidden in the heart, and nobody knows anything about it but the man himself, he must be a great and a good man indeed, such as few of us have known, if the pain inside him does not make him behave so as to cause all about him to be more or less uncomfortable."}, {"size": 636, "text": "But when a man brings money-troubles on himself by making haste to be rich, then most of the people he has to do with must suffer in the same way with himself. The elm-tree which North Wind blew down that very night, as if small and great trials were to be gathered in one heap, crushed Miss Coleman's pretty summer-house: just so the fall of Mr. Coleman crushed the little family that lived over his coach-house and stable.

Of course, Diamond's father had nothing to do for a time, but it was not so hard for him to have nothing to do as it was for Miss Coleman.

He had a friend in the Bloomsbury region, who lived by letting out cabs and horses to the cabmen. This man, happening to meet him one day as he was returning from an unsuccessful application, said to him: \u201cWhy don't you set up for yourself now--in the cab line, I mean?\u201d \u201cI haven't enough for that,\u201d answered Diamond's father."}, {"size": 645, "text": "\u201cYou must have saved a goodish bit, I should think.

You see parties as takes Hansoms wants to go like the wind, and he ain't got wind enough, for he ain't so young as he once was. But for a four-wheeler as takes families and their luggages, he's the very horse. He'd carry a small house any day.

It's a thousand pities to part man and horse.\u201d \u201cSo it is,\u201d returned his friend sympathetically. But what was the ex-coachman's delight, when, on going into the stable where his friend led him, he found the horse he wanted him to buy was no other than his own old Diamond, grown very thin and bony and long-legged, as if they, had been doing what they could to fit him for Hansom work!"}, {"size": 656, "text": "\u201cHe ain't a Hansom horse,\u201d said Diamond's father indignantly. \u201cWell, you're right.

The cab-master had never been so fond of a horse himself as to hug him like that, but he saw in a moment how it was. And he must have been a good-hearted fellow, for I never heard of such an idea coming into the head of any other man with a horse to sell: instead of putting something on to the price because he was now pretty sure of selling him, he actually took a pound off what he had meant to ask for him, saying to himself it was a shame to part old friends."}, {"size": 704, "text": "Diamond's father, as soon as he came to himself, turned and asked how much he wanted for the horse. \u201cI see you're old friends,\u201d said the owner. \u201cIt's my own old Diamond.

And instead of helping his mother to be miserable at the change, he began to find out all the advantages of the place; for every place has some advantages, and they are always better worth knowing than the disadvantages. Certainly the weather was depressing, for a thick, dull, persistent rain was falling by the time they reached home."}, {"size": 616, "text": "But happily the weather is very changeable; and besides, there was a good fire burning in the room, which their neighbour with the drunken husband had attended to for them; and the tea-things were put out, and the kettle was boiling on the fire.

And when heart and head go together, nothing can stand before them. \u201cWhat nice bread and butter this is!\u201d said Diamond. \u201cI'm glad you like it, my dear\u201d said his father. \u201cI bought the butter myself at the little shop round the corner.\u201d \u201cIt's very nice, thank you, father.

Yet neither father nor mother thought him hard-hearted because he crowed and laughed in the middle of their troubles. On the contrary, his crowing and laughing were infectious. His little heart was so full of merriment that it could not hold it all, and it ran over into theirs.

It was dreadful to Diamond to hear the scolding and the crying. But it could not make him miserable, because he had been at the back of the north wind.

My own impression is that every time when Diamond slept well and remembered nothing about it in the morning, he had been all that night at the back of the north wind. I am almost sure that was how he woke so refreshed, and felt so quiet and hopeful all the day. Indeed he said this much, though not to me--that always when he woke from such a sleep there was a something in his mind, he could not tell what--could not tell whether it was the last far-off sounds of the river dying away in the distance, or some of the words of the endless song his mother had read to him on the sea-shore."}, {"size": 753, "text": "Sometimes he thought it must have been the twittering of the swallows--over the shallows, you, know; but it may have been the chirping of the dingy sparrows picking up their breakfast in the yard--how can I tell?

When he knew he was coming awake, he would sometimes try hard to keep hold of the words of what seemed a new song, one he had not heard before--a song in which the words and the music somehow appeared to be all one; but even when he thought he had got them well fixed in his mind, ever as he came awaker--as he would say--one line faded away out of it, and then another, and then another, till at last there was nothing"}, {"size": 773, "text": "left but some lovely picture of water or grass or daisies, or something else very common, but with all the commonness polished off it, and the lovely soul of it, which people so seldom see, and, alas! yet seldomer believe in, shining out.

CHAPTER XVII. DIAMOND GOES ONDIAMOND became a great favourite with all the men about the mews. Some may think it was not the best place in the world for him to be brought up in; but it must have been, for there he was. At first, he heard a good many rough and bad words; but he did not like them, and so they did him little harm. He did not know in the least what they meant, but there was something in the very sound of them, and in the tone of voice in which they were said, which Diamond felt to be ugly."}, {"size": 737, "text": "So they did not even stick to him, not to say get inside him. He never took any notice of them, and his face shone pure and good in the middle of them, like a primrose in a hailstorm. At first, because his face was so quiet and sweet, with a smile always either awake or asleep in his eyes, and because he never heeded their ugly words and rough jokes, they said he wasn't all there, meaning that he was half an idiot, whereas he was a great deal more there than they had the sense to see. And before long the bad words found themselves ashamed to come out of the men's mouths when Diamond was near. The one would nudge the other to remind him that the boy was within hearing, and the words choked themselves before they got any farther."}, {"size": 729, "text": "When they talked to him nicely he had always a good answer, sometimes a smart one, ready, and that helped much to make them change their minds about him. One day Jack gave him a curry-comb and a brush to try his hand upon old Diamond's coat. He used them so deftly, so gently, and yet so thoroughly, as far as he could reach, that the man could not help admiring him. \u201cYou must make haste and, grow\u201d he said. \u201cIt won't do to have a horse's belly clean and his back dirty, you know.\u201d \u201cGive me a leg,\u201d said Diamond, and in a moment he was on the old horse's back with the comb and brush. He sat on his withers, and reaching forward as he ate his hay, he curried and he brushed, first at one side of his neck, and then at the other."}, {"size": 712, "text": "When that was done he asked for a dressing-comb, and combed his mane thoroughly. Then he pushed himself on to his back, and did his shoulders as far down as he could reach. Then he sat on his croup, and did his back and sides; then he turned around like a monkey, and attacked his hind-quarters, and combed his tail. This last was not so easy to manage, for he had to lift it up, and every now and then old Diamond would whisk it out of his hands, and once he sent the comb flying out of the stable door, to the great amusement of the men. But Jack fetched it again, and Diamond began once more, and did not leave off until he had done the whole business fairly well, if not in a first-rate, experienced fashion."}, {"size": 642, "text": "All the time the old horse went on eating his hay, and, but with an occasional whisk of his tail when Diamond tickled or scratched him, took no notice of the proceeding. But that was all a pretence, for he knew very well who it was that was perched on his back, and rubbing away at him with the comb and the brush. So he was quite pleased and proud, and perhaps said to himself something like this-- \u201cI'm a stupid old horse, who can't brush his own coat; but there's my young godson on my back, cleaning me like an angel.\u201d I won't vouch for what the old horse was thinking, for it is very difficult to find out what any old horse is thinking."}, {"size": 701, "text": "\u201cOh dear!\u201d said Diamond when he had done, \u201cI'm so tired!\u201d And he laid himself down at full length on old Diamond's back. By this time all the men in the stable were gathered about the two Diamonds, and all much amused. One of them lifted him down, and from that time he was a greater favourite than before. And if ever there was a boy who had a chance of being a prodigy at cab-driving, Diamond was that boy, for the strife came to be who should have him out with him on the box. His mother, however, was a little shy of the company for him, and besides she could not always spare him. Also his father liked to have him himself when he could; so that he was more desired than enjoyed among the cabmen."}, {"size": 756, "text": "But one way and another he did learn to drive all sorts of horses, and to drive them well, and that through the most crowded streets in London City. Of course there was the man always on the box-seat beside him, but before long there was seldom the least occasion to take the reins from out of his hands. For one thing he never got frightened, and consequently was never in too great a hurry. Yet when the moment came for doing something sharp, he was always ready for it. I must once more remind my readers that he had been to the back of the north wind. One day, which was neither washing-day, nor cleaning-day nor marketing-day, nor Saturday, nor Monday--upon which consequently Diamond could be spared from the baby--his father took him on his own cab."}, {"size": 757, "text": "After a stray job or two by the way, they drew up in the row upon the stand between Cockspur Street and Pall Mall.

To be sure it's the law; but mayhap they may get more law than they like some day themselves.\u201d As it was very hot, Diamond's father got down to have a glass of beer himself, and give another to the old waterman."}, {"size": 719, "text": "He left Diamond on the box. A sudden noise got up, and Diamond looked round to see what was the matter. There was a crossing near the cab-stand, where a girl was sweeping. Some rough young imps had picked a quarrel with her, and were now hauling at her broom to get it away from her. But as they did not pull all together, she was holding it against them, scolding and entreating alternately. Diamond was off his box in a moment, and running to the help of the girl. He got hold of the broom at her end and pulled along with her. But the boys proceeded to rougher measures, and one of them hit Diamond on the nose, and made it bleed; and as he could not let go the broom to mind his nose, he was soon a dreadful figure."}, {"size": 614, "text": "But presently his father came back, and missing Diamond, looked about.

With the help of old Tom, the waterman, he was soon washed into decency, and his father set him on the box again, perfectly satisfied with the account he gave of the cause of his being in a fray. \u201cI couldn't let them behave so to a poor girl--could I, father?\u201d he said."}, {"size": 610, "text": "\u201cCertainly not, Diamond,\u201d said his father, quite pleased, for Diamond's father was a gentleman.

THE DRUNKEN CABMANA FEW nights after this, Diamond woke up suddenly, believing he heard North Wind thundering along. But it was something quite different. South Wind was moaning round the chimneys, to be sure, for she was not very happy that night, but it was not her voice that had wakened Diamond. Her voice would only have lulled him the deeper asleep. It was a loud, angry voice, now growling like that of a beast, now raving like that of a madman; and when Diamond came a little wider awake, he knew that it was the voice of the drunken cabman, the wall of whose room was at the head of his bed."}, {"size": 676, "text": "It was anything but pleasant to hear, but he could not help hearing it. At length there came a cry from the woman, and then a scream from the baby. Thereupon Diamond thought it time that somebody did something, and as himself was the only somebody at hand, he must go and see whether he could not do something. So he got up and put on part of his clothes, and went down the stair, for the cabman's room did not open upon their stair, and he had to go out into the yard, and in at the next door. This, fortunately, the cabman, being drunk, had left open. By the time he reached their stair, all was still except the voice of the crying baby, which guided him to the right door."}, {"size": 634, "text": "He opened it softly, and peeped in. There, leaning back in a chair, with his arms hanging down by his sides, and his legs stretched out before him and supported on his heels, sat the drunken cabman. His wife lay in her clothes upon the bed, sobbing, and the baby was wailing in the cradle. It was very miserable altogether. Now the way most people do when they see anything very miserable is to turn away from the sight, and try to forget it. But Diamond began as usual to try to destroy the misery. The little boy was just as much one of God's messengers as if he had been an angel with a flaming sword, going out to fight the devil."}, {"size": 697, "text": "The devil he had to fight just then was Misery. And the way he fought him was the very best. Like a wise soldier, he attacked him first in his weakest point--that was the baby; for Misery can never get such a hold of a baby as of a grown person. Diamond was knowing in babies, and he knew he could do something to make the baby, happy; for although he had only known one baby as yet, and although not one baby is the same as another, yet they are so very much alike in some things, and he knew that one baby so thoroughly, that he had good reason to believe he could do something for any other. I have known people who would have begun to fight the devil in a very different and a very stupid way."}, {"size": 755, "text": "They would have begun by scolding the idiotic cabman; and next they would make his wife angry by saying it must be her fault as well as his, and by leaving ill-bred though well-meant shabby little books for them to read, which they were sure to hate the sight of; while all the time they would not have put out a finger to touch the wailing baby. But Diamond had him out of the cradle in a moment, set him up on his knee, and told him to look at the light. Now all the light there was came only from a lamp in the yard, and it was a very dingy and yellow light, for the glass of the lamp was dirty, and the gas was bad; but the light that came from it was, notwithstanding, as certainly light as if it had come from the sun itself, and the baby knew that,"}, {"size": 686, "text": "and smiled to it; and although it was indeed a wretched room which that lamp lighted--so dreary, and dirty, and empty, and hopeless!--there in the middle of it sat Diamond on a stool, smiling to the baby, and the baby on his knees smiling to the lamp. The father of him sat staring at nothing, neither asleep nor awake, not quite lost in stupidity either, for through it all he was dimly angry with himself, he did not know why. It was that he had struck his wife. He had forgotten it, but was miserable about it, notwithstanding. And this misery was the voice of the great Love that had made him and his wife and the baby and Diamond, speaking in his heart, and telling him to be good."}, {"size": 669, "text": "For that great Love speaks in the most wretched and dirty hearts; only the tone of its voice depends on the echoes of the place in which it sounds. On Mount Sinai, it was thunder; in the cabman's heart it was misery; in the soul of St. John it was perfect blessedness. By and by he became aware that there was a voice of singing in the room. This, of course, was the voice of Diamond singing to the baby--song after song, every one as foolish as another to the cabman, for he was too tipsy to part one word from another: all the words mixed up in his ear in a gurgle without division or stop; for such was the way he spoke himself, when he was in this horrid condition."}, {"size": 772, "text": "But the baby was more than content with Diamond's songs, and Diamond himself was so contented with what the songs were all about, that he did not care a bit about the songs themselves, if only baby liked them. But they did the cabman good as well as the baby and Diamond, for they put him to sleep, and the sleep was busy all the time it lasted, smoothing the wrinkles out of his temper. At length Diamond grew tired of singing, and began to talk to the baby instead. And as soon as he stopped singing, the cabman began to wake up. His brain was a little clearer now, his temper a little smoother, and his heart not quite so dirty. He began to listen and he went on listening, and heard Diamond saying to the baby something like this, for he thought the cabman was asleep:"}, {"size": 609, "text": "\u201cPoor daddy!

And he says, too, the only way to make the devil come out is to give him plenty of cold water and tea and coffee, and nothing at all that comes from the public-house; for the devil can't abide that kind of stuff, and creeps out pretty soon, for fear of being drowned in it."}, {"size": 782, "text": "But your daddy will drink the nasty stuff, poor man!

I know you do. Babies always take care of their fathers and mothers--don't they, baby? That's what they come for--isn't it, baby? And when daddy stops drinking beer and nasty gin with turpentine in it, father says, then mammy will be so happy, and look so pretty! and daddy will be so good to baby! and baby will be as happy as a swallow, which is the merriest fellow!

And for a whole week after, he did not go near the public-house, hard as it was to avoid it, seeing a certain rich brewer had built one, like a trap to catch souls and bodies in, at almost every corner he had to pass on his way home.

DIAMOND'S FRIENDSONE day when old Diamond was standing with his nose in his bag between Pall Mall and Cockspur Street, and his master was reading the newspaper on the box of his cab, which was the last of a good many in the row, little Diamond got down for a run, for his legs were getting cramped with sitting. And first of all he strolled with his hands in his pockets up to the crossing, where the girl and her broom were to be found in all weathers. Just as he was going to speak to her, a tall gentleman stepped upon the crossing. He was pleased to find it so clean, for the streets were muddy, and he had nice boots on; so he put his hand in his pocket, and gave the girl a penny."}, {"size": 639, "text": "But when she gave him a sweet smile in return, and made him a pretty courtesy, he looked at her again, and said: \u201cWhere do you live, my child?\u201d \u201cParadise Row,\u201d she answered; \u201cnext door to the Adam and Eve--down the area.\u201d \u201cWhom do you live with?\u201d he asked. \u201cMy wicked old grannie,\u201d she replied. \u201cYou shouldn't call your grannie wicked,\u201d said the gentleman. \u201cBut she is,\u201d said the girl, looking up confidently in his face. \u201cIf you don't believe me, you can come and take a look at her.\u201d The words sounded rude, but the girl's face looked so simple that the gentleman saw she did not mean to be rude, and became still more interested in her."}, {"size": 694, "text": "\u201cStill you shouldn't say so,\u201d he insisted. \u201cShouldn't I?

ANOTHER EARLY BIRD HE GOT up in the morning as soon as he heard the men moving in the yard. He tucked in his little brother so that he could not tumble out of bed, and then went out, leaving the door open, so that if he should cry his mother might hear him at once.

The collar was almost the worst part of the business; but there Diamond could help Diamond. He held his head very low till his little master had got it over and turned it round, and then he lifted his head, and shook it on to his shoulders.

Then he got his whip. The moment he mounted the box, the men broke into a hearty cheer of delight at his success.

He looked up, but saw only the deep blue sky full of stars--more brilliant, however, than he had seen them before; and both sky and stars looked nearer to the earth.

Again came the voice, calling \u201cDiamond, Diamond;\u201d and in jumped the star to its place. Diamond called as loud as he could, right up into the sky: \u201cHere's Diamond, down below you.

It's got its foot in it,\u201d said the first voice. Diamond got up at once, and walked to the other side of the rose-bush. There he found what seemed the very opposite of what he wanted--a stair down into the earth. It was of turf and moss. It did not seem to promise well for getting into the sky, but Diamond had learned to look through the look of things.

Neither was Diamond in the least surprised to see it pitching itself from one step to another as it climbed towards him: he never thought it was odd--and no more it was, there.

Lightly it rose to his hand, forced up by the stream from below; and, by what would have seemed an unaccountable perversion of things had he been awake, threatened to come tumbling upon his head. But he avoided it, and when it fell, got upon it. He now saw that the opening through which the water came pouring in was over his head, and with the help of the stone he scrambled out by it, and found himself on the side of a grassy hill which rounded away from him in every direction, and down which came the brook which vanished in the hole."}, {"size": 670, "text": "But scarcely had he noticed so much as this before a merry shouting and laughter burst upon him, and a number of naked little boys came running, every one eager to get to him first.

They kept constantly coming back to Diamond, however, as the centre of their enjoyment, rejoicing over him as if they had found a lost playmate. There was a wind on the hillside which blew like the very embodiment of living gladness.

But another would give a joyful shout, and after much tugging and loosening would draw from the hole a lump as big as his head, or no bigger than his fist; when the under side of it would pour such a blaze of golden or bluish light into Diamond's eyes that he was quite dazzled. Gold and blue were the commoner colours: the jubilation was greater over red or green or purple. And every time a star was dug up all the little angels dropped their tools and crowded about it, shouting and dancing and fluttering their wing-buds."}, {"size": 763, "text": "When they had examined it well, they would kneel down one after the other and peep through the hole; but they always stood back to give Diamond the first look. All that diamond could report, however, was, that through the star-holes he saw a great many things and places and people he knew quite well, only somehow they were different--there was something marvellous about them--he could not tell what. Every time he rose from looking through a star-hole, he felt as if his heart would break for, joy; and he said that if he had not cried, he did not know what would have become of him. As soon as all had looked, the star was carefully fitted in again, a little mould was strewn over it, and the rest of the heap left as a sign that the star had been discovered."}, {"size": 635, "text": "At length one dug up a small star of a most lovely colour--a colour Diamond had never seen before. The moment the angel saw what it was, instead of showing it about, he handed it to one of his neighbours, and seated himself on the edge of the hole, saying: \u201cThis will do for me. Good-bye. I'm off.\u201d They crowded about him, hugging and kissing him; then stood back with a solemn stillness, their wings lying close to their shoulders. The little fellow looked round on them once with a smile, and then shot himself headlong through the star-hole. Diamond, as privileged, threw himself on the ground to peep after him, but he saw nothing."}, {"size": 716, "text": "\u201cIt's no use,\u201d said the captain. \u201cI never saw anything more of one that went that way.\u201d \u201cHis wings can't be much use,\u201d said Diamond, concerned and fearful, yet comforted by the calm looks of the rest. \u201cThat's true,\u201d said the captain. \u201cHe's lost them by this time. They all do that go that way. You haven't got any, you see.\u201d \u201cNo,\u201d said Diamond. \u201cI never did have any.\u201d \u201cOh! didn't you?\u201d said the captain. \u201cSome people say,\u201d he added, after a pause, \u201cthat they come again. I don't know. I've never found the colour I care about myself. I suppose I shall some day.\u201d Then they looked again at the star, put it carefully into its hole, danced around it and over it--but solemnly, and called it by the name of the finder."}, {"size": 638, "text": "\u201cWill you know it again?\u201d asked Diamond. \u201cOh, yes.

The captain stopped his shovelling, leaned on his spade, rubbed his forehead thoughtfully with his left hand--the little angels were all left-handed--repeated the words \u201clittle girls,\u201d and then, as if a thought had struck him, resumed his work, saying-- \u201cI think I know what you mean. I've never seen any of them, of course; but I suppose that's the sort you mean."}, {"size": 725, "text": "I'm told--but mind I don't say it is so, for I don't know--that when we fall asleep, a troop of angels very like ourselves, only quite different, goes round to all the stars we have discovered, and discovers them after us.

They say--mind, I say they say--these other angels take them out one by one, and pass each round as we do, and breathe over it, and rub it with their white hands, which are softer than ours, because they don't do any pick-and-spade work, and smile at it, and put it in again: and that is what keeps them from growing dark.\u201d \u201cHow jolly!\u201d thought Diamond."}, {"size": 696, "text": "\u201cI should like to see them at their work too.--When do you go to sleep?\u201d he asked the captain. \u201cWhen we grow sleepy,\u201d answered the captain. \u201cThey do say--but mind I say they say--that it is when those others--what do you call them? I don't know if that is their name; I am only guessing that may be the sort you mean--when they are on their rounds and come near any troop of us we fall asleep. They live on the west side of the hill. None of us have ever been to the top of it yet.\u201d Even as he spoke, he dropped his spade. He tumbled down beside it, and lay fast asleep.

He struggled hard with the invading power. He put up his fingers to his eyelids and pulled them open. But it was of no use. He thought he saw a glimmer of pale rosy light far up the green hill, and ceased to know. When he awoke, all the angels were starting up wide awake too. He expected to see them lift their tools, but no, the time for play had come. They looked happier than ever, and each began to sing where he stood. He had not heard them sing before. \u201cNow,\u201d he thought, \u201cI shall know what kind of nonsense the angels sing when they are merry. They don't drive cabs, I see, but they dig for stars, and they work hard enough to be merry after it.\u201d"}, {"size": 889, "text": "And he did hear some of the angels' nonsense; for if it was all sense to them, it had only just as much sense to Diamond as made good nonsense of it. He tried hard to set it down in his mind, listening as closely as he could, now to one, now to another, and now to all together. But while they were yet singing he began, to his dismay, to find that he was coming awake--faster and faster. And as he came awake, he found that, for all the goodness of his memory, verse after verse of the angels' nonsense vanished from it. He always thought he could keep the last, but as the next began he lost the one before it, and at length awoke, struggling to keep hold of the last verse of all. He felt as if the effort to keep from forgetting that one verse of the vanishing song nearly killed him. And yet by the time he was wide awake he could not be sure of that even. It was something like this:"}, {"size": 727, "text": "White hands of whiteness Wash the stars' faces, Till glitter, glitter, glit, goes their brightness Down to poor places. This, however, was so near sense that he thought it could not be really what they did sing. CHAPTER XXVI. DIAMOND TAKES A FARE THE WRONG WAY RIGHTTHE next morning Diamond was up almost as early as before. He had nothing to fear from his mother now, and made no secret of what he was about. By the time he reached the stable, several of the men were there. They asked him a good many questions as to his luck the day before, and he told them all they wanted to know. But when he proceeded to harness the old horse, they pushed him aside with rough kindness, called him a baby, and began to do it all for him."}, {"size": 621, "text": "So Diamond ran in and had another mouthful of tea and bread and butter; and although he had never been so tired as he was the night before, he started quite fresh this morning. It was a cloudy day, and the wind blew hard from the north--so hard sometimes that, perched on the box with just his toes touching the ground, Diamond wished that he had some kind of strap to fasten himself down with lest he should be blown away. But he did not really mind it. His head was full of the dream he had dreamed; but it did not make him neglect his work, for his work was not to dig stars but to drive old Diamond and pick up fares."}, {"size": 625, "text": "There are not many people who can think about beautiful things and do common work at the same time. But then there are not many people who have been to the back of the north wind. There was not much business doing. And Diamond felt rather cold, notwithstanding his mother had herself put on his comforter and helped him with his greatcoat. But he was too well aware of his dignity to get inside his cab as some do. A cabman ought to be above minding the weather--at least so Diamond thought. At length he was called to a neighbouring house, where a young woman with a heavy box had to be taken to Wapping for a coast-steamer."}, {"size": 622, "text": "He did not find it at all pleasant, so far east and so near the river; for the roughs were in great force. However, there being no block, not even in Nightingale Lane, he reached the entrance of the wharf, and set down his passenger without annoyance. But as he turned to go back, some idlers, not content with chaffing him, showed a mind to the fare the young woman had given him. They were just pulling him off the box, and Diamond was shouting for the police, when a pale-faced man, in very shabby clothes, but with the look of a gentleman somewhere about him, came up, and making good use of his stick, drove them off."}, {"size": 659, "text": "\u201cNow, my little man,\u201d he said, \u201cget on while you can. Don't lose any time. This is not a place for you.\u201d But Diamond was not in the habit of thinking only of himself. He saw that his new friend looked weary, if not ill, and very poor. \u201cWon't you jump in, sir?\u201d he said. \u201cI will take you wherever you like.\u201d \u201cThank you, my man; but I have no money; so I can't.\u201d \u201cOh! I don't want any money. I shall be much happier if you will get in. You have saved me all I had. I owe you a lift, sir.\u201d \u201cWhich way are you going?\u201d \u201cTo Charing Cross; but I don't mind where I go.\u201d \u201cWell, I am very tired. If you will take me to Charing Cross, I shall be greatly obliged to you."}, {"size": 632, "text": "I have walked from Gravesend, and had hardly a penny left to get through the tunnel.\u201d So saying, he opened the door and got in, and Diamond drove away. But as he drove, he could not help fancying he had seen the gentleman--for Diamond knew he was a gentleman--before. Do all he could, however, he could not recall where or when. Meantime his fare, if we may call him such, seeing he was to pay nothing, whom the relief of being carried had made less and less inclined to carry himself, had been turning over things in his mind, and, as they passed the Mint, called to Diamond, who stopped the horse, got down and went to the window."}, {"size": 676, "text": "\u201cIf you didn't mind taking me to Chiswick, I should be able to pay you when we got there. It's a long way, but you shall have the whole fare from the Docks--and something over.\u201d \u201cVery well, sir\u201d said Diamond. \u201cI shall be most happy.\u201d He was just clambering up again, when the gentleman put his head out of the window and said-- \u201cIt's The Wilderness--Mr. Coleman's place; but I'll direct you when we come into the neighbourhood.\u201d It flashed upon Diamond who he was. But he got upon his box to arrange his thoughts before making any reply. The gentleman was Mr. Evans, to whom Miss Coleman was to have been married, and Diamond had seen him several times with her in the garden."}, {"size": 669, "text": "I have said that he had not behaved very well to Miss Coleman. He had put off their marriage more than once in a cowardly fashion, merely because he was ashamed to marry upon a small income, and live in a humble way. When a man thinks of what people will say in such a case, he may love, but his love is but a poor affair. Mr. Coleman took him into the firm as a junior partner, and it was in a measure through his influence that he entered upon those speculations which ruined him. So his love had not been a blessing. The ship which North Wind had sunk was their last venture, and Mr. Evans had gone out with it in the hope of turning its cargo to the best advantage."}, {"size": 625, "text": "He was one of the single boat-load which managed to reach a desert island, and he had gone through a great many hardships and sufferings since then. But he was not past being taught, and his troubles had done him no end of good, for they had made him doubt himself, and begin to think, so that he had come to see that he had been foolish as well as wicked. For, if he had had Miss Coleman with him in the desert island, to build her a hut, and hunt for her food, and make clothes for her, he would have thought himself the most fortunate of men; and when he was at home, he would not marry till he could afford a man-servant."}, {"size": 677, "text": "Before he got home again, he had even begun to understand that no man can make haste to be rich without going against the will of God, in which case it is the one frightful thing to be successful. So he had come back a more humble man, and longing to ask Miss Coleman to forgive him. But he had no idea what ruin had fallen upon them, for he had never made himself thoroughly acquainted with the firm's affairs. Few speculative people do know their own affairs. Hence he never doubted he should find matters much as he left them, and expected to see them all at The Wilderness as before. But if he had not fallen in with Diamond, he would not have thought of going there first."}, {"size": 650, "text": "What was Diamond to do? He had heard his father and mother drop some remarks concerning Mr. Evans which made him doubtful of him. He understood that he had not been so considerate as he might have been. So he went rather slowly till he should make up his mind. It was, of course, of no use to drive Mr. Evans to Chiswick. But if he should tell him what had befallen them, and where they lived now, he might put off going to see them, and he was certain that Miss Coleman, at least, must want very much to see Mr. Evans. He was pretty sure also that the best thing in any case was to bring them together, and let them set matters right for themselves."}, {"size": 762, "text": "The moment he came to this conclusion, he changed his course from westward to northward, and went straight for Mr. Coleman's poor little house in Hoxton. Mr. Evans was too tired and too much occupied with his thoughts to take the least notice of the streets they passed through, and had no suspicion, therefore, of the change of direction. By this time the wind had increased almost to a hurricane, and as they had often to head it, it was no joke for either of the Diamonds. The distance, however, was not great. Before they reached the street where Mr. Coleman lived it blew so tremendously, that when Miss Coleman, who was going out a little way, opened the door, it dashed against the wall with such a bang, that she was afraid to venture, and went in again."}, {"size": 678, "text": "In five minutes after, Diamond drew up at the door. As soon as he had entered the street, however, the wind blew right behind them, and when he pulled up, old Diamond had so much ado to stop the cab against it, that the breeching broke. Young Diamond jumped off his box, knocked loudly at the door, then turned to the cab and said--before Mr. Evans had quite begun to think something must be amiss: \u201cPlease, sir, my harness has given away. Would you mind stepping in here for a few minutes? They're friends of mine. I'll take you where you like after I've got it mended. I shan't be many minutes, but you can't stand in this wind.\u201d Half stupid with fatigue and want of food, Mr."}, {"size": 646, "text": "Evans yielded to the boy's suggestion, and walked in at the door which the maid held with difficulty against the wind. She took Mr. Evans for a visitor, as indeed he was, and showed him into the room on the ground-floor. Diamond, who had followed into the hall, whispered to her as she closed the door-- \u201cTell Miss Coleman. It's Miss Coleman he wants to see.\u201d \u201cI don't know\u201d said the maid. \u201cHe don't look much like a gentleman.\u201d \u201cHe is, though; and I know him, and so does Miss Coleman.\u201d The maid could not but remember Diamond, having seen him when he and his father brought the ladies home. So she believed him, and went to do what he told her."}, {"size": 674, "text": "What passed in the little parlour when Miss Coleman came down does not belong to my story, which is all about Diamond. If he had known that Miss Coleman thought Mr. Evans was dead, perhaps he would have managed differently. There was a cry and a running to and fro in the house, and then all was quiet again. Almost as soon as Mr. Evans went in, the wind began to cease, and was now still. Diamond found that by making the breeching just a little tighter than was quite comfortable for the old horse he could do very well for the present; and, thinking it better to let him have his bag in this quiet place, he sat on the box till the old horse should have eaten his dinner."}, {"size": 649, "text": "In a little while Mr. Evans came out, and asked him to come in. Diamond obeyed, and to his delight Miss Coleman put her arms round him and kissed him, and there was payment for him! Not to mention the five precious shillings she gave him, which he could not refuse because his mother wanted them so much at home for his father. He left them nearly as happy as they were themselves. The rest of the day he did better, and, although he had not so much to take home as the day before, yet on the whole the result was satisfactory. And what a story he had to tell his father and mother about his adventures, and how he had done, and what was the result!"}, {"size": 852, "text": "They asked him such a multitude of questions! some of which he could answer, and some of which he could not answer; and his father seemed ever so much better from finding that his boy was already not only useful to his family but useful to other people, and quite taking his place as a man who judged what was wise, and did work worth doing. For a fortnight Diamond went on driving his cab, and keeping his family. He had begun to be known about some parts of London, and people would prefer taking his cab because they liked what they heard of him. One gentleman who lived near the mews engaged him to carry him to the City every morning at a certain hour; and Diamond was punctual as clockwork--though to effect that required a good deal of care, for his father's watch was not much to be depended on, and had to be watched itself by the clock of St."}, {"size": 211, "text": "George's church. Between the two, however, he did make a success of it. After that fortnight, his father was able to go out again. Then Diamond went to make inquiries about Nanny, and this led to something else."}, {"size": 678, "text": "CHAPTER XXVII. THE CHILDREN'S HOSPITAL THE first day his father resumed his work, Diamond went with him as usual. In the afternoon, however, his father, having taken a fare to the neighbourhood, went home, and Diamond drove the cab the rest of the day. It was hard for old Diamond to do all the work, but they could not afford to have another horse. They contrived to save him as much as possible, and fed him well, and he did bravely.The next morning his father was so much stronger that Diamond thought he might go and ask Mr. Raymond to take him to see Nanny. He found him at home. His servant had grown friendly by this time, and showed him in without any cross-questioning."}, {"size": 809, "text": "Mr. Raymond received him with his usual kindness, consented at once, and walked with him to the Hospital, which was close at hand. It was a comfortable old-fashioned house, built in the reign of Queen Anne, and in her day, no doubt, inhabited by rich and fashionable people: now it was a home for poor sick children, who were carefully tended for love's sake. There are regions in London where a hospital in every other street might be full of such children, whose fathers and mothers are dead, or unable to take care of them. When Diamond followed Mr. Raymond into the room where those children who had got over the worst of their illness and were growing better lay, he saw a number of little iron bedsteads, with their heads to the walls, and in every one of them a child, whose face was a story in itself."}, {"size": 666, "text": "In some, health had begun to appear in a tinge upon the cheeks, and a doubtful brightness in the eyes, just as out of the cold dreary winter the spring comes in blushing buds and bright crocuses. In others there were more of the signs of winter left. Their faces reminded you of snow and keen cutting winds, more than of sunshine and soft breezes and butterflies; but even in them the signs of suffering told that the suffering was less, and that if the spring-time had but arrived, it had yet arrived. Diamond looked all round, but could see no Nanny. He turned to Mr. Raymond with a question in his eyes. \u201cWell?\u201d said Mr. Raymond. \u201cNanny's not here,\u201d said Diamond."}, {"size": 753, "text": "\u201cI do, though. There she is.\u201d He pointed to a bed right in front of where Diamond was standing. \u201cThat's not Nanny,\u201d he said. \u201cIt is Nanny. I have seen her many times since you have. Illness makes a great difference.\u201d\u201cWhy, that girl must have been to the back of the north wind!\u201d thought Diamond, but he said nothing, only stared; and as he stared, something of the old Nanny began to dawn through the face of the new Nanny. The old Nanny, though a good girl, and a friendly girl, had been rough, blunt in her speech, and dirty in her person. Her face would always have reminded one who had already been to the back of the north wind of something he had seen in the best of company, but it had been coarse notwithstanding, partly from the weather, partly"}, {"size": 717, "text": "from her living amongst low people, and partly from having to defend herself: now it was so sweet, and gentle, and refined, that she might have had a lady and gentleman for a father and mother. And Diamond could not help thinking of words which he had heard in the church the day before: \u201cSurely it is good to be afflicted;\u201d or something like that. North Wind, somehow or other, must have had to do with her! She had grown from a rough girl into a gentle maiden. Mr. Raymond, however, was not surprised, for he was used to see such lovely changes--something like the change which passes upon the crawling, many-footed creature, when it turns sick and ill, and revives a butterfly, with two wings instead of many feet."}, {"size": 671, "text": "Instead of her having to take care of herself, kind hands ministered to her, making her comfortable and sweet and clean, soothing her aching head, and giving her cooling drink when she was thirsty; and kind eyes, the stars of the kingdom of heaven, had shone upon her; so that, what with the fire of the fever and the dew of tenderness, that which was coarse in her had melted away, and her whole face had grown so refined and sweet that Diamond did not know her. But as he gazed, the best of the old face, all the true and good part of it, that which was Nanny herself, dawned upon him, like the moon coming out of a cloud, until at length, instead of only believing Mr."}, {"size": 635, "text": "Raymond that this was she, he saw for himself that it was Nanny indeed--very worn but grown beautiful. He went up to her. She smiled. He had heard her laugh, but had never seen her smile before. \u201cNanny, do you know me?\u201d said Diamond. She only smiled again, as if the question was amusing. She was not likely to forget him; for although she did not yet know it was he who had got her there, she had dreamed of him often, and had talked much about him when delirious. Nor was it much wonder, for he was the only boy except Joe who had ever shown her kindness. Meantime Mr. Raymond was going from bed to bed, talking to the little people."}, {"size": 618, "text": "Every one knew him, and every one was eager to have a look, and a smile, and a kind word from him. Diamond sat down on a stool at the head of Nanny's bed. She laid her hand in his. No one else of her old acquaintance had been near her. Suddenly a little voice called aloud-- \u201cWon't Mr. Raymond tell us a story?\u201d \u201cOh, yes, please do! please do!\u201d cried several little voices which also were stronger than the rest. For Mr. Raymond was in the habit of telling them a story when he went to see them, and they enjoyed it far more than the other nice things which the doctor permitted him to give them. \u201cVery well,\u201d said Mr."}, {"size": 649, "text": "Raymond, \u201cI will. What sort of a story shall it be?\u201d \u201cA true story,\u201d said one little girl. \u201cA fairy tale,\u201d said a little boy. \u201cWell,\u201d said Mr. Raymond, \u201cI suppose, as there is a difference, I may choose. I can't think of any true story just at this moment, so I will tell you a sort of a fairy one.\u201d \u201cOh, jolly!\u201d exclaimed the little boy who had called out for a fairy tale. \u201cIt came into my head this morning as I got out of bed,\u201d continued Mr. Raymond; \u201cand if it turns out pretty well, I will write it down, and get somebody to print it for me, and then you shall read it when you like.\u201d \u201cThen nobody ever heard it before?\u201d asked one older child."}, {"size": 702, "text": "\u201cOh!\u201d exclaimed several, thinking it very grand to have the first telling; and I daresay there might be a peculiar freshness about it, because everything would be nearly as new to the story-teller himself as to the listeners. Some were only sitting up and some were lying down, so there could not be the same busy gathering, bustling, and shifting to and fro with which children generally prepare themselves to hear a story; but their faces, and the turning of their heads, and many feeble exclamations of expected pleasure, showed that all such preparations were making within them.Mr. Raymond stood in the middle of the room, that he might turn from side to side, and give each a share of seeing him."}, {"size": 638, "text": "Diamond kept his place by Nanny's side, with her hand in his. I do not know how much of Mr. Raymond's story the smaller children understood; indeed, I don't quite know how much there was in it to be understood, for in such a story every one has just to take what he can get. But they all listened with apparent satisfaction, and certainly with great attention. Mr. Raymond wrote it down afterwards, and here it is--somewhat altered no doubt, for a good story-teller tries to make his stories better every time he tells them. I cannot myself help thinking that he was somewhat indebted for this one to the old story of The Sleeping Beauty."}, {"size": 811, "text": "CHAPTER XXVIII. LITTLE DAYLIGHTNO HOUSE of any pretension to be called a palace is in the least worthy of the name, except it has a wood near it--very near it--and the nearer the better. Not all round it--I don't mean that, for a palace ought to be open to the sun and wind, and stand high and brave, with weathercocks glittering and flags flying; but on one side of every palace there must be a wood. And there was a very grand wood indeed beside the palace of the king who was going to be Daylight's father; such a grand wood, that nobody yet had ever got to the other end of it. Near the house it was kept very trim and nice, and it was free of brushwood for a long way in; but by degrees it got wild, and it grew wilder, and wilder, and wilder, until some said wild beasts at last did what they liked in it."}, {"size": 670, "text": "The king and his courtiers often hunted, however, and this kept the wild beasts far away from the palace. One glorious summer morning, when the wind and sun were out together, when the vanes were flashing and the flags frolicking against the blue sky, little Daylight made her appearance from somewhere--nobody could tell where--a beautiful baby, with such bright eyes that she might have come from the sun, only by and by she showed such lively ways that she might equally well have come out of the wind. There was great jubilation in the palace, for this was the first baby the queen had had, and there is as much happiness over a new baby in a palace as in a cottage."}, {"size": 616, "text": "But there is one disadvantage of living near a wood: you do not know quite who your neighbours may be. Everybody knew there were in it several fairies, living within a few miles of the palace, who always had had something to do with each new baby that came; for fairies live so much longer than we, that they can have business with a good many generations of human mortals. The curious houses they lived in were well known also,--one, a hollow oak; another, a birch-tree, though nobody could ever find how that fairy made a house of it; another, a hut of growing trees intertwined, and patched up with turf and moss."}, {"size": 667, "text": "But there was another fairy who had lately come to the place, and nobody even knew she was a fairy except the other fairies. A wicked old thing she was, always concealing her power, and being as disagreeable as she could, in order to tempt people to give her offence, that she might have the pleasure of taking vengeance upon them. The people about thought she was a witch, and those who knew her by sight were careful to avoid offending her. She lived in a mud house, in a swampy part of the forest.

But I never knew of any interference on the part of the wicked fairy that did not turn out a good thing in the end.

For my part, I cannot help wishing a good many girls would sleep till just the same fate overtook them. It would be happier for them, and more agreeable to their friends. Of course all the known fairies were invited to the christening. But the king and queen never thought of inviting an old witch.

All their arrangements had reference to the state of the Princess Daylight, and it is amazing how things contrive to accommodate themselves.

This was the more painful that her appearance was unnatural; for her hair and eyes did not change. Her wan face was both drawn and wrinkled, and had an eager hungry look. Her skinny hands moved as if wishing, but unable, to lay hold of something. Her shoulders were bent forward, her chest went in, and she stooped as if she were eighty years old."}, {"size": 765, "text": "At last she had to be put to bed, and there await the flow of the tide of life.

A little way from the palace there was a great open glade, covered with the greenest and softest grass.

There were serious objections to such a relation.

There was no good in telling everybody he met that he was a prince, for he felt that a prince ought to be able to get on like other people, else his rank only made a fool of him.

The sun sank and sank and went out of sight, and he seemed no nearer the end of the wood than ever.

The moon shone very bright, and he thought he had never seen a more lovely spot. Still it looked dreary because of its loneliness, for he could not see the house at the other side.

What could it be? It moved; it came nearer. Was it a human creature, gliding across--a girl dressed in white, gleaming in the moonshine? She came nearer and nearer. He crept behind a tree and watched, wondering. It must be some strange being of the wood--a nymph whom the moonlight and the warm dusky air had enticed from her tree. But when she came close to where he stood, he no longer doubted she was human--for he had caught sight of her sunny hair, and her clear blue eyes, and the loveliest face and form that he had ever seen. All at once she began singing like a nightingale, and dancing to her own music, with her eyes ever turned towards the moon."}, {"size": 782, "text": "She passed close to where he stood, dancing on by the edge of the trees and away in a great circle towards the other side, until he could see but a spot of white in the yellowish green of the moonlit grass.

She approached him again, singing and dancing, and waving her arms over her head, until she had completed the circle. Just opposite his tree she stood, ceased her song, dropped her arms, and broke out into a long clear laugh, musical as a brook. Then, as if tired, she threw herself on the grass, and lay gazing at the moon. The prince was almost afraid to breathe lest he should startle her, and she should vanish from his sight. As to venturing near her, that never came into his head."}, {"size": 681, "text": "She had lain for a long hour or longer, when the prince began again to doubt concerning her. Perhaps she was but a vision of his own fancy. Or was she a spirit of the wood, after all? If so, he too would haunt the wood, glad to have lost kingdom and everything for the hope of being near her. He would build him a hut in the forest, and there he would live for the pure chance of seeing her again. Upon nights like this at least she would come out and bask in the moonlight, and make his soul blessed.

Again she began dancing to her own music, and danced away into the distance. Once more she returned in a similar manner; but although he was watching as eagerly as before, what with fatigue and what with gazing, he fell fast asleep before she came near him. When he awoke it was broad daylight, and the princess was nowhere. He could not leave the place. What if she should come the next night! He would gladly endure a day's hunger to see her yet again: he would buckle his belt quite tight. He walked round the glade to see if he could discover any prints of her feet."}, {"size": 638, "text": "But the grass was so short, and her steps had been so light, that she had not left a single trace behind her.

Of course this must be where the gracious lady who loved the moonlight lived.

But he learned nothing more, both because he was afraid of seeming inquisitive, and because the cook did not choose to be heard talking about her mistress to a peasant lad who had begged for his breakfast. As he rose to take his leave, it occurred to him that he might not be so far from the old woman's cottage as he had thought, and he asked the cook whether she knew anything of such a place, describing it as well as he could."}, {"size": 739, "text": "She said she knew it well enough, adding with a smile-- \u201cIt's there you're going, is it?\u201d \u201cYes, if it's not far off.\u201d \u201cIt's not more than three miles.

As it drew nearer, he saw it was she indeed--not dressed in white as before: in a pale blue like the sky, she looked lovelier still. He thought it was that the blue suited her yet better than the white; he did not know that she was really more beautiful because the moon was nearer the full. In fact the next night was full moon, and the princess would then be at the zenith of her loveliness."}, {"size": 711, "text": "The prince feared for some time that she was not coming near his hiding-place that night; but the circles in her dance ever widened as the moon rose, until at last they embraced the whole glade, and she came still closer to the trees where he was hiding than she had come the night before.

He would have been ashamed of watching her too, had he not become almost incapable of thinking of anything but how beautiful she was.

But, whether it was by the machinations of the swamp-fairy, or merely that it is one thing to go and another to return by the same road, he lost his way.

If Nanny had been taken straight from the street, it is very probable she would not have been so pleasant in a decent household, or so easy to teach; but after the refining influences of her illness and the kind treatment she had had in the hospital, she moved about the house just like some rather sad pleasure haunting the mind."}, {"size": 631, "text": "As she got better, and the colour came back to her cheeks, her step grew lighter and quicker, her smile shone out more readily, and it became certain that she would soon be a treasure of help.

But she had not many such lessons before she was able to perform those duties quite as well as Diamond himself. Things however did not go well with Joseph from the very arrival of Ruby. It almost seemed as if the red beast had brought ill luck with him. The fares were fewer, and the pay less."}, {"size": 647, "text": "Ruby's services did indeed make the week's income at first a little beyond what it used to be, but then there were two more to feed.

During all that month, they lived on very short commons indeed, seldom tasting meat except on Sundays, and poor old Diamond, who worked hardest of all, not even then--so that at the end of it he was as thin as a clothes-horse, while Ruby was as plump and sleek as a bishop's cob."}, {"size": 737, "text": "Nor was it much better after Ruby was able to work again, for it was a season of great depression in business, and that is very soon felt amongst the cabmen. City men look more after their shillings, and their wives and daughters have less to spend. It was besides a wet autumn, and bread rose greatly in price. When I add to this that Diamond's mother was but poorly, for a new baby was coming, you will see that these were not very jolly times for our friends in the mews. Notwithstanding the depressing influences around him, Joseph was able to keep a little hope alive in his heart; and when he came home at night, would get Diamond to read to him, and would also make Nanny produce her book that he might see how she was getting on."}, {"size": 648, "text": "For Diamond had taken her education in hand, and as she was a clever child, she was very soon able to put letters and words together. Thus the three months passed away, but Mr. Raymond did not return. Joseph had been looking anxiously for him, chiefly with the desire of getting rid of Ruby--not that he was absolutely of no use to him, but that he was a constant weight upon his mind. Indeed, as far as provision went, he was rather worse off with Ruby and Nanny than he had been before, but on the other hand, Nanny was a great help in the house, and it was a comfort to him to think that when the new baby did come, Nanny would be with his wife."}, {"size": 687, "text": "Of God's gifts a baby is of the greatest; therefore it is no wonder that when this one came, she was as heartily welcomed by the little household as if she had brought plenty with her.

But he did not sing the same songs to her that he had sung to his brother, for, he said, she was a new baby and must have new songs; and besides, she was a sister-baby and not a brother-baby, and of course would not like the same kind of songs."}, {"size": 899, "text": "Where the difference in his songs lay, however, I do not pretend to be able to point out. One thing I am sure of, that they not only had no small share in the education of the little girl, but helped the whole family a great deal more than they were aware.

But at last the spring came, and the winter was over and gone, and that was much. Still, Mr. Raymond did not return, and although the mother would have been able to manage without Nanny now, they could not look for a place for her so long as they had Ruby; and they were not altogether sorry for this.

He did not mind the change though, for was not his mother the more comfortable for it? And was not Nanny more comfortable too?

DIAMOND AND RUBYIT WAS Friday night, and Diamond, like the rest of the household, had had very little to eat that day. The mother would always pay the week's rent before she laid out anything even on food. His father had been very gloomy--so gloomy that he had actually been cross to his wife. It is a strange thing how pain of seeing the suffering of those we love will sometimes make us add to their suffering by being cross with them. This comes of not having faith enough in God, and shows how necessary this faith is, for when we lose it, we lose even the kindness which alone can soothe the suffering.

Diamond opened the door, and went out of the room, and down the stair and into the yard. His little heart was in a flutter, for he had long given up all thought of seeing her again. Neither now was he to see her. When he got out, a great puff of wind came against him, and in obedience to it he turned his back, and went as it blew.

He ran to the place, however: just as he reached it there came a wild blast, and down fell the key clanging on the stones at his feet. He picked it up, and ran back and opened the stable-door, and went in. And what do you think he saw?

RAYMOND'S house was called The Mound, because it stood upon a little steep knoll, so smooth and symmetrical that it showed itself at once to be artificial. It had, beyond doubt, been built for Queen Elizabeth as a hunting tower--a place, namely, from the top of which you could see the country for miles on all sides, and so be able to follow with your eyes the flying deer and the pursuing hounds and horsemen. The mound had been cast up to give a good basement-advantage over the neighbouring heights and woods. There was a great quarry-hole not far off, brim-full of water, from which, as the current legend stated, the materials forming the heart of the mound--a kind of stone unfit for building--had been dug."}, {"size": 621, "text": "The house itself was of brick, and they said the foundations were first laid in the natural level, and then the stones and earth of the mound were heaped about and between them, so that its great height should be well buttressed.

It was a real cottage, with a roof of thick thatch, which, in June and July, the wind sprinkled with the red and white petals it shook from the loose topmost sprays of the rose-trees climbing the walls.

The night was warm, and in the lady's arms he did not feel the wind which down below was making waves in the ripe corn, and ripples on the rivers and lakes. At length they descended on the side of an open earthy hill, just where, from beneath a stone, a spring came bubbling out. \u201cI am going to take you along this little brook,\u201d said North Wind. \u201cI am not wanted for anything else to-night, so I can give you a treat.\u201d"}, {"size": 625, "text": "She stooped over the stream and holding Diamond down close to the surface of it, glided along level with its flow as it ran down the hill.

It began with a musical tinkle which changed to a babble and then to a gentle rushing. Sometimes its song would almost cease, and then break out again, tinkle, babble, and rush, all at once.

Then they would leave the river and float about and over the houses, one after another--beautiful rich houses, which, like fine trees, had taken centuries to grow.

I woke all at once, as I generally do when I am going to see her, and there she was against the door into the big room, sitting just as I saw her sit on her own doorstep, as white as snow, and her eyes as blue as the heart of an iceberg. She looked at me, but never moved or spoke.\u201d \u201cWeren't you afraid?\u201d I asked. \u201cNo. Why should I have been?\u201d he answered. \u201cI only felt a little cold.\u201d"}, {"size": 635, "text": "\u201cI don't know. I fell asleep again. I think I have been rather cold ever since though,\u201d he added with a smile. I did not quite like this, but I said nothing. Four days after, I called again at the Mound. The maid who opened the door looked grave, but I suspected nothing. When I reached the drawing-room, I saw Mrs. Raymond had been crying. \u201cHaven't you heard?\u201d she said, seeing my questioning looks. \u201cI've heard nothing,\u201d I answered. \u201cThis morning we found our dear little Diamond lying on the floor of the big attic-room, just outside his own door--fast asleep, as we thought. But when we took him up, we did not think he was asleep."}, {"size": 407, "text": "We saw that----\u201d Here the kind-hearted lady broke out crying afresh. \u201cMay I go and see him?\u201d I asked. \u201cYes,\u201d she sobbed. \u201cYou know your way to the top of the tower.\u201d I walked up the winding stair, and entered his room. A lovely figure, as white and almost as clear as alabaster, was lying on the bed. I saw at once how it was. They thought he was dead. I knew that he had gone to the back of the north wind."}]}
