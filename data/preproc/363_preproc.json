From behind a low bush across the wide lawn a pair of eyes transferred to an alert brain these simple perceptions from which the brain deduced with Sherlockian accuracy and Raffleian purpose that the family of the president of The First National Bank of--Oh, let's call it Oakdale--was at dinner, that the servants were below stairs and the second floor deserted."}, {"size": 855, "text": "The owner of the eyes had but recently descended from the quarters of the chauffeur above the garage which he had entered as a thief in the night and quitted apparelled in a perfectly good suit of clothes belonging to the gentlemanly chauffeur and a soft, checked cap which was now pulled well down over a pair of large brown eyes in which a rather strained expression might have suggested to an alienist a certain neophytism which even the stern set of well shaped lips could not effectually belie. Apparently this was a youth steeling himself against a natural repugnance to the dangerous profession he had espoused; and when, a moment later, he stepped out into the moonlight and crossed the lawn toward the house, the slender, graceful lines which the ill-fitting clothes could not entirely conceal carried the conviction of youth if not of innocence."}, {"size": 789, "text": "The brazen assurance with which the lad crossed the lawn and mounted the steps to the verandah suggested a familiarity with the habits and customs of the inmates of the house upon the hill which bespoke long and careful study of the contemplated job. An old timer could not have moved with greater confidence. No detail seemed to have escaped his cunning calculation. Though the door leading from the verandah into the reception hall swung wide to the balmy airs of late Spring the prowler passed this blatant invitation to the hospitality of the House of Prim. It was as though he knew that from his place at the head of the table, with his back toward the great fire place which is the pride of the Prim dining hall, Jonas Prim commands a view of the major portion of the reception hall."}, {"size": 637, "text": "Stooping low the youth passed along the verandah to a window of the darkened library--a French window which swung open without noise to his light touch. Stepping within he crossed the room to a door which opened at the foot of a narrow stairway--a convenient little stairway which had often let the Hon. Jonas Prim pass from his library to his second floor bed-room unnoticed when Mrs. Prim chanced to be entertaining the feminine elite of Oakdale across the hall. A convenient little stairway for retiring husbands and diffident burglars--yes, indeed! The darkness of the upper hallway offered no obstacle to this familiar housebreaker."}, {"size": 781, "text": "He passed the tempting luxury of Mrs. Prim's boudoir, the chaste elegance of Jonas Prim's bed-room with all the possibilities of forgotten wallets and negotiable papers, setting his course straight for the apartments of Abigail Prim, the spinster daughter of the First National Bank of Oakdale. Or should we utilize a more charitable and at the same time more truthful word than spinster? I think we should, since Abigail was but nineteen and quite human, despite her name. Upon the dressing table of Abigail reposed much silver and gold and ivory, wrought by clever artisans into articles of great beauty and some utility; but with scarce a glance the burglar passed them by, directing his course straight across the room to a small wall safe cleverly hidden by a bit of tapestry."}, {"size": 629, "text": "How, Oh how, this suggestive familiarity with the innermost secrets of a virgin's sacred apartments upon the part of one so obviously of the male persuasion and, by his all too apparent calling, a denizen of that underworld of which no Abigail should have intimate knowledge? Yet, truly and with scarce a faint indication of groping, though the room was dark, the marauder walked directly to the hidden safe, swung back the tapestry in its frame, turned the knob of the combination and in a moment opened the circular door of the strong box. A fat roll of bills and a handful of jewelry he transferred to the pockets of his coat."}, {"size": 607, "text": "Some papers which his hand brushed within the safe he pushed aside as though preadvised of their inutility to one of his calling. Then he closed the safe door, closed the tapestry upon it and turned toward a dainty dressing table. From a drawer in this exquisite bit of Sheraton the burglar took a small, nickel plated automatic, which he slipped into an inside breast pocket of his coat, nor did he touch another article therein or thereon, nor hesitate an instant in the selection of the drawer to be rifled. His knowledge of the apartment of the daughter of the house of Prim was little short of uncanny."}, {"size": 690, "text": "Doubtless the fellow was some plumber's apprentice who had made good use of an opportunity to study the lay of the land against a contemplated invasion of these holy precincts. But even the most expert of second story men nod and now that all seemed as though running on greased rails a careless elbow raked a silver candle-stick from the dressing table to the floor where it crashed with a resounding din that sent cold shivers up the youth's spine and conjured in his mind a sudden onslaught of investigators from the floor below. The noise of the falling candlestick sounded to the taut nerved house-breaker as might the explosion of a stick of dynamite during prayer in a meeting house."}, {"size": 709, "text": "That all Oakdale had heard it seemed quite possible, while that those below stairs were already turning questioning ears, and probably inquisitive footsteps, upward was almost a foregone conclusion. Adjoining Miss Prim's boudoir was her bath and before the door leading from the one to the other was a cretonne covered screen behind which the burglar now concealed himself the while he listened in rigid apprehension for the approach of the enemy; but the only sound that came to him from the floor below was the deep laugh of Jonas Prim. A profound sigh of relief escaped the beardless lips; for that laugh assured the youth that, after all, the noise of the fallen candlestick had not alarmed the household."}, {"size": 737, "text": "With knees that still trembled a bit he crossed the room and passed out into the hallway, descended the stairs, and stood again in the library. Here he paused a moment listening to the voices which came from the dining room. Mrs. Prim was speaking. \u201cI feel quite relieved about Abigail,\u201d she was saying. \u201cI believe that at last she sees the wisdom and the advantages of an alliance with Mr. Benham, and it was almost with enthusiasm that she left this morning to visit his sister. I am positive that a week or two of companionship with him will impress upon her the fine qualities of his nature. We are to be congratulated, Jonas, upon settling our daughter so advantageously both in the matter of family and wealth.\u201d Jonas Prim grunted."}, {"size": 619, "text": "\u201cSam Benham is old enough to be the girl's father,\u201d he growled. \u201cIf she wants him, all right; but I can't imagine Abbie wanting a bald-headed husband with rheumatism. I wish you'd let her alone, Pudgy, to find her own mate in her own way--someone nearer her own age.\u201d \u201cThe child is not old enough to judge wisely for herself,\u201d replied Mrs. Prim. \u201cIt was my duty to arrange a proper alliance; and, Jonas, I will thank you not to call me Pudgy--it is perfectly ridiculous for a woman of my age--and position.\u201d The burglar did not hear Mr. Prim's reply for he had moved across the library and passed out onto the verandah."}, {"size": 782, "text": "Once again he crossed the lawn, taking advantage of the several trees and shrubs which dotted it, scaled the low stone wall at the side and was in the concealing shadows of the unlighted side street which bounds the Prim estate upon the south. The streets of Oakdale are flanked by imposing battalions of elm and maple which over-arch and meet above the thoroughfares; and now, following an early Spring, their foliage eclipsed the infrequent arclights to the eminent satisfaction of those nocturnal wayfarers who prefer neither publicity nor the spot light. Of such there are few within the well ordered precincts of law abiding Oakdale; but to-night there was at least one and this one was deeply grateful for the gloomy walks along which he hurried toward the limits of the city."}, {"size": 793, "text": "At last he found himself upon a country road with the odors of Spring in his nostrils and the world before him. The night noises of the open country fell strangely upon his ears accentuating rather than relieving the myriad noted silence of Nature. Familiar sounds became unreal and weird, the deep bass of innumerable bull frogs took on an uncanny humanness which sent a half shudder through the slender frame. The burglar felt a sad loneliness creeping over him. He tried whistling in an effort to shake off the depressing effects of this seeming solitude through which he moved; but there remained with him still the hallucination that he moved alone through a strange, new world peopled by invisible and unfamiliar forms--menacing shapes which lurked in waiting behind each tree and shrub."}, {"size": 611, "text": "He ceased his whistling and went warily upon the balls of his feet, lest he unnecessarily call attention to his presence. If the truth were to be told it would chronicle the fact that a very nervous and frightened burglar sneaked along the quiet and peaceful country road outside of Oakdale. A lonesome burglar, this, who so craved the companionship of man that he would almost have welcomed joyously the detaining hand of the law had it fallen upon him in the guise of a flesh and blood police officer from Oakdale. In leaving the city the youth had given little thought to the practicalities of the open road."}, {"size": 723, "text": "He had thought, rather vaguely, of sleeping in a bed of new clover in some hospitable fence corner; but the fence corners looked very dark and the wide expanse of fields beyond suggested a mysterious country which might be peopled by almost anything but human beings. At a farm house the youth hesitated and was almost upon the verge of entering and asking for a night's lodging when a savage voiced dog shattered the peace of the universe and sent the burglar along the road at a rapid run. A half mile further on a straw stack loomed large within a fenced enclosure. The youth wormed his way between the barbed wires determined at last to let nothing prevent him from making a cozy bed in the deep straw beside the stack."}, {"size": 698, "text": "With courage radiating from every pore he strode toward the stack. His walk was almost a swagger, for thus does youth dissemble the bravery it yearns for but does not possess. He almost whistled again; but not quite, since it seemed an unnecessary provocation to disaster to call particular attention to himself at this time. An instant later he was extremely glad that he had refrained, for as he approached the stack a huge bulk slowly loomed from behind it; and silhouetted against the moonlit sky he saw the vast proportions of a great, shaggy bull. The burglar tore the inside of one trousers' leg and the back of his coat in his haste to pass through the barbed wire fence onto the open road."}, {"size": 781, "text": "There he paused to mop the perspiration from his forehead, though the night was now far from warm. For another mile the now tired and discouraged house-breaker plodded, heavy footed, the unending road. Did vain compunction stir his youthful breast? Did he regret the safe respectability of the plumber's apprentice? Or, if he had not been a plumber's apprentice did he yearn to once again assume the unharried peace of whatever legitimate calling had been his before he bent his steps upon the broad boulevard of sin? We think he did. And then he saw through the chinks and apertures in the half ruined wall of what had once been a hay barn the rosy flare of a genial light which appeared to announce in all but human terms that man, red blooded and hospitable, forgathered within."}, {"size": 619, "text": "No growling dogs, no bulking bulls contested the short stretch of weed grown ground between the road and the disintegrating structure; and presently two wide, brown eyes were peering through a crack in the wall of the abandoned building. What they saw was a small fire built upon the earth floor in the center of the building and around the warming blaze the figures of six men. Some reclined at length upon old straw; others squatted, Turk fashion. All were smoking either disreputable pipes or rolled cigarets. Blear-eyed and foxy-eyed, bearded and stubbled cheeked, young and old, were the men the youth looked upon."}, {"size": 703, "text": "All were more or less dishevelled and filthy; but they were human. They were not dogs, or bulls, or croaking frogs. The boy's heart went out to them. Something that was almost a sob rose in his throat, and then he turned the corner of the building and stood in the doorway, the light from the fire playing upon his lithe young figure clothed in its torn and ill fitting suit and upon his oval face and his laughing brown eyes. For several seconds he stood there looking at the men around the fire. None of them had noticed him. \u201cTramps!\u201d thought the youth. \u201cRegular tramps.\u201d He wondered that they had not seen him, and then, clearing his throat, he said: \u201cHello, tramps!\u201d Six heads snapped up or around."}, {"size": 838, "text": "Six pairs of eyes, blear or foxy, were riveted upon the boyish figure of the housebreaker. \u201cWotinel!\u201d ejaculated a frowzy gentleman in a frock coat and golf cap. \u201cWheredju blow from?\u201d inquired another. \u201c'Hello, tramps'!\u201d mimicked a third. The youth came slowly toward the fire. \u201cI saw your fire,\u201d he said, \u201cand I thought I'd stop. I'm a tramp, too, you know.\u201d \u201cOh,\u201d sighed the elderly person in the frock coat. \u201cHe's a tramp, he is. An' does he think gents like us has any time for tramps? An' where might he be trampin', sonny, without his maw?\u201d The youth flushed. \u201cOh say!\u201d he cried; \u201cyou needn't kid me just because I'm new at it. You all had to start sometime. I've always longed for the free life of a tramp; and if you'll let me go along with you for a little while, and teach me, I'll not bother you; and I'll do whatever you say.\u201d"}, {"size": 681, "text": "The elderly person frowned. \u201cBeat it, kid!\u201d he commanded. \u201cWe ain't runnin' no day nursery. These you see here is all the real thing. Maybe we asks fer a handout now and then; but that ain't our reg'lar way. You ain't swift enough to travel with this bunch, kid, so you'd better duck. Why we gents, here, if we was added up is wanted in about twenty-seven cities fer about everything from rollin' a souse to crackin' a box and croakin' a bull. You gotta do something before you can train wid gents like us, see?\u201d The speaker projected a stubbled jaw, scowled horridly and swept a flattened palm downward and backward at a right angle to a hairy arm in eloquent gesture of finality."}, {"size": 690, "text": "The boy had stood with his straight, black eyebrows puckered into a studious frown, drinking in every word. Now he straightened up. \u201cI guess I made a mistake,\u201d he said, apologetically. \u201cYou ain't tramps at all. You're thieves and murderers and things like that.\u201d His eyes opened a bit wider and his voice sank to a whisper as the words passed his lips. \u201cBut you haven't so much on me, at that,\u201d he went on, \u201cfor I'm a regular burglar, too,\u201d and from the bulging pockets of his coat he drew two handfuls of greenbacks and jewelry. The eyes of the six registered astonishment, mixed with craft and greed. \u201cI just robbed a house in Oakdale,\u201d explained the boy. \u201cI usually rob one every night.\u201d"}, {"size": 653, "text": "For a moment his auditors were too surprised to voice a single emotion; but presently one murmured, soulfully: \u201cPipe de swag!\u201d He of the frock coat, golf cap, and years waved a conciliatory hand. He tried to look at the boy's face; but for the life of him he couldn't raise his eyes above the dazzling wealth clutched in the fingers of those two small, slim hands. From one dangled a pearl necklace which alone might have ransomed, if not a king, at least a lesser member of a royal family, while diamonds, rubies, sapphires, and emeralds scintillated in the flaring light of the fire. Nor was the fistful of currency in the other hand to be sneezed at."}, {"size": 900, "text": "There were greenbacks, it is true; but there were also yellowbacks with the reddish gold of large denominations. The Sky Pilot sighed a sigh that was more than half gasp. \u201cCan't yuh take a kid?\u201d he inquired. \u201cI knew youse all along. Yuh can't fool an old bird like The Sky Pilot--eh, boys?\u201d and he turned to his comrades for confirmation. \u201cHe's The Oskaloosa Kid,\u201d exclaimed one of the company. \u201cI'd know 'im anywheres.\u201d \u201cPull up and set down,\u201d invited another. The boy stuffed his loot back into his pockets and came closer to the fire. Its warmth felt most comfortable, for the Spring night was growing chill. He looked about him at the motley company, some half-spruce in clothing that suggested a Kuppenmarx label and a not too far association with a tailor's goose, others in rags, all but one unshaven and all more or less dirty--for the open road is close to Nature, which is principally dirt."}, {"size": 720, "text": "\u201cShake hands with Dopey Charlie,\u201d said The Sky Pilot, whose age and corpulency appeared to stamp him with the hall mark of authority. The youth did as he was bid, smiling into the sullen, chalk-white face and taking the clammy hand extended toward him. Was it a shudder that passed through the lithe, young figure or was it merely a subconscious recognition of the final passing of the bodily cold before the glowing warmth of the blaze? \u201cAnd Soup Face,\u201d continued The Sky Pilot. A battered wreck half rose and extended a pudgy hand. Red whiskers, matted in little tangled wisps which suggested the dried ingredients of an infinite procession of semi-liquid refreshments, rioted promiscuously over a scarlet countenance."}, {"size": 604, "text": "\u201cPleased to meetcha,\u201d sprayed Soup Face. It was a strained smile which twisted the rather too perfect mouth of The Oskaloosa Kid, an appellation which we must, perforce, accept since the youth did not deny it. Columbus Blackie, The General, and Dirty Eddie were formally presented. As Dirty Eddie was, physically, the cleanest member of the band the youth wondered how he had come by his sobriquet--that is, he wondered until he heard Dirty Eddie speak, after which he was no longer in doubt. The Oskaloosa Kid, self-confessed 'tramp' and burglar, flushed at the lurid obscenity of Dirty Eddie's remarks."}, {"size": 618, "text": "\u201cSit down, bo,\u201d invited Soup Face. \u201cI guess you're a regular all right. Here, have a snifter?\u201d and he pulled a flask from his side pocket, holding it toward The Oskaloosa Kid. \u201cThank you, but;--er--I'm on the wagon, you know,\u201d declined the youth. \u201cHave a smoke?\u201d suggested Columbus Blackie. \u201cHere's the makin's.\u201d The change in the attitude of the men toward him pleased The Oskaloosa Kid immensely. They were treating him as one of them, and after the lonely walk through the dark and desolate farm lands human companionship of any kind was to him as the proverbial straw to the man who rocked the boat once too often."}, {"size": 651, "text": "Dopey Charlie and The General, alone of all the company, waxed not enthusiastic over the advent of The Oskaloosa Kid and his priceless loot. These two sat scowling and whispering in the back-ground. \u201cDat's a wrong guy,\u201d muttered the former to the latter. \u201cHe's a stool pigeon or one of dese amatoor mugs.\u201d \u201cIt's the pullin' of that punk graft that got my goat,\u201d replied The General. \u201cI never seen a punk yet that didn't try to make you think he was a wise guy an' dis stiff don't belong enough even to pull a spiel that would fool a old ladies' sewin' circle. I don't see wot The Sky Pilot's cozyin' up to him fer.\u201d \u201cYou don't?\u201d scoffed Dopey Charlie."}, {"size": 868, "text": "\u201cDidn't you lamp de oyster harness? To say nothin' of de mitful of rocks and kale.\u201d \u201cThat 'ud be all right, too,\u201d replied the other, \u201cif we could put the guy to sleep; but The Sky Pilot won't never stand for croakin' nobody. He's too scared of his neck. We'll look like a bunch o' wise ones, won't we? lettin' a stranger sit in now--after last night. Hell!\u201d he suddenly exploded. \u201cDon't you know that you an' me stand to swing if any of de bunch gets gabby in front of dis phoney punk?\u201d The two sat silent for a while, The General puffing on a short briar, Dopey Charlie inhaling deep draughts from a cigarette, and both glaring through narrowed lids at the boy warming himself beside the fire where the others were attempting to draw him out the while they strove desperately but unavailingly to keep their eyes from the two bulging sidepockets of their guest's coat."}, {"size": 606, "text": "Soup Face, who had been assiduously communing with a pint flask, leaned close to Columbus Blackie, placing his whiskers within an inch or so of the other's nose as was his habit when addressing another, and whispered, relative to the pearl necklace: \u201cNot a cent less 'n fifty thou, bo!\u201d \u201cFertheluvomike!\u201d ejaculated Blackie, drawing back and wiping a palm quickly across his lips. \u201cGet a plumber first if you want to kiss me--you leak.\u201d \u201cHe thinks you need a shower bath,\u201d said Dirty Eddie, laughing. \u201cThe trouble with Soup Face,\u201d explained The Sky Pilot, \u201cis that he's got a idea he's a human atomizer an'"}, {"size": 766, "text": "that the rest of us has colds.\u201d \u201cWell, I don't want no atomizer loaded with rot-gut and garlic shot in my mug,\u201d growled Blackie. \u201cWhat Soup Face needs is to be learned ettyket, an' if he comes that on me again I'm goin' to push his mush through the back of his bean.\u201d An ugly light came into the blear eyes of Soup Face. Once again he leaned close to Columbus Blackie. \u201cNot a cent less 'n fifty thou, you tinhorn!\u201d he bellowed, belligerent and sprayful. Blackie leaped to his feet, with an oath--a frightful, hideous oath--and as he rose he swung a heavy fist to Soup Face's purple nose. The latter rolled over backward; but was upon his feet again much quicker than one would have expected in so gross a bulk, and as he came to his feet a knife flashed in his hand."}, {"size": 648, "text": "With a sound that was more bestial than human he ran toward Blackie; but there was another there who had anticipated his intentions. As the blow was struck The Sky Pilot had risen; and now he sprang forward, for all his age and bulk as nimble as a cat, and seized Soup Face by the wrist. A quick wrench brought a howl of pain to the would-be assassin, and the knife fell to the floor. \u201cYou gotta cut that if you travel with this bunch,\u201d said The Sky Pilot in a voice that was new to The Oskaloosa Kid; \u201cand you, too, Blackie,\u201d he continued. \u201cThe rough stuff don't go with me, see?\u201d He hurled Soup Face to the floor and resumed his seat by the fire."}, {"size": 681, "text": "The youth was astonished at the physical strength of this old man, seemingly so softened by dissipation; but it showed him the source of The Sky Pilot's authority and its scope, for Columbus Blackie and Soup Face quitted their quarrel immediately. Dirty Eddie rose, yawned and stretched. \u201cMe fer the hay,\u201d he announced, and lay down again with his feet toward the fire. Some of the others followed his example. \u201cYou'll find some hay in the loft there,\u201d said The Sky Pilot to The Oskaloosa Kid. \u201cBring it down an' make your bed here by me, there's plenty room.\u201d A half hour later all were stretched out upon the hard dirt floor upon improvised beds of rotted hay; but not all slept."}, {"size": 825, "text": "The Oskaloosa Kid, though tired, found himself wider awake than he ever before had been. Apparently sleep could never again come to those heavy eyes. There passed before his mental vision a panorama of the events of the night. He smiled as he inaudibly voiced the name they had given him, the right to which he had not seen fit to deny. \u201cThe Oskaloosa Kid.\u201d The boy smiled again as he felt the 'swag' hard and lumpy in his pockets. It had given him prestige here that he could not have gained by any other means; but he mistook the nature of the interest which his display of stolen wealth had aroused. He thought that the men now looked upon him as a fellow criminal to be accepted into the fraternity through achievement; whereas they suffered him to remain solely in the hope of transferring his loot to their own pockets."}, {"size": 710, "text": "It is true that he puzzled them. Even The Sky Pilot, the most astute and intelligent of them all, was at a loss to fathom The Oskaloosa Kid. Innocence and unsophistication flaunted their banners in almost every act and speech of The Oskaloosa Kid. The youth reminded him in some ways of members of a Sunday school which had flourished in the dim vistas of his past when, as an ordained minister of the Gospel, he had earned the sobriquet which now identified him. But the concrete evidence of the valuable loot comported not with The Sky Pilot's idea of a Sunday school boy's lark. The young fellow was, unquestionably, a thief; but that he had ever before consorted with thieves his speech and manners belied."}, {"size": 887, "text": "\u201cHe's got me,\u201d murmured The Sky Pilot; \u201cbut he's got the stuff on him, too; and all I want is to get it off of him without a painful operation.

They remained very wide awake, a little apart from the others, where their low whispers could not be overheard. \u201cYou better do it,\u201d urged The General, in a soft, insinuating voice. \u201cYou're pretty slick with the toad stabber, an' any way one more or less won't count.\u201d \u201cWe can go to Sout' America on dat stuff an' live like gents,\u201d muttered Dopey Charlie. \u201cI'm goin' to cut out de Hop an' buy a farm an' a ottymobeel and--\u201d \u201cCome out of it,\u201d admonished The General. \u201cIf we're lucky we'll get as far as Cincinnati, get a stew on and get pinched.

Sometimes he could have passed for a hundred and ten. He had won his military title as a boy in the famous march of Coxey's army on Washington, or, rather, the title had been conferred upon him in later years as a merited reward of service. The General, profiting by the precepts of his erstwhile companions in arms, had never soiled his military escutcheon by labor, nor had he ever risen to the higher planes of criminality. Rather as a mediocre pickpocket and a timorous confidence man had he eked out a meager existence, amply punctuated by seasons of straight bumming and intervals spent as the guest of various inhospitably hospitable states."}, {"size": 653, "text": "Now, for the first time in his life, The General faced the possibility of a serious charge; and his terror made him what he never before had been, a dangerous criminal. \u201cYou're a cheerful guy,\u201d commented Dopey Charlie; \u201cbut you may be right at dat.

From a pile of mouldy hay across the barn the youth, heavy eyed but sleepless, watched the two through half closed lids."}, {"size": 637, "text": "A qualm of disgust sent a sudden shudder through his slight frame. For the first time he almost regretted having embarked upon a life of crime. He had seen that the two men were conversing together earnestly, though he could over-hear nothing they said, and that he had been the subject of their nocturnal colloquy, for several times a glance or a nod in his direction assured him of this. And so he lay watching them--not that he was afraid, he kept reassuring himself, but through curiosity. Why should he be afraid? Was it not a well known truth that there was honor among thieves? But the longer he watched the heavier grew his lids."}, {"size": 791, "text": "Several times they closed to be dragged open again only by painful effort. Finally came a time that they remained closed and the young chest rose and fell in the regular breathing of slumber. The two ragged, rat-hearted creatures rose silently and picked their way, half-crouched, among the sleepers sprawled between them and The Oskaloosa Kid. In the hand of Dopey Charlie gleamed a bit of shiny steel and in his heart were fear and greed. The fear was engendered by the belief that the youth might be an amateur detective. Dopey Charlie had had one experience of such and he knew that it was easily possible for them to blunder upon evidence which the most experienced of operatives might pass over unnoticed, and the loot bulging pockets furnished a sufficient greed motive in themselves."}, {"size": 703, "text": "Beside the boy kneeled the man with the knife.

Coming into the Prim home as house-keeper shortly after the death of Abigail's mother, the second Mrs. Prim had from the first looked upon Abigail principally as an obstacle to be overcome.

Being misunderstood and, to all outward appearances of sentiment and affection, unloved had not in any way embittered Abigail's remarkably joyous temperament.

There was, first, the mysterious disappearance of Abigail Prim, the only daughter of Oakdale's wealthiest citizen; there was the equally mysterious robbery of the Prim home.

This in itself had been sufficient to have set him apart from all the other males of Oakdale. He was widely travelled, had an independent fortune, and was far from unhandsome.

Of course there were many who knew that Abigail and Reginald were old friends; and that the former had, on frequent occasions, ridden abroad in Reginald's French roadster, that he had escorted her to parties and been, at various times, a caller at her home; but no less had been true of a dozen other perfectly respectable young ladies of Oakdale.

Behind him slunk The General, urging the other on. The youth was backing toward the doorway. The tableau persisted but for an instant.

We gotta get him,\u201d he cried, as he ran from the barn after the fugitive. The others, all but Dopey Charlie, followed in the wake of their leader.

Down the road toward the south ran The Oskaloosa Kid with all the fleetness of youth spurred on by terror.

For a time he carried the small automatic in his hand; but later, hearing no evidence of pursuit, he returned it to the pocket in his coat where it had lain when it had saved him from death beneath the blade of the degenerate Charlie. For an hour he continued walking rapidly along the winding country road. He was very tired; but he dared not pause to rest. Always behind him he expected the sudden onslaught of the bearded, blear-eyed followers of The Sky Pilot."}, {"size": 729, "text": "Terror goaded him to supreme physical effort.

And Nature drew upon her sinister forces to add to the fear which the youth already felt.

In the dark and the storm and after all that has happened to me tonight nothing seemed natural. It was just as though I was in some strange land; but I know now. Yes, there is a deserted house a little less than a mile from here; but you wouldn't want to stop there at night. They tell some frightful stories about it. It hasn't been occupied for over twenty years--not since the Squibbs were found murdered there--the father, mother, three sons, and a daughter.

Oh, I wouldn't even pass that place on a night like this.\u201d The man smiled. \u201cI slept there alone one rainy night about a year ago,\u201d he said. \u201cI didn't see or hear anything unusual.

The man followed more slowly. The darkness hid the quizzical expression of his eyes. He, too, had heard the faint shout far to the rear.

You needn't be afraid of me. I'll help you if you've been on the square. If you haven't, you still needn't fear me, for I won't peach on you. What is it?

The only response was a pressure of the arm about the shoulders of The Oskaloosa Kid. Over a low hill they followed the muddy road and down into a dark and gloomy ravine.

The man lifted the still form in his arms. The youth wondered at the great strength of the slight figure. \u201cLet me help you carry her,\u201d he volunteered; but Bridge needed no assistance. \u201cRun ahead and open the door for me,\u201d he said, as he bore his burden toward the house."}, {"size": 620, "text": "Forgetful, in the excitement of the moment, of his terror of the horror ridden ruin, The Oskaloosa Kid hastened ahead, mounted the few steps to the verandah, crossed it and pushed open the sagging door.

His finger slipped from the lighting button plunging them all into darkness. In his frantic effort to find the button and relight the lamp the worst occurred--he fumbled the button and the lamp slipped through his fingers, falling over the bannister to the floor below.

There was a peculiar quality to the tone which caused Bridge to turn a quick look at the boy's face, just as the match flickered and went out.

With raised finger he motioned the others to silence and then pointed through the branches ahead. The boy and the girl, tense with excitement, peered past the man into a clearing in which stood a log shack, mud plastered; but it was not the hovel which held their mute attention--it was rather the figure of a girl, bare headed and bare footed, who toiled stubbornly with an old spade at a long, narrow excavation."}, {"size": 708, "text": "All too suggestive in itself was the shape of the hole the girl was digging; there was no need of the silent proof of its purpose which lay beside her to tell the watchers that she worked alone in the midst of the forest solitude upon a human grave.

And as the three watched her other eyes watched them and the digging girl--wide, awestruck eyes, filled with a great terror, yet now and again half closing in the shrewd expression of cunning that is a hall mark of crafty ignorance. And as they watched, their over-wrought nerves suddenly shuddered to the grewsome clanking of a chain from the dark interior of the hovel."}, {"size": 687, "text": "The youth, holding tight to Bridge's sleeve, strove to pull him away. \u201cLet's go back,\u201d he whispered in a voice that trembled so that he could scarce control it. \u201cYes, please,\u201d urged the girl. \u201cHere is another path leading toward the north. We must be close to a road. Let's get away from here.\u201d The digger paused and raised her head, listening, as though she had caught the faint, whispered note of human voices. She was a black haired girl of nineteen or twenty, dressed in a motley of flowered calico and silk, with strings of gold and silver coins looped around her olive neck. Her bare arms were encircled by bracelets--some cheap and gaudy, others well wrought from gold and silver."}, {"size": 640, "text": "From her ears depended ornaments fashioned from gold coins. Her whole appearance was barbaric, her occupation cast a sinister haze about her; and yet her eyes seemed fashioned for laughter and her lips for kissing. The watchers remained motionless as the girl peered first in one direction and then in another, seeking an explanation of the sounds which had disturbed her. Her brows were contracted into a scowl of apprehension which remained even after she returned to her labors, and that she was ill at ease was further evidenced by the frequent pauses she made to cast quick glances toward the dense tanglewood surrounding the clearing."}, {"size": 632, "text": "At last the grave was dug. The girl climbed out and stood looking down upon the quilt wrapped thing at her feet. For a moment she stood there as silent and motionless as the dead. Only the twittering of birds disturbed the quiet of the wood. Bridge felt a soft hand slipped into his and slender fingers grip his own. He turned his eyes to see the boy at his side gazing with wide eyes and trembling lips at the tableau within the clearing. Involuntarily the man's hand closed tightly upon the youth's. And as they stood thus the silence was shattered by a loud and human sneeze from the thicket not fifty feet from where they stood."}, {"size": 606, "text": "Instantly the girl in the clearing was electrified into action. Like a tigress charging those who stalked her she leaped swiftly across the clearing toward the point from which the disturbance had come.

Bridge and his companions heard the sounds of a swift and short pursuit followed by voices, one masterful, the other frightened and whimpering; and a moment afterward the girl reappeared dragging a boy with her--a wide-eyed, terrified, country boy who begged and blubbered to no avail."}, {"size": 619, "text": "Beside the dead man the girl halted and then turned on her captive. In her right hand she still held the menacing blade. \u201cWhat you do there watching me for?\u201d she demanded. \u201cTell me the truth, or I kill you,\u201d and she half raised the knife that he might profit in his decision by this most potent of arguments.

Then Willie told of the arrival of the great detective, of the reward that had been offered and of his decision to win it and become rich and famous in a single stroke.

The boy's voice had risen despite his efforts to hold it to a low whisper for what with the excitement of the adventure and his terror of the girl with the knife he had little or no control of himself, yet it was evident that he did not realize that practically every word he had spoken had reached the ears of the three in hiding and that his final precaution as he divulged the information to the girl was prompted by an excess of timidity and secretiveness. The eyes of the girl widened in surprise and fear as she learned that three watchers lay concealed at the verge of the clearing."}, {"size": 641, "text": "She bent a long, searching look in the direction indicated by the boy and then turned her eyes quickly toward the hut as though to summon aid.

He eat you.\u201d \u201cCome, come, now, my dear,\u201d urged Bridge, \u201cbe calm. Let us get at the root of this thing. Your young friend accuses me of being a murderer, does he?

I ask myself: was this man murdered? but I do not say that he was murdered. I wait for an explanation from you, for you do not look a murderer, though I cannot say as much for your desperate companion.\u201d The girl looked straight into Bridge's eyes for a full minute before she replied as though endeavoring to read his inmost soul."}, {"size": 838, "text": "\u201cI do not know this boy,\u201d she said. \u201cThat is the truth.

Will you?\u201d \u201cI will,\u201d replied Bridge, and then turning toward the brush he called: \u201cCome here!\u201d and presently a boy and a girl, dishevelled and fearful, crawled forth into sight. Willie Case's eyes went wide as they fell upon the Oskaloosa Kid.

Ice cream, red pop, peanuts, candy, and soda water may have diminished his appetite but not his pride and self-satisfaction as he sat alone and by night for the first time in a public eating place.

In addition to the meat and potatoes there was one vegetable in a side-dish and as dessert four prunes. The meat course gone Willie placed the vegetable dish on the empty plate, seized a spoon in lieu of knife and fork and--presto! the side-dish was empty. Whereupon the prune dish was set in the empty side-dish--four deft motions and there were no prunes--in the dish.

Amid the crash of crockery which followed the collision Willie slammed check and money upon the cashier's desk and fled. Nor did he pause until in the reassuring seclusion of a dark side street.

Before he had gone two blocks from the theater Willie had concocted at least three tales to account for his tardiness, either one of which would have done credit to the imaginative powers of a Rider Haggard or a Jules Verne; but at the end of the third block he caught a glimpse of something which drove all thoughts of home from his mind and came but barely short of driving his mind out too."}, {"size": 688, "text": "He was approaching the entrance to an alley.

Columbus Blackie leaped for The Oskaloosa Kid, while The Sky Pilot seized upon Abigail Prim.

Columbus Blackie found his hands full with The Oskaloosa Kid. Again and again the youth struck him in the face; but the man persisted, beating down the slim hands and striking viciously at body and head until, at last, the boy, half stunned though still struggling, was dragged from the room. Simultaneously a series of frightful growls reverberated through the deserted mill. A huge body catapulted into the midst of the fighters.

There, silhouetted against the lesser darkness without, he saw the figures of Columbus Blackie and The Oskaloosa Kid and with a growl he charged them.

At Payson he stopped long enough at the town jail to arrange for the reception of the two prisoners, to notify the coroner of the death of Columbus Blackie and the whereabouts of his body and to place Dirty Eddie in the hospital. He then telephoned Jonas Prim that his daughter was safe and would be returned to him in less than an hour."}, {"size": 741, "text": "By the time Bridge and The Oskaloosa Kid reached Payson the town was in an uproar.

Bridge and The Oskaloosa Kid were hustled into the single cell of the Payson jail. A bench ran along two sides of the room. A single barred window let out upon the yard behind the structure.

There were reproductions of photographs of John Baggs, Reginald Paynter, Abigail Prim, Jonas Prim, and his wife, with a large cut of the Prim mansion, a star marking the boudoir of the missing daughter of the house.

Automobile horns screamed out upon the night. The two heard the chugging of motors, the sound of brakes and the greetings of new arrivals. The reinforcements had arrived from Oakdale. A guard came to the grating of the cell door. \u201cThe bunch from Oakdale has come,\u201d he said. \u201cIf I was you I'd say my prayers. Old man Baggs is dead.

Burton's car drew up before the doorway of the Prim home in Oakdale. The great detective alighted and handed down the missing Abigail.

Mrs. Prim because it would not have been PROPER; Jonas because he could not trust himself to meet his daughter, whom he had thought lost, in the presence of a possible crowd which might have accompanied her home.

He said they were driving out into the country to look at a piece of property--a farm somewhere north of Oakdale--and that on the way back they were going to stop at The Crossroads Inn for dinner.

Both of them were drunk. After that it all happened so quickly that I could scarcely follow it.

I don't know why she wishes to conceal her identity; but I can't stand by and see her lynched without trying to save her.\u201d The crowd scoffed in incredulity. \u201cThere are some women here,\u201d said Bridge. \u201cTurn her over to them.

With a sudden wrench Bridge tore himself loose from his captors and leaped toward the farmer, his right flew straight out from the shoulder and Jeb Case went down with a broken jaw. Almost simultaneously a car sped around a curve from the north and stopped suddenly in rear of the mob. Two men leaped out and shouldered their way through. One was the detective, Burton; the other was Jonas Prim. \u201cWhere are they?\u201d cried the latter. \u201cGod help you if you've killed either of them, for one of them must know what became of Abigail.\u201d He pushed his way up until he faced the prisoners."}, {"size": 659, "text": "The Oskaloosa Kid gave him a single look of surprise and then sprang toward him with outstretched arms. \u201cOh, daddy, daddy!\u201d she cried, \u201cdon't let them kill him.\u201d The crowd melted away from the immediate vicinity of the prisoners. None seemed anxious to appear in the forefront as a possible leader of a mob that had so nearly lynched the only daughter of Jonas Prim.

Abigail laughed merrily. \u201cI stole them myself, Dad,\u201d she explained, \u201cand then Mr. Bridge took them from me in the jail to make the mob think he had stolen them and not I--he didn't know then that I was a girl, did you?\u201d \u201cIt was in the jail that I first guessed; but I didn't quite realize who you were until you said that the jewels were yours--then I knew.

The girl drew back. \u201cI want you to come with us,\u201d she said. \u201cI want Father to know you and to know how you have cared for me. Won't you come--for me?\u201d \u201cI couldn't refuse, if you put it that way,\u201d replied Bridge; and he climbed into the car.

He got everything wrong from A to Izzard, yet if it hadn't been for Willie we might not have cleared up the mystery so soon.\u201d \u201cIt isn't all cleared up yet,\u201d said Jonas Prim. \u201cWho murdered Baggs?\u201d \u201cTwo yeggs known as Dopey Charlie and the General,\u201d replied Burton. \u201cThey are in the jail at Oakdale; but they don't know yet that I know they are guilty."}, {"size": 619, "text": "They think they are being held merely as suspects in the case of your daughter's disappearance, whereas I have known since morning that they were implicated in the killing of Baggs; for after I got them in the car I went behind the bushes where we discovered them and dug up everything that was missing from Baggs' house, as nearly as is known--currency, gold and bonds.\u201d \u201cGood!\u201d exclaimed Mr. Prim. On the trip back to Oakdale, Abigail Prim cuddled in the back seat beside her father, told him all that she could think to tell of Bridge and his goodness to her. \u201cBut the man didn't know you were a girl,\u201d suggested Mr."}, {"size": 604, "text": "Prim. \u201cThere were two other girls with us, both very pretty,\u201d replied Abigail, \u201cand he was as courteous and kindly to them as a man could be to a woman.

Between them, Burton and Jonas Prim fitted Bridge out as he had not been dressed in years, and with the feel of fresh linen and pressed clothing, even if ill fitting, a sensation of comfort and ease pervaded him which the man would not have thought possible from such a source an hour before.
