He had travelled northward with the consciousness of several social duties that appealed to him from the further side of the Alps, but he was under the charm of the Italian spring, and he made a pretext for lingering. He had spent five days at Siena, where he had intended to spend but two, and still it was impossible to continue his journey. He was a young man of a contemplative and speculative turn, and this was his first visit to Italy, so that if he dallied by the way he should not be harshly judged."}, {"size": 620, "text": "He had a fancy for sketching, and it was on his conscience to take a few pictorial notes. There were two old inns at Siena, both of them very shabby and very dirty. The one at which Longueville had taken up his abode was entered by a dark, pestiferous arch-way, surmounted by a sign which at a distance might have been read by the travellers as the Dantean injunction to renounce all hope. The other was not far off, and the day after his arrival, as he passed it, he saw two ladies going in who evidently belonged to the large fraternity of Anglo-Saxon tourists, and one of whom was young and carried herself very well."}, {"size": 747, "text": "Longueville had his share--or more than his share--of gallantry, and this incident awakened a regret. If he had gone to the other inn he might have had charming company: at his own establishment there was no one but an aesthetic German who smoked bad tobacco in the dining-room. He remarked to himself that this was always his luck, and the remark was characteristic of the man; it was charged with the feeling of the moment, but it was not absolutely just; it was the result of an acute impression made by the particular occasion; but it failed in appreciation of a providence which had sprinkled Longueville\u2019s career with happy accidents--accidents, especially, in which his characteristic gallantry was not allowed to rust for want of exercise."}, {"size": 673, "text": "He lounged, however, contentedly enough through these bright, still days of a Tuscan April, drawing much entertainment from the high picturesqueness of the things about him. Siena, a few years since, was a flawless gift of the Middle Ages to the modern imagination. No other Italian city could have been more interesting to an observer fond of reconstructing obsolete manners. This was a taste of Bernard Longueville\u2019s, who had a relish for serious literature, and at one time had made several lively excursions into mediaeval history. His friends thought him very clever, and at the same time had an easy feeling about him which was a tribute to his freedom from pedantry."}, {"size": 852, "text": "He was clever indeed, and an excellent companion; but the real measure of his brilliancy was in the success with which he entertained himself. He was much addicted to conversing with his own wit, and he greatly enjoyed his own society. Clever as he often was in talking with his friends, I am not sure that his best things, as the phrase is, were not for his own ears. And this was not on account of any cynical contempt for the understanding of his fellow-creatures: it was simply because what I have called his own society was more of a stimulus than that of most other people. And yet he was not for this reason fond of solitude; he was, on the contrary, a very sociable animal. It must be admitted at the outset that he had a nature which seemed at several points to contradict itself, as will probably be perceived in the course of this narration."}, {"size": 869, "text": "He entertained himself greatly with his reflections and meditations upon Sienese architecture and early Tuscan art, upon Italian street-life and the geological idiosyncrasies of the Apennines. If he had only gone to the other inn, that nice-looking girl whom he had seen passing under the dusky portal with her face turned away from him might have broken bread with him at this intellectual banquet. Then came a day, however, when it seemed for a moment that if she were disposed she might gather up the crumbs of the feast. Longueville, every morning after breakfast, took a turn in the great square of Siena--the vast piazza, shaped like a horse-shoe, where the market is held beneath the windows of that crenellated palace from whose overhanging cornice a tall, straight tower springs up with a movement as light as that of a single plume in the bonnet of a captain."}, {"size": 751, "text": "Here he strolled about, watching a brown contadino disembarrass his donkey, noting the progress of half an hour\u2019s chaffer over a bundle of carrots, wishing a young girl with eyes like animated agates would let him sketch her, and gazing up at intervals at the beautiful, slim tower, as it played at contrasts with the large blue air. After he had spent the greater part of a week in these grave considerations, he made up his mind to leave Siena. But he was not content with what he had done for his portfolio. Siena was eminently sketchable, but he had not been industrious. On the last morning of his visit, as he stood staring about him in the crowded piazza, and feeling that, in spite of its picturesqueness, this was an awkward place for setting"}, {"size": 697, "text": "up an easel, he bethought himself, by contrast, of a quiet corner in another part of the town, which he had chanced upon in one of his first walks--an angle of a lonely terrace that abutted upon the city-wall, where three or four superannuated objects seemed to slumber in the sunshine--the open door of an empty church, with a faded fresco exposed to the air in the arch above it, and an ancient beggar-woman sitting beside it on a three-legged stool. The little terrace had an old polished parapet, about as high as a man\u2019s breast, above which was a view of strange, sad-colored hills. Outside, to the left, the wall of the town made an outward bend, and exposed its rugged and rusty complexion."}, {"size": 623, "text": "There was a smooth stone bench set into the wall of the church, on which Longueville had rested for an hour, observing the composition of the little picture of which I have indicated the elements, and of which the parapet of the terrace would form the foreground. The thing was what painters call a subject, and he had promised himself to come back with his utensils. This morning he returned to the inn and took possession of them, and then he made his way through a labyrinth of empty streets, lying on the edge of the town, within the wall, like the superfluous folds of a garment whose wearer has shrunken with old age."}, {"size": 654, "text": "He reached his little grass-grown terrace, and found it as sunny and as private as before. The old mendicant was mumbling petitions, sacred and profane, at the church door; but save for this the stillness was unbroken. The yellow sunshine warmed the brown surface of the city-wall, and lighted the hollows of the Etruscan hills. Longueville settled himself on the empty bench, and, arranging his little portable apparatus, began to ply his brushes. He worked for some time smoothly and rapidly, with an agreeable sense of the absence of obstacles. It seemed almost an interruption when, in the silent air, he heard a distant bell in the town strike noon."}, {"size": 656, "text": "Shortly after this, there was another interruption. The sound of a soft footstep caused him to look up; whereupon he saw a young woman standing there and bending her eyes upon the graceful artist. A second glance assured him that she was that nice girl whom he had seen going into the other inn with her mother, and suggested that she had just emerged from the little church. He suspected, however--I hardly know why--that she had been looking at him for some moments before he perceived her. It would perhaps be impertinent to inquire what she thought of him; but Longueville, in the space of an instant, made two or three reflections upon the young lady."}, {"size": 608, "text": "One of them was to the effect that she was a handsome creature, but that she looked rather bold; the burden of the other was that--yes, decidedly--she was a compatriot. She turned away almost as soon as she met his eyes; he had hardly time to raise his hat, as, after a moment\u2019s hesitation, he proceeded to do. She herself appeared to feel a certain hesitation; she glanced back at the church door, as if under the impulse to retrace her steps. She stood there a moment longer--long enough to let him see that she was a person of easy attitudes--and then she walked away slowly to the parapet of the terrace."}, {"size": 697, "text": "Here she stationed herself, leaning her arms upon the high stone ledge, presenting her back to Longueville, and gazing at rural Italy. Longueville went on with his sketch, but less attentively than before. He wondered what this young lady was doing there alone, and then it occurred to him that her companion--her mother, presumably--was in the church. The two ladies had been in the church when he arrived; women liked to sit in churches; they had been there more than half an hour, and the mother had not enough of it even yet. The young lady, however, at present preferred the view that Longueville was painting; he became aware that she had placed herself in the very centre of his foreground."}, {"size": 645, "text": "His first feeling was that she would spoil it; his second was that she would improve it. Little by little she turned more into profile, leaning only one arm upon the parapet, while the other hand, holding her folded parasol, hung down at her side. She was motionless; it was almost as if she were standing there on purpose to be drawn. Yes, certainly she improved the picture. Her profile, delicate and thin, defined itself against the sky, in the clear shadow of a coquettish hat; her figure was light; she bent and leaned easily; she wore a gray dress, fastened up as was then the fashion, and displaying the broad edge of a crimson petticoat."}, {"size": 731, "text": "She kept her position; she seemed absorbed in the view. \u201cIs she posing--is she attitudinizing for my benefit?\u201d Longueville asked of himself. And then it seemed to him that this was a needless assumption, for the prospect was quite beautiful enough to be looked at for itself, and there was nothing impossible in a pretty girl having a love of fine landscape. \u201cBut posing or not,\u201d he went on, \u201cI will put her into my sketch. She has simply put herself in. It will give it a human interest. There is nothing like having a human interest.\u201d So, with the ready skill that he possessed, he introduced the young girl\u2019s figure into his foreground, and at the end of ten minutes he had almost made something that had the form of a likeness."}, {"size": 622, "text": "\u201cIf she will only be quiet for another ten minutes,\u201d he said, \u201cthe thing will really be a picture.\u201d Unfortunately, the young lady was not quiet; she had apparently had enough of her attitude and her view. She turned away, facing Longueville again, and slowly came back, as if to re-enter the church. To do so she had to pass near him, and as she approached he instinctively got up, holding his drawing in one hand. She looked at him again, with that expression that he had mentally characterized as \u201cbold,\u201d a few minutes before--with dark, intelligent eyes. Her hair was dark and dense; she was a strikingly handsome girl."}, {"size": 697, "text": "\u201cI am so sorry you moved,\u201d he said, confidently, in English. \u201cYou were so--so beautiful.\u201d She stopped, looking at him more directly than ever; and she looked at his sketch, which he held out toward her. At the sketch, however, she only glanced, whereas there was observation in the eye that she bent upon Longueville. He never knew whether she had blushed; he afterward thought she might have been frightened. Nevertheless, it was not exactly terror that appeared to dictate her answer to Longueville\u2019s speech. \u201cI am much obliged to you. Don\u2019t you think you have looked at me enough?\u201d \u201cBy no means. I should like so much to finish my drawing.\u201d \u201cI am not a professional model,\u201d said the young lady."}, {"size": 713, "text": "\u201cNo. That \u2018s my difficulty,\u201d Longueville answered, laughing. \u201cI can\u2019t propose to remunerate you.\u201d The young lady seemed to think this joke in indifferent taste. She turned away in silence; but something in her expression, in his feeling at the time, in the situation, incited Longueville to higher play. He felt a lively need of carrying his point. \u201cYou see it will be pure kindness,\u201d he went on,--\u201ca simple act of charity. Five minutes will be enough. Treat me as an Italian beggar.\u201d She had laid down his sketch and had stepped forward. He stood there, obsequious, clasping his hands and smiling. His interruptress stopped and looked at him again, as if she thought him a very odd person; but she seemed amused."}, {"size": 620, "text": "Now, at any rate, she was not frightened. She seemed even disposed to provoke him a little. \u201cI wish to go to my mother,\u201d she said. \u201cWhere is your mother?\u201d the young man asked. \u201cIn the church, of course. I did n\u2019t come here alone!\u201d \u201cOf course not; but you may be sure that your mother is very contented. I have been in that little church. It is charming. She is just resting there; she is probably tired. If you will kindly give me five minutes more, she will come out to you.\u201d \u201cFive minutes?\u201d the young girl asked. \u201cFive minutes will do. I shall be eternally grateful.\u201d Longueville was amused at himself as he said this."}, {"size": 803, "text": "He cared infinitely less for his sketch than the words appeared to imply; but, somehow, he cared greatly that this graceful stranger should do what he had proposed. The graceful stranger dropped an eye on the sketch again. \u201cIs your picture so good as that?\u201d she asked. \u201cI have a great deal of talent,\u201d he answered, laughing. \u201cYou shall see for yourself, when it is finished.\u201d She turned slowly toward the terrace again. \u201cYou certainly have a great deal of talent, to induce me to do what you ask.\u201d And she walked to where she had stood before. Longueville made a movement to go with her, as if to show her the attitude he meant; but, pointing with decision to his easel, she said-- \u201cYou have only five minutes.\u201d He immediately went back to his work, and she made a vague attempt to take up her position."}, {"size": 629, "text": "\u201cYou must tell me if this will do,\u201d she added, in a moment. \u201cIt will do beautifully,\u201d Longueville answered, in a happy tone, looking at her and plying his brush. \u201cIt is immensely good of you to take so much trouble.\u201d For a moment she made no rejoinder, but presently she said-- \u201cOf course if I pose at all I wish to pose well.\u201d \u201cYou pose admirably,\u201d said Longueville. After this she said nothing, and for several minutes he painted rapidly and in silence. He felt a certain excitement, and the movement of his thoughts kept pace with that of his brush. It was very true that she posed admirably; she was a fine creature to paint."}, {"size": 726, "text": "Her prettiness inspired him, and also her audacity, as he was content to regard it for the moment. He wondered about her--who she was, and what she was--perceiving that the so-called audacity was not vulgar boldness, but the play of an original and probably interesting character. It was obvious that she was a perfect lady, but it was equally obvious that she was irregularly clever. Longueville\u2019s little figure was a success--a charming success, he thought, as he put on the last touches. While he was doing this, his model\u2019s companion came into view. She came out of the church, pausing a moment as she looked from her daughter to the young man in the corner of the terrace; then she walked straight over to the young girl."}, {"size": 607, "text": "She was a delicate little gentlewoman, with a light, quick step. Longueville\u2019s five minutes were up; so, leaving his place, he approached the two ladies, sketch in hand. The elder one, who had passed her hand into her daughter\u2019s arm, looked up at him with clear, surprised eyes; she was a charming old woman. Her eyes were very pretty, and on either side of them, above a pair of fine dark brows, was a band of silvery hair, rather coquettishly arranged. \u201cIt is my portrait,\u201d said her daughter, as Longueville drew near. \u201cThis gentleman has been sketching me.\u201d \u201cSketching you, dearest?\u201d murmured her mother."}, {"size": 644, "text": "\u201cWas n\u2019t it rather sudden?\u201d \u201cVery sudden--very abrupt!\u201d exclaimed the young girl with a laugh. \u201cConsidering all that, it \u2018s very good,\u201d said Longueville, offering his picture to the elder lady, who took it and began to examine it. \u201cI can\u2019t tell you how much I thank you,\u201d he said to his model. \u201cIt \u2018s very well for you to thank me now,\u201d she replied. \u201cYou really had no right to begin.\u201d \u201cThe temptation was so great.\u201d \u201cWe should resist temptation. And you should have asked my leave.\u201d \u201cI was afraid you would refuse it; and you stood there, just in my line of vision.\u201d \u201cYou should have asked me to get out of it.\u201d \u201cI should have been very sorry."}, {"size": 606, "text": "Besides, it would have been extremely rude.\u201d The young girl looked at him a moment. \u201cYes, I think it would. But what you have done is ruder.\u201d \u201cIt is a hard case!\u201d said Longueville. \u201cWhat could I have done, then, decently?\u201d \u201cIt \u2018s a beautiful drawing,\u201d murmured the elder lady, handing the thing back to Longueville. Her daughter, meanwhile, had not even glanced at it. \u201cYou might have waited till I should go away,\u201d this argumentative young person continued. Longueville shook his head. \u201cI never lose opportunities!\u201d \u201cYou might have sketched me afterwards, from memory.\u201d Longueville looked at her, smiling."}, {"size": 600, "text": "\u201cJudge how much better my memory will be now!\u201d She also smiled a little, but instantly became serious. \u201cFor myself, it \u2018s an episode I shall try to forget. I don\u2019t like the part I have played in it.\u201d \u201cMay you never play a less becoming one!\u201d cried Longueville. \u201cI hope that your mother, at least, will accept a memento of the occasion.\u201d And he turned again with his sketch to her companion, who had been listening to the girl\u2019s conversation with this enterprising stranger, and looking from one to the other with an air of earnest confusion. \u201cWon\u2019t you do me the honor of keeping my sketch?\u201d he said."}, {"size": 600, "text": "\u201cI think it really looks like your daughter.\u201d \u201cOh, thank you, thank you; I hardly dare,\u201d murmured the lady, with a deprecating gesture. \u201cIt will serve as a kind of amends for the liberty I have taken,\u201d Longueville added; and he began to remove the drawing from its paper block. \u201cIt makes it worse for you to give it to us,\u201d said the young girl. \u201cOh, my dear, I am sure it \u2018s lovely!\u201d exclaimed her mother. \u201cIt \u2018s wonderfully like you.\u201d \u201cI think that also makes it worse!\u201d Longueville was at last nettled. The young lady\u2019s perversity was perhaps not exactly malignant; but it was certainly ungracious."}, {"size": 792, "text": "She seemed to desire to present herself as a beautiful tormentress. \u201cHow does it make it worse?\u201d he asked, with a frown. He believed she was clever, and she was certainly ready. Now, however, she reflected a moment before answering. \u201cThat you should give us your sketch,\u201d she said at last. \u201cIt was to your mother I offered it,\u201d Longueville observed. But this observation, the fruit of his irritation, appeared to have no effect upon the young girl. \u201cIs n\u2019t it what painters call a study?\u201d she went on. \u201cA study is of use to the painter himself. Your justification would be that you should keep your sketch, and that it might be of use to you.\u201d \u201cMy daughter is a study, sir, you will say,\u201d said the elder lady in a little, light, conciliating voice, and graciously accepting the drawing again."}, {"size": 730, "text": "\u201cI will admit,\u201d said Longueville, \u201cthat I am very inconsistent. Set it down to my esteem, madam,\u201d he added, looking at the mother. \u201cThat \u2018s for you, mamma,\u201d said his model, disengaging her arm from her mother\u2019s hand and turning away. The mamma stood looking at the sketch with a smile which seemed to express a tender desire to reconcile all accidents. \u201cIt \u2018s extremely beautiful,\u201d she murmured, \u201cand if you insist on my taking it--\u201d \u201cI shall regard it as a great honor.\u201d \u201cVery well, then; with many thanks, I will keep it.\u201d She looked at the young man a moment, while her daughter walked away. Longueville thought her a delightful little person; she struck him as a sort of transfigured Quakeress--a mystic with a practical side."}, {"size": 823, "text": "\u201cI am sure you think she \u2018s a strange girl,\u201d she said. \u201cShe is extremely pretty.\u201d \u201cShe is very clever,\u201d said the mother. \u201cShe is wonderfully graceful.\u201d \u201cAh, but she \u2018s good!\u201d cried the old lady. \u201cI am sure she comes honestly by that,\u201d said Longueville, expressively, while his companion, returning his salutation with a certain scrupulous grace of her own, hurried after her daughter. Longueville remained there staring at the view but not especially seeing it. He felt as if he had at once enjoyed and lost an opportunity. After a while he tried to make a sketch of the old beggar-woman who sat there in a sort of palsied immobility, like a rickety statue at a church-door. But his attempt to reproduce her features was not gratifying, and he suddenly laid down his brush. She was not pretty enough--she had a bad profile."}, {"size": 656, "text": "Two months later Bernard Longueville was at Venice, still under the impression that he was leaving Italy. He was not a man who made plans and held to them. He made them, indeed--few men made more--but he made them as a basis for variation. He had gone to Venice to spend a fortnight, and his fortnight had taken the form of eight enchanting weeks. He had still a sort of conviction that he was carrying out his plans; for it must be confessed that where his pleasure was concerned he had considerable skill in accommodating his theory to his practice. His enjoyment of Venice was extreme, but he was roused from it by a summons he was indisposed to resist."}, {"size": 641, "text": "This consisted of a letter from an intimate friend who was living in Germany--a friend whose name was Gordon Wright. He had been spending the winter in Dresden, but his letter bore the date of Baden-Baden. As it was not long, I may give it entire. \u201cI wish very much that you would come to this place. I think you have been here before, so that you know how pretty it is, and how amusing. I shall probably be here the rest of the summer. There are some people I know and whom I want you to know. Be so good as to arrive. Then I will thank you properly for your various Italian rhapsodies. I can\u2019t reply on the same scale--I have n\u2019t the time."}, {"size": 679, "text": "Do you know what I am doing? I am making love. I find it a most absorbing occupation. That is literally why I have not written to you before. I have been making love ever since the last of May. It takes an immense amount of time, and everything else has got terribly behindhand. I don\u2019t mean to say that the experiment itself has gone on very fast; but I am trying to push it forward. I have n\u2019t yet had time to test its success; but in this I want your help. You know we great physicists never make an experiment without an \u2018assistant\u2019--a humble individual who burns his fingers and stains his clothes in the cause of science, but whose interest in the problem is only indirect."}, {"size": 625, "text": "I want you to be my assistant, and I will guarantee that your burns and stains shall not be dangerous. She is an extremely interesting girl, and I really want you to see her--I want to know what you think of her. She wants to know you, too, for I have talked a good deal about you. There you have it, if gratified vanity will help you on the way. Seriously, this is a real request. I want your opinion, your impression. I want to see how she will affect you. I don\u2019t say I ask for your advice; that, of course, you will not undertake to give. But I desire a definition, a characterization; you know you toss off those things."}, {"size": 603, "text": "I don\u2019t see why I should n\u2019t tell you all this--I have always told you everything. I have never pretended to know anything about women, but I have always supposed that you knew everything. You certainly have always had the tone of that sort of omniscience. So come here as soon as possible and let me see that you are not a humbug. She \u2018s a very handsome girl.\u201d Longueville was so much amused with this appeal that he very soon started for Germany. In the reader, Gordon Wright\u2019s letter will, perhaps, excite surprise rather than hilarity; but Longueville thought it highly characteristic of his friend."}, {"size": 885, "text": "What it especially pointed to was Gordon\u2019s want of imagination--a deficiency which was a matter of common jocular allusion between the two young men, each of whom kept a collection of acknowledged oddities as a playground for the other\u2019s wit. Bernard had often spoken of his comrade\u2019s want of imagination as a bottomless pit, into which Gordon was perpetually inviting him to lower himself. \u201cMy dear fellow,\u201d Bernard said, \u201cyou must really excuse me; I cannot take these subterranean excursions. I should lose my breath down there; I should never come up alive. You know I have dropped things down--little jokes and metaphors, little fantasies and paradoxes--and I have never heard them touch bottom!\u201d This was an epigram on the part of a young man who had a lively play of fancy; but it was none the less true that Gordon Wright had a firmly-treading, rather than a winged, intellect."}, {"size": 850, "text": "Every phrase in his letter seemed, to Bernard, to march in stout-soled walking-boots, and nothing could better express his attachment to the process of reasoning things out than this proposal that his friend should come and make a chemical analysis--a geometrical survey--of the lady of his love. \u201cThat I shall have any difficulty in forming an opinion, and any difficulty in expressing it when formed--of this he has as little idea as that he shall have any difficulty in accepting it when expressed.\u201d So Bernard reflected, as he rolled in the train to Munich. \u201cGordon\u2019s mind,\u201d he went on, \u201chas no atmosphere; his intellectual process goes on in the void. There are no currents and eddies to affect it, no high winds nor hot suns, no changes of season and temperature. His premises are neatly arranged, and his conclusions are perfectly calculable.\u201d"}, {"size": 676, "text": "Yet for the man on whose character he so freely exercised his wit Bernard Longueville had a strong affection. It is nothing against the validity of a friendship that the parties to it have not a mutual resemblance. There must be a basis of agreement, but the structure reared upon it may contain a thousand disparities. These two young men had formed an alliance of old, in college days, and the bond between them had been strengthened by the simple fact of its having survived the sentimental revolutions of early life. Its strongest link was a sort of mutual respect. Their tastes, their pursuits were different; but each of them had a high esteem for the other\u2019s character."}, {"size": 642, "text": "It may be said that they were easily pleased; for it is certain that neither of them had performed any very conspicuous action. They were highly civilized young Americans, born to an easy fortune and a tranquil destiny, and unfamiliar with the glitter of golden opportunities. If I did not shrink from disparaging the constitution of their native land for their own credit, I should say that it had never been very definitely proposed to these young gentlemen to distinguish themselves. On reaching manhood, they had each come into property sufficient to make violent exertion superfluous. Gordon Wright, indeed, had inherited a large estate."}, {"size": 680, "text": "Their wants being tolerably modest, they had not been tempted to strive for the glory of building up commercial fortunes--the most obvious career open to young Americans. They had, indeed, embraced no career at all, and if summoned to give an account of themselves would, perhaps, have found it hard to tell any very impressive story. Gordon Wright was much interested in physical science, and had ideas of his own on what is called the endowment of research. His ideas had taken a practical shape, and he had distributed money very freely among the investigating classes, after which he had gone to spend a couple of years in Germany, supposing it to be the land of laboratories."}, {"size": 680, "text": "Here we find him at present, cultivating relations with several learned bodies and promoting the study of various tough branches of human knowledge, by paying the expenses of difficult experiments. The experiments, it must be added, were often of his own making, and he must have the honor of whatever brilliancy attaches, in the estimation of the world, to such pursuits. It was not, indeed, a brilliancy that dazzled Bernard Longueville, who, however, was not easily dazzled by anything. It was because he regarded him in so plain and direct a fashion, that Bernard had an affection for his friend--an affection to which it would perhaps be difficult to assign a definite cause."}, {"size": 721, "text": "Personal sympathies are doubtless caused by something; but the causes are remote, mysterious to our daily vision, like those of the particular state of the weather. We content ourselves with remarking that it is fine or that it rains, and the enjoyment of our likes and dislikes is by no means apt to borrow its edge from the keenness of our analysis. Longueville had a relish for fine quality--superior savour; and he was sensible of this merit in the simple, candid, manly, affectionate nature of his comrade, which seemed to him an excellent thing of its kind. Gordon Wright had a tender heart and a strong will--a combination which, when the understanding is not too limited, is often the motive of admirable actions."}, {"size": 630, "text": "There might sometimes be a question whether Gordon\u2019s understanding were sufficiently unlimited, but the impulses of a generous temper often play a useful part in filling up the gaps of an incomplete imagination, and the general impression that Wright produced was certainly that of intelligent good-nature. The reasons for appreciating Bernard Longueville were much more manifest. He pleased superficially, as well as fundamentally. Nature had sent him into the world with an armful of good gifts. He was very good-looking--tall, dark, agile, perfectly finished, so good-looking that he might have been a fool and yet be forgiven."}, {"size": 891, "text": "As has already been intimated, however, he was far from being a fool. He had a number of talents, which, during three or four years that followed his leaving college, had received the discipline of the study of the law.

This question was never satisfactorily answered, the feeling being that Longueville did more than many people in causing it to be asked. Moreover, there was one thing he did constantly--he enjoyed himself. This is manifestly not a career, and it has been said at the outset that he was not attached to any of the recognized professions. But without going into details, he was a charming fellow--clever, urbane, free-handed, and with that fortunate quality in his appearance which is known as distinction."}, {"size": 694, "text": "He had not specified, in writing to Gordon Wright, the day on which he should arrive at Baden-Baden; it must be confessed that he was not addicted to specifying days. He came to his journey\u2019s end in the evening, and, on presenting himself at the hotel from which his friend had dated his letter, he learned that Gordon Wright had betaken himself after dinner, according to the custom of Baden-Baden, to the grounds of the Conversation-house. It was eight o\u2019clock, and Longueville, after removing the stains of travel, sat down to dine. His first impulse had been to send for Gordon to come and keep him company at his repast; but on second thought he determined to make it as brief as possible."}, {"size": 753, "text": "Having brought it to a close, he took his way to the Kursaal. The great German watering-place is one of the prettiest nooks in Europe, and of a summer evening in the gaming days, five-and-twenty years ago, it was one of the most brilliant scenes. The lighted windows of the great temple of hazard (of as chaste an architecture as if it had been devoted to a much purer divinity) opened wide upon the gardens and groves; the little river that issues from the bosky mountains of the Black Forest flowed, with an air of brook-like innocence, past the expensive hotels and lodging-houses; the orchestra, in a high pavilion on the terrace of the Kursaal, played a discreet accompaniment to the conversation of the ladies and gentlemen who, scattered over the"}, {"size": 765, "text": "large expanse on a thousand little chairs, preferred for the time the beauties of nature to the shuffle of coin and the calculation of chance; while the faint summer stars, twinkling above the vague black hills and woods, looked down at the indifferent groups without venturing to drop their light upon them. Longueville, noting all this, went straight into the gaming-rooms; he was curious to see whether his friend, being fond of experiments, was trying combinations at roulette. But he was not to be found in any of the gilded chambers, among the crowd that pressed in silence about the tables; so that Bernard presently came and began to wander about the lamp-lit terrace, where innumerable groups, seated and strolling, made the place a gigantic conversazione."}, {"size": 672, "text": "It seemed to him very agreeable and amusing, and he remarked to himself that, for a man who was supposed not to take especially the Epicurean view of life, Gordon Wright, in coming to Baden, had certainly made himself comfortable.

He had an excellent memory for faces; but it was some time before he was able to attach an identity to this one.

The lady was the mother of his inconsequent model, so that this mysterious personage was probably herself not far off. Before Longueville had time to verify this induction, he found his eyes resting upon the broad back of a gentleman seated close to the old lady, and who, turning away from her, was talking to a young girl. It was nothing but the back of this gentleman that he saw, but nevertheless, with the instinct of true friendship, he recognized in this featureless expanse the robust personality of Gordon Wright."}, {"size": 718, "text": "In a moment he had stepped forward and laid his hand upon Wright\u2019s shoulder.

He raised his hat to her and to the young girl, and he became conscious, as regards the latter, of a certain disappointment. She was very pretty; she was looking at him; but she was not the heroine of the little incident of the terrace at Siena."}, {"size": 758, "text": "\u201cIt \u2018s just like Longueville, you know,\u201d Gordon Wright went on; \u201che always comes at you from behind; he \u2018s so awfully fond of surprises.\u201d He was laughing; he was greatly pleased; he introduced Bernard to the two ladies. \u201cYou must know Mrs. Vivian; you must know Miss Blanche Evers.\u201d Bernard took his place in the little circle; he wondered whether he ought to venture upon a special recognition of Mrs. Vivian. Then it seemed to him that he should leave the option of this step with the lady, especially as he had detected recognition in her eye.

I don\u2019t complain of anything.\u201d And she gave a little deprecating laugh. Gordon Wright shook hands with Bernard again; he seemed really very glad to see him.

His features were thick and rather irregular; but his countenance--in addition to the merit of its expression--derived a certain grace from a powerful yellow moustache, to which its wearer occasionally gave a martial twist. Gordon Wright was not tall, but he was strong, and in his whole person there was something well-planted and sturdy. He almost always dressed in light-colored garments, and he wore round his neck an eternal blue cravat."}, {"size": 651, "text": "When he was agitated he grew very red. While he questioned Longueville about his journey and his health, his whereabouts and his intentions, the latter, among his own replies, endeavored to read in Wright\u2019s eyes some account of his present situation.

Perhaps this was another, a younger daughter, though, indeed, she bore no resemblance to either of Longueville\u2019s friends.

She was probably looking for her elder daughter, and Longueville could not help wishing also that this young lady would arrive."}, {"size": 643, "text": "Meanwhile, he saw that the young girl to whom Gordon had been devoting himself was extremely pretty, and appeared eminently approachable. Longueville had some talk with her, reflecting that if she were the person concerning whom Gordon had written him, it behooved him to appear to take an interest in her. This view of the case was confirmed by Gordon Wright\u2019s presently turning away to talk with Mrs. Vivian, so that his friend might be at liberty to make acquaintance with their companion.

She had soft brown hair, with a silky-golden thread in it, beautifully arranged and crowned by a smart little hat that savoured of Paris. She had also a slender little figure, neatly rounded, and delicate, narrow hands, prettily gloved.

Mrs. Vivian\u2019s protege was a member of the former category; she belonged to the genus coquette.

This was immediately followed, however, by the light of recognition--recognition embarrassed, and signalling itself by a blush. Miss Vivian\u2019s companion was a powerful, handsome fellow, with a remarkable auburn beard, who struck the observer immediately as being uncommonly well dressed.

She was silent and grave; she had a manner which took the edge from the wantonness of filial independence.

They sat on the terrace and talked in the mingled starlight and lamplight, and they strolled in the deep green forests and wound along the side of the gentle Baden hills, under the influence of colloquial tendencies.

Among themselves as well, however, a little drama went forward in which each member of the company had a part to play. Bernard Longueville had been surprised at first at what he would have called Miss Vivian\u2019s approachableness--at the frequency with which he encountered opportunities for sitting near her and entering into conversation.

After this result might have been supposed to be attained, Gordon Wright stepped back into his usual place and showed her those small civilities which were the only homage that the quiet conditions of their life rendered possible--walked with her, talked with her, brought her a book to read, a chair to sit upon, a couple of flowers to place in the bosom of her gown, treated her, in a word, with a sober but by no means inexpressive gallantry."}, {"size": 733, "text": "He had not been making violent love, as he told Longueville, and these demonstrations were certainly not violent.

He found Mrs. Vivian and her daughter, very opportunely, in the garden of the pleasant, homely Schloss which forms the residence of the Grand Dukes of Baden during their visits to the scene of our narrative, and which, perched upon the hill-side directly above the little town, is surrounded with charming old shrubberies and terraces. To this garden a portion of the public is admitted, and Bernard, who liked the place, had been there more than once. One of the terraces had a high parapet, against which Angela was leaning, looking across the valley."}, {"size": 682, "text": "Mrs. Vivian was not at first in sight, but Bernard presently perceived her seated under a tree with Victor Cousin in her hand.

Bernard spent the evening in the gaming-rooms, in the thick of the crowd that pressed about the tables, and by way of a change--he had hitherto been almost nothing of a gambler--he laid down a couple of pieces at roulette."}, {"size": 641, "text": "He had played but two or three times, without winning a penny; but now he had the agreeable sensation of drawing in a small handful of gold. He continued to play, and he continued to win.

He felt amused and exhilarated, but the feeling amounted almost to agitation. He, nevertheless, returned to the tables, where he again found success awaiting him. Again and again he put his money on a happy number, and so steady a run of luck began at last to attract attention."}, {"size": 789, "text": "The rumor of it spread through the rooms, and the crowd about the roulette received a large contingent of spectators. Bernard felt that they were looking more or less eagerly for a turn of the tide; but he was in the humor for disappointing them, and he left the place, while his luck was still running high, with ten thousand francs in his pocket. It was very late when he returned to the inn--so late that he forbore to knock at Gordon\u2019s door. But though he betook himself to his own quarters, he was far from finding, or even seeking, immediate rest. He knocked about, as he would have said, for half the night--not because he was delighted at having won ten thousand francs, but rather because all of a sudden he found himself disgusted at the manner in which he had spent the evening."}, {"size": 745, "text": "It was extremely characteristic of Bernard Longueville that his pleasure should suddenly transform itself into flatness. What he felt was not regret or repentance. He had it not in the least on his conscience that he had given countenance to the reprehensible practice of gaming. It was annoyance that he had passed out of his own control--that he had obeyed a force which he was unable to measure at the time. He had been drunk and he was turning sober. In spite of a great momentary appearance of frankness and a lively relish of any conjunction of agreeable circumstances exerting a pressure to which one could respond, Bernard had really little taste for giving himself up, and he never did so without very soon wishing to take himself back."}, {"size": 617, "text": "He had now given himself to something that was not himself, and the fact that he had gained ten thousand francs by it was an insufficient salve to an aching sense of having ceased to be his own master.

Good luck and bad luck? Bernard felt very scornful of the distinction, save that good luck seemed to him rather the more vulgar. As the night went on his disgust deepened, and at last the weariness it brought with it sent him to sleep."}, {"size": 507, "text": "He slept very late, and woke up to a disagreeable consciousness. At first, before collecting his thoughts, he could not imagine what he had on his mind--was it that he had spoken ill of Angela Vivian?

Bernard resented this idea as an injury to himself, yet it was difficult to imagine what else could have happened.

He intended to intimate that he had come back to Baden with his mind made up to relinquish his suit, and that he had questioned Bernard simply from moral curiosity--for the sake of intellectual satisfaction. Nothing was altered by the fact that Bernard had told him a sorry tale; it had not modified his behavior--that effect would have been traceable."}, {"size": 724, "text": "It had simply affected his imagination, which was a consequence of the imponderable sort.

Of course, after renouncing the attempt to make himself acceptable to Miss Vivian, the only possible thing for Gordon had been to leave Baden. Bernard, continuing to meditate, at last convinced himself that there had been no explicit rupture, that Gordon\u2019s last visit had simply been a visit of farewell, that its character had sufficiently signified his withdrawal, and that he had now gone away because, after giving the girl up, he wished very naturally not to meet her again."}, {"size": 397, "text": "This was, on Bernard\u2019s part, a sufficiently coherent view of the case; but nevertheless, an hour afterward, as he strolled along the Lichtenthal Alley, he found himself stopping suddenly and exclaiming under his breath--\u201cHave I done her an injury?

It seemed a harmless use to make of it, in the afternoon, to go and pay another visit to the ladies who lived at the confectioner\u2019s. Here, however, he met a reception which introduced a fresh element of perplexity into the situation that Gordon had left behind him."}, {"size": 659, "text": "The door was opened to him by Mrs. Vivian\u2019s maid-servant, a sturdy daughter of the Schwartzwald, who informed him that the ladies--with much regret--were unable to receive any one. \u201cThey are very busy--and they are ill,\u201d said the young woman, by way of explanation. Bernard was disappointed, and he felt like arguing the case. \u201cSurely,\u201d he said, \u201cthey are not both ill and busy! When you make excuses, you should make them agree with each other.\u201d The Teutonic soubrette fixed her round blue eyes a minute upon the patch of blue sky revealed to her by her open door. \u201cI say what I can, lieber Herr.

In the evening, at the Kursaal, he met Captain Lovelock, who was wandering about with an air of explosive sadness. \u201cDamn it, they \u2018re going--yes, they \u2018re going,\u201d said the Captain, after the two young men had exchanged a few allusions to current events."}, {"size": 640, "text": "\u201cFancy their leaving us in that heartless manner!

He took refuge by anticipation, as it were, in this reflection, whenever, for the next three or four days, he foresaw himself stopping short, as he had done before, and asking himself whether he had done an injury to Angela Vivian. This was an idle and unpractical question, inasmuch as the answer was not forthcoming; whereas it was quite simple and conclusive to say, without the note of interrogation, that she was, in spite of many attractive points, an abrupt and capricious young woman."}, {"size": 824, "text": "During the three or four days in question, Bernard lingered on at Baden, uncertain what to do or where to go, feeling as if he had received a sudden check--a sort of spiritual snub--which arrested the accumulation of motive.

Some girls don\u2019t write, you know.\u201d Bernard remarked that it was possible Lovelock would still have news of Miss Blanche; and before he left Baden he learned that she had addressed her forsaken swain a charming little note from Lausanne, where the three ladies had paused in their flight from Baden, and where Mrs."}, {"size": 834, "text": "Vivian had decreed that for the present they should remain. \u201cI \u2018m devilish glad she writes,\u201d said Captain Lovelock; \u201csome girls do write, you know.\u201d Blanche found Lausanne most horrid after Baden, for whose delights she languished. The delights of Baden, however, were not obvious just now to her correspondent, who had taken Bernard\u2019s fifty pounds into the Kursaal and left them there. Bernard, on learning his misfortune, lent him another fifty, with which he performed a second series of unsuccessful experiments; and our hero was not at his ease until he had passed over to his luckless friend the whole amount of his own winnings, every penny of which found its way through Captain Lovelock\u2019s fingers back into the bank. When this operation was completed, Bernard left Baden, the Captain gloomily accompanying him to the station."}, {"size": 648, "text": "I have said that there had come over Bernard a singular sense of freedom. One of the uses he made of his freedom was to undertake a long journey. He went to the East and remained absent from Europe for upward of two years--a period of his life of which it is not proposed to offer a complete history. The East is a wonderful region, and Bernard, investigating the mysteries of Asia, saw a great many curious and beautiful things. He had moments of keen enjoyment; he laid up a great store of impressions and even a considerable sum of knowledge. But, nevertheless, he was not destined to look back upon this episode with any particular complacency."}, {"size": 758, "text": "It was less delightful than it was supposed to be; it was less successful than it might have been. By what unnatural element the cup of pleasure was adulterated, he would have been very much at a loss to say; but it was an incontestable fact that at times he sipped it as a medicine, rather than quaffed it as a nectar. When people congratulated him on his opportunity of seeing the world, and said they envied him the privilege of seeing it so well, he felt even more than the usual degree of irritation produced by an insinuation that fortune thinks so poorly of us as to give us easy terms. Misplaced sympathy is the least available of superfluities, and Bernard at this time found himself thinking that there was a good deal of impertinence in the world."}, {"size": 631, "text": "He would, however, readily have confessed that, in so far as he failed to enjoy his Oriental wanderings, the fault was his own; though he would have made mentally the gratifying reflection that never was a fault less deliberate. If, during the period of which I speak, his natural gayety had sunk to a minor key, a partial explanation may be found in the fact that he was deprived of the society of his late companion. It was an odd circumstance that the two young men had not met since Gordon\u2019s abrupt departure from Baden. Gordon went to Berlin, and shortly afterward to America, so that they were on opposite sides of the globe."}, {"size": 635, "text": "Before he returned to his own country, Bernard made by letter two or three offers to join him in Europe, anywhere that was agreeable to him. Gordon answered that his movements were very uncertain, and that he should be sorry to trouble Bernard to follow him about. He had put him to this inconvenience in making him travel from Venice to Baden, and one such favor at a time was enough to ask, even of the most obliging of men. Bernard was, of course, afraid that what he had told Gordon about Angela Vivian was really the cause of a state of things which, as between two such good friends, wore a perceptible resemblance to alienation."}, {"size": 730, "text": "Gordon had given her up; but he bore Bernard a grudge for speaking ill of her, and so long as this disagreeable impression should last, he preferred not to see him. Bernard was frank enough to charge the poor fellow with a lingering rancor, of which he made, indeed, no great crime. But Gordon denied the allegation, and assured him that, to his own perception, there was no decline in their intimacy. He only requested, as a favor and as a tribute to \u201cjust susceptibilities,\u201d that Bernard would allude no more either to Miss Vivian or to what had happened at Baden. This request was easy to comply with, and Bernard, in writing, strictly conformed to it; but it seemed to him that the act of doing so was in itself a cooling-off."}, {"size": 707, "text": "What would be a better proof of what is called a \u201ctension\u201d than an agreement to avoid a natural topic? Bernard moralized a little over Gordon\u2019s \u201cjust susceptibilities,\u201d and felt that the existence of a perverse resentment in so honest a nature was a fact gained to his acquaintance with psychological science. It cannot be said, however, that he suffered this fact to occupy at all times the foreground of his consciousness. Bernard was like some great painters; his foregrounds were very happily arranged. He heard nothing of Mrs. Vivian and her daughter, beyond a rumor that they had gone to Italy; and he learned, on apparently good authority, that Blanche Evers had returned to New York with her mother."}, {"size": 644, "text": "He wondered whether Captain Lovelock was still in pawn at the Hotel de Hollande. If he did not allow himself to wonder too curiously whether he had done a harm to Gordon, it may be affirmed that he was haunted by the recurrence of that other question, of which mention has already been made. Had he done a harm to Angela Vivian, and did she know that he had done it? This inquiry by no means made him miserable, and it was far from awaiting him regularly on his pillow. But it visited him at intervals, and sometimes in the strangest places--suddenly, abruptly, in the stillness of an Indian temple, or amid the shrillness of an Oriental crowd."}, {"size": 806, "text": "He became familiar with it at last; he called it his Jack-in-the-box. Some invisible touch of circumstance would press the spring, and the little image would pop up, staring him in the face and grinning an interrogation. Bernard always clapped down the lid, for he regarded this phenomenon as strikingly inane. But if it was more frequent than any pang of conscience connected with the remembrance of Gordon himself, this last sentiment was certainly lively enough to make it a great relief to hear at last a rumor that the excellent fellow was about to be married. The rumor reached him at Athens; it was vague and indirect, and it omitted the name of his betrothed. But Bernard made the most of it, and took comfort in the thought that his friend had recovered his spirits and his appetite for matrimony."}, {"size": 668, "text": "It was not till our hero reached Paris, on his return from the distant East, that the rumor I have just mentioned acquired an appreciable consistency. Here, indeed, it took the shape of authentic information. Among a number of delayed letters which had been awaiting him at his banker\u2019s he found a communication from Gordon Wright. During the previous year or two his correspondence with this trusted--and trusting--friend had not been frequent, and Bernard had received little direct news of him. Three or four short letters had overtaken him in his wanderings--letters as cordial, to all appearance, if not as voluminous, as the punctual missives of an earlier time."}, {"size": 893, "text": "Bernard made a point of satisfying himself that they were as cordial; he weighed them in the scales of impartial suspicion. It seemed to him on the whole that there was no relaxation of Gordon\u2019s epistolary tone. If he wrote less often than he used to do, that was a thing that very commonly happened as men grew older. The closest intimacies, moreover, had phases and seasons, intermissions and revivals, and even if his friend had, in fact, averted his countenance from him, this was simply the accomplishment of a periodical revolution which would bring them in due order face to face again. Bernard made a point, himself, of writing tolerably often and writing always in the friendliest tone. He made it a matter of conscience--he liked to feel that he was treating Gordon generously, and not demanding an eye for an eye. The letter he found in Paris was so short that I may give it entire."}, {"size": 621, "text": "\u201cMy dear Bernard (it ran), I must write to you before I write to any one else, though unfortunately you are so far away that you can\u2019t be the first to congratulate me.

I have altogether got over that, and I don\u2019t know how I ever came to talk such nonsense. I am fascinated now, and I assure you I like it!

She was much younger then, and she has greatly developed and improved in these two or three years. But she will always be young and innocent--I don\u2019t want her to improve too much. She came back to America with her mother the winter after we met her at Baden, but I never saw her again till three months ago.

The first effect of the letter I have just quoted had been an immense surprise; the second had been a series of reflections which were quite the negative of surprise; and these operations of Bernard\u2019s mind had finally merged themselves in a simple sentiment of jollity. He was delighted that Gordon should be married; he felt jovial about it; he was almost indifferent to the question of whom he had chosen. Certainly, at first, the choice of Blanche Evers seemed highly incongruous; it was difficult to imagine a young woman less shaped to minister to Gordon\u2019s strenuous needs"}, {"size": 624, "text": "than the light-hearted and empty-headed little flirt whose inconsequent prattle had remained for Bernard one of the least importunate memories of a charming time. Blanche Evers was a pretty little goose--the prettiest of little geese, perhaps, and doubtless the most amiable; but she was not a companion for a peculiarly serious man, who would like his wife to share his view of human responsibilities. What a singular selection--what a queer infatuation! Bernard had no sooner committed himself to this line of criticism than he stopped short, with the sudden consciousness of error carried almost to the point of naivetae."}, {"size": 629, "text": "He exclaimed that Blanche Evers was exactly the sort of girl that men of Gordon Wright\u2019s stamp always ended by falling in love with, and that poor Gordon knew very much better what he was about in this case than he had done in trying to solve the deep problem of a comfortable life with Angela Vivian. This was what your strong, solid, sensible fellows always came to; they paid, in this particular, a larger tribute to pure fancy than the people who were supposed habitually to cultivate that muse. Blanche Evers was what the French call an article of fantasy, and Gordon had taken a pleasure in finding her deliciously useless."}, {"size": 677, "text": "He cultivated utility in other ways, and it pleased and flattered him to feel that he could afford, morally speaking, to have a kittenish wife. He had within himself a fund of common sense to draw upon, so that to espouse a paragon of wisdom would be but to carry water to the fountain. He could easily make up for the deficiencies of a wife who was a little silly, and if she charmed and amused him, he could treat himself to the luxury of these sensations for themselves. He was not in the least afraid of being ruined by it, and if Blanche\u2019s birdlike chatter and turns of the head had made a fool of him, he knew it perfectly well, and simply took his stand upon his rights."}, {"size": 612, "text": "Every man has a right to a little flower-bed, and life is not all mere kitchen-gardening. Bernard rapidly extemporized this rough explanation of the surprise his friend had offered him, and he found it all-sufficient for his immediate needs. He wrote Blanche a charming note, to which she replied with a great deal of spirit and grace. Her little letter was very prettily turned, and Bernard, reading it over two or three times, said to himself that, to do her justice, she might very well have polished her intellect a trifle during these two or three years. As she was older, she could hardly help being wiser."}, {"size": 886, "text": "It even occurred to Bernard that she might have profited by the sort of experience that is known as the discipline of suffering. What had become of Captain Lovelock and that tender passion which was apparently none the less genuine for having been expressed in the slang of a humorous period? Had they been permanently separated by judicious guardians, and had she been obliged to obliterate his image from her lightly-beating little heart? Bernard had felt sure at Baden that, beneath her contemptuous airs and that impertinent consciousness of the difficulties of conquest by which a pretty American girl attests her allegiance to a civilization in which young women occupy the highest place--he had felt sure that Blanche had a high appreciation of her handsome Englishman, and that if Lovelock should continue to relish her charms, he might count upon the advantages of reciprocity."}, {"size": 611, "text": "But it occurred to Bernard that Captain Lovelock had perhaps been faithless; that, at least, the discourtesy of chance and the inhumanity of an elder brother might have kept him an eternal prisoner at the Hotel de Hollande (where, for all Bernard knew to the contrary, he had been obliged to work out his destiny in the arduous character of a polyglot waiter); so that the poor young girl, casting backward glances along the path of Mrs. Vivian\u2019s retreat, and failing to detect the onward rush of a rescuing cavalier, had perforce believed herself forsaken, and had been obliged to summon philosophy to her aid."}, {"size": 882, "text": "It was very possible that her philosophic studies had taught her the art of reflection; and that, as she would have said herself, she was tremendously toned down. Once, at Baden, when Gordon Wright happened to take upon himself to remark that little Miss Evers was bored by her English gallant, Bernard had ventured to observe, in petto, that Gordon knew nothing about it. But all this was of no consequence now, and Bernard steered further and further away from the liability to detect fallacies in his friend. Gordon had engaged himself to marry, and our critical hero had not a grain of fault to find with this resolution. It was a capital thing; it was just what he wanted; it would do him a world of good. Bernard rejoiced with him sincerely, and regretted extremely that a series of solemn engagements to pay visits in England should prevent his being present at the nuptials."}, {"size": 607, "text": "They were well over, as I have said, when he reached New York. The honeymoon had waned, and the business of married life had begun. Bernard, at the end, had sailed from England rather abruptly. A friend who had a remarkably good cabin on one of the steamers was obliged by a sudden detention to give it up, and on his offering it to Longueville, the latter availed himself gratefully of this opportunity of being a little less discomposed than usual by the Atlantic billows. He therefore embarked at two days\u2019 notice, a fortnight earlier than he had intended and than he had written to Gordon to expect him."}, {"size": 671, "text": "Gordon, of course, had written that he was to seek no hospitality but that which Blanche was now prepared--they had a charming house--so graciously to dispense; but Bernard, nevertheless, leaving the ship early in the morning, had betaken himself to an hotel. He wished not to anticipate his welcome, and he determined to report himself to Gordon first and to come back with his luggage later in the day. After purifying himself of his sea-stains, he left his hotel and walked up the Fifth Avenue with all a newly-landed voyager\u2019s enjoyment of terrestrial locomotion. It was a charming autumn day; there was a golden haze in the air; he supposed it was the Indian summer."}, {"size": 666, "text": "The broad sidewalk of the Fifth Avenue was scattered over with dry leaves--crimson and orange and amber. He tossed them with his stick as he passed; they rustled and murmured with the motion, and it reminded him of the way he used to kick them in front of him over these same pavements in his riotous infancy. It was a pleasure, after many wanderings, to find himself in his native land again, and Bernard Longueville, as he went, paid his compliments to his mother-city. The brightness and gayety of the place seemed a greeting to a returning son, and he felt a throb of affection for the freshest, the youngest, the easiest and most good-natured of great capitals."}, {"size": 679, "text": "On presenting himself at Gordon\u2019s door, Bernard was told that the master of the house was not at home; he went in, however, to see the mistress.

Bernard had thought it possible she had \u201cimproved,\u201d and she was certainly prettier than ever. He instantly perceived that she was still a chatterbox; it remained to be seen whether the quality of her discourse were finer. \u201cWell, Mr. Longueville,\u201d she exclaimed, \u201cwhere in the world did you drop from, and how long did it take you to cross the Atlantic?"}, {"size": 727, "text": "Three days, eh?

Bernard, on his side, was greatly pleased; it was delightful to him to look into Gordon\u2019s honest face again and to return his manly grasp.

He saw that Gordon looked well and happy, but that he looked older, too, and more serious, more marked by life. He looked as if something had happened to him--as, in fact, something had. Bernard saw a latent spark in his friend\u2019s eye that seemed to question his own for an impression of Blanche--to question it eagerly, and yet to deprecate judgment. He saw, too--with the fact made more vivid by Gordon\u2019s standing there beside her in his manly sincerity and throwing it into contrast--that Blanche was the same little posturing coquette of a Blanche whom, at Baden, he would have treated it as a broad joke that Gordon Wright should dream of marrying."}, {"size": 755, "text": "He saw, in a word, that it was what it had first struck him as being--an incongruous union.

He asked himself indeed at times whether Blanche were really so silly as she seemed; he doubted whether any woman could be so silly as Blanche seemed.

But why should she keep them out of sight, and what were the ends that she proposed to serve by this uncomfortable perversity? Bernard wondered whether she were fond of her husband, and he heard it intimated by several good people in New York who had had some observation of the courtship, that she had married him for his money."}, {"size": 774, "text": "He was very sorry to find that this was taken for granted, and he determined, on the whole, not to believe it. He was disgusted with the idea of such a want of gratitude; for, if Gordon Wright had loved Miss Evers for herself, the young lady might certainly have discovered the intrinsic value of so disinterested a suitor. Her mother had the credit of having made the match. Gordon was known to be looking for a wife; Mrs. Evers had put her little feather-head of a daughter very much forward, and Gordon was as easily captivated as a child by the sound of a rattle.

It was impossible to go to more parties, to give better dinners, to have fewer privations or annoyances.

Some people say that if you are very fond of a person you always think them handsome; but I don\u2019t agree with that at all.

The hospitality of New York was profuse; the charm of its daughters extreme; the radiance of its skies superb. Bernard was the restless and professionless mortal that we know, wandering in life from one vague experiment to another, constantly gratified and never satisfied, to whom no imperious finality had as yet presented itself; and, nevertheless, for a time he contrived to limit his horizon to the passing hour, and to make a good many hours pass in the drawing-room of a demonstrative flirt."}, {"size": 702, "text": "For Mrs. Gordon was a flirt; that had become tolerably obvious.

Blanche flirted, in fact, more or less with all men, but her opportunity for playing her harmless batteries upon Bernard were of course exceptionally large.

He had no plans nor intentions; he had not even any very definite desires. He had felt the impulse to come back to Europe, and he had obeyed it; but now that he had arrived, his impulse seemed to have little more to say to him.

The weather was very hot, and neither the hotel nor the town at large appeared to form an attractive sejour for persons of an irritable nostril."}, {"size": 852, "text": "To go to Paris, however, was hardly more attractive than to remain at Havre, for Bernard had a lively vision of the heated bitumen and the glaring frontages of the French capital. But if a Norman town was close and dull, the Norman country was notoriously fresh and entertaining, and the next morning Bernard got into a caleche, with his luggage, and bade its proprietor drive him along the coast. Once he had begun to rumble through this charming landscape, he was in much better humor with his situation; the air was freshened by a breeze from the sea; the blooming country, without walls or fences, lay open to the traveller\u2019s eye; the grain-fields and copses were shimmering in the summer wind; the pink-faced cottages peeped through the ripening orchard-boughs, and the gray towers of the old churches were silvered by the morning-light of France."}, {"size": 711, "text": "At the end of some three hours, Bernard arrived at a little watering-place which lay close upon the shore, in the embrace of a pair of white-armed cliffs. It had a quaint and primitive aspect and a natural picturesqueness which commended it to Bernard\u2019s taste. There was evidently a great deal of nature about it, and at this moment, nature, embodied in the clear, gay sunshine, in the blue and quiet sea, in the daisied grass of the high-shouldered downs, had an air of inviting the intelligent observer to postpone his difficulties. Blanquais-les-Galets, as Bernard learned the name of this unfashionable resort to be, was twenty miles from a railway, and the place wore an expression of unaffected rusticity."}, {"size": 613, "text": "Bernard stopped at an inn for his noonday breakfast, and then, with his appreciation quickened by the homely felicity of this repast, determined to go no further. He engaged a room at the inn, dismissed his vehicle, and gave himself up to the contemplation of French sea-side manners. These were chiefly to be observed upon a pebbly strand which lay along the front of the village and served as the gathering-point of its idler inhabitants. Bathing in the sea was the chief occupation of these good people, including, as it did, prolonged spectatorship of the process and infinite conversation upon its mysteries."}, {"size": 631, "text": "The little world of Blanquais appeared to form a large family party, of highly developed amphibious habits, which sat gossiping all day upon the warm pebbles, occasionally dipping into the sea and drying itself in the sun, without any relaxation of personal intimacy. All this was very amusing to Bernard, who in the course of the day took a bath with the rest. The ocean was, after all, very large, and when one took one\u2019s plunge one seemed to have it quite to one\u2019s self. When he had dressed himself again, Bernard stretched himself on the beach, feeling happier than he had done in a long time, and pulled his hat over his eyes."}, {"size": 673, "text": "The feeling of happiness was an odd one; it had come over him suddenly, without visible cause; but, such as it was, our hero made the most of it. As he lay there it seemed to deepen; his immersion and his exercise in the salt water had given him an agreeable languor. This presently became a drowsiness which was not less agreeable, and Bernard felt himself going to sleep. There were sounds in the air above his head--sounds of the crunching and rattling of the loose, smooth stones as his neighbors moved about on them; of high-pitched French voices exchanging colloquial cries; of the plash of the bathers in the distant water, and the short, soft breaking of the waves."}, {"size": 620, "text": "But these things came to his ears more vaguely and remotely, and at last they faded away. Bernard enjoyed half an hour of that light and easy slumber which is apt to overtake idle people in recumbent attitudes in the open air on August afternoons. It brought with it an exquisite sense of rest, and the rest was not spoiled by the fact that it was animated by a charming dream. Dreams are vague things, and this one had the defects of its species; but it was somehow concerned with the image of a young lady whom Bernard had formerly known, and who had beautiful eyes, into which--in the dream--he found himself looking."}, {"size": 677, "text": "He waked up to find himself looking into the crown of his hat, which had been resting on the bridge of his nose. He removed it, and half raised himself, resting on his elbow and preparing to taste, in another position, of a little more of that exquisite rest of which mention has just been made. The world about him was still amusing and charming; the chatter of his companions, losing itself in the large sea-presence, the plash of the divers and swimmers, the deep blue of the ocean and the silvery white of the cliff, had that striking air of indifference to the fact that his mind had been absent from them which we are apt to find in mundane things on emerging from a nap."}, {"size": 639, "text": "The same people were sitting near him on the beach--the same, and yet not quite the same. He found himself noticing a person whom he had not noticed before--a young lady, who was seated in a low portable chair, some dozen yards off, with her eyes bent upon a book. Her head was in shade; her large parasol made, indeed, an awning for her whole person, which in this way, in the quiet attitude of perusal, seemed to abstract itself from the glare and murmur of the beach. The clear shadow of her umbrella--it was lined with blue--was deep upon her face; but it was not deep enough to prevent Bernard from recognizing a profile that he knew."}, {"size": 622, "text": "He suddenly sat upright, with an intensely quickened vision. Was he dreaming still, or had he waked? In a moment he felt that he was acutely awake; he heard her, across the interval, turn the page of her book. For a single instant, as she did so, she looked with level brows at the glittering ocean; then, lowering her eyes, she went on with her reading. In this barely perceptible movement he saw Angela Vivian; it was wonderful how well he remembered her. She was evidently reading very seriously; she was much interested in her book. She was alone; Bernard looked about for her mother, but Mrs. Vivian was not in sight."}, {"size": 613, "text": "By this time Bernard had become aware that he was agitated; the exquisite rest of a few moments before had passed away. His agitation struck him as unreasonable; in a few minutes he made up his mind that it was absurd. He had done her an injury--yes; but as she sat there losing herself in a French novel--Bernard could see it was a French novel--he could not make out that she was the worse for it. It had not affected her appearance; Miss Vivian was still a handsome girl. Bernard hoped she would not look toward him or recognize him; he wished to look at her at his ease; to think it over; to make up his mind."}, {"size": 720, "text": "The idea of meeting Angela Vivian again had often come into his thoughts; I may, indeed, say that it was a tolerably familiar presence there; but the fact, nevertheless, now presented itself with all the violence of an accident for which he was totally unprepared. He had often asked himself what he should say to her, how he should carry himself, and how he should probably find the young lady; but, with whatever ingenuity he might at the moment have answered these questions, his intelligence at present felt decidedly overtaxed. She was a very pretty girl to whom he had done a wrong; this was the final attitude into which, with a good deal of preliminary shifting and wavering, she had settled in his recollection."}, {"size": 625, "text": "The wrong was a right, doubtless, from certain points of view; but from the girl\u2019s own it could only seem an injury to which its having been inflicted by a clever young man with whom she had been on agreeable terms, necessarily added a touch of baseness. In every disadvantage that a woman suffers at the hands of a man, there is inevitably, in what concerns the man, an element of cowardice. When I say \u201cinevitably,\u201d I mean that this is what the woman sees in it. This is what Bernard believed that Angela Vivian saw in the fact that by giving his friend a bad account of her he had prevented her making an opulent marriage."}, {"size": 759, "text": "At first he had said to himself that, whether he had held his tongue or spoken, she had already lost her chance; but with time, somehow, this reflection had lost its weight in the scale. It conveyed little re-assurance to his irritated conscience--it had become imponderable and impertinent. At the moment of which I speak it entirely failed to present itself, even for form\u2019s sake; and as he sat looking at this superior creature who came back to him out of an episode of his past, he thought of her simply as an unprotected woman toward whom he had been indelicate. It is not an agreeable thing for a delicate man like Bernard Longueville to have to accommodate himself to such an accident, but this is nevertheless what it seemed needful that he should do."}, {"size": 717, "text": "If she bore him a grudge he must think it natural; if she had vowed him a hatred he must allow her the comfort of it. He had done the only thing possible, but that made it no better for her. He had wronged her. The circumstances mattered nothing, and as he could not make it up to her, the only reasonable thing was to keep out of her way. He had stepped into her path now, and the proper thing was to step out of it. If it could give her no pleasure to see him again, it could certainly do him no good to see her. He had seen her by this time pretty well--as far as mere seeing went, and as yet, apparently, he was none the worse for that; but his hope that he should himself escape unperceived had now become acute."}, {"size": 606, "text": "It is singular that this hope should not have led him instantly to turn his back and move away; but the explanation of his imprudent delay is simply that he wished to see a little more of Miss Vivian. He was unable to bring himself to the point. Those clever things that he might have said to her quite faded away. The only good taste was to take himself off, and spare her the trouble of inventing civilities that she could not feel. And yet he continued to sit there from moment to moment, arrested, detained, fascinated, by the accident of her not looking round--of her having let him watch her so long."}, {"size": 673, "text": "She turned another page, and another, and her reading absorbed her still. He was so near her that he could have touched her dress with the point of his umbrella. At last she raised her eyes and rested them a while on the blue horizon, straight in front of her, but as yet without turning them aside. This, however, augmented the danger of her doing so, and Bernard, with a good deal of an effort, rose to his feet. The effort, doubtless, kept the movement from being either as light or as swift as it might have been, and it vaguely attracted his neighbor\u2019s attention. She turned her head and glanced at him, with a glance that evidently expected but to touch him and pass."}, {"size": 698, "text": "It touched him, and it was on the point of passing; then it suddenly checked itself; she had recognized him. She looked at him, straight and open-eyed, out of the shadow of her parasol, and Bernard stood there--motionless now--receiving her gaze. How long it lasted need not be narrated. It was probably a matter of a few seconds, but to Bernard it seemed a little eternity. He met her eyes, he looked straight into her face; now that she had seen him he could do nothing else. Bernard\u2019s little eternity, however, came to an end; Miss Vivian dropped her eyes upon her book again. She let them rest upon it only a moment; then she closed it and slowly rose from her chair, turning away from Bernard."}, {"size": 699, "text": "He still stood looking at her--stupidly, foolishly, helplessly enough, as it seemed to him; no sign of recognition had been exchanged. Angela Vivian hesitated a minute; she now had her back turned to him, and he fancied her light, flexible figure was agitated by her indecision. She looked along the sunny beach which stretched its shallow curve to where the little bay ended and the white wall of the cliffs began. She looked down toward the sea, and up toward the little Casino which was perched on a low embankment, communicating with the beach at two or three points by a short flight of steps. Bernard saw--or supposed he saw--that she was asking herself whither she had best turn to avoid him."}, {"size": 674, "text": "He had not blushed when she looked at him--he had rather turned a little pale; but he blushed now, for it really seemed odious to have literally driven the poor girl to bay. Miss Vivian decided to take refuge in the Casino, and she passed along one of the little pathways of planks that were laid here and there across the beach, and directed herself to the nearest flight of steps. Before she had gone two paces a complete change came over Bernard\u2019s feeling; his only wish now was to speak to her--to explain--to tell her he would go away. There was another row of steps at a short distance behind him; he rapidly ascended them and reached the little terrace of the Casino."}, {"size": 722, "text": "Miss Vivian stood there; she was apparently hesitating again which way to turn. Bernard came straight up to her, with a gallant smile and a greeting. The comparison is a coarse one, but he felt that he was taking the bull by the horns. Angela Vivian stood watching him arrive. \u201cYou did n\u2019t recognize me,\u201d he said, \u201cand your not recognizing me made me--made me hesitate.\u201d For a moment she said nothing, and then-- \u201cYou are more timid than you used to be!\u201d she answered. He could hardly have said what expression he had expected to find in her face; his apprehension had, perhaps, not painted her obtrusively pale and haughty, aggressively cold and stern; but it had figured something different from the look he encountered."}, {"size": 659, "text": "Miss Vivian was simply blushing--that was what Bernard mainly perceived; he saw that her surprise had been extreme--complete. Her blush was re-assuring; it contradicted the idea of impatient resentment, and Bernard took some satisfaction in noting that it was prolonged. \u201cYes, I am more timid than I used to be,\u201d he said. In spite of her blush, she continued to look at him very directly; but she had always done that--she always met one\u2019s eye; and Bernard now instantly found all the beauty that he had ever found before in her pure, unevasive glance. \u201cI don\u2019t know whether I am more brave,\u201d she said; \u201cbut I must tell the truth--I instantly recognized you.\u201d"}, {"size": 610, "text": "\u201cI supposed I gave a striking one--in getting up and going away.\u201d \u201cAh!\u201d said Bernard, \u201cas I say, I am more timid than I was, and I did n\u2019t venture to interpret that as a sign of recognition.\u201d \u201cIt was a sign of surprise.\u201d \u201cNot of pleasure!\u201d said Bernard. He felt this to be a venturesome, and from the point of view of taste perhaps a reprehensible, remark; but he made it because he was now feeling his ground, and it seemed better to make it gravely than with assumed jocosity. \u201cGreat surprises are to me never pleasures,\u201d Angela answered; \u201cI am not fond of shocks of any kind. The pleasure is another matter."}, {"size": 741, "text": "I have not yet got over my surprise.\u201d \u201cIf I had known you were here, I would have written to you beforehand,\u201d said Bernard, laughing. Miss Vivian, beneath her expanded parasol, gave a little shrug of her shoulders. \u201cEven that would have been a surprise.\u201d \u201cYou mean a shock, eh? Did you suppose I was dead?\u201d Now, at last, she lowered her eyes, and her blush slowly died away. \u201cI knew nothing about it.\u201d \u201cOf course you could n\u2019t know, and we are all mortal. It was natural that you should n\u2019t expect--simply on turning your head--to find me lying on the pebbles at Blanquais-les-Galets. You were a great surprise to me, as well; but I differ from you--I like surprises.\u201d \u201cIt is rather refreshing to hear that one is a surprise,\u201d said the girl."}, {"size": 611, "text": "\u201cEspecially when in that capacity one is liked!\u201d Bernard exclaimed. \u201cI don\u2019t say that--because such sensations pass away. I am now beginning to get over mine.\u201d The light mockery of her tone struck him as the echo of an unforgotten air. He looked at her a moment, and then he said-- \u201cYou are not changed; I find you quite the same.\u201d \u201cI am sorry for that!\u201d And she turned away. \u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d he asked. \u201cWhere are you going?\u201d She looked about her, without answering, up and down the little terrace. The Casino at Blanquais was a much more modest place of reunion than the Conversation-house at Baden-Baden."}, {"size": 804, "text": "It was a small, low structure of brightly painted wood, containing but three or four rooms, and furnished all along its front with a narrow covered gallery, which offered a delusive shelter from the rougher moods of the fine, fresh weather. It was somewhat rude and shabby--the subscription for the season was low--but it had a simple picturesqueness. Its little terrace was a very convenient place for a stroll, and the great view of the ocean and of the marble-white crags that formed the broad gate-way of the shallow bay, was a sufficient compensation for the absence of luxuries. There were a few people sitting in the gallery, and a few others scattered upon the terrace; but the pleasure-seekers of Blanquais were, for the most part, immersed in the salt water or disseminated on the grassy downs."}, {"size": 511, "text": "\u201cI am looking for my mother,\u201d said Angela Vivian. \u201cI hope your mother is well.\u201d \u201cVery well, thank you.\u201d \u201cMay I help you to look for her?\u201d Bernard asked. Her eyes paused in their quest, and rested a moment upon her companion. \u201cShe is not here,\u201d she said presently. \u201cShe has gone home.\u201d \u201cWhat do you call home?\u201d Bernard demanded. \u201cThe sort of place that we always call home; a bad little house that we have taken for a month.\u201d \u201cWill you let me come and see it?\u201d \u201cIt \u2018s nothing to see.\u201d Bernard hesitated a moment."}, {"size": 627, "text": "\u201cI should never think of giving it so fine a name.\u201d \u201cThere would be nothing fine in forbidding me your door. Don\u2019t think that!\u201d said Bernard, with rather a forced laugh. It was difficult to know what the girl thought; but she said, in a moment-- \u201cWe shall be very happy to see you. I am going home.\u201d \u201cMay I walk with you so far?\u201d asked Bernard. \u201cIt is not far; it \u2018s only three minutes.\u201d And Angela moved slowly to the gate of the Casino.Bernard walked beside her, and for some moments nothing was said between them. As the silence continued, he became aware of it, and it vexed him that she should leave certain things unsaid."}, {"size": 688, "text": "She had asked him no question--neither whence he had come, nor how long he would stay, nor what had happened to him since they parted. He wished to see whether this was intention or accident. He was already complaining to himself that she expressed no interest in him, and he was perfectly aware that this was a ridiculous feeling. He had come to speak to her in order to tell her that he was going away, and yet, at the end of five minutes, he had asked leave to come and see her. This sudden gyration of mind was grotesque, and Bernard knew it; but, nevertheless, he had an immense expectation that, if he should give her time, she would manifest some curiosity as to his own situation."}, {"size": 754, "text": "He tried to give her time; he held his tongue; but she continued to say nothing. They passed along a sort of winding lane, where two or three fishermen\u2019s cottages, with old brown nets suspended on the walls and drying in the sun, stood open to the road, on the other side of which was a patch of salt-looking grass, browsed by a donkey that was not fastidious. \u201cIt \u2018s so long since we parted, and we have so much to say to each other!\u201d Bernard exclaimed at last, and he accompanied this declaration with a laugh much more spontaneous than the one he had given a few moments before. It might have gratified him, however, to observe that his companion appeared to see no ground for joking in the idea that they should have a good deal to say to each other."}, {"size": 778, "text": "\u201cYes, it \u2018s a long time since we spent those pleasant weeks at Baden,\u201d she rejoined. \u201cHave you been there again?\u201d This was a question, and though it was a very simple one, Bernard was charmed with it. \u201cI would n\u2019t go back for the world!\u201d he said. \u201cAnd you?\u201d \u201cWould I go back? Oh yes; I thought it so agreeable.\u201d With this he was less pleased; he had expected the traces of resentment, and he was actually disappointed at not finding them. But here was the little house of which his companion had spoken, and it seemed, indeed, a rather bad one. That is, it was one of those diminutive structures which are known at French watering-places as \u201cchalets,\u201d and, with an exiguity of furniture, are let for the season to families that pride themselves upon their powers of contraction."}, {"size": 604, "text": "This one was a very humble specimen of its class, though it was doubtless a not inadequate abode for two quiet and frugal women.

The little door stood wide open. \u201cThis is where we live,\u201d said Angela; and she stopped and laid her hand upon the little garden-gate. \u201cIt \u2018s very fair,\u201d said Bernard. \u201cI think it \u2018s better than the pastry-cook\u2019s at Baden.\u201d They stood there, and she looked over the gate at the geraniums."}, {"size": 826, "text": "She did not ask him to come in; but, on the other hand, keeping the gate closed, she made no movement to leave him. The Casino was now quite out of sight, and the whole place was perfectly still. Suddenly, turning her eyes upon Bernard with a certain strange inconsequence-- \u201cI have not seen you here before,\u201d she observed. He gave a little laugh. \u201cI suppose it \u2018s because I only arrived this morning. I think that if I had been here you would have noticed me.\u201d \u201cYou arrived this morning?\u201d \u201cThree or four hours ago. So, if the remark were not in questionable taste, I should say we had not lost time.\u201d \u201cYou may say what you please,\u201d said Angela, simply. \u201cWhere did you come from?\u201d Interrogation, now it had come, was most satisfactory, and Bernard was glad to believe that there was an element of the unexpected in his answer."}, {"size": 637, "text": "\u201cYou came straight from California to this place?\u201d \u201cI arrived at Havre only yesterday.\u201d \u201cAnd why did you come here?\u201d \u201cIt would be graceful of me to be able to answer--\u2018Because I knew you were here.\u2019 But unfortunately I did not know it. It was a mere chance; or rather, I feel like saying it was an inspiration.\u201d Angela looked at the geraniums again. \u201cIt was very singular,\u201d she said. \u201cWe might have been in so many places besides this one.

But she might have heard from you.\u201d \u201cShe does n\u2019t hear from us. My mother used to write to her for a while after she left Europe, but she has given it up.\u201d She paused a moment, and then she added--\u201cBlanche is too silly!\u201d Bernard noted this, wondering how it bore upon his theory of a spiteful element in his companion. Of course Blanche was silly; but, equally of course, this young lady\u2019s perception of it was quickened by Blanche\u2019s having married a rich man whom she herself might have married."}, {"size": 900, "text": "\u201cGordon does n\u2019t think so,\u201d Bernard said.

And then she moved the latch of the gate and passed in. At the same moment her mother appeared in the open door-way. Mrs. Vivian had apparently been summoned by the sound of her daughter\u2019s colloquy with an unrecognized voice, and when she saw Bernard she gave a sharp little cry of surprise. Then she stood gazing at him. Since the dispersion of the little party at Baden-Baden he had not devoted much meditation to this conscientious gentlewoman who had been so tenderly anxious to establish her daughter properly in life; but there had been in his mind a tacit assumption that if Angela deemed that he had played her a trick Mrs."}, {"size": 692, "text": "Vivian\u2019s view of his conduct was not more charitable. He felt that he must have seemed to her very unkind, and that in so far as a well-regulated conscience permitted the exercise of unpractical passions, she honored him with a superior detestation. The instant he beheld her on her threshold this conviction rose to the surface of his consciousness and made him feel that now, at least, his hour had come. \u201cIt is Mr. Longueville, whom we met at Baden,\u201d said Angela to her mother, gravely. Mrs. Vivian began to smile, and stepped down quickly toward the gate. \u201cAh, Mr. Longueville,\u201d she murmured, \u201cit \u2018s so long--it \u2018s so pleasant--it \u2018s so strange--\u201d And suddenly she stopped, still smiling."}, {"size": 858, "text": "Her smile had an odd intensity; she was trembling a little, and Bernard, who was prepared for hissing scorn, perceived with a deep, an almost violent, surprise, a touching agitation, an eager friendliness. \u201cYes, it \u2018s very long,\u201d he said; \u201cit \u2018s very pleasant. I have only just arrived; I met Miss Vivian.\u201d \u201cAnd you are not coming in?\u201d asked Angela\u2019s mother, very graciously. \u201cYour daughter has not asked me!\u201d said Bernard. \u201cAh, my dearest,\u201d murmured Mrs. Vivian, looking at the girl. Her daughter returned her glance, and then the elder lady paused again, and simply began to smile at Bernard, who recognized in her glance that queer little intimation--shy and cautious, yet perfectly discernible--of a desire to have a private understanding with what he felt that she mentally termed his better nature, which he had more than once perceived at Baden-Baden."}, {"size": 723, "text": "\u201cAh no, she has not asked me,\u201d Bernard repeated, laughing gently. Then Angela turned her eyes upon him, and the expression of those fine organs was strikingly agreeable. It had, moreover, the merit of being easily interpreted; it said very plainly, \u201cPlease don\u2019t insist, but leave me alone.\u201d And it said it not at all sharply--very gently and pleadingly. Bernard found himself understanding it so well that he literally blushed with intelligence. \u201cDon\u2019t you come to the Casino in the evening, as you used to come to the Kursaal?\u201d he asked. Mrs. Vivian looked again at her daughter, who had passed into the door-way of the cottage; then she said-- \u201cWe will go this evening.\u201d \u201cI shall look for you eagerly,\u201d Bernard rejoined."}, {"size": 639, "text": "\u201cAuf wiedersehen, as we used to say at Baden!\u201d Mrs. Vivian waved him a response over the gate, her daughter gave him a glance from the threshold, and he took his way back to his inn. He awaited the evening with great impatience; he fancied he had made a discovery, and he wished to confirm it. The discovery was that his idea that she bore him a grudge, that she was conscious of an injury, that he was associated in her mind with a wrong, had all been a morbid illusion. She had forgiven, she had forgotten, she did n\u2019t care, she had possibly never cared! This, at least, was his theory now, and he longed for a little more light upon it."}, {"size": 682, "text": "His old sense of her being a complex and intricate girl had, in that quarter of an hour of talk with her, again become lively, so that he was not absolutely sure his apprehensions had been vain. But, with his quick vision of things, he had got the impression, at any rate, that she had no vulgar resentment of any slight he might have put upon her, or any disadvantage he might have caused her. Her feeling about such a matter would be large and original. Bernard desired to see more of that, and in the evening, in fact, it seemed to him that he did so. The terrace of the Casino was far from offering the brilliant spectacle of the promenade in front of the gaming-rooms at Baden."}, {"size": 640, "text": "It had neither the liberal illumination, the distinguished frequenters, nor the superior music which formed the attraction of that celebrated spot; but it had a modest animation of its own, in which the starlight on the open sea took the place of clustered lamps, and the mighty resonance of the waves performed the function of an orchestra. Mrs. Vivian made her appearance with her daughter, and Bernard, as he used to do at Baden, chose a corner to place some chairs for them. The crowd was small, for most of the visitors had compressed themselves into one of the rooms, where a shrill operetta was being performed by a strolling troupe."}, {"size": 660, "text": "Mrs. Vivian\u2019s visit was a short one; she remained at the Casino less than half an hour. But Bernard had some talk with Angela. He sat beside her--her mother was on the other side, talking with an old French lady whose acquaintance she had made on the beach. Between Bernard and Angela several things were said. When his friends went away Bernard walked home with them. He bade them good-night at the door of their chalet, and then slowly strolled back to the Casino. The terrace was nearly empty; every one had gone to listen to the operetta, the sound of whose contemporary gayety came through the open, hot-looking windows in little thin quavers and catches."}, {"size": 805, "text": "The ocean was rumbling just beneath; it made a ruder but richer music. Bernard stood looking at it a moment; then he went down the steps to the beach. The tide was rather low; he walked slowly down to the line of the breaking waves. The sea looked huge and black and simple; everything was vague in the unassisted darkness. Bernard stood there some time; there was nothing but the sound and the sharp, fresh smell. Suddenly he put his hand to his heart; it was beating very fast. An immense conviction had come over him--abruptly, then and there--and for a moment he held his breath. It was like a word spoken in the darkness--he held his breath to listen. He was in love with Angela Vivian, and his love was a throbbing passion! He sat down on the stones where he stood--it filled him with a kind of awe."}, {"size": 705, "text": "It filled him with a kind of awe, and the feeling was by no means agreeable. It was not a feeling to which even a man of Bernard Longueville\u2019s easy power of extracting the savour from a sensation could rapidly habituate himself, and for the rest of that night it was far from making of our hero the happy man that a lover just coming to self-consciousness is supposed to be. It was wrong--it was dishonorable--it was impossible--and yet it was; it was, as nothing in his own personal experience had ever been. He seemed hitherto to have been living by proxy, in a vision, in reflection--to have been an echo, a shadow, a futile attempt; but this at last was life itself, this was a fact, this was reality."}, {"size": 669, "text": "For these things one lived; these were the things that people had died for. Love had been a fable before this--doubtless a very pretty one; and passion had been a literary phrase--employed obviously with considerable effect. But now he stood in a personal relation to these familiar ideas, which gave them a very much keener import; they had laid their hand upon him in the darkness, he felt it upon his shoulder, and he knew by its pressure that it was the hand of destiny. What made this sensation a shock was the element that was mixed with it; the fact that it came not simply and singly, but with an attendant shadow in which it immediately merged and lost itself."}, {"size": 852, "text": "It was forbidden fruit--he knew it the instant he had touched it. He felt that he had pledged himself not to do just this thing which was gleaming before him so divinely--not to widen the crevice, not to open the door that would flood him with light. Friendship and honor were at stake; they stood at his left hand, as his new-born passion stood already at his right; they claimed him as well, and their grasp had a pressure which might become acutely painful. The soul is a still more tender organism than the body, and it shrinks from the prospect of being subjected to violence. Violence--spiritual violence--was what our luxurious hero feared; and it is not too much to say that as he lingered there by the sea, late into the night, while the gurgitation of the waves grew deeper to his ear, the prospect came to have an element of positive terror."}, {"size": 680, "text": "The two faces of his situation stood confronting each other; it was a rigid, brutal opposition, and Bernard held his breath for a while with the wonder of what would come of it. He sat a long time upon the beach; the night grew very cold, but he had no sense of it. Then he went away and passed before the Casino again, and wandered through the village. The Casino was shrouded in darkness and silence, and there was nothing in the streets of the little town but the salt smell of the sea, a vague aroma of fish and the distant sound of the breakers. Little by little, Bernard lost the feeling of having been startled, and began to perceive that he could reason about his trouble."}, {"size": 730, "text": "Trouble it was, though this seems an odd name for the consciousness of a bright enchantment; and the first thing that reason, definitely consulted, told him about the matter was that he had been in love with Angela Vivian any time these three years. This sapient faculty supplied him with further information; only two or three of the items of which, however, it is necessary to reproduce. He had been a great fool--an incredible fool--not to have discovered before this what was the matter with him! Bernard\u2019s sense of his own shrewdness--always tolerably acute--had never received such a bruise as this present perception that a great many things had been taking place in his clever mind without his clever mind suspecting them."}, {"size": 829, "text": "But it little mattered, his reason went on to declare, what he had suspected or what he might now feel about it; his present business was to leave Blanquais-les-Galets at sunrise the next morning and never rest his eyes upon Angela Vivian again. This was his duty; it had the merit of being perfectly plain and definite, easily apprehended, and unattended, as far as he could discover, with the smallest material difficulties. Not only this, reason continued to remark; but the moral difficulties were equally inconsiderable. He had never breathed a word of his passion to Miss Vivian--quite the contrary; he had never committed himself nor given her the smallest reason to suspect his hidden flame; and he was therefore perfectly free to turn his back upon her--he could never incur the reproach of trifling with her affections."}, {"size": 717, "text": "Bernard was in that state of mind when it is the greatest of blessings to be saved the distress of choice--to see a straight path before you and to feel that you have only to follow it. Upon the straight path I have indicated, he fixed his eyes very hard; of course he would take his departure at the earliest possible hour on the morrow. There was a streak of morning in the eastern sky by the time he knocked for re-admittance at the door of the inn, which was opened to him by a mysterious old woman in a nightcap and meagre accessories, whose identity he failed to ascertain; and he laid himself down to rest--he was very tired--with his attention fastened, as I say, on the idea--on the very image--of departure."}, {"size": 668, "text": "On waking up the next morning, rather late, he found, however, that it had attached itself to a very different object. His vision was filled with the brightness of the delightful fact itself, which seemed to impregnate the sweet morning air and to flutter in the light, fresh breeze that came through his open window from the sea. He saw a great patch of the sea between a couple of red-tiled roofs; it was bluer than any sea had ever been before. He had not slept long--only three or four hours; but he had quite slept off his dread. The shadow had dropped away and nothing was left but the beauty of his love, which seemed to shine in the freshness of the early day."}, {"size": 711, "text": "He felt absurdly happy--as if he had discovered El Dorado; quite apart from consequences--he was not thinking of consequences, which of course were another affair--the feeling was intrinsically the finest one he had ever had, and--as a mere feeling--he had not done with it yet. The consideration of consequences could easily be deferred, and there would, meanwhile, be no injury to any one in his extracting, very quietly, a little subjective joy from the state of his heart. He would let the flower bloom for a day before plucking it up by the roots. Upon this latter course he was perfectly resolved, and in view of such an heroic resolution the subjective interlude appeared no more than his just privilege."}, {"size": 678, "text": "The project of leaving Blanquais-les-Galets at nine o\u2019clock in the morning dropped lightly from his mind, making no noise as it fell; but another took its place, which had an air of being still more excellent and which consisted of starting off on a long walk and absenting himself for the day. Bernard grasped his stick and wandered away; he climbed the great shoulder of the further cliff and found himself on the level downs. Here there was apparently no obstacle whatever to his walking as far as his fancy should carry him. The summer was still in a splendid mood, and the hot and quiet day--it was a Sunday--seemed to constitute a deep, silent smile on the face of nature."}, {"size": 619, "text": "The sea glistened on one side, and the crops ripened on the other; the larks, losing themselves in the dense sunshine, made it ring here and there in undiscoverable spots; this was the only sound save when Bernard, pausing now and then in his walk, found himself hearing far below him, at the base of the cliff, the drawling murmur of a wave. He walked a great many miles and passed through half a dozen of those rude fishing-hamlets, lodged in some sloping hollow of the cliffs, so many of which, of late years, all along the Norman coast, have adorned themselves with a couple of hotels and a row of bathing-machines."}, {"size": 765, "text": "He walked so far that the shadows had begun to lengthen before he bethought himself of stopping; the afternoon had come on and had already begun to wane. The grassy downs still stretched before him, shaded here and there with shallow but windless dells. He looked for the softest place and then flung himself down on the grass; he lay there for a long time, thinking of many things. He had determined to give himself up to a day\u2019s happiness; it was happiness of a very harmless kind--the satisfaction of thought, the bliss of mere consciousness; but such as it was it did not elude him nor turn bitter in his heart, and the long summer day closed upon him before his spirit, hovering in perpetual circles round the idea of what might be, had begun to rest its wing."}, {"size": 651, "text": "When he rose to his feet again it was too late to return to Blanquais in the same way that he had come; the evening was at hand, the light was already fading, and the walk he had taken was one which even if he had not felt very tired, he would have thought it imprudent to attempt to repeat in the darkness. He made his way to the nearest village, where he was able to hire a rustic carriole, in which primitive conveyance, gaining the high-road, he jogged and jostled through the hours of the evening slowly back to his starting-point. It wanted an hour of midnight by the time he reached his inn, and there was nothing left for him but to go to bed."}, {"size": 676, "text": "He went in the unshaken faith that he should leave Blanquais early on the morrow. But early on the morrow it occurred to him that it would be simply grotesque to go off without taking leave of Mrs. Vivian and her daughter, and offering them some explanation of his intention. He had given them to understand that, so delighted was he to find them there, he would remain at Blanquais at least as long as they. He must have seemed to them wanting in civility, to spend a whole bright Sunday without apparently troubling his head about them, and if the unlucky fact of his being in love with the girl were a reason for doing his duty, it was at least not a reason for being rude."}, {"size": 628, "text": "He had not yet come to that--to accepting rudeness as an incident of virtue; it had always been his theory that virtue had the best manners in the world, and he flattered himself at any rate that he could guard his integrity without making himself ridiculous. So, at what he thought a proper hour, in the course of the morning, he retraced his steps along the little lane through which, two days ago, Angela Vivian had shown him the way to her mother\u2019s door. At this humble portal he knocked; the windows of the little chalet were open, and the white curtains, behind the flower-pots, were fluttering as he had seen them before."}, {"size": 750, "text": "The door was opened by a neat young woman, who informed him very promptly that Madame and Mademoiselle had left Blanquais a couple of hours earlier. They had gone to Paris--yes, very suddenly, taking with them but little luggage, and they had left her--she had the honor of being the femme de chambre of ces dames--to put up their remaining possessions and follow as soon as possible. On Bernard\u2019s expressing surprise and saying that he had supposed them to be fixed at the sea-side for the rest of the season, the femme de chambre, who seemed a very intelligent person, begged to remind him that the season was drawing to a close, that Madame had taken the chalet but for five weeks, only ten days of which period were yet to expire, that ces dames,"}, {"size": 809, "text": "as Monsieur perhaps knew, were great travellers, who had been half over the world and thought nothing of breaking camp at an hour\u2019s notice, and that, in fine, Madame might very well have received a telegram summoning her to another part of the country. \u201cAnd where have the ladies gone?\u201d asked Bernard. \u201cFor the moment, to Paris.\u201d \u201cAnd in Paris where have they gone?\u201d \u201cDame, chez elles--to their house,\u201d said the femme de chambre, who appeared to think that Bernard asked too many questions. But Bernard persisted. \u201cWhere is their house?\u201d The waiting-maid looked at him from head to foot. \u201cIf Monsieur wishes to write, many of Madame\u2019s letters come to her banker,\u201d she said, inscrutably. \u201cAnd who is her banker?\u201d \u201cHe lives in the Rue de Provence.\u201d \u201cVery good--I will find him out,\u201d said our hero, turning away."}, {"size": 674, "text": "The discriminating reader who has been so good as to interest himself in this little narrative will perhaps at this point exclaim with a pardonable consciousness of shrewdness: \u201cOf course he went the next day to the Rue de Provence!\u201d Of course, yes; only as it happens Bernard did nothing of the kind. He did one of the most singular things he ever did in his life--a thing that puzzled him even at the time, and with regard to which he often afterward wondered whence he had drawn the ability for so remarkable a feat--he simply spent a fortnight at Blanquais-les-Galets. It was a very quiet fortnight; he spoke to no one, he formed no relations, he was company to himself."}, {"size": 716, "text": "It may be added that he had never found his own company half so good. He struck himself as a reasonable, delicate fellow, who looked at things in such a way as to make him refrain--refrain successfully, that was the point--from concerning himself practically about Angela Vivian. His saying that he would find out the banker in the Rue de Provence had been for the benefit of the femme de chambre, whom he thought rather impertinent; he had really no intention whatever of entering that classic thoroughfare. He took long walks, rambled on the beach, along the base of the cliffs and among the brown sea-caves, and he thought a good deal of certain incidents which have figured at an earlier stage of this narrative."}, {"size": 628, "text": "He had forbidden himself the future, as an object of contemplation, and it was therefore a matter of necessity that his imagination should take refuge among the warm and familiar episodes of the past. He wondered why Mrs. Vivian should have left the place so suddenly, and was of course struck with the analogy between this incident and her abrupt departure from Baden. It annoyed him, it troubled him, but it by no means rekindled the alarm he had felt on first perceiving the injured Angela on the beach. That alarm had been quenched by Angela\u2019s manner during the hour that followed and during their short talk in the evening."}, {"size": 676, "text": "This evening was to be forever memorable, for it had brought with it the revelation which still, at moments, suddenly made Bernard tremble; but it had also brought him the assurance that Angela cared as little as possible for anything that a chance acquaintance might have said about her. It is all the more singular, therefore, that one evening, after he had been at Blanquais a fortnight, a train of thought should suddenly have been set in motion in his mind. It was kindled by no outward occurrence, but by some wandering spark of fancy or of memory, and the immediate effect of it was to startle our hero very much as he had been startled on the evening I have described."}, {"size": 674, "text": "The circumstances were the same; he had wandered down to the beach alone, very late, and he stood looking at the duskily-tumbling sea. Suddenly the same voice that had spoken before murmured another phrase in the darkness, and it rang upon his ear for the rest of the night. It startled him, as I have said, at first; then, the next morning, it led him to take his departure for Paris. During the journey it lingered in his ear; he sat in the corner of the railway-carriage with his eyes closed, abstracted, on purpose to prolong the reverberation. If it were not true it was at least, as the Italians have it, ben trovato, and it was wonderful how well it bore thinking of."}, {"size": 604, "text": "It bears telling less well; but I can at least give a hint of it. The theory that Angela hated him had evaporated in her presence, and another of a very different sort had sprung into being. It fitted a great many of the facts, it explained a great many contradictions, anomalies, mysteries, and it accounted for Miss Vivian\u2019s insisting upon her mother\u2019s leaving Blanquais at a few hours\u2019 notice, even better than the theory of her resentment could have done. At any rate, it obliterated Bernard\u2019s scruples very effectually, and led him on his arrival in Paris to repair instantly to the Rue de Provence."}, {"size": 565, "text": "This street contains more than one banker, but there is one with whom Bernard deemed Mrs. Vivian most likely to have dealings. He found he had reckoned rightly, and he had no difficulty in procuring her address. Having done so, however, he by no means went immediately to see her; he waited a couple of days--perhaps to give those obliterated scruples I have spoken of a chance to revive. They kept very quiet, and it must be confessed that Bernard took no great pains to recall them to life. After he had been in Paris three days, he knocked at Mrs. Vivian\u2019s door."}, {"size": 653, "text": "It was opened by the little waiting-maid whom he had seen at Blanquais, and who looked at him very hard before she answered his inquiry. \u201cYou see I have found Mrs. Vivian\u2019s dwelling, though you would n\u2019t give me the address,\u201d Bernard said to her, smiling. \u201cMonsieur has put some time to it!\u201d the young woman answered dryly. And she informed him that Madame was at home, though Mademoiselle, for whom he had not asked, was not.Mrs. Vivian occupied a diminutive apartment at the summit of one of the tall white houses which ornament the neighborhood of the Arc de Triomphe. The early days of September had arrived, but Paris was still a city of absentees."}, {"size": 676, "text": "The weather was warm and charming, and a certain savour of early autumn in the air was in accord with the somewhat melancholy aspect of the empty streets and closed shutters of this honorable quarter, where the end of the monumental vistas seemed to be curtained with a hazy emanation from the Seine. It was late in the afternoon when Bernard was ushered into Mrs. Vivian\u2019s little high-nestling drawing-room, and a patch of sunset tints, faintly red, rested softly upon the gilded wall. Bernard had seen these ladies only in borrowed and provisional abodes; but here was a place where they were really living and which was stamped with their tastes, their habits, their charm."}, {"size": 843, "text": "The little salon was very elegant; it contained a multitude of pretty things, and it appeared to Bernard to be arranged in perfection. The long windows--the ceiling being low, they were really very short--opened upon one of those solid balconies, occupying the width of the apartment, which are often in Paris a compensation for living up five flights of stairs, and this balcony was filled with flowers and cushions. Bernard stepped out upon it to await the coming of Mrs. Vivian, and, as she was not quick to appear, he had time to see that his friends enjoyed a magnificent view. They looked up at the triumphal Arch, which presented itself at a picturesque angle, and near the green tree-tops of the Champs Elysees, beyond which they caught a broad gleam of the Seine and a glimpse, blue in the distance, of the great towers of Notre Dame."}, {"size": 625, "text": "The whole vast city lay before them and beneath them, with its ordered brilliancy and its mingled aspect of compression and expansion; and yet the huge Parisian murmur died away before it reached Mrs. Vivian\u2019s sky-parlor, which seemed to Bernard the brightest and quietest little habitation he had ever known. His hostess came rustling in at last; she seemed agitated; she knocked over with the skirt of her dress a little gilded chair which was reflected in the polished parquet as in a sheet of looking-glass. Mrs. Vivian had a fixed smile--she hardly knew what to say. \u201cI found your address at the banker\u2019s,\u201d said Bernard."}, {"size": 717, "text": "\u201cYour maid, at Blanquais, refused to give it to me.\u201d Mrs. Vivian gave him a little look--there was always more or less of it in her face--which seemed equivalent to an entreaty that her interlocutor should spare her. \u201cMaids are so strange,\u201d she murmured; \u201cespecially the French!\u201d It pleased Bernard for the moment not to spare her, though he felt a sort of delight of kindness for her. \u201cYour going off from Blanquais so suddenly, without leaving me any explanation, any clue, any message of any sort--made me feel at first as if you did n\u2019t wish that I should look you up.

And after all, here we are together again--that is, some of us. But I have only my own audacity to thank for it. I was quite free to believe that you were not at all pleased to see me re-appear--and it is only because I am not easy to discourage--am indeed probably a rather impudent fellow--that I have ventured to come here to-day.\u201d \u201cI am very glad to see you re-appear, Mr."}, {"size": 621, "text": "Longueville,\u201d Mrs. Vivian declared with the accent of veracity. \u201cIt was your daughter\u2019s idea, then, running away from Blanquais?\u201d Mrs. Vivian lowered her eyes. \u201cWe were obliged to go to Fontainebleau.

We don\u2019t mind about Siena now,\u201d she added, softly.

This lady and her daughter gave him a welcome which--I will not say satisfied him, but which, at least, did something toward soothing the still unhealed wounds of separation. \u201cAnd what is the news of Gordon?\u201d he presently asked. \u201cWe have not seen him in three days,\u201d said Angela. \u201cHe is cured, dear Bernard; he must be. Angela has been wonderful,\u201d Mrs. Vivian declared. \u201cYou should have seen mamma with Blanche,\u201d her daughter said, smiling. \u201cIt was most remarkable.\u201d Mrs. Vivian smiled, too, very gently. \u201cDear little Blanche! Captain Lovelock has gone to London.\u201d \u201cYes, he thinks it a beastly hole. Ah, no,\u201d Bernard added, \u201cI have got it wrong.\u201d"}, {"size": 636, "text": "But it little mattered. Late that night, on his return to his own rooms, Bernard sat gazing at his fire. He had not begun to undress; he was thinking of a good many things. He was in the midst of his reflections when there came a rap at his door, which the next moment was flung open. Gordon Wright stood there, looking at him--with a gaze which Bernard returned for a moment before bidding him to come in. Gordon came in and came up to him; then he held out his hand. Bernard took it with great satisfaction; his last feeling had been that he was very weary of this ridiculous quarrel, and it was an extreme relief to find it was over."}, {"size": 684, "text": "\u201cIt was very good of you to go to London,\u201d said Gordon, looking at him with all the old serious honesty of his eyes. \u201cI have always tried to do what I could to oblige you,\u201d Bernard answered, smiling. \u201cYou must have cursed me over there,\u201d Gordon went on. \u201cI did, a little. As you were cursing me here, it was permissible.\u201d \u201cThat \u2018s over now,\u201d said Gordon. \u201cI came to welcome you back. It seemed to me I could n\u2019t lay my head on my pillow without speaking to you.\u201d \u201cI am glad to get back,\u201d Bernard admitted, smiling still. \u201cI can\u2019t deny that. And I find you as I believed I should.\u201d Then he added, seriously--\u201cI knew Angela would keep us good friends.\u201d For a moment Gordon said nothing."}, {"size": 603, "text": "Then, at last-- \u201cYes, for that purpose it did n\u2019t matter which of us should marry her. If it had been I,\u201d he added, \u201cshe would have made you accept it.\u201d \u201cAh, I don\u2019t know!\u201d Bernard exclaimed. \u201cI am sure of it,\u201d said Gordon earnestly--almost argumentatively. \u201cShe \u2018s an extraordinary woman.\u201d \u201cKeeping you good friends with me--that \u2018s a great thing. But it \u2018s nothing to her keeping you good friends with your wife.\u201d Gordon looked at Bernard for an instant; then he fixed his eyes for some time on the fire. \u201cYes, that is the greatest of all things. A man should value his wife. He should believe in her."}, {"size": 704, "text": "He has taken her, and he should keep her--especially when there is a great deal of good in her. I was a great fool the other day,\u201d he went on. \u201cI don\u2019t remember what I said. It was very weak.\u201d \u201cIt seemed to me feeble,\u201d said Bernard. \u201cBut it is quite within a man\u2019s rights to be a fool once in a while, and you had never abused of the license.\u201d \u201cWell, I have done it for a lifetime--for a lifetime.\u201d And Gordon took up his hat. He looked into the crown of it for a moment, and then he fixed his eyes on Bernard\u2019s again. \u201cBut there is one thing I hope you won\u2019t mind my saying. I have come back to my old impression of Miss Vivian.\u201d \u201cYour old impression?\u201d And Miss Vivian\u2019s accepted lover frowned a little."}, {"size": 793, "text": "\u201cI mean that she \u2018s not simple. She \u2018s very strange.\u201d Bernard\u2019s frown cleared away in a sudden, almost eager smile. \u201cSay at once that you dislike her! That will do capitally.\u201d Gordon shook his head, and he, too, almost smiled a little. \u201cIt \u2018s not true. She \u2018s very wonderful. And if I did dislike her, I should struggle with it. It would never do for me to dislike your wife!\u201d After he had gone, when the night was half over, Bernard, lying awake a while, gave a laugh in the still darkness, as this last sentence came back to him. On the morrow he saw Blanche, for he went to see Gordon. The latter, at first, was not at home; but he had a quarter of an hour\u2019s talk with his wife, whose powers of conversation were apparently not in the smallest degree affected by anything that had occurred."}, {"size": 624, "text": "\u201cI hope you enjoyed your visit to London,\u201d she said. \u201cDid you go to buy Angela a set of diamonds in Bond Street? You did n\u2019t buy anything--you did n\u2019t go into a shop? Then pray what did you go for? Excuse my curiosity--it seems to me it \u2018s rather flattering. I never know anything unless I am told. I have n\u2019t any powers of observation. I noticed you went--oh, yes, I observed that very much; and I thought it very strange, under the circumstances. Your most intimate friend arrived in Paris, and you choose the next day to make a little tour! I don\u2019t like to see you treat my husband so; he would never have done it to you."}, {"size": 722, "text": "And if you did n\u2019t stay for Gordon, you might have staid for Angela. I never heard of anything so monstrous as a gentleman rushing away from the object of his affection, for no particular purpose that any one could discover, the day after she has accepted him. It was not the day after? Well, it was too soon, at any rate. Angela could n\u2019t in the least tell me what you had gone for; she said it was for a \u2018change.\u2019 That was a charming reason! But she was very much ashamed of you--and so was I; and at last we all sent Captain Lovelock after you to bring you back. You came back without him? Ah, so much the better; I suppose he is still looking for you, and, as he is n\u2019t very clever, that will occupy him for some time."}, {"size": 672, "text": "We want to occupy him; we don\u2019t approve of his being so idle. However, for my own part, I am very glad you were away. I was a great deal at Mrs. Vivian\u2019s, and I should n\u2019t have felt nearly so much at liberty to go if I had known I should always find you there making love to Mademoiselle. It would n\u2019t have seemed to me discreet,--I know what you are going to say--that it \u2018s the first time you ever heard of my wishing to avoid an indiscretion. It \u2018s a taste I have taken up lately,--for the same reason you went to London, for a \u2018change.\u2019\u201d Here Blanche paused for an appreciable moment; and then she added--\u201cWell, I must say, I have never seen anything so lovely as Mrs."}, {"size": 629, "text": "Vivian\u2019s influence. I hope mamma won\u2019t be disappointed in it this time.\u201d When Bernard next saw the other two ladies, he said to them that he was surprised at the way in which clever women incurred moral responsibilities. \u201cWe like them,\u201d said Mrs. Vivian. \u201cWe delight in them!\u201d \u201cWell,\u201d said Bernard, \u201cI would n\u2019t for the world have it on my conscience to have reconciled poor Gordon to Mrs. Blanche.\u201d \u201cYou are not to say a word against Blanche,\u201d Angela declared. \u201cShe \u2018s a little miracle.\u201d \u201cIt will be all right, dear Bernard,\u201d Mrs. Vivian added, with soft authority. \u201cI have taken a great fancy to her,\u201d the younger lady went on."}, {"size": 750, "text": "Bernard gave a little laugh. \u201cGordon is right in his ultimate opinion. You are very strange!\u201d \u201cYou may abuse me as much as you please; but I will never hear a word against Mrs. Gordon.\u201d And she never would in future; though it is not recorded that Bernard availed himself in any special degree of the license offered him in conjunction with this warning. Blanche\u2019s health within a few days had, according to her own account, taken a marvellous turn for the better; but her husband appeared still to think it proper that they should spend the winter beneath a brilliant sun, and he presently informed his friends that they had at last settled it between them that a voyage up the Nile must be, for a thoroughly united couple, a very agreeable pastime."}, {"size": 872, "text": "To perform this expedition advantageously they must repair to Cairo without delay, and for this reason he was sure that Bernard and Angela would easily understand their not making a point of waiting for the wedding. These happy people quite understood it. Their nuptials were to be celebrated with extreme simplicity. If, however, Gordon was not able to be present, he, in conjunction with his wife, bought for Angela, as a bridal gift, a necklace of the most beautiful pearls the Rue de la Paix could furnish; and on his arrival at Cairo, while he waited for his dragoman to give the signal for starting, he found time, in spite of the exactions of that large correspondence which has been more than once mentioned in the course of our narrative, to write Bernard the longest letter he had ever addressed to him. The letter reached Bernard in the middle of his honeymoon."}]}
