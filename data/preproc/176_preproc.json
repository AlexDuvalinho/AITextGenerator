SwitzerlandMallet had made his arrangements to sail for Europe on the first of September, and having in the interval a fortnight to spare, he determined to spend it with his cousin Cecilia, the widow of a nephew of his father. He was urged by the reflection that an affectionate farewell might help to exonerate him from the charge of neglect frequently preferred by this lady. It was not that the young man disliked her; on the contrary, he regarded her with a tender admiration, and he had not forgotten how, when his cousin had brought her home on her"}, {"size": 642, "text": "marriage, he had seemed to feel the upward sweep of the empty bough from which the golden fruit had been plucked, and had then and there accepted the prospect of bachelorhood. The truth was, that, as it will be part of the entertainment of this narrative to exhibit, Rowland Mallet had an uncomfortably sensitive conscience, and that, in spite of the seeming paradox, his visits to Cecilia were rare because she and her misfortunes were often uppermost in it. Her misfortunes were three in number: first, she had lost her husband; second, she had lost her money (or the greater part of it); and third, she lived at Northampton, Massachusetts."}, {"size": 681, "text": "Mallet\u2019s compassion was really wasted, because Cecilia was a very clever woman, and a most skillful counter-plotter to adversity. She had made herself a charming home, her economies were not obtrusive, and there was always a cheerful flutter in the folds of her crape. It was the consciousness of all this that puzzled Mallet whenever he felt tempted to put in his oar. He had money and he had time, but he never could decide just how to place these gifts gracefully at Cecilia\u2019s service. He no longer felt like marrying her: in these eight years that fancy had died a natural death. And yet her extreme cleverness seemed somehow to make charity difficult and patronage impossible."}, {"size": 777, "text": "He would rather chop off his hand than offer her a check, a piece of useful furniture, or a black silk dress; and yet there was some sadness in seeing such a bright, proud woman living in such a small, dull way. Cecilia had, moreover, a turn for sarcasm, and her smile, which was her pretty feature, was never so pretty as when her sprightly phrase had a lurking scratch in it. Rowland remembered that, for him, she was all smiles, and suspected, awkwardly, that he ministered not a little to her sense of the irony of things. And in truth, with his means, his leisure, and his opportunities, what had he done? He had an unaffected suspicion of his uselessness. Cecilia, meanwhile, cut out her own dresses, and was personally giving her little girl the education of a princess."}, {"size": 733, "text": "This time, however, he presented himself bravely enough; for in the way of activity it was something definite, at least, to be going to Europe and to be meaning to spend the winter in Rome. Cecilia met him in the early dusk at the gate of her little garden, amid a studied combination of floral perfumes. A rosy widow of twenty-eight, half cousin, half hostess, doing the honors of an odorous cottage on a midsummer evening, was a phenomenon to which the young man\u2019s imagination was able to do ample justice. Cecilia was always gracious, but this evening she was almost joyous. She was in a happy mood, and Mallet imagined there was a private reason for it--a reason quite distinct from her pleasure in receiving her honored kinsman."}, {"size": 662, "text": "The next day he flattered himself he was on the way to discover it. For the present, after tea, as they sat on the rose-framed porch, while Rowland held his younger cousin between his knees, and she, enjoying her situation, listened timorously for the stroke of bedtime, Cecilia insisted on talking more about her visitor than about herself. \u201cWhat is it you mean to do in Europe?\u201d she asked, lightly, giving a turn to the frill of her sleeve--just such a turn as seemed to Mallet to bring out all the latent difficulties of the question. \u201cWhy, very much what I do here,\u201d he answered. \u201cNo great harm.\u201d \u201cIs it true,\u201d Cecilia asked, \u201cthat here you do no great harm?"}, {"size": 660, "text": "Is not a man like you doing harm when he is not doing positive good?\u201d \u201cYour compliment is ambiguous,\u201d said Rowland. \u201cNo,\u201d answered the widow, \u201cyou know what I think of you. You have a particular aptitude for beneficence. You have it in the first place in your character. You are a benevolent person. Ask Bessie if you don\u2019t hold her more gently and comfortably than any of her other admirers.\u201d \u201cHe holds me more comfortably than Mr. Hudson,\u201d Bessie declared, roundly. Rowland, not knowing Mr. Hudson, could but half appreciate the eulogy, and Cecilia went on to develop her idea. \u201cYour circumstances, in the second place, suggest the idea of social usefulness."}, {"size": 641, "text": "You are intelligent, you are well-informed, and your charity, if one may call it charity, would be discriminating. You are rich and unoccupied, so that it might be abundant. Therefore, I say, you are a person to do something on a large scale. Bestir yourself, dear Rowland, or we may be taught to think that virtue herself is setting a bad example.\u201d \u201cHeaven forbid,\u201d cried Rowland, \u201cthat I should set the examples of virtue! I am quite willing to follow them, however, and if I don\u2019t do something on the grand scale, it is that my genius is altogether imitative, and that I have not recently encountered any very striking models of grandeur."}, {"size": 700, "text": "Pray, what shall I do? Found an orphan asylum, or build a dormitory for Harvard College? I am not rich enough to do either in an ideally handsome way, and I confess that, yet awhile, I feel too young to strike my grand coup. I am holding myself ready for inspiration. I am waiting till something takes my fancy irresistibly. If inspiration comes at forty, it will be a hundred pities to have tied up my money-bag at thirty.\u201d \u201cWell, I give you till forty,\u201d said Cecilia. \u201cIt \u2018s only a word to the wise, a notification that you are expected not to run your course without having done something handsome for your fellow-men.\u201d Nine o\u2019clock sounded, and Bessie, with each stroke, courted a closer embrace."}, {"size": 667, "text": "But a single winged word from her mother overleaped her successive intrenchments. She turned and kissed her cousin, and deposited an irrepressible tear on his moustache. Then she went and said her prayers to her mother: it was evident she was being admirably brought up. Rowland, with the permission of his hostess, lighted a cigar and puffed it awhile in silence. Cecilia\u2019s interest in his career seemed very agreeable. That Mallet was without vanity I by no means intend to affirm; but there had been times when, seeing him accept, hardly less deferentially, advice even more peremptory than the widow\u2019s, you might have asked yourself what had become of his vanity."}, {"size": 641, "text": "Now, in the sweet-smelling starlight, he felt gently wooed to egotism. There was a project connected with his going abroad which it was on his tongue\u2019s end to communicate. It had no relation to hospitals or dormitories, and yet it would have sounded very generous. But it was not because it would have sounded generous that poor Mallet at last puffed it away in the fumes of his cigar. Useful though it might be, it expressed most imperfectly the young man\u2019s own personal conception of usefulness. He was extremely fond of all the arts, and he had an almost passionate enjoyment of pictures. He had seen many, and he judged them sagaciously."}, {"size": 716, "text": "It had occurred to him some time before that it would be the work of a good citizen to go abroad and with all expedition and secrecy purchase certain valuable specimens of the Dutch and Italian schools as to which he had received private proposals, and then present his treasures out of hand to an American city, not unknown to aesthetic fame, in which at that time there prevailed a good deal of fruitless aspiration toward an art-museum. He had seen himself in imagination, more than once, in some mouldy old saloon of a Florentine palace, turning toward the deep embrasure of the window some scarcely-faded Ghirlandaio or Botticelli, while a host in reduced circumstances pointed out the lovely drawing of a hand."}, {"size": 704, "text": "But he imparted none of these visions to Cecilia, and he suddenly swept them away with the declaration that he was of course an idle, useless creature, and that he would probably be even more so in Europe than at home. \u201cThe only thing is,\u201d he said, \u201cthat there I shall seem to be doing something. I shall be better entertained, and shall be therefore, I suppose, in a better humor with life. You may say that that is just the humor a useless man should keep out of. He should cultivate discontentment. I did a good many things when I was in Europe before, but I did not spend a winter in Rome. Every one assures me that this is a peculiar refinement of bliss; most people talk about Rome in the same way."}, {"size": 680, "text": "It is evidently only a sort of idealized form of loafing: a passive life in Rome, thanks to the number and the quality of one\u2019s impressions, takes on a very respectable likeness to activity. It is still lotus-eating, only you sit down at table, and the lotuses are served up on rococo china. It \u2018s all very well, but I have a distinct prevision of this--that if Roman life does n\u2019t do something substantial to make you happier, it increases tenfold your liability to moral misery. It seems to me a rash thing for a sensitive soul deliberately to cultivate its sensibilities by rambling too often among the ruins of the Palatine, or riding too often in the shadow of the aqueducts."}, {"size": 702, "text": "In such recreations the chords of feeling grow tense, and after-life, to spare your intellectual nerves, must play upon them with a touch as dainty as the tread of Mignon when she danced her egg-dance.\u201d \u201cI should have said, my dear Rowland,\u201d said Cecilia, with a laugh, \u201cthat your nerves were tough, that your eggs were hard!\u201d \u201cThat being stupid, you mean, I might be happy? Upon my word I am not. I am clever enough to want more than I \u2018ve got. I am tired of myself, my own thoughts, my own affairs, my own eternal company. True happiness, we are told, consists in getting out of one\u2019s self; but the point is not only to get out--you must stay out; and to stay out you must have some absorbing errand."}, {"size": 623, "text": "Unfortunately, I \u2018ve got no errand, and nobody will trust me with one. I want to care for something, or for some one. And I want to care with a certain ardor; even, if you can believe it, with a certain passion. I can\u2019t just now feel ardent and passionate about a hospital or a dormitory. Do you know I sometimes think that I \u2018m a man of genius, half finished? The genius has been left out, the faculty of expression is wanting; but the need for expression remains, and I spend my days groping for the latch of a closed door.\u201d \u201cWhat an immense number of words,\u201d said Cecilia after a pause, \u201cto say you want to fall in love!"}, {"size": 874, "text": "I \u2018ve no doubt you have as good a genius for that as any one, if you would only trust it.\u201d \u201cOf course I \u2018ve thought of that, and I assure you I hold myself ready. But, evidently, I \u2018m not inflammable. Is there in Northampton some perfect epitome of the graces?\u201d \u201cOf the graces?\u201d said Cecilia, raising her eyebrows and suppressing too distinct a consciousness of being herself a rosy embodiment of several. \u201cThe household virtues are better represented. There are some excellent girls, and there are two or three very pretty ones. I will have them here, one by one, to tea, if you like.\u201d \u201cI should particularly like it; especially as I should give you a chance to see, by the profundity of my attention, that if I am not happy, it \u2018s not for want of taking pains.\u201d Cecilia was silent a moment; and then, \u201cOn the whole,\u201d she resumed, \u201cI don\u2019t think there are any worth asking."}, {"size": 746, "text": "There are none so very pretty, none so very pleasing.\u201d \u201cAre you very sure?\u201d asked the young man, rising and throwing away his cigar-end. \u201cUpon my word,\u201d cried Cecilia, \u201cone would suppose I wished to keep you for myself. Of course I am sure! But as the penalty of your insinuations, I shall invite the plainest and prosiest damsel that can be found, and leave you alone with her.\u201d Rowland smiled. \u201cEven against her,\u201d he said, \u201cI should be sorry to conclude until I had given her my respectful attention.\u201d This little profession of ideal chivalry (which closed the conversation) was not quite so fanciful on Mallet\u2019s lips as it would have been on those of many another man; as a rapid glance at his antecedents may help to make the reader perceive."}, {"size": 660, "text": "His life had been a singular mixture of the rough and the smooth. He had sprung from a rigid Puritan stock, and had been brought up to think much more intently of the duties of this life than of its privileges and pleasures. His progenitors had submitted in the matter of dogmatic theology to the relaxing influences of recent years; but if Rowland\u2019s youthful consciousness was not chilled by the menace of long punishment for brief transgression, he had at least been made to feel that there ran through all things a strain of right and of wrong, as different, after all, in their complexions, as the texture, to the spiritual sense, of Sundays and week-days."}, {"size": 725, "text": "His father was a chip of the primal Puritan block, a man with an icy smile and a stony frown. He had always bestowed on his son, on principle, more frowns than smiles, and if the lad had not been turned to stone himself, it was because nature had blessed him, inwardly, with a well of vivifying waters. Mrs. Mallet had been a Miss Rowland, the daughter of a retired sea-captain, once famous on the ships that sailed from Salem and Newburyport. He had brought to port many a cargo which crowned the edifice of fortunes already almost colossal, but he had also done a little sagacious trading on his own account, and he was able to retire, prematurely for so sea-worthy a maritime organism, upon a pension of his own providing."}, {"size": 765, "text": "He was to be seen for a year on the Salem wharves, smoking the best tobacco and eying the seaward horizon with an inveteracy which superficial minds interpreted as a sign of repentance. At last, one evening, he disappeared beneath it, as he had often done before; this time, however, not as a commissioned navigator, but simply as an amateur of an observing turn likely to prove oppressive to the officer in command of the vessel. Five months later his place at home knew him again, and made the acquaintance also of a handsome, blonde young woman, of redundant contours, speaking a foreign tongue. The foreign tongue proved, after much conflicting research, to be the idiom of Amsterdam, and the young woman, which was stranger still, to be Captain Rowland\u2019s wife."}, {"size": 637, "text": "Why he had gone forth so suddenly across the seas to marry her, what had happened between them before, and whether--though it was of questionable propriety for a good citizen to espouse a young person of mysterious origin, who did her hair in fantastically elaborate plaits, and in whose appearance \u201cfigure\u201d enjoyed such striking predominance--he would not have had a heavy weight on his conscience if he had remained an irresponsible bachelor; these questions and many others, bearing with varying degrees of immediacy on the subject, were much propounded but scantily answered, and this history need not be charged with resolving them."}, {"size": 676, "text": "Mrs. Rowland, for so handsome a woman, proved a tranquil neighbor and an excellent housewife. Her extremely fresh complexion, however, was always suffused with an air of apathetic homesickness, and she played her part in American society chiefly by having the little squares of brick pavement in front of her dwelling scoured and polished as nearly as possible into the likeness of Dutch tiles. Rowland Mallet remembered having seen her, as a child--an immensely stout, white-faced lady, wearing a high cap of very stiff tulle, speaking English with a formidable accent, and suffering from dropsy. Captain Rowland was a little bronzed and wizened man, with eccentric opinions."}, {"size": 616, "text": "He advocated the creation of a public promenade along the sea, with arbors and little green tables for the consumption of beer, and a platform, surrounded by Chinese lanterns, for dancing. He especially desired the town library to be opened on Sundays, though, as he never entered it on week-days, it was easy to turn the proposition into ridicule. If, therefore, Mrs. Mallet was a woman of an exquisite moral tone, it was not that she had inherited her temper from an ancestry with a turn for casuistry. Jonas Mallet, at the time of his marriage, was conducting with silent shrewdness a small, unpromising business."}, {"size": 641, "text": "Both his shrewdness and his silence increased with his years, and at the close of his life he was an extremely well-dressed, well-brushed gentleman, with a frigid gray eye, who said little to anybody, but of whom everybody said that he had a very handsome fortune. He was not a sentimental father, and the roughness I just now spoke of in Rowland\u2019s life dated from his early boyhood. Mr. Mallet, whenever he looked at his son, felt extreme compunction at having made a fortune. He remembered that the fruit had not dropped ripe from the tree into his own mouth, and determined it should be no fault of his if the boy was corrupted by luxury."}, {"size": 779, "text": "Rowland, therefore, except for a good deal of expensive instruction in foreign tongues and abstruse sciences, received the education of a poor man\u2019s son. His fare was plain, his temper familiar with the discipline of patched trousers, and his habits marked by an exaggerated simplicity which it really cost a good deal of money to preserve unbroken. He was kept in the country for months together, in the midst of servants who had strict injunctions to see that he suffered no serious harm, but were as strictly forbidden to wait upon him. As no school could be found conducted on principles sufficiently rigorous, he was attended at home by a master who set a high price on the understanding that he was to illustrate the beauty of abstinence not only by precept but by example."}, {"size": 671, "text": "Rowland passed for a child of ordinary parts, and certainly, during his younger years, was an excellent imitation of a boy who had inherited nothing whatever that was to make life easy. He was passive, pliable, frank, extremely slow at his books, and inordinately fond of trout-fishing. His hair, a memento of his Dutch ancestry, was of the fairest shade of yellow, his complexion absurdly rosy, and his measurement around the waist, when he was about ten years old, quite alarmingly large. This, however, was but an episode in his growth; he became afterwards a fresh-colored, yellow-bearded man, but he was never accused of anything worse than a tendency to corpulence."}, {"size": 755, "text": "He emerged from childhood a simple, wholesome, round-eyed lad, with no suspicion that a less roundabout course might have been taken to make him happy, but with a vague sense that his young experience was not a fair sample of human freedom, and that he was to make a great many discoveries. When he was about fifteen, he achieved a momentous one. He ascertained that his mother was a saint. She had always been a very distinct presence in his life, but so ineffably gentle a one that his sense was fully opened to it only by the danger of losing her. She had an illness which for many months was liable at any moment to terminate fatally, and during her long-arrested convalescence she removed the mask which she had worn for years by her husband\u2019s order."}, {"size": 785, "text": "Rowland spent his days at her side and felt before long as if he had made a new friend. All his impressions at this period were commented and interpreted at leisure in the future, and it was only then that he understood that his mother had been for fifteen years a perfectly unhappy woman. Her marriage had been an immitigable error which she had spent her life in trying to look straight in the face. She found nothing to oppose to her husband\u2019s will of steel but the appearance of absolute compliance; her spirit sank, and she lived for a while in a sort of helpless moral torpor. But at last, as her child emerged from babyhood, she began to feel a certain charm in patience, to discover the uses of ingenuity, and to learn that, somehow or other, one can always arrange one\u2019s life."}, {"size": 693, "text": "She cultivated from this time forward a little private plot of sentiment, and it was of this secluded precinct that, before her death, she gave her son the key. Rowland\u2019s allowance at college was barely sufficient to maintain him decently, and as soon as he graduated, he was taken into his father\u2019s counting-house, to do small drudgery on a proportionate salary. For three years he earned his living as regularly as the obscure functionary in fustian who swept the office. Mr. Mallet was consistent, but the perfection of his consistency was known only on his death. He left but a third of his property to his son, and devoted the remainder to various public institutions and local charities."}, {"size": 677, "text": "Rowland\u2019s third was an easy competence, and he never felt a moment\u2019s jealousy of his fellow-pensioners; but when one of the establishments which had figured most advantageously in his father\u2019s will bethought itself to affirm the existence of a later instrument, in which it had been still more handsomely treated, the young man felt a sudden passionate need to repel the claim by process of law. There was a lively tussle, but he gained his case; immediately after which he made, in another quarter, a donation of the contested sum. He cared nothing for the money, but he had felt an angry desire to protest against a destiny which seemed determined to be exclusively salutary."}, {"size": 614, "text": "It seemed to him that he would bear a little spoiling. And yet he treated himself to a very modest quantity, and submitted without reserve to the great national discipline which began in 1861. When the Civil War broke out he immediately obtained a commission, and did his duty for three long years as a citizen soldier. His duty was obscure, but he never lost a certain private satisfaction in remembering that on two or three occasions it had been performed with something of an ideal precision. He had disentangled himself from business, and after the war he felt a profound disinclination to tie the knot again."}, {"size": 603, "text": "He had no desire to make money, he had money enough; and although he knew, and was frequently reminded, that a young man is the better for a fixed occupation, he could discover no moral advantage in driving a lucrative trade. Yet few young men of means and leisure ever made less of a parade of idleness, and indeed idleness in any degree could hardly be laid at the door of a young man who took life in the serious, attentive, reasoning fashion of our friend. It often seemed to Mallet that he wholly lacked the prime requisite of a graceful flaneur--the simple, sensuous, confident relish of pleasure."}, {"size": 668, "text": "He had frequent fits of extreme melancholy, in which he declared that he was neither fish nor flesh nor good red herring. He was neither an irresponsibly contemplative nature nor a sturdily practical one, and he was forever looking in vain for the uses of the things that please and the charm of the things that sustain. He was an awkward mixture of strong moral impulse and restless aesthetic curiosity, and yet he would have made a most ineffective reformer and a very indifferent artist. It seemed to him that the glow of happiness must be found either in action, of some immensely solid kind, on behalf of an idea, or in producing a masterpiece in one of the arts."}, {"size": 798, "text": "Oftenest, perhaps, he wished he were a vigorous young man of genius, without a penny. As it was, he could only buy pictures, and not paint them; and in the way of action, he had to content himself with making a rule to render scrupulous moral justice to handsome examples of it in others. On the whole, he had an incorruptible modesty. With his blooming complexion and his serene gray eye, he felt the friction of existence more than was suspected; but he asked no allowance on grounds of temper, he assumed that fate had treated him inordinately well and that he had no excuse for taking an ill-natured view of life, and he undertook constantly to believe that all women were fair, all men were brave, and the world was a delightful place of sojourn, until the contrary had been distinctly proved."}, {"size": 878, "text": "Cecilia\u2019s blooming garden and shady porch had seemed so friendly to repose and a cigar, that she reproached him the next morning with indifference to her little parlor, not less, in its way, a monument to her ingenious taste. \u201cAnd by the way,\u201d she added as he followed her in, \u201cif I refused last night to show you a pretty girl, I can at least show you a pretty boy.\u201d She threw open a window and pointed to a statuette which occupied the place of honor among the ornaments of the room. Rowland looked at it a moment and then turned to her with an exclamation of surprise. She gave him a rapid glance, perceived that her statuette was of altogether exceptional merit, and then smiled, knowingly, as if this had long been an agreeable certainty. \u201cWho did it? where did you get it?\u201d Rowland demanded. \u201cOh,\u201d said Cecilia, adjusting the light, \u201cit \u2018s a little thing of Mr. Hudson\u2019s.\u201d"}, {"size": 609, "text": "\u201cAnd who the deuce is Mr. Hudson?\u201d asked Rowland. But he was absorbed; he lost her immediate reply. The statuette, in bronze, something less than two feet high, represented a naked youth drinking from a gourd. The attitude was perfectly simple. The lad was squarely planted on his feet, with his legs a little apart; his back was slightly hollowed, his head thrown back, and both hands raised to support the rustic cup. There was a loosened fillet of wild flowers about his head, and his eyes, under their drooped lids, looked straight into the cup. On the base was scratched the Greek word \u00ce\u201d\u00e1\u00bc\u00b1\u00cf\u02c6\u00ce\u00b1, Thirst."}, {"size": 683, "text": "The figure might have been some beautiful youth of ancient fable,--Hylas or Narcissus, Paris or Endymion. Its beauty was the beauty of natural movement; nothing had been sought to be represented but the perfection of an attitude. This had been most attentively studied, and it was exquisitely rendered. Rowland demanded more light, dropped his head on this side and that, uttered vague exclamations. He said to himself, as he had said more than once in the Louvre and the Vatican, \u201cWe ugly mortals, what beautiful creatures we are!\u201d Nothing, in a long time, had given him so much pleasure. \u201cHudson--Hudson,\u201d he asked again; \u201cwho is Hudson?\u201d \u201cA young man of this place,\u201d said Cecilia."}, {"size": 640, "text": "\u201cA young man?

He was a frequent visitor, and as he had not called for some days it was likely he would come that evening. Rowland, left alone, examined the statuette at his leisure, and returned more than once during the day to take another look at it. He discovered its weak points, but it wore well. It had the stamp of genius. Rowland envied the happy youth who, in a New England village, without aid or encouragement, without models or resources, had found it so easy to produce a lovely work."}, {"size": 606, "text": "In the evening, as he was smoking his cigar on the veranda, a light, quick step pressed the gravel of the garden path, and in a moment a young man made his bow to Cecilia. It was rather a nod than a bow, and indicated either that he was an old friend, or that he was scantily versed in the usual social forms. Cecilia, who was sitting near the steps, pointed to a neighboring chair, but the young man seated himself abruptly on the floor at her feet, began to fan himself vigorously with his hat, and broke out into a lively objurgation upon the hot weather. \u201cI \u2018m dripping wet!\u201d he said, without ceremony."}, {"size": 647, "text": "\u201cYou walk too fast,\u201d said Cecilia. \u201cYou do everything too fast.\u201d \u201cI know it, I know it!\u201d he cried, passing his hand through his abundant dark hair and making it stand out in a picturesque shock. \u201cI can\u2019t be slow if I try. There \u2018s something inside of me that drives me. A restless fiend!\u201d Cecilia gave a light laugh, and Rowland leaned forward in his hammock. He had placed himself in it at Bessie\u2019s request, and was playing that he was her baby and that she was rocking him to sleep. She sat beside him, swinging the hammock to and fro, and singing a lullaby. When he raised himself she pushed him back and said that the baby must finish its nap."}, {"size": 702, "text": "\u201cBut I want to see the gentleman with the fiend inside of him,\u201d said Rowland. \u201cWhat is a fiend?\u201d Bessie demanded. \u201cIt \u2018s only Mr. Hudson.\u201d \u201cVery well, I want to see him.\u201d \u201cOh, never mind him!\u201d said Bessie, with the brevity of contempt. \u201cYou speak as if you did n\u2019t like him.\u201d \u201cI don\u2019t!\u201d Bessie affirmed, and put Rowland to bed again. The hammock was swung at the end of the veranda, in the thickest shade of the vines, and this fragment of dialogue had passed unnoticed. Rowland submitted a while longer to be cradled, and contented himself with listening to Mr. Hudson\u2019s voice. It was a soft and not altogether masculine organ, and was pitched on this occasion in a somewhat plaintive and pettish key."}, {"size": 612, "text": "The young man\u2019s mood seemed fretful; he complained of the heat, of the dust, of a shoe that hurt him, of having gone on an errand a mile to the other side of the town and found the person he was in search of had left Northampton an hour before. \u201cWon\u2019t you have a cup of tea?\u201d Cecilia asked. \u201cPerhaps that will restore your equanimity.\u201d \u201cAye, by keeping me awake all night!\u201d said Hudson. \u201cAt the best, it \u2018s hard enough to go down to the office. With my nerves set on edge by a sleepless night, I should perforce stay at home and be brutal to my poor mother.\u201d \u201cYour mother is well, I hope.\u201d \u201cOh, she \u2018s as usual.\u201d"}, {"size": 654, "text": "\u201cShe \u2018s as usual, too.

Rowland was struck at first only with its responsive vivacity, but in a short time he perceived it was remarkably handsome. The features were admirably chiseled and finished, and a frank smile played over them as gracefully as a breeze among flowers. The fault of the young man\u2019s whole structure was an excessive want of breadth. The forehead, though it was high and rounded, was narrow; the jaw and the shoulders were narrow; and the result was an air of insufficient physical substance. But Mallet afterwards learned that this fair, slim youth could draw indefinitely upon a mysterious fund of nervous force, which outlasted and outwearied the endurance of many a sturdier temperament."}, {"size": 777, "text": "And certainly there was life enough in his eye to furnish an immortality! It was a generous dark gray eye, in which there came and went a sort of kindling glow, which would have made a ruder visage striking, and which gave at times to Hudson\u2019s harmonious face an altogether extraordinary beauty. There was to Rowland\u2019s sympathetic sense a slightly pitiful disparity between the young sculptor\u2019s delicate countenance and the shabby gentility of his costume. He was dressed for a visit--a visit to a pretty woman. He was clad from head to foot in a white linen suit, which had never been remarkable for the felicity of its cut, and had now quite lost that crispness which garments of this complexion can as ill spare as the back-scene of a theatre the radiance of the footlights."}, {"size": 839, "text": "He wore a vivid blue cravat, passed through a ring altogether too splendid to be valuable; he pulled and twisted, as he sat, a pair of yellow kid gloves; he emphasized his conversation with great dashes and flourishes of a light, silver-tipped walking-stick, and he kept constantly taking off and putting on one of those slouched sombreros which are the traditional property of the Virginian or Carolinian of romance. When this was on, he was very picturesque, in spite of his mock elegance; and when it was off, and he sat nursing it and turning it about and not knowing what to do with it, he could hardly be said to be awkward. He evidently had a natural relish for brilliant accessories, and appropriated what came to his hand. This was visible in his talk, which abounded in the florid and sonorous. He liked words with color in them."}, {"size": 714, "text": "Rowland, who was but a moderate talker, sat by in silence, while Cecilia, who had told him that she desired his opinion upon her friend, used a good deal of characteristic finesse in leading the young man to expose himself. She perfectly succeeded, and Hudson rattled away for an hour with a volubility in which boyish unconsciousness and manly shrewdness were singularly combined. He gave his opinion on twenty topics, he opened up an endless budget of local gossip, he described his repulsive routine at the office of Messrs. Striker and Spooner, counselors at law, and he gave with great felicity and gusto an account of the annual boat-race between Harvard and Yale, which he had lately witnessed at Worcester."}, {"size": 758, "text": "He had looked at the straining oarsmen and the swaying crowd with the eye of the sculptor.

Show Mr. Mallet how Mr. Striker read the Declaration of Independence.\u201d Hudson, like most men with a turn for the plastic arts, was an excellent mimic, and he represented with a great deal of humor the accent and attitude of a pompous country lawyer sustaining the burden of this customary episode of our national festival."}, {"size": 659, "text": "The sonorous twang, the see-saw gestures, the odd pronunciation, were vividly depicted.

He wondered whether his cousin was not sacrificing the faculty of reverence in her clever protege to her need for amusement. Hudson made no serious rejoinder to Rowland\u2019s compliment on his statuette until he rose to go. Rowland wondered whether he had forgotten it, and supposed that the oversight was a sign of the natural self-sufficiency of genius.

The artist performs great feats, in a dream. We must not wake him up, lest he should lose his balance.\u201d \u201cOh, when he \u2018s back in bed again!\u201d Hudson answered with a laugh. \u201cYes, call it a dream.

His mother is a widow, of a Massachusetts country family, a little timid, tremulous woman, who is always on pins and needles about her son. She had some property herself, and married a Virginian gentleman of good estates. He turned out, I believe, a very licentious personage, and made great havoc in their fortune.

I remember him, later; he was an ugly, sturdy, practical lad, very different from his brother, and in his way, I imagine, a very fine fellow.

He grew up a la grace de Dieu, and was horribly spoiled. Three or four years ago he graduated at a small college in this neighborhood, where I am afraid he had given a good deal more attention to novels and billiards than to mathematics and Greek. Since then he has been reading law, at the rate of a page a day. If he is ever admitted to practice I \u2018m afraid my friendship won\u2019t avail to make me give him my business.

Then his mother, as she one day confessed to me, has a holy horror of a profession which consists exclusively, as she supposes, in making figures of people without their clothes on.

Roderick was acutely sensitive, and Rowland\u2019s tranquil commendation had stilled his restless pulses. He was ruminating the full-flavored verdict of culture.

Rowland was amused, and wondered what it was that made this ill-mannered speech seem perfectly inoffensive on Roderick\u2019s lips.

They stopped at a large white house, flanked with melancholy hemlocks, and passed through a little front garden, paved with moss-coated bricks and ornamented with parterres bordered with high box hedges.

Roderick\u2019s studio was behind, in the basement; a large, empty room, with the paper peeling off the walls. This represented, in the fashion of fifty years ago, a series of small fantastic landscapes of a hideous pattern, and the young sculptor had presumably torn it away in great scraps, in moments of aesthetic exasperation. On a board in a corner was a heap of clay, and on the floor, against the wall, stood some dozen medallions, busts, and figures, in various stages of completion."}, {"size": 645, "text": "To exhibit them Roderick had to place them one by one on the end of a long packing-box, which served as a pedestal. He did so silently, making no explanations, and looking at them himself with a strange air of quickened curiosity. Most of the things were portraits; and the three at which he looked longest were finished busts. One was a colossal head of a negro, tossed back, defiant, with distended nostrils; one was the portrait of a young man whom Rowland immediately perceived, by the resemblance, to be his deceased brother; the last represented a gentleman with a pointed nose, a long, shaved upper lip, and a tuft on the end of his chin."}, {"size": 636, "text": "This was a face peculiarly unadapted to sculpture; but as a piece of modeling it was the best, and it was admirable. It reminded Rowland in its homely veracity, its artless artfulness, of the works of the early Italian Renaissance. On the pedestal was cut the name--Barnaby Striker, Esq. Rowland remembered that this was the appellation of the legal luminary from whom his companion had undertaken to borrow a reflected ray, and although in the bust there was naught flagrantly set down in malice, it betrayed, comically to one who could relish the secret, that the features of the original had often been scanned with an irritated eye."}, {"size": 649, "text": "Besides these there were several rough studies of the nude, and two or three figures of a fanciful kind. The most noticeable (and it had singular beauty) was a small modeled design for a sepulchral monument; that, evidently, of Stephen Hudson. The young soldier lay sleeping eternally, with his hand on his sword, like an old crusader in a Gothic cathedral. Rowland made no haste to pronounce; too much depended on his judgment. \u201cUpon my word,\u201d cried Hudson at last, \u201cthey seem to me very good.\u201d And in truth, as Rowland looked, he saw they were good. They were youthful, awkward, and ignorant; the effort, often, was more apparent than the success."}, {"size": 697, "text": "But the effort was signally powerful and intelligent; it seemed to Rowland that it needed only to let itself go to compass great things. Here and there, too, success, when grasped, had something masterly. Rowland turned to his companion, who stood with his hands in his pockets and his hair very much crumpled, looking at him askance. The light of admiration was in Rowland\u2019s eyes, and it speedily kindled a wonderful illumination on Hudson\u2019s handsome brow. Rowland said at last, gravely, \u201cYou have only to work!\u201d \u201cI think I know what that means,\u201d Roderick answered.

When his companion had left him he went in search of Cecilia. She was sitting at work at a shady window, and welcomed him to a low chintz-covered chair.

I don\u2019t say he is of a more useful metal than other people, but he is of a different one. Of course, however, that I shall miss him sadly is not a reason for his not going to seek his fortune. Men must work and women must weep!\u201d \u201cDecidedly not!\u201d said Rowland, with a good deal of emphasis. He had suspected from the first hour of his stay that Cecilia had treated herself to a private social luxury; he had then discovered that she found it in Hudson\u2019s lounging visits and boyish chatter, and he had felt himself wondering at last whether, judiciously viewed, her gain in the matter was not the young man\u2019s loss."}, {"size": 849, "text": "It was evident that Cecilia was not judicious, and that her good sense, habitually rigid under the demands of domestic economy, indulged itself with a certain agreeable laxity on this particular point. She liked her young friend just as he was; she humored him, flattered him, laughed at him, caressed him--did everything but advise him. It was a flirtation without the benefits of a flirtation. She was too old to let him fall in love with her, which might have done him good; and her inclination was to keep him young, so that the nonsense he talked might never transgress a certain line. It was quite conceivable that poor Cecilia should relish a pastime; but if one had philanthropically embraced the idea that something considerable might be made of Roderick, it was impossible not to see that her friendship was not what might be called tonic."}, {"size": 660, "text": "So Rowland reflected, in the glow of his new-born sympathy.

I only think that circumstances, with our young man, have a great influence; as is proved by the fact that although he has been fuming and fretting here for the last five years, he has nevertheless managed to make the best of it, and found it easy, on the whole, to vegetate.

At the table, near the candles, busy with a substantial piece of needle-work, sat the young girl of whom he had had a moment\u2019s quickened glimpse in Roderick\u2019s studio, and whom he had learned to be Miss Garland, his companion\u2019s kinswoman.

She was a small, eager woman, with a pale, troubled face, which added to her apparent age.

In fact, he had spoken from the simplest of motives.

Roderick, thus far, had justified his confidence and flattered his perspicacity; he was rapidly unfolding into an ideal brilliancy. He was changed even more than he himself suspected; he had stepped, without faltering, into his birthright, and was spending money, intellectually, as lavishly as a young heir who has just won an obstructive lawsuit."}, {"size": 865, "text": "Roderick\u2019s glance and voice were the same, doubtless, as when they enlivened the summer dusk on Cecilia\u2019s veranda, but in his person, generally, there was an indefinable expression of experience rapidly and easily assimilated.

He had not been, for instance, half an hour on English soil before he perceived that he was dressed like a rustic, and he had immediately reformed his toilet with the most unerring tact. His appetite for novelty was insatiable, and for everything characteristically foreign, as it presented itself, he had an extravagant greeting; but in half an hour the novelty had faded, he had guessed the secret, he had plucked out the heart of the mystery and was clamoring for a keener sensation."}, {"size": 655, "text": "At the end of a month, he presented, mentally, a puzzling spectacle to his companion.

He had a relish for social subtleties and mysteries, and, in perception, when occasion offered him an inch he never failed to take an ell. A single glimpse of a social situation of the elder type enabled him to construct the whole, with all its complex chiaroscuro, and Rowland more than once assured him that he made him believe in the metempsychosis, and that he must have lived in European society, in the last century, as a gentleman in a cocked hat and brocaded waistcoat."}, {"size": 650, "text": "Hudson asked Rowland questions which poor Rowland was quite unable to answer, and of which he was equally unable to conceive where he had picked up the data. Roderick ended by answering them himself, tolerably to his satisfaction, and in a short time he had almost turned the tables and become in their walks and talks the accredited source of information. Rowland told him that when he turned sculptor a capital novelist was spoiled, and that to match his eye for social detail one would have to go to Honore de Balzac. In all this Rowland took a generous pleasure; he felt an especial kindness for his comrade\u2019s radiant youthfulness of temperament."}, {"size": 655, "text": "He was so much younger than he himself had ever been! And surely youth and genius, hand in hand, were the most beautiful sight in the world. Roderick added to this the charm of his more immediately personal qualities. The vivacity of his perceptions, the audacity of his imagination, the picturesqueness of his phrase when he was pleased,--and even more when he was displeased,--his abounding good-humor, his candor, his unclouded frankness, his unfailing impulse to share every emotion and impression with his friend; all this made comradeship a pure felicity, and interfused with a deeper amenity their long evening talks at cafe doors in Italian towns."}, {"size": 623, "text": "They had gone almost immediately to Paris, and had spent their days at the Louvre and their evenings at the theatre. Roderick was divided in mind as to whether Titian or Mademoiselle Delaporte was the greater artist. They had come down through France to Genoa and Milan, had spent a fortnight in Venice and another in Florence, and had now been a month in Rome. Roderick had said that he meant to spend three months in simply looking, absorbing, and reflecting, without putting pencil to paper. He looked indefatigably, and certainly saw great things--things greater, doubtless, at times, than the intentions of the artist."}, {"size": 842, "text": "And yet he made few false steps and wasted little time in theories of what he ought to like and to dislike. He judged instinctively and passionately, but never vulgarly. At Venice, for a couple of days, he had half a fit of melancholy over the pretended discovery that he had missed his way, and that the only proper vestment of plastic conceptions was the coloring of Titian and Paul Veronese. Then one morning the two young men had themselves rowed out to Torcello, and Roderick lay back for a couple of hours watching a brown-breasted gondolier making superb muscular movements, in high relief, against the sky of the Adriatic, and at the end jerked himself up with a violence that nearly swamped the gondola, and declared that the only thing worth living for was to make a colossal bronze and set it aloft in the light of a public square."}, {"size": 617, "text": "In Rome his first care was for the Vatican; he went there again and again. But the old imperial and papal city altogether delighted him; only there he really found what he had been looking for from the first--the complete antipodes of Northampton.

It is the immemorial city of convention. The stagnant Roman air is charged with convention; it colors the yellow light and deepens the chilly shadows."}, {"size": 750, "text": "And in that still recent day the most impressive convention in all history was visible to men\u2019s eyes, in the Roman streets, erect in a gilded coach drawn by four black horses. Roderick\u2019s first fortnight was a high aesthetic revel. He declared that Rome made him feel and understand more things than he could express: he was sure that life must have there, for all one\u2019s senses, an incomparable fineness; that more interesting things must happen to one than anywhere else. And he gave Rowland to understand that he meant to live freely and largely, and be as interested as occasion demanded.

Rowland took immense satisfaction in his companion\u2019s deep impatience to make something of all his impressions. Some of these indeed found their way into a channel which did not lead to statues, but it was none the less a safe one. He wrote frequent long letters to Miss Garland; when Rowland went with him to post them he thought wistfully of the fortune of the great loosely-written missives, which cost Roderick unconscionable sums in postage."}, {"size": 663, "text": "He received punctual answers of a more frugal form, written in a clear, minute hand, on paper vexatiously thin.

For the rest he let the days go by unprotestingly, and enjoyed Roderick\u2019s serene efflorescence as he would have done a beautiful summer sunrise. Rome, for the past month, had been delicious. The annual descent of the Goths had not yet begun, and sunny leisure seemed to brood over the city.

One was a woman of middle age, with a rather grand air and a great many furbelows.

She had such an expansive majesty of mien that Rowland supposed she must have some proprietary right in the villa and was not just then in a hospitable mood. Beside her walked a little elderly man, tightly buttoned in a shabby black coat, but with a flower in his lappet, and a pair of soiled light gloves."}, {"size": 686, "text": "He was a grotesque-looking personage, and might have passed for a gentleman of the old school, reduced by adversity to playing cicerone to foreigners of distinction.

He was smiling with extreme urbanity, and talking in a low, mellifluous voice to the lady, who evidently was not listening to him. At a considerable distance behind this couple strolled a young girl, apparently of about twenty.

He stepped along stiffly and solemnly beside his mistress, with an air of conscious elegance. There was something at first slightly ridiculous in the sight of a young lady gravely appended to an animal of these incongruous attributes, and Roderick, with his customary frankness, greeted the spectacle with a confident smile. The young girl perceived it and turned her face full upon him, with a gaze intended apparently to enforce greater deference."}, {"size": 626, "text": "It was not deference, however, her face provoked, but startled, submissive admiration; Roderick\u2019s smile fell dead, and he sat eagerly staring. A pair of extraordinary dark blue eyes, a mass of dusky hair over a low forehead, a blooming oval of perfect purity, a flexible lip, just touched with disdain, the step and carriage of a tired princess--these were the general features of his vision. The young lady was walking slowly and letting her long dress rustle over the gravel; the young men had time to see her distinctly before she averted her face and went her way. She left a vague, sweet perfume behind her as she passed."}, {"size": 698, "text": "\u201cImmortal powers!\u201d cried Roderick, \u201cwhat a vision!

Roderick went to work and spent a month shut up in his studio; he had an idea, and he was not to rest till he had embodied it.

Rowland had found a convenient corner in a stately old palace not far from the Fountain of Trevi, and made himself a home to which books and pictures and prints and odds and ends of curious furniture gave an air of leisurely permanence.

But Rowland had two substantial aids for giving patience the air of contentment: he was an inquisitive reader and a passionate rider.

He took to evening parties as a duck to water, and before the winter was half over was the most freely and frequently discussed young man in the heterogeneous foreign colony. Rowland\u2019s theory of his own duty was to let him run his course and play his cards, only holding himself ready to point out shoals and pitfalls, and administer a friendly propulsion through tight places. Roderick\u2019s manners on the precincts of the Pincian were quite the same as his manners on Cecilia\u2019s veranda: that is, they were no manners at all."}, {"size": 603, "text": "But it remained as true as before that it would have been impossible, on the whole, to violate ceremony with less of lasting offense. He interrupted, he contradicted, he spoke to people he had never seen, and left his social creditors without the smallest conversational interest on their loans; he lounged and yawned, he talked loud when he should have talked low, and low when he should have talked loud. Many people, in consequence, thought him insufferably conceited, and declared that he ought to wait till he had something to show for his powers, before he assumed the airs of a spoiled celebrity."}, {"size": 698, "text": "But to Rowland and to most friendly observers this judgment was quite beside the mark, and the young man\u2019s undiluted naturalness was its own justification. He was impulsive, spontaneous, sincere; there were so many people at dinner-tables and in studios who were not, that it seemed worth while to allow this rare specimen all possible freedom of action. If Roderick took the words out of your mouth when you were just prepared to deliver them with the most effective accent, he did it with a perfect good conscience and with no pretension of a better right to being heard, but simply because he was full to overflowing of his own momentary thought and it sprang from his lips without asking leave."}, {"size": 687, "text": "There were persons who waited on your periods much more deferentially, who were a hundred times more capable than Roderick of a reflective impertinence. Roderick received from various sources, chiefly feminine, enough finely-adjusted advice to have established him in life as an embodiment of the proprieties, and he received it, as he afterwards listened to criticisms on his statues, with unfaltering candor and good-humor. Here and there, doubtless, as he went, he took in a reef in his sail; but he was too adventurous a spirit to be successfully tamed, and he remained at most points the florid, rather strident young Virginian whose serene inflexibility had been the despair of Mr."}, {"size": 676, "text": "Striker.

Afterwards, when those who loved him were in tears, there was something in all this unspotted comeliness that seemed to lend a mockery to the causes of their sorrow. Certainly, among the young men of genius who, for so many ages, have gone up to Rome to test their powers, none ever made a fairer beginning than Roderick."}, {"size": 631, "text": "He rode his two horses at once with extraordinary good fortune; he established the happiest modus vivendi betwixt work and play. He wrestled all day with a mountain of clay in his studio, and chattered half the night away in Roman drawing-rooms. It all seemed part of a kind of divine facility. He was passionately interested, he was feeling his powers; now that they had thoroughly kindled in the glowing aesthetic atmosphere of Rome, the ardent young fellow should be pardoned for believing that he never was to see the end of them. He enjoyed immeasurably, after the chronic obstruction of home, the downright act of production."}, {"size": 673, "text": "He kept models in his studio till they dropped with fatigue; he drew, on other days, at the Capitol and the Vatican, till his own head swam with his eagerness, and his limbs stiffened with the cold.

There were naturally a great many wiseheads who smiled at his precipitancy, and cited him as one more example of Yankee crudity, a capital recruit to the great army of those who wish to dance before they can walk. They were right, but Roderick was right too, for the success of his statue was not to have been foreseen; it partook, really, of the miraculous."}, {"size": 745, "text": "He never surpassed it afterwards, and a good judge here and there has been known to pronounce it the finest piece of sculpture of our modern era. To Rowland it seemed to justify superbly his highest hopes of his friend, and he said to himself that if he had invested his happiness in fostering a genius, he ought now to be in possession of a boundless complacency. There was something especially confident and masterly in the artist\u2019s negligence of all such small picturesque accessories as might serve to label his figure to a vulgar apprehension. If it represented the father of the human race and the primal embodiment of human sensation, it did so in virtue of its look of balanced physical perfection, and deeply, eagerly sentient vitality."}, {"size": 855, "text": "Rowland, in fraternal zeal, traveled up to Carrara and selected at the quarries the most magnificent block of marble he could find, and when it came down to Rome, the two young men had a \u201ccelebration.\u201d They drove out to Albano, breakfasted boisterously (in their respective measure) at the inn, and lounged away the day in the sun on the top of Monte Cavo. Roderick\u2019s head was full of ideas for other works, which he described with infinite spirit and eloquence, as vividly as if they were ranged on their pedestals before him. He had an indefatigable fancy; things he saw in the streets, in the country, things he heard and read, effects he saw just missed or half-expressed in the works of others, acted upon his mind as a kind of challenge, and he was terribly restless until, in some form or other, he had taken up the glove and set his lance in rest."}, {"size": 630, "text": "The Adam was put into marble, and all the world came to see it. Of the criticisms passed upon it this history undertakes to offer no record; over many of them the two young men had a daily laugh for a month, and certain of the formulas of the connoisseurs, restrictive or indulgent, furnished Roderick with a permanent supply of humorous catch-words. But people enough spoke flattering good-sense to make Roderick feel as if he were already half famous. The statue passed formally into Rowland\u2019s possession, and was paid for as if an illustrious name had been chiseled on the pedestal. Poor Roderick owed every franc of the money."}, {"size": 622, "text": "It was not for this, however, but because he was so gloriously in the mood, that, denying himself all breathing-time, on the same day he had given the last touch to the Adam, he began to shape the rough contour of an Eve. This went forward with equal rapidity and success. Roderick lost his temper, time and again, with his models, who offered but a gross, degenerate image of his splendid ideal; but his ideal, as he assured Rowland, became gradually such a fixed, vivid presence, that he had only to shut his eyes to behold a creature far more to his purpose than the poor girl who stood posturing at forty sous an hour."}, {"size": 600, "text": "The Eve was finished in a month, and the feat was extraordinary, as well as the statue, which represented an admirably beautiful woman. When the spring began to muffle the rugged old city with its clambering festoons, it seemed to him that he had done a handsome winter\u2019s work and had fairly earned a holiday. He took a liberal one, and lounged away the lovely Roman May, doing nothing. He looked very contented; with himself, perhaps, at times, a trifle too obviously. But who could have said without good reason? He was \u201cflushed with triumph;\u201d this classic phrase portrayed him, to Rowland\u2019s sense."}, {"size": 670, "text": "He would lose himself in long reveries, and emerge from them with a quickened smile and a heightened color. Rowland grudged him none of his smiles, and took an extreme satisfaction in his two statues. He had the Adam and the Eve transported to his own apartment, and one warm evening in May he gave a little dinner in honor of the artist. It was small, but Rowland had meant it should be very agreeably composed. He thought over his friends and chose four. They were all persons with whom he lived in a certain intimacy. One of them was an American sculptor of French extraction, or remotely, perhaps, of Italian, for he rejoiced in the somewhat fervid name of Gloriani."}, {"size": 612, "text": "He was a man of forty, he had been living for years in Paris and in Rome, and he now drove a very pretty trade in sculpture of the ornamental and fantastic sort. In his youth he had had money; but he had spent it recklessly, much of it scandalously, and at twenty-six had found himself obliged to make capital of his talent. This was quite inimitable, and fifteen years of indefatigable exercise had brought it to perfection. Rowland admitted its power, though it gave him very little pleasure; what he relished in the man was the extraordinary vivacity and frankness, not to call it the impudence, of his ideas."}, {"size": 676, "text": "He had a definite, practical scheme of art, and he knew at least what he meant. In this sense he was solid and complete. There were so many of the aesthetic fraternity who were floundering in unknown seas, without a notion of which way their noses were turned, that Gloriani, conscious and compact, unlimitedly intelligent and consummately clever, dogmatic only as to his own duties, and at once gracefully deferential and profoundly indifferent to those of others, had for Rowland a certain intellectual refreshment quite independent of the character of his works. These were considered by most people to belong to a very corrupt, and by many to a positively indecent school."}, {"size": 751, "text": "Others thought them tremendously knowing, and paid enormous prices for them; and indeed, to be able to point to one of Gloriani\u2019s figures in a shady corner of your library was tolerable proof that you were not a fool. Corrupt things they certainly were; in the line of sculpture they were quite the latest fruit of time. It was the artist\u2019s opinion that there is no essential difference between beauty and ugliness; that they overlap and intermingle in a quite inextricable manner; that there is no saying where one begins and the other ends; that hideousness grimaces at you suddenly from out of the very bosom of loveliness, and beauty blooms before your eyes in the lap of vileness; that it is a waste of wit to nurse metaphysical distinctions, and"}, {"size": 692, "text": "a sadly meagre entertainment to caress imaginary lines; that the thing to aim at is the expressive, and the way to reach it is by ingenuity; that for this purpose everything may serve, and that a consummate work is a sort of hotch-potch of the pure and the impure, the graceful and the grotesque. Its prime duty is to amuse, to puzzle, to fascinate, to savor of a complex imagination. Gloriani\u2019s statues were florid and meretricious; they looked like magnified goldsmith\u2019s work. They were extremely elegant, but they had no charm for Rowland. He never bought one, but Gloriani was such an honest fellow, and withal was so deluged with orders, that this made no difference in their friendship."}, {"size": 826, "text": "The artist might have passed for a Frenchman. He was a great talker, and a very picturesque one; he was almost bald; he had a small, bright eye, a broken nose, and a moustache with waxed ends. When sometimes he received you at his lodging, he introduced you to a lady with a plain face whom he called Madame Gloriani--which she was not. Rowland\u2019s second guest was also an artist, but of a very different type. His friends called him Sam Singleton; he was an American, and he had been in Rome a couple of years. He painted small landscapes, chiefly in water-colors: Rowland had seen one of them in a shop window, had liked it extremely, and, ascertaining his address, had gone to see him and found him established in a very humble studio near the Piazza Barberini, where, apparently, fame and fortune had not yet found him out."}, {"size": 646, "text": "Rowland took a fancy to him and bought several of his pictures; Singleton made few speeches, but was grateful. Rowland heard afterwards that when he first came to Rome he painted worthless daubs and gave no promise of talent. Improvement had come, however, hand in hand with patient industry, and his talent, though of a slender and delicate order, was now incontestable. It was as yet but scantily recognized, and he had hard work to live. Rowland hung his little water-colors on the parlor wall, and found that, as he lived with them, he grew very fond of them. Singleton was a diminutive, dwarfish personage; he looked like a precocious child."}, {"size": 606, "text": "He had a high, protuberant forehead, a transparent brown eye, a perpetual smile, an extraordinary expression of modesty and patience. He listened much more willingly than he talked, with a little fixed, grateful grin; he blushed when he spoke, and always offered his ideas in a sidelong fashion, as if the presumption were against them. His modesty set them off, and they were eminently to the point. He was so perfect an example of the little noiseless, laborious artist whom chance, in the person of a moneyed patron, has never taken by the hand, that Rowland would have liked to befriend him by stealth."}, {"size": 823, "text": "Singleton had expressed a fervent admiration for Roderick\u2019s productions, but had not yet met the young master. Roderick was lounging against the chimney-piece when he came in, and Rowland presently introduced him. The little water-colorist stood with folded hands, blushing, smiling, and looking up at him as if Roderick were himself a statue on a pedestal. Singleton began to murmur something about his pleasure, his admiration; the desire to make his compliment smoothly gave him a kind of grotesque formalism. Roderick looked down at him surprised, and suddenly burst into a laugh. Singleton paused a moment and then, with an intenser smile, went on: \u201cWell, sir, your statues are beautiful, all the same!\u201d Rowland\u2019s two other guests were ladies, and one of them, Miss Blanchard, belonged also to the artistic fraternity."}, {"size": 643, "text": "She was an American, she was young, she was pretty, and she had made her way to Rome alone and unaided. She lived alone, or with no other duenna than a bushy-browed old serving-woman, though indeed she had a friendly neighbor in the person of a certain Madame Grandoni, who in various social emergencies lent her a protecting wing, and had come with her to Rowland\u2019s dinner. Miss Blanchard had a little money, but she was not above selling her pictures. These represented generally a bunch of dew-sprinkled roses, with the dew-drops very highly finished, or else a wayside shrine, and a peasant woman, with her back turned, kneeling before it."}, {"size": 625, "text": "She did backs very well, but she was a little weak in faces. Flowers, however, were her speciality, and though her touch was a little old-fashioned and finical, she painted them with remarkable skill. Her pictures were chiefly bought by the English. Rowland had made her acquaintance early in the winter, and as she kept a saddle horse and rode a great deal, he had asked permission to be her cavalier. In this way they had become almost intimate. Miss Blanchard\u2019s name was Augusta; she was slender, pale, and elegant looking; she had a very pretty head and brilliant auburn hair, which she braided with classical simplicity."}, {"size": 614, "text": "She talked in a sweet, soft voice, used language at times a trifle superfine, and made literary allusions. These had often a patriotic strain, and Rowland had more than once been irritated by her quotations from Mrs. Sigourney in the cork-woods of Monte Mario, and from Mr. Willis among the ruins of Veii. Rowland was of a dozen different minds about her, and was half surprised, at times, to find himself treating it as a matter of serious moment whether he liked her or not. He admired her, and indeed there was something admirable in her combination of beauty and talent, of isolation and tranquil self-support."}, {"size": 616, "text": "He used sometimes to go into the little, high-niched, ordinary room which served her as a studio, and find her working at a panel six inches square, at an open casement, profiled against the deep blue Roman sky. She received him with a meek-eyed dignity that made her seem like a painted saint on a church window, receiving the daylight in all her being. The breath of reproach passed her by with folded wings. And yet Rowland wondered why he did not like her better. If he failed, the reason was not far to seek. There was another woman whom he liked better, an image in his heart which refused to yield precedence."}, {"size": 621, "text": "On that evening to which allusion has been made, when Rowland was left alone between the starlight and the waves with the sudden knowledge that Mary Garland was to become another man\u2019s wife, he had made, after a while, the simple resolution to forget her. And every day since, like a famous philosopher who wished to abbreviate his mourning for a faithful servant, he had said to himself in substance--\u201cRemember to forget Mary Garland.\u201d Sometimes it seemed as if he were succeeding; then, suddenly, when he was least expecting it, he would find her name, inaudibly, on his lips, and seem to see her eyes meeting his eyes."}, {"size": 821, "text": "All this made him uncomfortable, and seemed to portend a possible discord. Discord was not to his taste; he shrank from imperious passions, and the idea of finding himself jealous of an unsuspecting friend was absolutely repulsive. More than ever, then, the path of duty was to forget Mary Garland, and he cultivated oblivion, as we may say, in the person of Miss Blanchard. Her fine temper, he said to himself, was a trifle cold and conscious, her purity prudish, perhaps, her culture pedantic. But since he was obliged to give up hopes of Mary Garland, Providence owed him a compensation, and he had fits of angry sadness in which it seemed to him that to attest his right to sentimental satisfaction he would be capable of falling in love with a woman he absolutely detested, if she were the best that came in his way."}, {"size": 675, "text": "And what was the use, after all, of bothering about a possible which was only, perhaps, a dream? Even if Mary Garland had been free, what right had he to assume that he would have pleased her? The actual was good enough. Miss Blanchard had beautiful hair, and if she was a trifle old-maidish, there is nothing like matrimony for curing old-maidishness. Madame Grandoni, who had formed with the companion of Rowland\u2019s rides an alliance which might have been called defensive on the part of the former and attractive on that of Miss Blanchard, was an excessively ugly old lady, highly esteemed in Roman society for her homely benevolence and her shrewd and humorous good sense."}, {"size": 655, "text": "She had been the widow of a German archaeologist, who had come to Rome in the early ages as an attache of the Prussian legation on the Capitoline. Her good sense had been wanting on but a single occasion, that of her second marriage. This occasion was certainly a momentous one, but these, by common consent, are not test cases. A couple of years after her first husband\u2019s death, she had accepted the hand and the name of a Neapolitan music-master, ten years younger than herself, and with no fortune but his fiddle-bow. The marriage was most unhappy, and the Maestro Grandoni was suspected of using the fiddle-bow as an instrument of conjugal correction."}, {"size": 860, "text": "He had finally run off with a prima donna assoluta, who, it was to be hoped, had given him a taste of the quality implied in her title. He was believed to be living still, but he had shrunk to a small black spot in Madame Grandoni\u2019s life, and for ten years she had not mentioned his name. She wore a light flaxen wig, which was never very artfully adjusted, but this mattered little, as she made no secret of it. She used to say, \u201cI was not always so ugly as this; as a young girl I had beautiful golden hair, very much the color of my wig.\u201d She had worn from time immemorial an old blue satin dress, and a white crape shawl embroidered in colors; her appearance was ridiculous, but she had an interminable Teutonic pedigree, and her manners, in every presence, were easy and jovial, as became a lady whose ancestor had been cup-bearer to Frederick Barbarossa."}, {"size": 626, "text": "Thirty years\u2019 observation of Roman society had sharpened her wits and given her an inexhaustible store of anecdotes, but she had beneath her crumpled bodice a deep-welling fund of Teutonic sentiment, which she communicated only to the objects of her particular favor. Rowland had a great regard for her, and she repaid it by wishing him to get married. She never saw him without whispering to him that Augusta Blanchard was just the girl. It seemed to Rowland a sort of foreshadowing of matrimony to see Miss Blanchard standing gracefully on his hearth-rug and blooming behind the central bouquet at his circular dinner-table."}, {"size": 689, "text": "The dinner was very prosperous and Roderick amply filled his position as hero of the feast. He had always an air of buoyant enjoyment in his work, but on this occasion he manifested a good deal of harmless pleasure in his glory. He drank freely and talked bravely; he leaned back in his chair with his hands in his pockets, and flung open the gates of his eloquence. Singleton sat gazing and listening open-mouthed, as if Apollo in person were talking. Gloriani showed a twinkle in his eye and an evident disposition to draw Roderick out. Rowland was rather regretful, for he knew that theory was not his friend\u2019s strong point, and that it was never fair to take his measure from his talk."}, {"size": 636, "text": "\u201cAs you have begun with Adam and Eve,\u201d said Gloriani, \u201cI suppose you are going straight through the Bible.\u201d He was one of the persons who thought Roderick delightfully fresh. \u201cI may make a David,\u201d said Roderick, \u201cbut I shall not try any more of the Old Testament people. I don\u2019t like the Jews; I don\u2019t like pendulous noses. David, the boy David, is rather an exception; you can think of him and treat him as a young Greek.

But Roderick\u2019s allusions were ambiguous, and it was possible they might simply mean that he was out of patience with a frivolous way of life and fretting wholesomely over his absent work. It was a very good thing, certainly, that idleness should prove, on experiment, to sit heavily on his conscience."}, {"size": 814, "text": "Nevertheless, the letter needed, to Rowland\u2019s mind, a key: the key arrived a week later. \u201cIn common charity,\u201d Roderick wrote, \u201clend me a hundred pounds!

Send me the money first; lecture me afterwards!\u201d Rowland sent the money by return of mail; then he proceeded, not to lecture, but to think. He hung his head; he was acutely disappointed. He had no right to be, he assured himself; but so it was. Roderick was young, impulsive, unpracticed in stoicism; it was a hundred to one that he was to pay the usual vulgar tribute to folly.

The answer came promptly; it ran as follows: \u201cSend me another fifty pounds! I have been back to the tables. I will leave as soon as the money comes, and meet you at Geneva.

He had arrived late the night before; he looked tired, and yet flushed and excited. He made no professions of penitence, but he practiced an unmitigated frankness, and his self-reprobation might be taken for granted.

He had fallen in with some very idle people, and had discovered that a little example and a little practice were capable of producing on his own part a considerable relish for their diversions. What could he do? He never read, and he had no studio; in one way or another he had to pass the time. He passed it in dangling about several very pretty women in wonderful Paris toilets, and reflected that it was always something gained for a sculptor to sit under a tree, looking at his leisure into a charming face and saying things that made it smile and play its muscles and part its lips and show its teeth."}, {"size": 808, "text": "Attached to these ladies were certain gentlemen who walked about in clouds of perfume, rose at midday, and supped at midnight. Roderick had found himself in the mood for thinking them very amusing fellows. He was surprised at his own taste, but he let it take its course. It led him to the discovery that to live with ladies who expect you to present them with expensive bouquets, to ride with them in the Black Forest on well-looking horses, to come into their opera-boxes on nights when Patti sang and prices were consequent, to propose little light suppers at the Conversation House after the opera or drives by moonlight to the Castle, to be always arrayed and anointed, trinketed and gloved,--that to move in such society, we say, though it might be a privilege, was a privilege with a penalty attached."}, {"size": 622, "text": "But the tables made such things easy; half the Baden world lived by the tables. Roderick tried them and found that at first they smoothed his path delightfully. This simplification of matters, however, was only momentary, for he soon perceived that to seem to have money, and to have it in fact, exposed a good-looking young man to peculiar liabilities. At this point of his friend\u2019s narrative, Rowland was reminded of Madame de Cruchecassee in The Newcomes, and though he had listened in tranquil silence to the rest of it, he found it hard not to say that all this had been, under the circumstances, a very bad business."}, {"size": 768, "text": "Roderick admitted it with bitterness, and then told how much--measured simply financially--it had cost him. His luck had changed; the tables had ceased to back him, and he had found himself up to his knees in debt.

He had been an ass, but it was not irreparable; he could make another statue in a couple of months. Rowland frowned. \u201cFor heaven\u2019s sake,\u201d he said, \u201cdon\u2019t play such dangerous games with your facility. If you have got facility, revere it, respect it, adore it, treasure it--don\u2019t speculate on it.\u201d And he wondered what his companion, up to his knees in debt, would have done if there had been no good-natured Rowland Mallet to lend a helping hand."}, {"size": 689, "text": "But he did not formulate his curiosity audibly, and the contingency seemed not to have presented itself to Roderick\u2019s imagination. The young sculptor reverted to his late adventures again in the evening, and this time talked of them more objectively, as the phrase is; more as if they had been the adventures of another person. He related half a dozen droll things that had happened to him, and, as if his responsibility had been disengaged by all this free discussion, he laughed extravagantly at the memory of them. Rowland sat perfectly grave, on principle. Then Roderick began to talk of half a dozen statues that he had in his head, and set forth his design, with his usual vividness."}, {"size": 634, "text": "Suddenly, as it was relevant, he declared that his Baden doings had not been altogether fruitless, for that the lady who had reminded Rowland of Madame de Cruchecassee was tremendously statuesque.

It all depends upon circumstances. I believe there is a certain group of circumstances possible for every man, in which his will is destined to snap like a dry twig.\u201d \u201cMy dear boy,\u201d said Rowland, \u201cdon\u2019t talk about the will being \u2018destined.\u2019 The will is destiny itself."}, {"size": 620, "text": "That \u2018s the way to look at it.\u201d \u201cLook at it, my dear Rowland,\u201d Roderick answered, \u201cas you find most comfortable.

He was unwilling to admit even to himself that this speech had really the sinister meaning it seemed to have. In a few days the two young men made their way back to Italy, and lingered a while in Florence before going on to Rome."}, {"size": 671, "text": "In Florence Roderick seemed to have won back his old innocence and his preference for the pleasures of study over any others. Rowland began to think of the Baden episode as a bad dream, or at the worst as a mere sporadic piece of disorder, without roots in his companion\u2019s character. They passed a fortnight looking at pictures and exploring for out the way bits of fresco and carving, and Roderick recovered all his earlier fervor of appreciation and comment. In Rome he went eagerly to work again, and finished in a month two or three small things he had left standing on his departure. He talked the most joyous nonsense about finding himself back in his old quarters."}, {"size": 658, "text": "On the first Sunday afternoon following their return, on their going together to Saint Peter\u2019s, he delivered himself of a lyrical greeting to the great church and to the city in general, in a tone of voice so irrepressibly elevated that it rang through the nave in rather a scandalous fashion, and almost arrested a procession of canons who were marching across to the choir. He began to model a new statue--a female figure, of which he had said nothing to Rowland. It represented a woman, leaning lazily back in her chair, with her head drooping as if she were listening, a vague smile on her lips, and a pair of remarkably beautiful arms folded in her lap."}, {"size": 683, "text": "With rather less softness of contour, it would have resembled the noble statue of Agrippina in the Capitol. Rowland looked at it and was not sure he liked it. \u201cWho is it? what does it mean?\u201d he asked. \u201cAnything you please!\u201d said Roderick, with a certain petulance. \u201cI call it A Reminiscence.\u201d Rowland then remembered that one of the Baden ladies had been \u201cstatuesque,\u201d and asked no more questions. This, after all, was a way of profiting by experience. A few days later he took his first ride of the season on the Campagna, and as, on his homeward way, he was passing across the long shadow of a ruined tower, he perceived a small figure at a short distance, bent over a sketch-book."}, {"size": 601, "text": "As he drew near, he recognized his friend Singleton. The honest little painter\u2019s face was scorched to flame-color by the light of southern suns, and borrowed an even deeper crimson from his gleeful greeting of his most appreciative patron.

On Rowland\u2019s asking him how he had spent his summer, he gave an account of his wanderings which made poor Mallet sigh with a sense of more contrasts than one. He had not been out of Italy, but he had been delving deep into the picturesque heart of the lovely land, and gathering a wonderful store of subjects."}, {"size": 611, "text": "He had rambled about among the unvisited villages of the Apennines, pencil in hand and knapsack on back, sleeping on straw and eating black bread and beans, but feasting on local color, rioting, as it were, on chiaroscuro, and laying up a treasure of pictorial observations. He took a devout satisfaction in his hard-earned wisdom and his happy frugality. Rowland went the next day, by appointment, to look at his sketches, and spent a whole morning turning them over. Singleton talked more than he had ever done before, explained them all, and told some quaintly humorous anecdote about the production of each."}, {"size": 652, "text": "\u201cDear me, how I have chattered!\u201d he said at last. \u201cI am afraid you had rather have looked at the things in peace and quiet.

But somehow, I feel very happy; I feel as if I had improved.\u201d \u201cThat you have,\u201d said Rowland. \u201cI doubt whether an artist ever passed a more profitable three months.

He met a number of his last winter\u2019s friends again, and called upon Madame Grandoni, upon Miss Blanchard, and upon Gloriani, shortly after their return.

He examined the new statue with great deference, said it was very promising, and abstained, considerately, from irritating prophecies.

Don\u2019t you see it yourself, man?\u201d \u201cI don\u2019t particularly like this new statue,\u201d said Rowland. \u201cThat \u2018s because you \u2018re a purist.

My statue looks so bad when I come into the studio that I have twenty minds to smash it on the spot, and I lose three or four hours in sitting there, moping and getting used to it.\u201d Rowland said that he supposed that this sort of thing was the lot of every artist and that the only remedy was plenty of courage and faith.

Their rides were always very long, and Roderick insisted on making them longer by dismounting in picturesque spots and stretching himself in the sun among a heap of overtangled stones. He let the scorching Roman luminary beat down upon him with an equanimity which Rowland found it hard to emulate.

I have shuffled them in a measure out of sight, but I have not corrected them. I can\u2019t--I can\u2019t--I can\u2019t!\u201d he cried passionately. \u201cThey stare me in the face--they are all I see!\u201d Rowland offered several criticisms of detail, and suggested certain practicable changes."}, {"size": 792, "text": "But Roderick differed with him on each of these points; the thing had faults enough, but they were not those faults.

I think of subjects, but they remain mere lifeless names. They are mere words--they are not images.

There was nothing bold in her look; it expressed a kind of languid, imperturbable indifference. Her beauty was extraordinary; it grew and grew as the young man observed her.

If Roderick chose to follow a crooked path, it was no fault of his; he had given him, he would continue to give him, all that he had offered him--friendship, sympathy, advice. He had not undertaken to provide him with unflagging strength of purpose, nor to stand bondsman for unqualified success."}, {"size": 716, "text": "If Rowland felt his roots striking and spreading in the Roman soil, Roderick also surrendered himself with renewed abandon to the local influence.

I am sure the sight of Northampton Main Street would permanently upset me.\u201d It was reassuring to hear that Roderick, in his own view, was but \u201cjust beginning\u201d to spread his wings, and Rowland, if he had had any forebodings, might have suffered them to be modified by this declaration."}, {"size": 784, "text": "This was the first time since their meeting at Geneva that Roderick had mentioned Miss Garland\u2019s name, but the ice being broken, he indulged for some time afterward in frequent allusions to his betrothed, which always had an accent of scrupulous, of almost studied, consideration. An uninitiated observer, hearing him, would have imagined her to be a person of a certain age--possibly an affectionate maiden aunt--who had once done him a kindness which he highly appreciated: perhaps presented him with a check for a thousand dollars. Rowland noted the difference between his present frankness and his reticence during the first six months of his engagement, and sometimes wondered whether it was not rather an anomaly that he should expatiate more largely as the happy event receded."}, {"size": 651, "text": "He had wondered over the whole matter, first and last, in a great many different ways, and looked at it in all possible lights.

Just why it was that Roderick should not logically have fancied Miss Garland, his companion would have been at loss to say, but I think the conviction had its roots in an unformulated comparison between himself and the accepted suitor."}, {"size": 750, "text": "Roderick and he were as different as two men could be, and yet Roderick had taken it into his head to fall in love with a woman for whom he himself had been keeping in reserve, for years, a profoundly characteristic passion.

There were women, he said to himself, whom it was every one\u2019s business to fall in love with a little--women beautiful, brilliant, artful, easily fascinating. Miss Light, for instance, was one of these; every man who spoke to her did so, if not in the language, at least with something of the agitation, the divine tremor, of a lover."}, {"size": 693, "text": "There were other women--they might have great beauty, they might have small; perhaps they were generally to be classified as plain--whose triumphs in this line were rare, but immutably permanent.

Upon the doctrine of probabilities, it was unlikely that she had had an equal charm for each of them, and was it not possible, therefore, that the charm for Roderick had been simply the charm imagined, unquestioningly accepted: the general charm of youth, sympathy, kindness--of the present feminine, in short--enhanced indeed by several fine facial traits? The charm in this case for Rowland was--the charm!--the mysterious, individual, essential woman."}, {"size": 724, "text": "There was an element in the charm, as his companion saw it, which Rowland was obliged to recognize, but which he forbore to ponder; the rather important attraction, namely, of reciprocity. As to Miss Garland being in love with Roderick and becoming charming thereby, this was a point with which his imagination ventured to take no liberties; partly because it would have been indelicate, and partly because it would have been vain. He contented himself with feeling that the young girl was still as vivid an image in his memory as she had been five days after he left her, and with drifting nearer and nearer to the impression that at just that crisis any other girl would have answered Roderick\u2019s sentimental needs as well."}, {"size": 622, "text": "Any other girl indeed would do so still! Roderick had confessed as much to him at Geneva, in saying that he had been taking at Baden the measure of his susceptibility to female beauty.

She sat to him, repeatedly, for a fortnight, and the work was rapidly finished.

As Rowland entered, Christina was losing patience. \u201cDo it yourself, then!\u201d she cried, and with a rapid movement unloosed the great coil of her tresses and let them fall over her shoulders.

The poor old fetish had been so caressed and manipulated, so thrust in and out of its niche, so passed from hand to hand, so dressed and undressed, so mumbled and fumbled over, that it had lost by this time much of its early freshness, and seemed a rather battered and disfeatured divinity."}, {"size": 600, "text": "But it was still brought forth in moments of trouble to have its tinseled petticoat twisted about and be set up on its altar.

People accused me, I believe, of neglecting my little girl; if it was so, I \u2018ve made up for it since. One day I went to drive on the Pincio in very low spirits.

I rushed with my child to the carriage, drove home post-haste, pulled off her rags, and, as I may say, wrapped her in cotton.

It seemed to him that he had seen her before, but he was unable to localize her face. Passing her again, he perceived that one of the little red-legged French soldiers at that time on guard there had approached her and was gallantly making himself agreeable.

He had but to step slightly forward to find himself overlooking two persons who had seated themselves on a narrow ledge, in a sunny corner.

It was all against the grain; he wrought without love. Nevertheless after a fashion he wrought, and the figure grew beneath his hands.

As a customer, Mr. Leavenworth used to drop into Roderick\u2019s studio, to see how things were getting on, and give a friendly hint or so.

He used to give the most fantastic reasons for his likes and dislikes. He would declare he could n\u2019t speak a civil word to a man who brushed his hair in a certain fashion, and he would explain his unaccountable fancy for an individual of imperceptible merit by telling you that he had an ancestor who in the thirteenth century had walled up his wife alive."}, {"size": 630, "text": "\u201cI like to talk to a man whose ancestor has walled up his wife alive,\u201d he would say. \u201cYou may not see the fun of it, and think poor P---- is a very dull fellow.

Provocation About a month later, Rowland addressed to his cousin Cecilia a letter of which the following is a portion:--... \u201cSo much for myself; yet I tell you but a tithe of my own story unless I let you know how matters stand with poor Hudson, for he gives me more to think about just now than anything else in the world.

I should like to say, \u2018My dear wise woman, you were right and I was wrong; you were a shrewd observer and I was a meddlesome donkey!\u2019 When I think of a little talk we had about the \u2018salubrity of genius,\u2019 I feel my ears tingle.

I don\u2019t in the least give it up, you know; I \u2018m incapable of giving it up. I sit holding my head by the hour, racking my brain, wondering what under heaven is to be done. You told me at Northampton that I took the thing too easily; you would tell me now, perhaps, that I take it too hard. I do, altogether; but it can\u2019t be helped.

I certainly never pretended the thing was anything else than an experiment; I promised nothing, I answered for nothing; I only said the case was hopeful, and that it would be a shame to neglect it.

Have n\u2019t I already told you about Miss Light? Last winter everything was perfection. Roderick struck out bravely, did really great things, and proved himself, as I supposed, thoroughly solid.

But in the summer I began to be puzzled, though I succeeded in not being alarmed. When we came back to Rome, however, I saw that the tide had turned and that we were close upon the rocks. It is, in fact, another case of Ulysses alongside of the Sirens; only Roderick refuses to be tied to the mast. He is the most extraordinary being, the strangest mixture of qualities. I don\u2019t understand so much force going with so much weakness--such a brilliant gift being subject to such lapses.

He perplexes me, as I say, to death, and though he tires out my patience, he still fascinates me. Sometimes I think he has n\u2019t a grain of conscience, and sometimes I think that, in a way, he has an excess.

He has something that Miss Garland took for one, and I \u2018m pretty sure she \u2018s a judge. But she judged on scanty evidence. He has something that Christina Light, here, makes believe at times that she takes for one, but she is no judge at all!

Are they all like that, all the men of genius? There are a great many artists here who hammer away at their trade with exemplary industry; in fact I am surprised at their success in reducing the matter to a steady, daily grind: but I really don\u2019t think that one of them has his exquisite quality of talent."}, {"size": 614, "text": "It is in the matter of quantity that he has broken down.

This I consider great nonsense; but I would nevertheless take him on his own terms if it was only I that was concerned. But I keep thinking of those two praying, trusting neighbors of yours, and I feel wretchedly like a swindler.

I wish he were less of a genius and more of a charlatan! He \u2018s too confoundedly all of one piece; he won\u2019t throw overboard a grain of the cargo to save the rest. Fancy him thus with all his brilliant personal charm, his handsome head, his careless step, his look as of a nervous nineteenth-century Apollo, and you will understand that there is mighty little comfort in seeing him in a bad way.

She is one of the great beauties of all time, and worth coming barefoot to Rome, like the pilgrims of old, to see. Her complexion, her glance, her step, her dusky tresses, may have been seen before in a goddess, but never in a woman. And you may take this for truth, because I \u2018m not in love with her. On the contrary! Her education has been simply infernal. She is corrupt, perverse, as proud as the queen of Sheba, and an appalling coquette; but she is generous, and with patience and skill you may enlist her imagination in a good cause as well as in a bad one."}, {"size": 679, "text": "The other day I tried to manipulate it a little. Chance offered me an interview to which it was possible to give a serious turn, and I boldly broke ground and begged her to suffer my poor friend to go in peace.

I have come to the conclusion that she is more dangerous in her virtuous moods than in her vicious ones, and that she probably has a way of turning her back which is the most provoking thing in the world. She \u2018s an actress, she could n\u2019t forego doing the thing dramatically, and it was the dramatic touch that made it fatal."}, {"size": 620, "text": "I wished her, of course, to let him down easily; but she desired to have the curtain drop on an attitude, and her attitudes deprive inflammable young artists of their reason.....

They were all great ladies and ready to take him by the hand, but he told them all their faces did n\u2019t interest him, and sent them away vowing his destruction.\u201d At this point of his long effusion, Rowland had paused and put by his letter.

In his altered mood he added these few lines:-- \u201cI unburdened myself the other day of this monstrous load of perplexity; I think it did me good, and I let it stand.

Roderick submitted with extreme ill grace to being bored, and he was now evidently in a state of high exasperation. He had lately begun a representation of a lazzarone lounging in the sun; an image of serene, irresponsible, sensuous life.

Nothing is more permanent, more sculpturesque, more monumental!\u201d \u201cAn entertaining paradox,\u201d said Mr. Leavenworth, \u201cif we had time to exercise our wits upon it.

The duchesses the other night had no attractions for my eyes; they looked coarse and sensual!

It had been but a flash, for what provoked it had instantly vanished. Rowland had murmured a rapturous blessing on Roderick\u2019s head, as he perceived him instantly apprehend the situation. If he had been drinking, its gravity sobered him on the spot; in a single moment he collected his wits.

What had become of it? It had dropped down deep into her memory, and it was lying there for the present in the shade. But with another week, Rowland said to himself, it would leap erect again; the lightest friction would strike a spark from it. Rowland thought he had schooled himself to face the issue of Mary Garland\u2019s advent, casting it even in a tragical phase; but in her personal presence--in which he found a poignant mixture of the familiar and the strange--he seemed to face it and all that it might bring with it for the first time."}, {"size": 691, "text": "In vulgar parlance, he stood uneasy in his shoes.

For Rowland at last was ardent, and all the bells within his soul were ringing bravely in jubilee. Roderick, he learned, had been the whole day with his mother, and had evidently responded to her purest trust. He appeared to her appealing eyes still unspotted by the world.

The elder lady had usually gone off to the studio, and he found Miss Garland sitting alone at the open window, turning the leaves of some book of artistic or antiquarian reference that he had given her."}, {"size": 754, "text": "She always had a smile, she was always eager, alert, responsive. She might be grave by nature, she might be sad by circumstance, she might have secret doubts and pangs, but she was essentially young and strong and fresh and able to enjoy. Her enjoyment was not especially demonstrative, but it was curiously diligent. Rowland felt that it was not amusement and sensation that she coveted, but knowledge--facts that she might noiselessly lay away, piece by piece, in the perfumed darkness of her serious mind, so that, under this head at least, she should not be a perfectly portionless bride. She never merely pretended to understand; she let things go, in her modest fashion, at the moment, but she watched them on their way, over the crest of the hill,"}, {"size": 658, "text": "and when her fancy seemed not likely to be missed it went hurrying after them and ran breathless at their side, as it were, and begged them for the secret. Rowland took an immense satisfaction in observing that she never mistook the second-best for the best, and that when she was in the presence of a masterpiece, she recognized the occasion as a mighty one. She said many things which he thought very profound--that is, if they really had the fine intention he suspected. This point he usually tried to ascertain; but he was obliged to proceed cautiously, for in her mistrustful shyness it seemed to her that cross-examination must necessarily be ironical."}, {"size": 605, "text": "She wished to know just where she was going--what she would gain or lose. This was partly on account of a native intellectual purity, a temper of mind that had not lived with its door ajar, as one might say, upon the high-road of thought, for passing ideas to drop in and out at their pleasure; but had made much of a few long visits from guests cherished and honored--guests whose presence was a solemnity. But it was even more because she was conscious of a sort of growing self-respect, a sense of devoting her life not to her own ends, but to those of another, whose life would be large and brilliant."}, {"size": 740, "text": "She had been brought up to think a great deal of \u201cnature\u201d and nature\u2019s innocent laws; but now Rowland had spoken to her ardently of culture; her strenuous fancy had responded, and she was pursuing culture into retreats where the need for some intellectual effort gave a noble severity to her purpose. She wished to be very sure, to take only the best, knowing it to be the best. There was something exquisite in this labor of pious self-adornment, and Rowland helped it, though its fruits were not for him. In spite of her lurking rigidity and angularity, it was very evident that a nervous, impulsive sense of beauty was constantly at play in her soul, and that her actual experience of beautiful things moved her in some very deep places."}, {"size": 803, "text": "For all that she was not demonstrative, that her manner was simple, and her small-talk of no very ample flow; for all that, as she had said, she was a young woman from the country, and the country was West Nazareth, and West Nazareth was in its way a stubborn little fact, she was feeling the direct influence of the great amenities of the world, and they were shaping her with a divinely intelligent touch. \u201cOh exquisite virtue of circumstance!\u201d cried Rowland to himself, \u201cthat takes us by the hand and leads us forth out of corners where, perforce, our attitudes are a trifle contracted, and beguiles us into testing mistrusted faculties!\u201d When he said to Mary Garland that he wished he might see her ten years hence, he was paying mentally an equal compliment to circumstance and to the girl herself."}, {"size": 722, "text": "Capacity was there, it could be freely trusted; observation would have but to sow its generous seed. \u201cA superior woman\u201d--the idea had harsh associations, but he watched it imaging itself in the vagueness of the future with a kind of hopeless confidence. They went a great deal to Saint Peter\u2019s, for which Rowland had an exceeding affection, a large measure of which he succeeded in infusing into his companion. She confessed very speedily that to climb the long, low, yellow steps, beneath the huge florid facade, and then to push the ponderous leathern apron of the door, to find one\u2019s self confronted with that builded, luminous sublimity, was a sensation of which the keenness renewed itself with surprising generosity."}, {"size": 800, "text": "In those days the hospitality of the Vatican had not been curtailed, and it was an easy and delightful matter to pass from the gorgeous church to the solemn company of the antique marbles. Here Rowland had with his companion a great deal of talk, and found himself expounding aesthetics a perte de vue. He discovered that she made notes of her likes and dislikes in a new-looking little memorandum book, and he wondered to what extent she reported his own discourse. These were charming hours. The galleries had been so cold all winter that Rowland had been an exile from them; but now that the sun was already scorching in the great square between the colonnades, where the twin fountains flashed almost fiercely, the marble coolness of the long, image-bordered vistas made them a delightful refuge."}, {"size": 661, "text": "The great herd of tourists had almost departed, and our two friends often found themselves, for half an hour at a time, in sole and tranquil possession of the beautiful Braccio Nuovo. Here and there was an open window, where they lingered and leaned, looking out into the warm, dead air, over the towers of the city, at the soft-hued, historic hills, at the stately shabby gardens of the palace, or at some sunny, empty, grass-grown court, lost in the heart of the labyrinthine pile. They went sometimes into the chambers painted by Raphael, and of course paid their respects to the Sistine Chapel; but Mary\u2019s evident preference was to linger among the statues."}, {"size": 655, "text": "Once, when they were standing before that noblest of sculptured portraits, the so-called Demosthenes, in the Braccio Nuovo, she made the only spontaneous allusion to her projected marriage, direct or indirect, that had yet fallen from her lips. \u201cI am so glad,\u201d she said, \u201cthat Roderick is a sculptor and not a painter.\u201d The allusion resided chiefly in the extreme earnestness with which the words were uttered. Rowland immediately asked her the reason of her gladness. \u201cIt \u2018s not that painting is not fine,\u201d she said, \u201cbut that sculpture is finer. It is more manly.\u201d Rowland tried at times to make her talk about herself, but in this she had little skill."}, {"size": 609, "text": "She seemed to him so much older, so much more pliant to social uses than when he had seen her at home, that he had a desire to draw from her some categorical account of her occupation and thoughts.

Your growth, then, was unconscious? You did not watch yourself and water your roots?\u201d She paid no heed to his question. \u201cI am willing to grant,\u201d she said, \u201cthat Europe is more delightful than I supposed; and I don\u2019t think that, mentally, I had been stingy."}, {"size": 647, "text": "But you must admit that America is better than you have supposed.\u201d \u201cI have not a fault to find with the country which produced you!\u201d Rowland thought he might risk this, smiling. \u201cAnd yet you want me to change--to assimilate Europe, I suppose you would call it.\u201d \u201cI have felt that desire only on general principles. Shall I tell you what I feel now? America has made you thus far; let America finish you! I should like to ship you back without delay and see what becomes of you.

It would have been hard to say why this point interested him, for he had not the slightest real apprehension that she was dry or pedantic. The simple human truth was, the poor fellow was jealous of science. In preaching science to her, he had over-estimated his powers of self-effacement. Suddenly, sinking science for the moment, she looked at him very frankly and began to frown. At the same time she let the Murray slide down to the ground, and he was so charmed with this circumstance that he made no movement to pick it up. \u201cYou are singularly inconsistent, Mr. Mallet,\u201d she said."}, {"size": 860, "text": "\u201cThat first day that we were in Saint Peter\u2019s you said things that inspired me.

Mrs. HudsonOf Roderick, meanwhile, Rowland saw nothing; but he immediately went to Mrs. Hudson and assured her that her son was in even exceptionally good health and spirits. After this he called again on the two ladies from Northampton, but, as Roderick\u2019s absence continued, he was able neither to furnish nor to obtain much comfort. Miss Garland\u2019s apprehensive face seemed to him an image of his own state of mind. He was profoundly depressed; he felt that there was a storm in the air, and he wished it would come, without more delay, and perform its ravages.

He saw it was that of an artist, hastily transferring to his sketch-book a memento of some fleeting variation in the scenery of the basilica; and in a moment he perceived that the artist was little Sam Singleton. Singleton pocketed his sketch-book with a guilty air, as if it cost his modesty a pang to be detected in this greedy culture of opportunity.

Singleton had come to bid farewell to Saint Peter\u2019s, and he was gathering a few supreme memories. He had earned a purse-full of money, and he was meaning to take a summer\u2019s holiday; going to Switzerland, to Germany, to Paris. In the autumn he was to return home; his family--composed, as Rowland knew, of a father who was cashier in a bank and five unmarried sisters, one of whom gave lyceum-lectures on woman\u2019s rights, the whole resident at Buffalo, New York--had been writing him peremptory letters and appealing to him as a son, brother, and fellow-citizen."}, {"size": 690, "text": "He would have been grateful for another year in Rome, but what must be must be, and he had laid up treasure which, in Buffalo, would seem infinite.

I don\u2019t see what \u2018s in your head, Rowland, to attempt to defend Miss Light; you were the first to cry out against her! You told me she was dangerous, and I pooh-poohed you.

There was no space in Mrs. Hudson\u2019s tiny maternal mind for complications of feeling, and one emotion existed only by turning another over flat and perching on top of it. She was evidently not following Roderick at all in his dusky aberrations.

She leaned her head on his shoulder and sobbed broken-heartedly. She said not a word, she made no attempt to scold; but the desolation of her tears was overwhelming. It lasted some time--too long for Rowland\u2019s courage.

Her advent puzzled him, and it was not for some time that he began to understand the motive of it. Roderick\u2019s countenance threw no light upon it; but Roderick\u2019s countenance, full of light as it was, in a way, itself, had never thrown light upon anything.

But by some diminutive logical process of her own she had convinced herself that she had been weakly trustful, and that she had suffered Rowland to think too meanly, not only of her understanding, but of her social consequence.

He says I must write to Mr. Striker to sell my house for what it will bring, and send me out the money. When the money comes I must give it to him.

I will do as I \u2018m told, but I don\u2019t call that doing. We must leave Rome, I suppose, though I don\u2019t see why.

There was not a trace in Roderick\u2019s face, or in his voice, of the bitterness of his emotion of the day before, and not a hint of his having the lightest weight upon his conscience. He looked at Rowland with his frank, luminous eye as if there had never been a difference of opinion between them; as if each had ever been for both, unalterably, and both for each. Rowland had received a few days before a letter from a lady of his acquaintance, a worthy Scotswoman domiciled in a villa upon one of the olive-covered hills near Florence. She held her apartment in the villa upon a long lease, and she enjoyed for a sum not worth mentioning the possession of an extraordinary number of noble, stone-floored rooms, with ceilings vaulted and frescoed, and barred windows commanding the loveliest view in the world."}, {"size": 646, "text": "She was a needy and thrifty spinster, who never hesitated to declare that the lovely view was all very well, but that for her own part she lived in the villa for cheapness, and that if she had a clear three hundred pounds a year she would go and really enjoy life near her sister, a baronet\u2019s lady, at Glasgow. She was now proposing to make a visit to that exhilarating city, and she desired to turn an honest penny by sub-letting for a few weeks her historic Italian chambers. The terms on which she occupied them enabled her to ask a rent almost jocosely small, and she begged Rowland to do what she called a little genteel advertising for her."}, {"size": 718, "text": "Would he say a good word for her rooms to his numerous friends, as they left Rome?

He dwelt upon the fact that she would strike a truce with tables-d\u2019hote and have a cook of her own, amenable possibly to instruction in the Northampton mysteries. He had touched a tender chord; Mrs. Hudson became almost cheerful. Her sentiments upon the table-d\u2019hote system and upon foreign household habits generally were remarkable, and, if we had space for it, would repay analysis; and the idea of reclaiming a lost soul to the Puritanic canons of cookery quite lightened the burden of her depression."}, {"size": 648, "text": "While Rowland set forth his case Roderick was slowly walking round the magnificent Adam, with his hands in his pockets. Rowland waited for him to manifest an interest in their discussion, but the statue seemed to fascinate him and he remained calmly heedless.

He entered into Mrs. Hudson\u2019s position minutely, and told her exactly why it seemed good that she should remove immediately to the Florentine villa. She received his advice with great frigidity, looking hard at the floor and sighing, like a person well on her guard against an insidious optimism."}, {"size": 620, "text": "But she had nothing better to propose, and Rowland received her permission to write to his friend that he had let the rooms.

Whether you work or whether you loaf, it \u2018s a place for an artist to be happy in.

He glanced at Mrs. Hudson and saw that her eyebrows were lifted and her lips parted in soft irony. She seemed to accuse him of a craven shirking of trouble, to demand of him to repair his cruel havoc in her life by a solemn renewal of zeal. But Roderick\u2019s expectations were the oddest! Such as they were, Rowland asked himself why he should n\u2019t make a bargain with them. \u201cYou desire me to go with you?\u201d he asked. \u201cIf you don\u2019t go, I won\u2019t--that \u2018s all!"}, {"size": 621, "text": "How in the world shall I get through the summer without you?\u201d \u201cHow will you get through it with me?

When she asked him what he meant, he said he really could n\u2019t tell her, and parted from her with much genuine emotion; the more so, doubtless, that she blessed him in a quite loving, maternal fashion, and told him she honestly believed him to be the best fellow in the world."}, {"size": 718, "text": "The Villa Pandolfini stood directly upon a small grass-grown piazza, on the top of a hill which sloped straight from one of the gates of Florence. It offered to the outer world a long, rather low facade, colored a dull, dark yellow, and pierced with windows of various sizes, no one of which, save those on the ground floor, was on the same level with any other. Within, it had a great, cool, gray cortile, with high, light arches around it, heavily-corniced doors, of majestic altitude, opening out of it, and a beautiful mediaeval well on one side of it. Mrs. Hudson\u2019s rooms opened into a small garden supported on immense substructions, which were planted on the farther side of the hill, as it sloped steeply away."}, {"size": 644, "text": "This garden was a charming place. Its south wall was curtained with a dense orange vine, a dozen fig-trees offered you their large-leaved shade, and over the low parapet the soft, grave Tuscan landscape kept you company. The rooms themselves were as high as chapels and as cool as royal sepulchres. Silence, peace, and security seemed to abide in the ancient house and make it an ideal refuge for aching hearts. Mrs. Hudson had a stunted, brown-faced Maddalena, who wore a crimson handkerchief passed over her coarse, black locks and tied under her sharp, pertinacious chin, and a smile which was as brilliant as a prolonged flash of lightning."}, {"size": 799, "text": "She smiled at everything in life, especially the things she did n\u2019t like and which kept her talent for mendacity in healthy exercise. A glance, a word, a motion was sufficient to make her show her teeth at you like a cheerful she-wolf. This inexpugnable smile constituted her whole vocabulary in her dealings with her melancholy mistress, to whom she had been bequeathed by the late occupant of the apartment, and who, to Rowland\u2019s satisfaction, promised to be diverted from her maternal sorrows by the still deeper perplexities of Maddalena\u2019s theory of roasting, sweeping, and bed-making. Rowland took rooms at a villa a trifle nearer Florence, whence in the summer mornings he had five minutes\u2019 walk in the sharp, black, shadow-strip projected by winding, flower-topped walls, to join his friends."}, {"size": 747, "text": "The life at the Villa Pandolfini, when it had fairly defined itself, was tranquil and monotonous, but it might have borrowed from exquisite circumstance an absorbing charm. If a sensible shadow rested upon it, this was because it had an inherent vice; it was feigning a repose which it very scantily felt. Roderick had lost no time in giving the full measure of his uncompromising chagrin, and as he was the central figure of the little group, as he held its heart-strings all in his own hand, it reflected faithfully the eclipse of his own genius. No one had ventured upon the cheerful commonplace of saying that the change of air and of scene would restore his spirits; this would have had, under the circumstances, altogether too silly a sound."}, {"size": 616, "text": "The change in question had done nothing of the sort, and his companions had, at least, the comfort of their perspicacity. An essential spring had dried up within him, and there was no visible spiritual law for making it flow again. He was rarely violent, he expressed little of the irritation and ennui that he must have constantly felt; it was as if he believed that a spiritual miracle for his redemption was just barely possible, and was therefore worth waiting for. The most that one could do, however, was to wait grimly and doggedly, suppressing an imprecation as, from time to time, one looked at one\u2019s watch."}, {"size": 671, "text": "An attitude of positive urbanity toward life was not to be expected; it was doing one\u2019s duty to hold one\u2019s tongue and keep one\u2019s hands off one\u2019s own windpipe, and other people\u2019s. Roderick had long silences, fits of profound lethargy, almost of stupefaction. He used to sit in the garden by the hour, with his head thrown back, his legs outstretched, his hands in his pockets, and his eyes fastened upon the blinding summer sky. He would gather a dozen books about him, tumble them out on the ground, take one into his lap, and leave it with the pages unturned. These moods would alternate with hours of extreme restlessness, during which he mysteriously absented himself."}, {"size": 701, "text": "He bore the heat of the Italian summer like a salamander, and used to start off at high noon for long walks over the hills. He often went down into Florence, rambled through her close, dim streets, and lounged away mornings in the churches and galleries. On many of these occasions Rowland bore him company, for they were the times when he was most like his former self. Before Michael Angelo\u2019s statues and the pictures of the early Tuscans, he quite forgot his own infelicities, and picked up the thread of his old aesthetic loquacity. He had a particular fondness for Andrea del Sarto, and affirmed that if he had been a painter he would have taken the author of the Madonna del Sacco for his model."}, {"size": 690, "text": "He found in Florence some of his Roman friends, and went down on certain evenings to meet them. More than once he asked Mary Garland to go with him into town, and showed her the things he most cared for. He had some modeling clay brought up to the villa and deposited in a room suitable for his work; but when this had been done he turned the key in the door and the clay never was touched. His eye was heavy and his hand cold, and his mother put up a secret prayer that he might be induced to see a doctor. But on a certain occasion, when her prayer became articulate, he had a great outburst of anger and begged her to know, once for all, that his health was better than it had ever been."}, {"size": 857, "text": "On the whole, and most of the time, he was a sad spectacle; he looked so hopelessly idle. If he was not querulous and bitter, it was because he had taken an extraordinary vow not to be; a vow heroic, for him, a vow which those who knew him well had the tenderness to appreciate. Talking with him was like skating on thin ice, and his companions had a constant mental vision of spots designated \u201cdangerous.\u201d This was a difficult time for Rowland; he said to himself that he would endure it to the end, but that it must be his last adventure of the kind. Mrs. Hudson divided her time between looking askance at her son, with her hands tightly clasped about her pocket-handkerchief, as if she were wringing it dry of the last hour\u2019s tears, and turning her eyes much more directly upon Rowland, in the mutest, the feeblest, the most intolerable reproachfulness."}, {"size": 601, "text": "She never phrased her accusations, but he felt that in the unillumined void of the poor lady\u2019s mind they loomed up like vaguely-outlined monsters. Her demeanor caused him the acutest suffering, and if, at the outset of his enterprise, he had seen, how dimly soever, one of those plaintive eye-beams in the opposite scale, the brilliancy of Roderick\u2019s promises would have counted for little.

If Mrs. Hudson had been loquacious and vulgar, he would have borne even a less valid persecution with greater fortitude."}, {"size": 783, "text": "But somehow, neat and noiseless and dismally lady-like, as she sat there, keeping her grievance green with her soft-dropping tears, her displeasure conveyed an overwhelming imputation of brutality. He felt like a reckless trustee who has speculated with the widow\u2019s mite, and is haunted with the reflection of ruin that he sees in her tearful eyes. He did everything conceivable to be polite to Mrs. Hudson, and to treat her with distinguished deference. Perhaps his exasperated nerves made him overshoot the mark, and rendered his civilities a trifle peremptory. She seemed capable of believing that he was trying to make a fool of her; she would have thought him cruelly recreant if he had suddenly departed in desperation, and yet she gave him no visible credit for his constancy."}, {"size": 660, "text": "Women are said by some authorities to be cruel; I don\u2019t know how true this is, but it may at least be pertinent to remark that Mrs. Hudson was very much of a woman.

But Mary Garland had helped him before, and she helped him now--helped him not less than he had assured himself she would when he found himself drifting to Florence. Yet her help was rendered in the same unconscious, unacknowledged fashion as before; there was no explicit change in their relations."}, {"size": 607, "text": "After that distressing scene in Rome which had immediately preceded their departure, it was of course impossible that there should not be on Miss Garland\u2019s part some frankness of allusion to Roderick\u2019s sad condition.

But he knew that she knew far too much for her happiness; Roderick had told him, shortly after their settlement at the Villa Pandolfini, that he had had a \u201ctremendous talk\u201d with his cousin."}, {"size": 601, "text": "Rowland asked no questions about it; he preferred not to know what had passed between them. If their interview had been purely painful, he wished to ignore it for Miss Garland\u2019s sake; and if it had sown the seeds of reconciliation, he wished to close his eyes to it for his own--for the sake of that unshaped idea, forever dismissed and yet forever present, which hovered in the background of his consciousness, with a hanging head, as it were, and yet an unshamed glance, and whose lightest motions were an effectual bribe to patience. Was the engagement broken? Rowland wondered, yet without asking."}, {"size": 709, "text": "But it hardly mattered, for if, as was more than probable, Miss Garland had peremptorily released her cousin, her own heart had by no means recovered its liberty. It was very certain to Rowland\u2019s mind that if she had given him up she had by no means ceased to care for him passionately, and that, to exhaust her charity for his weaknesses, Roderick would have, as the phrase is, a long row to hoe. She spoke of Roderick as she might have done of a person suffering from a serious malady which demanded much tenderness; but if Rowland had found it possible to accuse her of dishonesty he would have said now that she believed appreciably less than she pretended to in her victim\u2019s being an involuntary patient."}, {"size": 753, "text": "There are women whose love is care-taking and patronizing, and who rather prefer a weak man because he gives them a comfortable sense of strength. It did not in the least please Rowland to believe that Mary Garland was one of these; for he held that such women were only males in petticoats, and he was convinced that Miss Garland\u2019s heart was constructed after the most perfect feminine model. That she was a very different woman from Christina Light did not at all prove that she was less a woman, and if the Princess Casamassima had gone up into a high place to publish her disrelish of a man who lacked the virile will, it was very certain that Mary Garland was not a person to put up, at any point, with what might be called the princess\u2019s leavings."}, {"size": 835, "text": "It was Christina\u2019s constant practice to remind you of the complexity of her character, of the subtlety of her mind, of her troublous faculty of seeing everything in a dozen different lights. Mary Garland had never pretended not to be simple; but Rowland had a theory that she had really a more multitudinous sense of human things, a more delicate imagination, and a finer instinct of character. She did you the honors of her mind with a grace far less regal, but was not that faculty of quite as remarkable an adjustment? If in poor Christina\u2019s strangely commingled nature there was circle within circle, and depth beneath depth, it was to be believed that Mary Garland, though she did not amuse herself with dropping stones into her soul, and waiting to hear them fall, laid quite as many sources of spiritual life under contribution."}, {"size": 682, "text": "She had believed Roderick was a fine fellow when she bade him farewell beneath the Northampton elms, and this belief, to her young, strenuous, concentrated imagination, had meant many things. If it was to grow cold, it would be because disenchantment had become total and won the battle at each successive point. Miss Garland had even in her face and carriage something of the preoccupied and wearied look of a person who is watching at a sick-bed; Roderick\u2019s broken fortunes, his dead ambitions, were a cruel burden to the heart of a girl who had believed that he possessed \u201cgenius,\u201d and supposed that genius was to one\u2019s spiritual economy what full pockets were to one\u2019s domestic."}, {"size": 716, "text": "And yet, with her, Rowland never felt, as with Mrs. Hudson, that undercurrent of reproach and bitterness toward himself, that impertinent implication that he had defrauded her of happiness. Was this justice, in Miss Garland, or was it mercy? The answer would have been difficult, for she had almost let Rowland feel before leaving Rome that she liked him well enough to forgive him an injury. It was partly, Rowland fancied, that there were occasional lapses, deep and sweet, in her sense of injury. When, on arriving at Florence, she saw the place Rowland had brought them to in their trouble, she had given him a look and said a few words to him that had seemed not only a remission of guilt but a positive reward."}, {"size": 620, "text": "This happened in the court of the villa--the large gray quadrangle, overstretched, from edge to edge of the red-tiled roof, by the soft Italian sky. Mary had felt on the spot the sovereign charm of the place; it was reflected in her deeply intelligent glance, and Rowland immediately accused himself of not having done the villa justice. Miss Garland took a mighty fancy to Florence, and used to look down wistfully at the towered city from the windows and garden. Roderick having now no pretext for not being her cicerone, Rowland was no longer at liberty, as he had been in Rome, to propose frequent excursions to her."}, {"size": 733, "text": "Roderick\u2019s own invitations, however, were not frequent, and Rowland more than once ventured to introduce her to a gallery or a church. These expeditions were not so blissful, to his sense, as the rambles they had taken together in Rome, for his companion only half surrendered herself to her enjoyment, and seemed to have but a divided attention at her command. Often, when she had begun with looking intently at a picture, her silence, after an interval, made him turn and glance at her. He usually found that if she was looking at the picture still, she was not seeing it. Her eyes were fixed, but her thoughts were wandering, and an image more vivid than any that Raphael or Titian had drawn had superposed itself upon the canvas."}, {"size": 754, "text": "She asked fewer questions than before, and seemed to have lost heart for consulting guide-books and encyclopaedias. From time to time, however, she uttered a deep, full murmur of gratification. Florence in midsummer was perfectly void of travelers, and the dense little city gave forth its aesthetic aroma with a larger frankness, as the nightingale sings when the listeners have departed. The churches were deliciously cool, but the gray streets were stifling, and the great, dove-tailed polygons of pavement as hot to the tread as molten lava. Rowland, who suffered from intense heat, would have found all this uncomfortable in solitude; but Florence had never charmed him so completely as during these midsummer strolls with his preoccupied companion."}, {"size": 838, "text": "One evening they had arranged to go on the morrow to the Academy. Miss Garland kept her appointment, but as soon as she appeared, Rowland saw that something painful had befallen her. She was doing her best to look at her ease, but her face bore the marks of tears. Rowland told her that he was afraid she was ill, and that if she preferred to give up the visit to Florence he would submit with what grace he might. She hesitated a moment, and then said she preferred to adhere to their plan. \u201cI am not well,\u201d she presently added, \u201cbut it \u2018s a moral malady, and in such cases I consider your company beneficial.\u201d \u201cBut if I am to be your doctor,\u201d said Rowland, \u201cyou must tell me how your illness began.\u201d \u201cI can tell you very little. It began with Mrs. Hudson being unjust to me, for the first time in her life. And now I am already better!\u201d"}, {"size": 608, "text": "I mention this incident because it confirmed an impression of Rowland\u2019s from which he had derived a certain consolation. He knew that Mrs. Hudson considered her son\u2019s ill-regulated passion for Christina Light a very regrettable affair, but he suspected that her manifest compassion had been all for Roderick, and not in the least for Mary Garland. She was fond of the young girl, but she had valued her primarily, during the last two years, as a kind of assistant priestess at Roderick\u2019s shrine. Roderick had honored her by asking her to become his wife, but that poor Mary had any rights in consequence Mrs."}, {"size": 783, "text": "Hudson was quite incapable of perceiving. Her sentiment on the subject was of course not very vigorously formulated, but she was unprepared to admit that Miss Garland had any ground for complaint. Roderick was very unhappy; that was enough, and Mary\u2019s duty was to join her patience and her prayers to those of his doting mother. Roderick might fall in love with whom he pleased; no doubt that women trained in the mysterious Roman arts were only too proud and too happy to make it easy for him; and it was very presuming in poor, plain Mary to feel any personal resentment. Mrs. Hudson\u2019s philosophy was of too narrow a scope to suggest that a mother may forgive where a mistress cannot, and she thought herself greatly aggrieved that Miss Garland was not so disinterested as herself."}, {"size": 626, "text": "She was ready to drop dead in Roderick\u2019s service, and she was quite capable of seeing her companion falter and grow faint, without a tremor of compassion. Mary, apparently, had given some intimation of her belief that if constancy is the flower of devotion, reciprocity is the guarantee of constancy, and Mrs. Hudson had rebuked her failing faith and called it cruelty. That Miss Garland had found it hard to reason with Mrs. Hudson, that she suffered deeply from the elder lady\u2019s softly bitter imputations, and that, in short, he had companionship in misfortune--all this made Rowland find a certain luxury in his discomfort."}, {"size": 732, "text": "The party at Villa Pandolfini used to sit in the garden in the evenings, which Rowland almost always spent with them. Their entertainment was in the heavily perfumed air, in the dim, far starlight, in the crenelated tower of a neighboring villa, which loomed vaguely above them in the warm darkness, and in such conversation as depressing reflections allowed. Roderick, clad always in white, roamed about like a restless ghost, silent for the most part, but making from time to time a brief observation, characterized by the most fantastic cynicism. Roderick\u2019s contributions to the conversation were indeed always so fantastic that, though half the time they wearied him unspeakably, Rowland made an effort to treat them humorously."}, {"size": 608, "text": "With Rowland alone Roderick talked a great deal more; often about things related to his own work, or about artistic and aesthetic matters in general. He talked as well as ever, or even better; but his talk always ended in a torrent of groans and curses. When this current set in, Rowland straightway turned his back or stopped his ears, and Roderick now witnessed these movements with perfect indifference. When the latter was absent from the star-lit circle in the garden, as often happened, Rowland knew nothing of his whereabouts; he supposed him to be in Florence, but he never learned what he did there."}, {"size": 605, "text": "All this was not enlivening, but with an even, muffled tread the days followed each other, and brought the month of August to a close. One particular evening at this time was most enchanting; there was a perfect moon, looking so extraordinarily large that it made everything its light fell upon seem small; the heat was tempered by a soft west wind, and the wind was laden with the odors of the early harvest. The hills, the vale of the Arno, the shrunken river, the domes of Florence, were vaguely effaced by the dense moonshine; they looked as if they were melting out of sight like an exorcised vision."}, {"size": 683, "text": "Rowland had found the two ladies alone at the villa, and he had sat with them for an hour. He felt absolutely hushed by the solemn splendor of the scene, but he had risked the remark that, whatever life might yet have in store for either of them, this was a night that they would never forget. \u201cIt \u2018s a night to remember on one\u2019s death-bed!\u201d Miss Garland exclaimed. \u201cOh, Mary, how can you!\u201d murmured Mrs. Hudson, to whom this savored of profanity, and to whose shrinking sense, indeed, the accumulated loveliness of the night seemed to have something shameless and defiant. They were silent after this, for some time, but at last Rowland addressed certain idle words to Miss Garland."}, {"size": 659, "text": "She made no reply, and he turned to look at her. She was sitting motionless, with her head pressed to Mrs. Hudson\u2019s shoulder, and the latter lady was gazing at him through the silvered dusk with a look which gave a sort of spectral solemnity to the sad, weak meaning of her eyes. She had the air, for the moment, of a little old malevolent fairy. Miss Garland, Rowland perceived in an instant, was not absolutely motionless; a tremor passed through her figure. She was weeping, or on the point of weeping, and she could not trust herself to speak. Rowland left his place and wandered to another part of the garden, wondering at the motive of her sudden tears."}, {"size": 654, "text": "Of women\u2019s sobs in general he had a sovereign dread, but these, somehow, gave him a certain pleasure.

I feel as if I were saying something sinful--I love it!\u201d \u201cIf it is sinful, I absolve you,\u201d said Rowland, \u201cin so far as I have power. We are made, I suppose, both to suffer and to enjoy. As you say, it \u2018s a mixture. Just now and here, it seems a peculiarly strange one.

Take me out of this land of impossible beauty and put me in the midst of ugliness. Set me down where nature is coarse and flat, and men and manners are vulgar.

Rowland had a theory, after the scene which led to these preparations, that Mary Garland was weary of waiting for Roderick to come to his senses, that the faith which had bravely borne his manhood company hitherto, on the tortuous march he was leading it, had begun to believe it had gone far enough."}, {"size": 708, "text": "This theory was not vitiated by something she said to him on the day before that on which Mrs. Hudson had arranged to leave Florence. \u201cCousin Sarah, the other evening,\u201d she said, \u201casked you to please leave us.

The Princess CasamassimaRowland had a very friendly memory of a little mountain inn, accessible with moderate trouble from Lucerne, where he had once spent a blissful ten days. He had at that time been trudging, knapsack on back, over half Switzerland, and not being, on his legs, a particularly light weight, it was no shame to him to confess that he was mortally tired. The inn of which I speak presented striking analogies with a cow-stable; but in spite of this circumstance, it was crowded with hungry tourists.

His face, on the Swiss hill-sides, had been scorched to within a shade of the color nowadays called magenta, and his bed was a pallet in a loft, which he shared with a German botanist of colossal stature--every inch of him quaking at an open window."}, {"size": 886, "text": "These had been drawbacks to felicity, but Rowland hardly cared where or how he was lodged, for he spent the livelong day under the sky, on the crest of a slope that looked at the Jungfrau.

He communicated with his old friend the landlord, and, while September was yet young, his companions established themselves under his guidance in the grassy valley. He had crossed the Saint Gothard Pass with them, in the same carriage. During the journey from Florence, and especially during this portion of it, the cloud that hung over the little party had been almost dissipated, and they had looked at each other, in the close contiguity of the train and the posting-carriage, without either accusing or consoling glances."}, {"size": 641, "text": "It was impossible not to enjoy the magnificent scenery of the Apennines and the Italian Alps, and there was a tacit agreement among the travelers to abstain from sombre allusions.

He concerned himself not a particle about the itinerary, or about any of the wayside arrangements; he took no trouble, and he gave none.

Rowland and Roderick turned aside from the little paved footway that clambered and dipped and wound and doubled beside the lake, and stretched themselves idly beneath a fig-tree, on a grassy promontory. Rowland had never known anything so divinely soothing as the dreamy softness of that early autumn afternoon. The iridescent mountains shut him in; the little waves, beneath him, fretted the white pebbles at the laziest intervals; the festooned vines above him swayed just visibly in the all but motionless air."}, {"size": 705, "text": "Roderick lay observing it all with his arms thrown back and his hands under his head. \u201cThis suits me,\u201d he said; \u201cI could be happy here and forget everything.

She was exhilarated; she liked to walk; in the way of mountains, until within the last few weeks, she had seen nothing greater than Mount Holyoke, and she found that the Alps amply justified their reputation.

Rowland of course was alert in her service, and he gathered for her several botanical specimens which at first seemed inaccessible. One of these, indeed, had at first appeared easier of capture than his attempt attested, and he had paused a moment at the base of the little peak on which it grew, measuring the risk of farther pursuit."}, {"size": 786, "text": "Suddenly, as he stood there, he remembered Roderick\u2019s defiance of danger and of Miss Light, at the Coliseum, and he was seized with a strong desire to test the courage of his companion.

He was the least brutal of men, but for a moment he was perfectly indifferent to her suffering. \u201cI can get the flower,\u201d he called to her. \u201cWill you trust me?\u201d \u201cI don\u2019t want it; I would rather not have it!\u201d she cried. \u201cWill you trust me?\u201d he repeated, looking at her."}, {"size": 665, "text": "She looked at him and then at the flower; he wondered whether she would shriek and swoon, as Miss Light had done. \u201cI wish it were something better!\u201d she said simply; and then stood watching him, while he began to clamber. Rowland was not shaped for an acrobat, and his enterprise was difficult; but he kept his wits about him, made the most of narrow foot-holds and coigns of vantage, and at last secured his prize. He managed to stick it into his buttonhole and then he contrived to descend. There was more than one chance for an ugly fall, but he evaded them all. It was doubtless not gracefully done, but it was done, and that was all he had proposed to himself."}, {"size": 729, "text": "He was red in the face when he offered Miss Garland the flower, and she was visibly pale. She had watched him without moving. All this had passed without the knowledge of Mrs. Hudson, who was dozing beneath the hood of the carriage. Mary Garland\u2019s eyes did not perhaps display that ardent admiration which was formerly conferred by the queen of beauty at a tournament; but they expressed something in which Rowland found his reward. \u201cWhy did you do that?\u201d she asked, gravely. He hesitated. He felt that it was physically possible to say, \u201cBecause I love you!\u201d but that it was not morally possible. He lowered his pitch and answered, simply, \u201cBecause I wanted to do something for you.\u201d \u201cSuppose you had fallen,\u201d said Miss Garland."}, {"size": 649, "text": "\u201cI believed I would not fall. And you believed it, I think.\u201d \u201cI believed nothing. I simply trusted you, as you asked me.\u201d \u201cQuod erat demonstrandum!\u201d cried Rowland. \u201cI think you know Latin.\u201d When our four friends were established in what I have called their grassy valley, there was a good deal of scrambling over slopes both grassy and stony, a good deal of flower-plucking on narrow ledges, a great many long walks, and, thanks to the lucid mountain air, not a little exhilaration. Mrs. Hudson was obliged to intermit her suspicions of the deleterious atmosphere of the old world, and to acknowledge the edifying purity of the breezes of Engelthal."}, {"size": 638, "text": "She was certainly more placid than she had been in Italy; having always lived in the country, she had missed in Rome and Florence that social solitude mitigated by bushes and rocks which is so dear to the true New England temperament. The little unpainted inn at Engelthal, with its plank partitions, its milk-pans standing in the sun, its \u201chelp,\u201d in the form of angular young women of the country-side, reminded her of places of summer sojourn in her native land; and the beautiful historic chambers of the Villa Pandolfini passed from her memory without a regret, and without having in the least modified her ideal of domiciliary grace."}, {"size": 685, "text": "Roderick had changed his sky, but he had not changed his mind; his humor was still that of which he had given Rowland a glimpse in that tragic explosion on the Lake of Como. He kept his despair to himself, and he went doggedly about the ordinary business of life; but it was easy to see that his spirit was mortally heavy, and that he lived and moved and talked simply from the force of habit. In that sad half-hour among the Italian olives there had been such a fierce sincerity in his tone, that Rowland began to abdicate the critical attitude. He began to feel that it was essentially vain to appeal to the poor fellow\u2019s will; there was no will left; its place was an impotent void."}, {"size": 776, "text": "This view of the case indeed was occasionally contravened by certain indications on Roderick\u2019s part of the power of resistance to disagreeable obligations: one might still have said, if one had been disposed to be didactic at any hazard, that there was a method in his madness, that his moral energy had its sleeping and its waking hours, and that, in a cause that pleased it, it was capable of rising with the dawn. But on the other hand, pleasure, in this case, was quite at one with effort; evidently the greatest bliss in life, for Roderick, would have been to have a plastic idea. And then, it was impossible not to feel tenderly to a despair which had so ceased to be aggressive--not to forgive a great deal of apathy to a temper which had so unlearned its irritability."}, {"size": 732, "text": "Roderick said frankly that Switzerland made him less miserable than Italy, and the Alps seemed less to mock at his enforced leisure than the Apennines. He indulged in long rambles, generally alone, and was very fond of climbing into dizzy places, where no sound could overtake him, and there, flinging himself on the never-trodden moss, of pulling his hat over his eyes and lounging away the hours in perfect immobility. Rowland sometimes walked with him; though Roderick never invited him, he seemed duly grateful for his society. Rowland now made it a rule to treat him like a perfectly sane man, to assume that all things were well with him, and never to allude to the prosperity he had forfeited or to the work he was not doing."}, {"size": 679, "text": "He would have still said, had you questioned him, that Roderick\u2019s condition was a mood--certainly a puzzling one. It might last yet for many a weary hour; but it was a long lane that had no turning. Roderick\u2019s blues would not last forever. Rowland\u2019s interest in Miss Garland\u2019s relations with her cousin was still profoundly attentive, and perplexed as he was on all sides, he found nothing transparent here. After their arrival at Engelthal, Roderick appeared to seek the young girl\u2019s society more than he had done hitherto, and this revival of ardor could not fail to set his friend a-wondering. They sat together and strolled together, and Miss Garland often read aloud to him."}, {"size": 661, "text": "One day, on their coming to dinner, after he had been lying half the morning at her feet, in the shadow of a rock, Rowland asked him what she had been reading. \u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d Roderick said, \u201cI don\u2019t heed the sense.\u201d Miss Garland heard this, and Rowland looked at her. She looked at Roderick sharply and with a little blush. \u201cI listen to Mary,\u201d Roderick continued, \u201cfor the sake of her voice. It \u2018s distractingly sweet!\u201d At this Miss Garland\u2019s blush deepened, and she looked away. Rowland, in Florence, as we know, had suffered his imagination to wander in the direction of certain conjectures which the reader may deem unflattering to Miss Garland\u2019s constancy."}, {"size": 631, "text": "He had asked himself whether her faith in Roderick had not faltered, and that demand of hers which had brought about his own departure for Switzerland had seemed almost equivalent to a confession that she needed his help to believe. Rowland was essentially a modest man, and he did not risk the supposition that Miss Garland had contrasted him with Roderick to his own advantage; but he had a certain consciousness of duty resolutely done which allowed itself to fancy, at moments, that it might be not illogically rewarded by the bestowal of such stray grains of enthusiasm as had crumbled away from her estimate of his companion."}, {"size": 742, "text": "If some day she had declared, in a sudden burst of passion, that she was outwearied and sickened, and that she gave up her recreant lover, Rowland\u2019s expectation would have gone half-way to meet her. And certainly if her passion had taken this course no generous critic would utterly condemn her. She had been neglected, ignored, forsaken, treated with a contempt which no girl of a fine temper could endure. There were girls, indeed, whose fineness, like that of Burd Helen in the ballad, lay in clinging to the man of their love through thick and thin, and in bowing their head to all hard usage. This attitude had often an exquisite beauty of its own, but Rowland deemed that he had solid reason to believe it never could be Mary Garland\u2019s."}, {"size": 667, "text": "She was not a passive creature; she was not soft and meek and grateful for chance bounties. With all her reserve of manner she was proud and eager; she asked much and she wanted what she asked; she believed in fine things and she never could long persuade herself that fine things missed were as beautiful as fine things achieved. Once Rowland passed an angry day. He had dreamed--it was the most insubstantial of dreams--that she had given him the right to believe that she looked to him to transmute her discontent. And yet here she was throwing herself back into Roderick\u2019s arms at his lightest overture, and playing with his own half fearful, half shameful hopes!"}, {"size": 602, "text": "Rowland declared to himself that his position was essentially detestable, and that all the philosophy he could bring to bear upon it would make it neither honorable nor comfortable. He would go away and make an end of it. He did not go away; he simply took a long walk, stayed away from the inn all day, and on his return found Miss Garland sitting out in the moonlight with Roderick. Rowland, communing with himself during the restless ramble in question, had determined that he would at least cease to observe, to heed, or to care for what Miss Garland and Roderick might do or might not do together."}, {"size": 642, "text": "Nevertheless, some three days afterward, the opportunity presenting itself, he deliberately broached the subject with Roderick. He knew this was inconsistent and faint-hearted; it was indulgence to the fingers that itched to handle forbidden fruit. But he said to himself that it was really more logical to be inconsistent than the reverse; for they had formerly discussed these mysteries very candidly. Was it not perfectly reasonable that he should wish to know the sequel of the situation which Roderick had then delineated? Roderick had made him promises, and it was to be expected that he should ascertain how the promises had been kept."}, {"size": 779, "text": "Rowland could not say to himself that if the promises had been extorted for Mary Garland\u2019s sake, his present attention to them was equally disinterested; and so he had to admit that he was indeed faint-hearted. He may perhaps be deemed too narrow a casuist, but we have repeated more than once that he was solidly burdened with a conscience. \u201cI imagine,\u201d he said to Roderick, \u201cthat you are not sorry, at present, to have allowed yourself to be dissuaded from making a final rupture with Miss Garland.\u201d Roderick eyed him with the vague and absent look which had lately become habitual to his face, and repeated \u201cDissuaded?\u201d \u201cDon\u2019t you remember that, in Rome, you wished to break your engagement, and that I urged you to respect it, though it seemed to hang by so slender a thread?"}, {"size": 668, "text": "I wished you to see what would come of it? If I am not mistaken, you are reconciled to it.\u201d \u201cOh yes,\u201d said Roderick, \u201cI remember what you said; you made it a kind of personal favor to yourself that I should remain faithful. I consented, but afterwards, when I thought of it, your attitude greatly amused me. Had it ever been seen before?--a man asking another man to gratify him by not suspending his attentions to a pretty girl!\u201d \u201cIt was as selfish as anything else,\u201d said Rowland. \u201cOne man puts his selfishness into one thing, and one into another. It would have utterly marred my comfort to see Miss Garland in low spirits.\u201d \u201cBut you liked her--you admired her, eh?"}, {"size": 705, "text": "So you intimated.\u201d \u201cI admire her profoundly.\u201d \u201cIt was your originality then--to do you justice you have a great deal, of a certain sort--to wish her happiness secured in just that fashion. Many a man would have liked better himself to make the woman he admired happy, and would have welcomed her low spirits as an opening for sympathy. You were awfully queer about it.\u201d \u201cSo be it!\u201d said Rowland. \u201cThe question is, Are you not glad I was queer? Are you not finding that your affection for Miss Garland has a permanent quality which you rather underestimated?\u201d \u201cI don\u2019t pretend to say. When she arrived in Rome, I found I did n\u2019t care for her, and I honestly proposed that we should have no humbug about it."}, {"size": 671, "text": "If you, on the contrary, thought there was something to be gained by having a little humbug, I was willing to try it! I don\u2019t see that the situation is really changed. Mary Garland is all that she ever was--more than all. But I don\u2019t care for her! I don\u2019t care for anything, and I don\u2019t find myself inspired to make an exception in her favor. The only difference is that I don\u2019t care now, whether I care for her or not. Of course, marrying such a useless lout as I am is out of the question for any woman, and I should pay Miss Garland a poor compliment to assume that she is in a hurry to celebrate our nuptials.\u201d \u201cOh, you \u2018re in love!\u201d said Rowland, not very logically."}, {"size": 619, "text": "It must be confessed, at any cost, that this assertion was made for the sole purpose of hearing Roderick deny it. But it quite failed of its aim. Roderick gave a liberal shrug of his shoulders and an irresponsible toss of his head. \u201cCall it what you please! I am past caring for names.\u201d Rowland had not only been illogical, he had also been slightly disingenuous. He did not believe that his companion was in love; he had argued the false to learn the true. The true was that Roderick was again, in some degree, under a charm, and that he found a healing virtue in Mary\u2019s presence, indisposed though he was to admit it."}, {"size": 764, "text": "He had said, shortly before, that her voice was sweet to his ear; and this was a promising beginning. If her voice was sweet it was probable that her glance was not amiss, that her touch had a quiet magic, and that her whole personal presence had learned the art of not being irritating. So Rowland reasoned, and invested Mary Garland with a still finer loveliness. It was true that she herself helped him little to definite conclusions, and that he remained in puzzled doubt as to whether these happy touches were still a matter of the heart, or had become simply a matter of the conscience. He watched for signs that she rejoiced in Roderick\u2019s renewed acceptance of her society; but it seemed to him that she was on her guard against interpreting it too largely."}, {"size": 716, "text": "It was now her turn--he fancied that he sometimes gathered from certain nameless indications of glance and tone and gesture--it was now her turn to be indifferent, to care for other things. Again and again Rowland asked himself what these things were that Miss Garland might be supposed to care for, to the injury of ideal constancy; and again, having designated them, he divided them into two portions. One was that larger experience, in general, which had come to her with her arrival in Europe; the vague sense, borne in upon her imagination, that there were more things one might do with one\u2019s life than youth and ignorance and Northampton had dreamt of; the revision of old pledges in the light of new emotions."}, {"size": 754, "text": "The other was the experience, in especial, of Rowland\u2019s--what? Here Rowland always paused, in perfect sincerity, to measure afresh his possible claim to the young girl\u2019s regard. What might he call it? It had been more than civility and yet it had been less than devotion. It had spoken of a desire to serve, but it had said nothing of a hope of reward. Nevertheless, Rowland\u2019s fancy hovered about the idea that it was recompensable, and his reflections ended in a reverie which perhaps did not define it, but at least, on each occasion, added a little to its volume. Since Miss Garland had asked him as a sort of favor to herself to come also to Switzerland, he thought it possible she might let him know whether he seemed to have effectively served her."}, {"size": 607, "text": "The days passed without her doing so, and at last Rowland walked away to an isolated eminence some five miles from the inn and murmured to the silent rocks that she was ungrateful. Listening nature seemed not to contradict him, so that, on the morrow, he asked the young girl, with an infinitesimal touch of irony, whether it struck her that his deflection from his Florentine plan had been attended with brilliant results. \u201cWhy, we are delighted that you are with us!\u201d she answered. He was anything but satisfied with this; it seemed to imply that she had forgotten that she had solemnly asked him to come."}, {"size": 613, "text": "He reminded her of her request, and recalled the place and time. \u201cThat evening on the terrace, late, after Mrs. Hudson had gone to bed, and Roderick being absent.\u201d She perfectly remembered, but the memory seemed to trouble her. \u201cI am afraid your kindness has been a great charge upon you,\u201d she said. \u201cYou wanted very much to do something else.\u201d \u201cI wanted above all things to oblige you, and I made no sacrifice. But if I had made an immense one, it would be more than made up to me by any assurance that I have helped Roderick into a better mood.\u201d She was silent a moment, and then, \u201cWhy do you ask me?\u201d she said."}, {"size": 628, "text": "\u201cYou are able to judge quite as well as I.\u201d Rowland blushed; he desired to justify himself in the most veracious manner. \u201cThe truth is,\u201d he said, \u201cthat I am afraid I care only in the second place for Roderick\u2019s holding up his head. What I care for in the first place is your happiness.\u201d \u201cI don\u2019t know why that should be,\u201d she answered. \u201cI have certainly done nothing to make you so much my friend. If you were to tell me you intended to leave us to-morrow, I am afraid that I should not venture to ask you to stay. But whether you go or stay, let us not talk of Roderick!\u201d \u201cBut that,\u201d said Rowland, \u201cdoes n\u2019t answer my question."}, {"size": 683, "text": "Is he better?\u201d \u201cNo!\u201d she said, and turned away. He was careful not to tell her that he intended to leave them. One day, shortly after this, as the two young men sat at the inn-door watching the sunset, which on that evening was very striking and lurid, Rowland made an attempt to sound his companion\u2019s present sentiment touching Christina Light. \u201cI wonder where she is,\u201d he said, \u201cand what sort of a life she is leading her prince.\u201d Roderick at first made no response. He was watching a figure on the summit of some distant rocks, opposite to them. The figure was apparently descending into the valley, and in relief against the crimson screen of the western sky, it looked gigantic."}, {"size": 660, "text": "\u201cChristina Light?\u201d Roderick at last repeated, as if arousing himself from a reverie. \u201cWhere she is?

It was only three months ago, but it seems like ten years.\u201d His friend said nothing more, and after a while he went on of his own accord."}, {"size": 616, "text": "\u201cI believed there was a future in it all! She pleased me--pleased me; and when an artist--such as I was--is pleased, you know!\u201d And he paused again. \u201cYou never saw her as I did; you never heard her in her great moments. But there is no use talking about that! At first she would n\u2019t regard me seriously; she chaffed me and made light of me. But at last I forced her to admit I was a great man. Think of that, sir! Christina Light called me a great man. A great man was what she was looking for, and we agreed to find our happiness for life in each other. To please me she promised not to marry till I gave her leave."}, {"size": 625, "text": "I was not in a marrying way myself, but it was damnation to think of another man possessing her. To spare my sensibilities, she promised to turn off her prince, and the idea of her doing so made me as happy as to see a perfect statue shaping itself in the block.

She died for me, like that!\u201d And he snapped his fingers. \u201cWas it wounded vanity, disappointed desire, betrayed confidence? I am sure I don\u2019t know; you certainly have some name for it.\u201d \u201cThe poor girl did the best she could,\u201d said Rowland."}, {"size": 830, "text": "\u201cIf that was her best, so much the worse for her!

Then he relapsed into silence, and the two sat watching the colossal figure as it made its way downward along the jagged silhouette of the rocks. \u201cWho is this mighty man,\u201d cried Roderick at last, \u201cand what is he coming down upon us for? We are small people here, and we can\u2019t undertake to keep company with giants.\u201d \u201cWait till we meet him on our own level,\u201d said Rowland, \u201cand perhaps he will not overtop us.\u201d \u201cFor ten minutes, at least,\u201d Roderick rejoined, \u201che will have been a great man!\u201d At this moment the figure sank beneath the horizon line and became invisible in the uncertain light."}, {"size": 663, "text": "Suddenly Roderick said, \u201cI would like to see her once more--simply to look at her.\u201d \u201cI would not advise it,\u201d said Rowland. \u201cIt was her beauty that did it!\u201d Roderick went on. \u201cIt was all her beauty; in comparison, the rest was nothing. What befooled me was to think of it as my property! And I had made it mine--no one else had studied it as I had, no one else understood it. What does that stick of a Casamassima know about it at this hour? I should like to see it just once more; it \u2018s the only thing in the world of which I can say so.\u201d \u201cI would not advise it,\u201d Rowland repeated. \u201cThat \u2018s right, dear Rowland,\u201d said Roderick; \u201cdon\u2019t advise!

Suddenly it stepped into the circle of light projected from the door and windows, and they beheld little Sam Singleton stopping to stare at them. He was the giant whom they had seen descending along the rocks. When this was made apparent Roderick was seized with a fit of intense hilarity--it was the first time he had laughed in three months. Singleton, who carried a knapsack and walking-staff, received from Rowland the friendliest welcome. He was in the serenest possible humor, and if in the way of luggage his knapsack contained nothing but a comb and a second shirt, he produced from it a dozen admirable sketches."}, {"size": 661, "text": "He had been trudging over half Switzerland and making everywhere the most vivid pictorial notes.

The nights were cold, and our friends, with three or four other chance sojourners, sat in-doors over a fire of logs. Even with Roderick sitting moodily in the outer shadow they made a sympathetic little circle, and they turned over Singleton\u2019s drawings, while he perched in the chimney-corner, blushing and grinning, with his feet on the rounds of his chair."}, {"size": 819, "text": "He had been pedestrianizing for six weeks, and he was glad to rest awhile at Engelthal. It was an economic repose, however, for he sallied forth every morning, with his sketching tools on his back, in search of material for new studies. Roderick\u2019s hilarity, after the first evening, had subsided, and he watched the little painter\u2019s serene activity with a gravity that was almost portentous. Singleton, who was not in the secret of his personal misfortunes, still treated him with timid frankness as the rising star of American art. Roderick had said to Rowland, at first, that Singleton reminded him of some curious little insect with a remarkable mechanical instinct in its antennae; but as the days went by it was apparent that the modest landscapist\u2019s unflagging industry grew to have an oppressive meaning for him."}, {"size": 604, "text": "It pointed a moral, and Roderick used to sit and con the moral as he saw it figured in Singleton\u2019s bent back, on the hot hill-sides, protruding from beneath his white umbrella.

Roderick stood looking at him a moment. \u201cDamnation!\u201d he said at last, solemnly, and turned his back. One morning, shortly after this, Rowland and Roderick took a long walk."}, {"size": 642, "text": "They had walked before in a dozen different directions, but they had not yet crossed a charming little wooded pass, which shut in their valley on one side and descended into the vale of Engelberg. In coming from Lucerne they had approached their inn by this path, and, feeling that they knew it, had hitherto neglected it in favor of untrodden ways. But at last the list of these was exhausted, and Rowland proposed the walk to Engelberg as a novelty. The place is half bleak and half pastoral; a huge white monastery rises abruptly from the green floor of the valley and complicates its picturesqueness with an element rare in Swiss scenery."}, {"size": 811, "text": "Hard by is a group of chalets and inns, with the usual appurtenances of a prosperous Swiss resort--lean brown guides in baggy homespun, lounging under carved wooden galleries, stacks of alpenstocks in every doorway, sun-scorched Englishmen without shirt-collars. Our two friends sat a while at the door of an inn, discussing a pint of wine, and then Roderick, who was indefatigable, announced his intention of climbing to a certain rocky pinnacle which overhung the valley, and, according to the testimony of one of the guides, commanded a view of the Lake of Lucerne. To go and come back was only a matter of an hour, but Rowland, with the prospect of his homeward trudge before him, confessed to a preference for lounging on his bench, or at most strolling a trifle farther and taking a look at the monastery."}, {"size": 725, "text": "Roderick went off alone, and his companion after a while bent his steps to the monasterial church. It was remarkable, like most of the churches of Catholic Switzerland, for a hideous style of devotional ornament; but it had a certain cold and musty picturesqueness, and Rowland lingered there with some tenderness for Alpine piety. While he was near the high-altar some people came in at the west door; but he did not notice them, and was presently engaged in deciphering a curious old German epitaph on one of the mural tablets. At last he turned away, wondering whether its syntax or its theology was the more uncomfortable, and, to this infinite surprise, found himself confronted with the Prince and Princess Casamassima."}, {"size": 799, "text": "The surprise on Christina\u2019s part, for an instant, was equal, and at first she seemed disposed to turn away without letting it give place to a greeting. The prince, however, saluted gravely, and then Christina, in silence, put out her hand. Rowland immediately asked whether they were staying at Engelberg, but Christina only looked at him without speaking. The prince answered his questions, and related that they had been making a month\u2019s tour in Switzerland, that at Lucerne his wife had been somewhat obstinately indisposed, and that the physician had recommended a week\u2019s trial of the tonic air and goat\u2019s milk of Engelberg.

Rowland remembered that the Cavaliere Giacosa had told him that Mrs. Light\u2019s candidate was thoroughly a prince, and our friend wondered how he relished a peremptory accent.

It was the outward mark of her sacrificed ideal.

So long as she had been free to choose, she had esteemed him: but from the moment she was forced to marry him she had detested him. Rowland read in the young man\u2019s elastic Italian mask a profound consciousness of all this; and as he found there also a record of other curious things--of pride, of temper, of bigotry, of an immense heritage of more or less aggressive traditions--he reflected that the matrimonial conjunction of his two companions might be sufficiently prolific in incident."}, {"size": 666, "text": "\u201cYou are going to Naples?\u201d Rowland said to the prince by way of conversation. \u201cWe are going to Paris,\u201d Christina interposed, slowly and softly. \u201cWe are going to London.

While he engaged Rowland\u2019s attention Christina turned away. When Rowland glanced at her again he saw a change pass over her face; she was observing something that was concealed from his own eyes by the angle of the church-wall.

Christina then put out her hand to Rowland. \u201cFarewell,\u201d she said. \u201cIf you are near me in future, don\u2019t try to see me!\u201d And then, after a pause, in a lower tone, \u201cI was sincere!\u201d She addressed herself again to Roderick and asked him some commonplace about his walk."}, {"size": 694, "text": "But he said nothing; he only looked at her.

Early on the morrow Roderick, saying nothing of his intentions, started off on a walk; Rowland saw him striding with light steps along the rugged path to Engelberg.

When he had left the room Miss Garland drew near to Rowland. \u201cI wish to ask you a question,\u201d she said. \u201cWhat happened to Roderick yesterday at Engelberg?\u201d \u201cYou have discovered that something happened?\u201d Rowland answered."}, {"size": 675, "text": "\u201cI am sure of it.

The conversation had been brief, but, like many small things, it furnished Rowland with food for reflection. When one is looking for symptoms one easily finds them. This was the first time Mary Garland had asked Rowland a question which it was in Roderick\u2019s power to answer, the first time she had frankly betrayed Roderick\u2019s reticence. Rowland ventured to think it marked an era. The next morning was sultry, and the air, usually so fresh at those altitudes, was oppressively heavy."}, {"size": 733, "text": "Rowland lounged on the grass a while, near Singleton, who was at work under his white umbrella, within view of the house; and then in quest of coolness he wandered away to the rocky ridge whence you looked across at the Jungfrau. To-day, however, the white summits were invisible; their heads were muffled in sullen clouds and the valleys beneath them curtained in dun-colored mist. Rowland had a book in his pocket, and he took it out and opened it. But his page remained unturned; his own thoughts were more importunate. His interview with Christina Light had made a great impression upon him, and he was haunted with the memory of her almost blameless bitterness, and of all that was tragic and fatal in her latest transformation."}, {"size": 679, "text": "These things were immensely appealing, and Rowland thought with infinite impatience of Roderick\u2019s having again encountered them. It required little imagination to apprehend that the young sculptor\u2019s condition had also appealed to Christina. His consummate indifference, his supreme defiance, would make him a magnificent trophy, and Christina had announced with sufficient distinctness that she had said good-by to scruples. It was her fancy at present to treat the world as a garden of pleasure, and if, hitherto, she had played with Roderick\u2019s passion on its stem, there was little doubt that now she would pluck it with an unfaltering hand and drain it of its acrid sweetness."}, {"size": 735, "text": "And why the deuce need Roderick have gone marching back to destruction? Rowland\u2019s meditations, even when they began in rancor, often brought him peace; but on this occasion they ushered in a quite peculiar quality of unrest. He felt conscious of a sudden collapse in his moral energy; a current that had been flowing for two years with liquid strength seemed at last to pause and evaporate. Rowland looked away at the stagnant vapors on the mountains; their dreariness seemed a symbol of the dreariness which his own generosity had bequeathed him. At last he had arrived at the uttermost limit of the deference a sane man might pay to other people\u2019s folly; nay, rather, he had transgressed it; he had been befooled on a gigantic scale."}, {"size": 676, "text": "He turned to his book and tried to woo back patience, but it gave him cold comfort and he tossed it angrily away. He pulled his hat over his eyes, and tried to wonder, dispassionately, whether atmospheric conditions had not something to do with his ill-humor. He remained for some time in this attitude, but was finally aroused from it by a singular sense that, although he had heard nothing, some one had approached him. He looked up and saw Roderick standing before him on the turf. His mood made the spectacle unwelcome, and for a moment he felt like uttering an uncivil speech. Roderick stood looking at him with an expression of countenance which had of late become rare."}, {"size": 869, "text": "There was an unfamiliar spark in his eye and a certain imperious alertness in his carriage.

Breakfast, at the inn, was early, and by breakfast-time Roderick had not appeared. Then Rowland admitted that he was nervous.

The creature\u2019s family was scattered on the mountain-sides; he could give Rowland no help to find them. Rowland climbed into many awkward places, and skirted, intently and peeringly, many an ugly chasm and steep-dropping ledge.

I have not the least idea where we are.\u201d \u201cWe are at about three hours\u2019 walk from home,\u201d said Singleton. \u201cI will go for help; I can find my way.\u201d \u201cRemember,\u201d said Rowland, \u201cwhom you will have to face.\u201d \u201cI remember,\u201d the excellent fellow answered. \u201cThere was nothing I could ever do for him in life; I will do what I can now.\u201d"}, {"size": 683, "text": "He went off, and Rowland stayed there alone. He watched for seven long hours, and his vigil was forever memorable. The most rational of men was for an hour the most passionate. He reviled himself with transcendent bitterness, he accused himself of cruelty and injustice, he would have lain down there in Roderick\u2019s place to unsay the words that had yesterday driven him forth on his lonely ramble. Roderick had been fond of saying that there are such things as necessary follies, and Rowland was now proving it. At last he grew almost used to the dumb exultation of the cliff above him. He saw that Roderick was a mass of hideous injury, and he tried to understand what had happened."}, {"size": 768, "text": "Not that it helped him; before that confounding mortality one hypothesis after another faltered and swooned away. Roderick\u2019s passionate walk had carried him farther and higher than he knew; he had outstayed, supposably, the first menace of the storm, and perhaps even found a defiant entertainment in watching it. Perhaps he had simply lost himself. The tempest had overtaken him, and when he tried to return, it was too late. He had attempted to descend the cliff in the darkness, he had made the inevitable slip, and whether he had fallen fifty feet or three hundred little mattered. The condition of his body indicated the shorter fall. Now that all was over, Rowland understood how exclusively, for two years, Roderick had filled his life. His occupation was gone."}, {"size": 753, "text": "Singleton came back with four men--one of them the landlord of the inn. They had formed a sort of rude bier of the frame of a chaise a porteurs, and by taking a very round-about course homeward were able to follow a tolerably level path and carry their burden with a certain decency. To Rowland it seemed as if the little procession would never reach the inn; but as they drew near it he would have given his right hand for a longer delay. The people of the inn came forward to meet them, in a little silent, solemn convoy. In the doorway, clinging together, appeared the two bereaved women. Mrs. Hudson tottered forward with outstretched hands and the expression of a blind person; but before she reached her son, Mary Garland had rushed past her, and,"}, {"size": 691, "text": "in the face of the staring, pitying, awe-stricken crowd, had flung herself, with the magnificent movement of one whose rights were supreme, and with a loud, tremendous cry, upon the senseless vestige of her love. That cry still lives in Rowland\u2019s ears. It interposes, persistently, against the reflection that when he sometimes--very rarely--sees her, she is unreservedly kind to him; against the memory that during the dreary journey back to America, made of course with his assistance, there was a great frankness in her gratitude, a great gratitude in her frankness. Miss Garland lives with Mrs. Hudson, at Northampton, where Rowland visits his cousin Cecilia more frequently than of old."}, {"size": 353, "text": "When he calls upon Miss Garland he never sees Mrs. Hudson. Cecilia, who, having her shrewd impression that he comes to see Miss Garland as much as to see herself, does not feel obliged to seem unduly flattered, calls him, whenever he reappears, the most restless of mortals. But he always says to her in answer, \u201cNo, I assure you I am the most patient!\u201d"}]}
