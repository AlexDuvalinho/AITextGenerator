My knowledge of the English language had marked me out for a certain employment. Though I cannot conceive a soldier refusing to incur the risk, yet to be hanged for a spy is a disgusting business; and I was relieved to be held a prisoner of war. Into the Castle of Edinburgh, standing in the midst of that city on the summit of an extraordinary rock, I was cast with several hundred fellow-sufferers, all privates like myself, and the more part of them, by an accident, very ignorant, plain fellows."}, {"size": 631, "text": "My English, which had brought me into that scrape, now helped me very materially to bear it. I had a thousand advantages. I was often called to play the part of an interpreter, whether of orders or complaints, and thus brought in relations, sometimes of mirth, sometimes almost of friendship, with the officers in charge. A young lieutenant singled me out to be his adversary at chess, a game in which I was extremely proficient, and would reward me for my gambits with excellent cigars. The major of the battalion took lessons of French from me while at breakfast, and was sometimes so obliging as to have me join him at the meal."}, {"size": 812, "text": "Chevenix was his name. He was stiff as a drum-major and selfish as an Englishman, but a fairly conscientious pupil and a fairly upright man. Little did I suppose that his ramrod body and frozen face would, in the end, step in between me and all my dearest wishes; that upon this precise, regular, icy soldier-man my fortunes should so nearly shipwreck! I never liked, but yet I trusted him; and though it may seem but a trifle, I found his snuff-box with the bean in it come very welcome. For it is strange how grown men and seasoned soldiers can go back in life; so that after but a little while in prison, which is after all the next thing to being in the nursery, they grow absorbed in the most pitiful, childish interests, and a sugar biscuit or a pinch of snuff become things to follow after and scheme for!"}, {"size": 603, "text": "We made but a poor show of prisoners. The officers had been all offered their parole, and had taken it. They lived mostly in suburbs of the city, lodging with modest families, and enjoyed their freedom and supported the almost continual evil tidings of the Emperor as best they might. It chanced I was the only gentleman among the privates who remained. A great part were ignorant Italians, of a regiment that had suffered heavily in Catalonia. The rest were mere diggers of the soil, treaders of grapes or hewers of wood, who had been suddenly and violently preferred to the glorious state of soldiers."}, {"size": 671, "text": "We had but the one interest in common: each of us who had any skill with his fingers passed the hours of his captivity in the making of little toys and _articles of Paris_; and the prison was daily visited at certain hours by a concourse of people of the country, come to exult over our distress, or\u2014it is more tolerant to suppose\u2014their own vicarious triumph. Some moved among us with a decency of shame or sympathy. Others were the most offensive personages in the world, gaped at us as if we had been baboons, sought to evangelise us to their rustic, northern religion, as though we had been savages, or tortured us with intelligence of disasters to the arms of France."}, {"size": 603, "text": "Good, bad, and indifferent, there was one alleviation to the annoyance of these visitors; for it was the practice of almost all to purchase some specimen of our rude handiwork. This led, amongst the prisoners, to a strong spirit of competition. Some were neat of hand, and (the genius of the French being always distinguished) could place upon sale little miracles of dexterity and taste. Some had a more engaging appearance; fine features were found to do as well as fine merchandise, and an air of youth in particular (as it appealed to the sentiment of pity in our visitors) to be a source of profit."}, {"size": 649, "text": "Others again enjoyed some acquaintance with the language, and were able to recommend the more agreeably to purchasers such trifles as they had to sell. To the first of these advantages I could lay no claim, for my fingers were all thumbs. Some at least of the others I possessed; and finding much entertainment in our commerce, I did not suffer my advantages to rust. I have never despised the social arts, in which it is a national boast that every Frenchman should excel. For the approach of particular sorts of visitors, I had a particular manner of address, and even of appearance, which I could readily assume and change on the occasion rising."}, {"size": 621, "text": "I never lost an opportunity to flatter either the person of my visitor, if it should be a lady, or, if it should be a man, the greatness of his country in war. And in case my compliments should miss their aim, I was always ready to cover my retreat with some agreeable pleasantry, which would often earn me the name of an \u2018oddity\u2019 or a \u2018droll fellow.\u2019 In this way, although I was so left-handed a toy-maker, I made out to be rather a successful merchant; and found means to procure many little delicacies and alleviations, such as children or prisoners desire. I am scarcely drawing the portrait of a very melancholy man."}, {"size": 834, "text": "It is not indeed my character; and I had, in a comparison with my comrades, many reasons for content. In the first place, I had no family: I was an orphan and a bachelor; neither wife nor child awaited me in France. In the second, I had never wholly forgot the emotions with which I first found myself a prisoner; and although a military prison be not altogether a garden of delights, it is still preferable to a gallows. In the third, I am almost ashamed to say it, but I found a certain pleasure in our place of residence: being an obsolete and really mediaeval fortress, high placed and commanding extraordinary prospects, not only over sea, mountain, and champaign but actually over the thoroughfares of a capital city, which we could see blackened by day with the moving crowd of the inhabitants, and at night shining with lamps."}, {"size": 726, "text": "And lastly, although I was not insensible to the restraints of prison or the scantiness of our rations, I remembered I had sometimes eaten quite as ill in Spain, and had to mount guard and march perhaps a dozen leagues into the bargain. The first of my troubles, indeed, was the costume we were obliged to wear. There is a horrible practice in England to trick out in ridiculous uniforms, and as it were to brand in mass, not only convicts but military prisoners, and even the children in charity schools. I think some malignant genius had found his masterpiece of irony in the dress which we were condemned to wear: jacket, waistcoat, and trousers of a sulphur or mustard yellow, and a shirt or blue-and-white striped cotton."}, {"size": 642, "text": "It was conspicuous, it was cheap, it pointed us out to laughter\u2014we, who were old soldiers, used to arms, and some of us showing noble scars,\u2014like a set of lugubrious zanies at a fair. The old name of that rock on which our prison stood was (I have heard since then) the _Painted Hill_. Well, now it was all painted a bright yellow with our costumes; and the dress of the soldiers who guarded us being of course the essential British red rag, we made up together the elements of a lively picture of hell. I have again and again looked round upon my fellow-prisoners, and felt my anger rise, and choked upon tears, to behold them thus parodied."}, {"size": 641, "text": "The more part, as I have said, were peasants, somewhat bettered perhaps by the drill-sergeant, but for all that ungainly, loutish fellows, with no more than a mere barrack-room smartness of address: indeed, you could have seen our army nowhere more discreditably represented than in this Castle of Edinburgh. And I used to see myself in fancy, and blush. It seemed that my more elegant carriage would but point the insult of the travesty. And I remembered the days when I wore the coarse but honourable coat of a soldier; and remembered further back how many of the noble, the fair, and the gracious had taken a delight to tend my childhood."}, {"size": 698, "text": ". . . But I must not recall these tender and sorrowful memories twice; their place is further on, and I am now upon another business. The perfidy of the Britannic Government stood nowhere more openly confessed than in one particular of our discipline: that we were shaved twice in the week. To a man who has loved all his life to be fresh shaven, can a more irritating indignity be devised? Monday and Thursday were the days. Take the Thursday, and conceive the picture I must present by Sunday evening! And Saturday, which was almost as bad, was the great day for visitors. Those who came to our market were of all qualities, men and women, the lean and the stout, the plain and the fairly pretty."}, {"size": 669, "text": "Sure, if people at all understood the power of beauty, there would be no prayers addressed except to Venus; and the mere privilege of beholding a comely woman is worth paying for. Our visitors, upon the whole, were not much to boast of; and yet, sitting in a corner and very much ashamed of myself and my absurd appearance, I have again and again tasted the finest, the rarest, and the most ethereal pleasures in a glance of an eye that I should never see again\u2014and never wanted to. The flower of the hedgerow and the star in heaven satisfy and delight us: how much more the look of that exquisite being who was created to bear and rear, to madden and rejoice, mankind!"}, {"size": 646, "text": "There was one young lady in particular, about eighteen or nineteen, tall, of a gallant carriage, and with a profusion of hair in which the sun found threads of gold. As soon as she came in the courtyard (and she was a rather frequent visitor) it seemed I was aware of it. She had an air of angelic candour, yet of a high spirit; she stepped like a Diana, every movement was noble and free. One day there was a strong east wind; the banner was straining at the flagstaff; below us the smoke of the city chimneys blew hither and thither in a thousand crazy variations; and away out on the Forth we could see the ships lying down to it and scudding."}, {"size": 610, "text": "I was thinking what a vile day it was, when she appeared. Her hair blew in the wind with changes of colour; her garments moulded her with the accuracy of sculpture; the ends of her shawl fluttered about her ear and were caught in again with an inimitable deftness. You have seen a pool on a gusty day, how it suddenly sparkles and flashes like a thing alive? So this lady\u2019s face had become animated and coloured; and as I saw her standing, somewhat inclined, her lips parted, a divine trouble in her eyes, I could have clapped my hands in applause, and was ready to acclaim her a genuine daughter of the winds."}, {"size": 646, "text": "What put it in my head, I know not: perhaps because it was a Thursday and I was new from the razor; but I determined to engage her attention no later than that day. She was approaching that part of the court in which I sat with my merchandise, when I observed her handkerchief to escape from her hands and fall to the ground; the next moment the wind had taken it up and carried it within my reach. I was on foot at once: I had forgot my mustard-coloured clothes, I had forgot the private soldier and his salute. Bowing deeply, I offered her the slip of cambric. \u2018Madam,\u2019 said I, \u2018your handkerchief. The wind brought it me.\u2019 I met her eyes fully."}, {"size": 640, "text": "\u2018I thank you, sir,\u2019 said she. \u2018The wind brought it me,\u2019 I repeated. \u2018May I not take it for an omen? You have an English proverb, \u201cIt\u2019s an ill wind that blows nobody good.\u201d\u2019 \u2018Well,\u2019 she said, with a smile, \u2018\u201cOne good turn deserves another.\u201d I will see what you have.\u2019 She followed me to where my wares were spread out under lee of a piece of cannon. \u2018Alas, mademoiselle!\u2019 said I, \u2018I am no very perfect craftsman. This is supposed to be a house, and you see the chimneys are awry. You may call this a box if you are very indulgent; but see where my tool slipped! Yes, I am afraid you may go from one to another, and find a flaw in everything."}, {"size": 772, "text": "_Failures for Sale_ should be on my signboard. I do not keep a shop; I keep a Humorous Museum.\u2019 I cast a smiling glance about my display, and then at her, and instantly became grave. \u2018Strange, is it not,\u2019 I added, \u2018that a grown man and a soldier should be engaged upon such trash, and a sad heart produce anything so funny to look at?\u2019 An unpleasant voice summoned her at this moment by the name of Flora, and she made a hasty purchase and rejoined her party. A few days after she came again. But I must first tell you how she came to be so frequent. Her aunt was one of those terrible British old maids, of which the world has heard much; and having nothing whatever to do, and a word or two of French, she had taken what she called an _interest in the French prisoners_."}, {"size": 650, "text": "A big, bustling, bold old lady, she flounced about our market-place with insufferable airs of patronage and condescension. She bought, indeed, with liberality, but her manner of studying us through a quizzing-glass, and playing cicerone to her followers, acquitted us of any gratitude. She had a tail behind her of heavy, obsequious old gentlemen, or dull, giggling misses, to whom she appeared to be an oracle. \u2018This one can really carve prettily: is he not a quiz with his big whiskers?\u2019 she would say. \u2018And this one,\u2019 indicating myself with her gold eye-glass, \u2018is, I assure you, quite an oddity.\u2019 The oddity, you may be certain, ground his teeth."}, {"size": 715, "text": "She had a way of standing in our midst, nodding around, and addressing us in what she imagined to be French: \u2018_Bienne_, _hommes_! _\u00e7a va bienne_?\u2019 I took the freedom to reply in the same lingo: _Bienne_, _femme_! _\u00e7a va couci-couci tout d\u2019m\u00eame_, _la bourgeoise_!\u2019 And at that, when we had all laughed with a little more heartiness than was entirely civil, \u2018I told you he was quite an oddity!\u2019 says she in triumph. Needless to say, these passages were before I had remarked the niece. The aunt came on the day in question with a following rather more than usually large, which she manoeuvred to and fro about the market and lectured to at rather more than usual length, and with rather less than her accustomed tact."}, {"size": 746, "text": "I kept my eyes down, but they were ever fixed in the same direction, quite in vain. The aunt came and went, and pulled us out, and showed us off, like caged monkeys; but the niece kept herself on the outskirts of the crowd and on the opposite side of the courtyard, and departed at last as she had come, without a sign. Closely as I had watched her, I could not say her eyes had ever rested on me for an instant; and my heart was overwhelmed with bitterness and blackness. I tore out her detested image; I felt I was done with her for ever; I laughed at myself savagely, because I had thought to please; when I lay down at night sleep forsook me, and I lay, and rolled, and gloated on her charms, and cursed her insensibility, for half the night."}, {"size": 708, "text": "How trivial I thought her! and how trivial her sex! A man might be an angel or an Apollo, and a mustard-coloured coat would wholly blind them to his merits. I was a prisoner, a slave, a contemned and despicable being, the butt of her sniggering countrymen. I would take the lesson: no proud daughter of my foes should have the chance to mock at me again; none in the future should have the chance to think I had looked at her with admiration. You cannot imagine any one of a more resolute and independent spirit, or whose bosom was more wholly mailed with patriotic arrogance, than I. Before I dropped asleep, I had remembered all the infamies of Britain, and debited them in an overwhelming column to Flora."}, {"size": 626, "text": "The next day, as I sat in my place, I became conscious there was some one standing near; and behold, it was herself! I kept my seat, at first in the confusion of my mind, later on from policy; and she stood, and leaned a little over me, as in pity. She was very still and timid; her voice was low. Did I suffer in my captivity? she asked me. Had I to complain of any hardship? \u2018Mademoiselle, I have not learned to complain,\u2019 said I. \u2018I am a soldier of Napoleon.\u2019 She sighed. \u2018At least you must regret _La France_,\u2019 said she, and coloured a little as she pronounced the words, which she did with a pretty strangeness of accent."}, {"size": 650, "text": "\u2018What am I to say?\u2019 I replied. \u2018If you were carried from this country, for which you seem so wholly suited, where the very rains and winds seem to become you like ornaments, would you regret, do you think? We must surely all regret! the son to his mother, the man to his country; these are native feelings.\u2019 \u2018You have a mother?\u2019 she asked. \u2018In heaven, mademoiselle,\u2019 I answered. \u2018She, and my father also, went by the same road to heaven as so many others of the fair and brave: they followed their queen upon the scaffold. So, you see, I am not so much to be pitied in my prison,\u2019 I continued: \u2018there are none to wait for me; I am alone in the world."}, {"size": 613, "text": "\u2019Tis a different case, for instance, with yon poor fellow in the cloth cap. His bed is next to mine, and in the night I hear him sobbing to himself. He has a tender character, full of tender and pretty sentiments; and in the dark at night, and sometimes by day when he can get me apart with him, he laments a mother and a sweetheart. Do you know what made him take me for a confidant?\u2019 She parted her lips with a look, but did not speak. The look burned all through me with a sudden vital heat. \u2018Because I had once seen, in marching by, the belfry of his village!\u2019 I continued. \u2018The circumstance is quaint enough."}, {"size": 603, "text": "It seems to bind up into one the whole bundle of those human instincts that make life beautiful, and people and places dear\u2014and from which it would seem I am cut off!\u2019 I rested my chin on my knee and looked before me on the ground. I had been talking until then to hold her; but I was now not sorry she should go: an impression is a thing so delicate to produce and so easy to overthrow! Presently she seemed to make an effort. \u2018I will take this toy,\u2019 she said, laid a five-and-sixpenny piece in my hand, and was gone ere I could thank her. I retired to a place apart near the ramparts and behind a gun."}, {"size": 613, "text": "The beauty, the expression of her eyes, the tear that had trembled there, the compassion in her voice, and a kind of wild elegance that consecrated the freedom of her movements, all combined to enslave my imagination and inflame my heart. What had she said? Nothing to signify; but her eyes had met mine, and the fire they had kindled burned inextinguishably in my veins. I loved her; and I did not fear to hope. Twice I had spoken with her; and in both interviews I had been well inspired, I had engaged her sympathies, I had found words that she must remember, that would ring in her ears at night upon her bed."}, {"size": 681, "text": "What mattered if I were half shaved and my clothes a caricature? I was still a man, and I had drawn my image on her memory. I was still a man, and, as I trembled to realise, she was still a woman. Many waters cannot quench love; and love, which is the law of the world, was on my side. I closed my eyes, and she sprang up on the background of the darkness, more beautiful than in life. \u2018Ah!\u2019 thought I, \u2018and you too, my dear, you too must carry away with you a picture, that you are still to behold again and still to embellish. In the darkness of night, in the streets by day, still you are to have my voice and face, whispering, making love for me, encroaching on your shy heart."}, {"size": 805, "text": "Shy as your heart is, _it_ is lodged there\u2014_I_ am lodged there; let the hours do their office\u2014let time continue to draw me ever in more lively, ever in more insidious colours.\u2019 And then I had a vision of myself, and burst out laughing. A likely thing, indeed, that a beggar-man, a private soldier, a prisoner in a yellow travesty, was to awake the interest of this fair girl! I would not despair; but I saw the game must be played fine and close. It must be my policy to hold myself before her, always in a pathetic or pleasing attitude; never to alarm or startle her; to keep my own secret locked in my bosom like a story of disgrace, and let hers (if she could be induced to have one) grow at its own rate; to move just so fast, and not by a hair\u2019s-breadth any faster, than the inclination of her heart."}, {"size": 672, "text": "I was the man, and yet I was passive, tied by the foot in prison. I could not go to her; I must cast a spell upon her at each visit, so that she should return to me; and this was a matter of nice management. I had done it the last time\u2014it seemed impossible she should not come again after our interview; and for the next I had speedily ripened a fresh plan. A prisoner, if he has one great disability for a lover, has yet one considerable advantage: there is nothing to distract him, and he can spend all his hours ripening his love and preparing its manifestations. I had been then some days upon a piece of carving,\u2014no less than the emblem of Scotland, the Lion Rampant."}, {"size": 783, "text": "This I proceeded to finish with what skill I was possessed of; and when at last I could do no more to it (and, you may be sure, was already regretting I had done so much), added on the base the following dedication.\u2014 \u00c0 LA BELLE FLORA LE PRISONNIER RECONNAISSANT A. D. ST. Y. D. K. I put my heart into the carving of these letters. What was done with so much ardour, it seemed scarce possible that any should behold with indifference; and the initials would at least suggest to her my noble birth. I thought it better to suggest: I felt that mystery was my stock-in-trade; the contrast between my rank and manners, between my speech and my clothing, and the fact that she could only think of me by a combination of letters, must all tend to increase her interest and engage her heart."}, {"size": 631, "text": "This done, there was nothing left for me but to wait and to hope. And there is nothing further from my character: in love and in war, I am all for the forward movement; and these days of waiting made my purgatory. It is a fact that I loved her a great deal better at the end of them, for love comes, like bread, from a perpetual rehandling. And besides, I was fallen into a panic of fear. How, if she came no more, how was I to continue to endure my empty days? how was I to fall back and find my interest in the major\u2019s lessons, the lieutenant\u2019s chess, in a twopenny sale in the market, or a halfpenny addition to the prison fare?"}, {"size": 885, "text": "Days went by, and weeks; I had not the courage to calculate, and to-day I have not the courage to remember; but at last she was there. At last I saw her approach me in the company of a boy about her own age, and whom I divined at once to be her brother. I rose and bowed in silence. \u2018This is my brother, Mr. Ronald Gilchrist,\u2019 said she. \u2018I have told him of your sufferings. He is so sorry for you!\u2019 \u2018It is more than I have the right to ask,\u2019 I replied; \u2018but among gentlefolk these generous sentiments are natural. If your brother and I were to meet in the field, we should meet like tigers; but when he sees me here disarmed and helpless, he forgets his animosity.\u2019 (At which, as I had ventured to expect, this beardless champion coloured to the ears for pleasure.) \u2018Ah, my dear young lady,\u2019 I continued, \u2018there are many of your countrymen languishing in my country, even as I do here."}, {"size": 627, "text": "I can but hope there is found some French lady to convey to each of them the priceless consolation of her sympathy. You have given me alms; and more than alms\u2014hope; and while you were absent I was not forgetful. Suffer me to be able to tell myself that I have at least tried to make a return; and for the prisoner\u2019s sake deign to accept this trifle.\u2019 So saying, I offered her my lion, which she took, looked at in some embarrassment, and then, catching sight of the dedication, broke out with a cry. \u2018Why, how did you know my name?\u2019 she exclaimed. \u2018When names are so appropriate, they should be easily guessed,\u2019 said I, bowing."}, {"size": 666, "text": "\u2018But indeed, there was no magic in the matter. A lady called you by name on the day I found your handkerchief, and I was quick to remark and cherish it.\u2019 \u2018It is very, very beautiful,\u2019 said she, \u2018and I shall be always proud of the inscription.\u2014Come, Ronald, we must be going.\u2019 She bowed to me as a lady bows to her equal, and passed on (I could have sworn) with a heightened colour. I was overjoyed: my innocent ruse had succeeded; she had taken my gift without a hint of payment, and she would scarce sleep in peace till she had made it up to me. No greenhorn in matters of the heart, I was besides aware that I had now a resident ambassador at the court of my lady."}, {"size": 783, "text": "The lion might be ill chiselled; it was mine. My hands had made and held it; my knife\u2014or, to speak more by the mark, my rusty nail\u2014had traced those letters; and simple as the words were, they would keep repeating to her that I was grateful and that I found her fair. The boy had looked like a gawky, and blushed at a compliment; I could see besides that he regarded me with considerable suspicion; yet he made so manly a figure of a lad, that I could not withhold from him my sympathy. And as for the impulse that had made her bring and introduce him, I could not sufficiently admire it. It seemed to me finer than wit, and more tender than a caress. It said (plain as language), \u2018I do not and I cannot know you. Here is my brother\u2014you can know him; this is the way to me\u2014follow it.\u2019"}, {"size": 678, "text": "CHAPTER II\u2014A TALE OF A PAIR OF SCISSORS I was still plunged in these thoughts when the bell was rung that discharged our visitors into the street. Our little market was no sooner closed than we were summoned to the distribution, and received our rations, which we were then allowed to eat according to fancy in any part of our quarters.I have said the conduct of some of our visitors was unbearably offensive; it was possibly more so than they dreamed\u2014as the sight-seers at a menagerie may offend in a thousand ways, and quite without meaning it, the noble and unfortunate animals behind the bars; and there is no doubt but some of my compatriots were susceptible beyond reason."}, {"size": 740, "text": "Some of these old whiskerandos, originally peasants, trained since boyhood in victorious armies, and accustomed to move among subject and trembling populations, could ill brook their change of circumstance. There was one man of the name of Goguelat, a brute of the first water, who had enjoyed no touch of civilisation beyond the military discipline, and had risen by an extreme heroism of bravery to a grade for which he was otherwise unfitted\u2014that of _mar\u00e9chal des logis_ in the 22nd of the line. In so far as a brute can be a good soldier, he was a good soldier; the Cross was on his breast, and gallantly earned; but in all things outside his line of duty the man was no other than a brawling, bruising ignorant pillar of low pothouses."}, {"size": 642, "text": "As a gentleman by birth, and a scholar by taste and education, I was the type of all that he least understood and most detested; and the mere view of our visitors would leave him daily in a transport of annoyance, which he would make haste to wreak on the nearest victim, and too often on myself. It was so now. Our rations were scarce served out, and I had just withdrawn into a corner of the yard, when I perceived him drawing near. He wore an air of hateful mirth; a set of young fools, among whom he passed for a wit, followed him with looks of expectation; and I saw I was about to be the object of some of his insufferable pleasantries."}, {"size": 737, "text": "He took a place beside me, spread out his rations, drank to me derisively from his measure of prison beer, and began.

The question of arms was more obscure. We had a good many tools, indeed, which we employed in the manufacture of our toys; but they were none of them suited for a single combat between civilised men, and, being nondescript, it was found extremely hard to equalise the chances of the combatants."}, {"size": 703, "text": "At length a pair of scissors was unscrewed; and a couple of tough wands being found in a corner of the courtyard, one blade of the scissors was lashed solidly to each with resined twine\u2014the twine coming I know not whence, but the resin from the green pillars of the shed, which still sweated from the axe. It was a strange thing to feel in one\u2019s hand this weapon, which was no heavier than a riding-rod, and which it was difficult to suppose would prove more dangerous.

It was to play my life upon one card: should I not mortally wound him, no defence would be left me; what was yet more appalling, I thus ran the risk of bringing my own face against his scissor with the double force of our assaults, and my face and eyes are not that part of me that I would the most readily expose."}, {"size": 664, "text": "\u2018_Allez_!\u2019 said the sergeant-major.

The idea of having killed a man with such an instrument as half a pair of scissors seemed to turn my stomach. I am sure I might have killed a dozen with a firelock, a sabre, a bayonet, or any accepted weapon, and been visited by no such sickness of remorse.

Here had we two expatriated Frenchmen engaged in an ill-regulated combat like the battles of beasts. Here was he, who had been all his life so great a ruffian, dying in a foreign land of this ignoble injury, and meeting death with something of the spirit of a Bayard.

The doctor vowed it was impossible, the nature and direction of the wound forbidding it. Goguelat replied that he was more ingenious than the other thought for, and had propped up the weapon in the ground and fallen on the point\u2014\u2018just like Nebuchadnezzar,\u2019 he added, winking to the assistants.

Cleanliness is good, but I cannot bear a man\u2019s nails to seem japanned. And certainly he was too self-possessed and cold. There was none of the fire of youth, none of the swiftness of the soldier, in this young officer. His kindness was cold, and cruel cold; his deliberation exasperating.

A private of pioneers remembered the formula for that\u2014or else remembered part of it and obligingly invented the remainder.

In short, if any two set forth upon this enterprise, they invariably returned with two opinions, and often with a black eye in the bargain. I looked on upon these proceedings, although not without laughter, yet with impatience and disgust.

It was lucky for us that he was one of the prime movers and believers in our project of escape, or he had certainly revenged himself by a denunciation.

In this situation I had really but the one wish, and that was: something else to think of! Strange to say, I got it: a veil was torn from my mind, and I saw what a fool I was\u2014what fools we had all been\u2014and that I had no business to be thus dangling between earth and heaven by my arms.

This made me a second landmark, the ledge being my first. I began accordingly to compute intervals of time: so much to the ledge, so much again to the wallflower, so much more below.

I am not strong enough to keep this rope extended. If I do not keep it extended the next man will be dashed against the precipice. There is no reason why he should have my extravagant good luck. I see no reason why he should not fall\u2014nor any place for him to fall on but my head.\u2019 From where I was now standing there was occasionally visible, as the fog lightened, a lamp in one of the barrack windows, which gave me a measure of the height he had to fall and the horrid force that he must strike me with."}, {"size": 627, "text": "What was yet worse, we had agreed to do without signals: every so many minutes by Laclas\u2019 watch another man was to be started from the battlements.

I began to be afraid that our conspiracy was out, that my friends were all secured, and that I should pass the remainder of the night, and be discovered in the morning, vainly clinging to the rope\u2019s end like a hooked fish upon an angle.

It was like the fellow, who had no harm in him beyond an instinctive selfishness. But he was like to have paid pretty dearly for the privilege.

The round, however, went by, and nothing was discovered; the third man came to the ground quite easily; the fourth was, of course, child\u2019s play; and before there were ten of us collected, it seemed to me that, without the least injustice to my comrades, I might proceed to take care of myself."}, {"size": 688, "text": "I knew their plan: they had a map and an almanack, and designed for Grangemouth, where they were to steal a ship.

As the day wore on, the sun came very pleasantly out. I had been awake all night, I had undergone the most violent agitations of mind and body, and it is not so much to be wondered at, as it was exceedingly unwise and foolhardy, that I should have dropped into a doze.

I have named the talismans on which I habitually depend, but here was a conjuncture in which both were wholly useless.

This second drover (whose name proved to be Candlish) rose on our approach. \u2018Here\u2019s a mannie that\u2019s to gang through with us,\u2019 said Sim. \u2018It was the auld wife, Gilchrist, wanted it.\u2019 \u2018Aweel, aweel,\u2019 said the other; and presently, remembering his manners, and looking on me with a solemn grin, \u2018A fine day!\u2019 says he.

Presently we were ascending the side of the mountain by a rude green track, whose presence I had not hitherto observed. A continual sound of munching and the crying of a great quantity of moor birds accompanied our progress, which the deliberate pace and perennial appetite of the cattle rendered wearisomely slow.

In a back view they might be described as indistinguishable; and even from the front they were much alike. An incredible coincidence of humours augmented the impression. Thrice and four times I attempted to pave the way for some exchange of thought, sentiment, or\u2014at the least of it\u2014human words. An _Ay_ or an _Nhm_ was the sole return, and the topic died on the hill-side without echo."}, {"size": 640, "text": "I can never deny that I was chagrined; and when, after a little more walking, Sim turned towards me and offered me a ram\u2019s horn of snuff, with the question \u2018Do ye use it?\u2019 I answered, with some animation, \u2018Faith, sir, I would use pepper to introduce a little cordiality.\u2019 But even this sally failed to reach, or at least failed to soften, my companions. At this rate we came to the summit of a ridge, and saw the track descend in front of us abruptly into a desert vale, about a league in length, and closed at the farther end by no less barren hilltops.

The liveliest excitement was at once exhibited by both my comrades. They climbed hillocks, they studied the approaching drove from under their hand, they consulted each other with an appearance of alarm that seemed to me extraordinary.

Are ye stench?\u2019 inquired Sim, with a gleam of approval in his wooden countenance.

It struck him in the throat, and he went down like a ninepin and moved no more. It seemed this was the signal for the engagement to be discontinued. The other combatants separated at once; our foes were suffered, without molestation, to lift up and bear away their fallen comrade; so that I perceived this sort of war to be not wholly without laws of chivalry, and perhaps rather to partake of the character of a tournament than of a battle _\u00e0 outrance_."}, {"size": 730, "text": "There was no doubt, at least, that I was supposed to have pushed the affair too seriously.

The entrance-hall, in which I now found myself, was of a good size and good proportions; potted plants occupied the corners; the paved floor was soiled with muddy footprints and encumbered with straw; on a mahogany hall-table, which was the only furniture, a candle had been stuck and suffered to burn down\u2014plainly a long while ago, for the gutterings were green with mould."}, {"size": 724, "text": "My mind, under these new impressions, worked with unusual vivacity.

I felt I had carried my pleasantry as far as was safe; I must lose no time in declaring my true character, and I was even choosing the words in which I was to begin, when the hall-door was slammed-to behind me with a bang, and I turned, dropping my stick as I did so, in time\u2014and not any more than time\u2014to save my life."}, {"size": 770, "text": "The surprise of the onslaught and the huge weight of my assailant gave him the advantage.

The affair was as brief as it was hot and sudden. The potations which had swelled and bloated his carcase had already weakened the springs of energy.

He was as good as his word; indeed, despite a gawky air, he was simply invaluable in his present employment, showing marked sagacity in all that concerned the care of horses, and guiding us by one short cut after another for days, and without a fault. The interior of that engine of torture, the covered cart, was fitted with a bench, on which we took our places; the door was shut; in a moment, the night closed upon us solid and stifling; and we felt that we were being driven carefully out of the courtyard."}, {"size": 623, "text": "Careful was the word all night, and it was an alleviation of our miseries that we did not often enjoy.

I only knew I was walking in the dark night and among ruts, when I heard very far off, over the silent country that surrounded us, the guard\u2019s horn wailing its signal to the next post-house for a change of horses. It was like the voice of the day heard in darkness, a voice of the world heard in prison, the note of a cock crowing in the mid-seas\u2014in short, I cannot tell you what it was like, you will have to fancy for yourself\u2014but I could have wept to hear it."}, {"size": 855, "text": "Once we were belated: the cattle could hardly crawl, the day was at hand, it was a nipping, rigorous morning, King was lashing his horses, I was giving an arm to the old Colonel, and the Major was coughing in our rear. I must suppose that King was a thought careless, being nearly in desperation about his team, and, in spite of the cold morning, breathing hot with his exertions. We came, at last, a little before sunrise to the summit of a hill, and saw the high-road passing at right angles through an open country of meadows and hedgerow pollards; and not only the York mail, speeding smoothly at the gallop of the four horses, but a post-chaise besides, with the post-boy titupping briskly, and the traveller himself putting his head out of the window, but whether to breathe the dawn, or the better to observe the passage of the mail, I do not know."}, {"size": 756, "text": "So that we enjoyed for an instant a picture of free life on the road, in its most luxurious forms of despatch and comfort.

Nowhere again were we so well entertained as at Burchell Fenn\u2019s. And this, I suppose, was natural, and indeed inevitable, in so long and secret a journey. The first stop, we lay six hours in a barn standing by itself in a poor, marshy orchard, and packed with hay; to make it more attractive, we were told it had been the scene of an abominable murder, and was now haunted."}, {"size": 809, "text": "But the day was beginning to break, and our fatigue was too extreme for visionary terrors.

In the meanwhile, King was gone with the cart, I know not where, to get a change of horses, and it was late in the dark morning when he returned and we were able to resume our journey. In the middle of another night, we came to a stop by an ancient, whitewashed cottage of two stories; a privet hedge surrounded it; the frosty moon shone blankly on the upper windows; but through those of the kitchen the firelight was seen glinting on the roof and reflected from the dishes on the wall."}, {"size": 625, "text": "Here, after much hammering on the door, King managed to arouse an old crone from the chimney-corner chair, where she had been dozing in the watch; and we were had in, and entertained with a dish of hot tea.

Though the house stood solitary, and the hour was an unlikely one for any passenger upon the road, King and she conversed in whispers only. There was something dismal, something of the sick-room, in this perpetual, guarded sibilation. The apprehensions of our hostess insensibly communicated themselves to every one present."}, {"size": 621, "text": "We ate like mice in a cat\u2019s ear; if one of us jingled a teaspoon, all would start; and when the hour came to take the road again, we drew a long breath of relief, and climbed to our places in the covered cart with a positive sense of escape. The most of our meals, however, were taken boldly at hedgerow alehouses, usually at untimely hours of the day, when the clients were in the field or the farmyard at labour.

On the contrary, he ever showed himself careful to please; and even if he rambled in his talk, rambled always gently\u2014like a humane, half-witted old hero, true to his colours to the last. I would not dare to say how often he awoke suddenly from a lethargy, and told us again, as though we had never heard it, the story of how he had earned the cross, how it had been given him by the hand of the Emperor, and of the innocent\u2014and, indeed, foolish\u2014sayings of his daughter when he returned with it on his bosom."}, {"size": 838, "text": "He had another anecdote which he was very apt to give, by way of a rebuke, when the Major wearied us beyond endurance with dispraises of the English.

They made a fire in his bedroom, which the sons and daughters tended with their own hands; letters from France were looked for with scarce more eagerness by himself than by these alien sympathisers; when they came, he would read them aloud in the parlour to the assembled family, translating as he went."}, {"size": 619, "text": "The Colonel\u2019s English was elementary; his daughter not in the least likely to be an amusing correspondent; and, as I conceived these scenes in the parlour, I felt sure the interest centred in the Colonel himself, and I thought I could feel in my own heart that mixture of the ridiculous and the pathetic, the contest of tears and laughter, which must have shaken the bosoms of the family.

On the very last day he began again his eternal story of the cross and the Emperor. The Major, who was particularly ill, or at least particularly cross, uttered some angry words of protest. \u2018_Pardonnez-moi_, _monsieur le commandant_, _mais c\u2019est pour monsieur_,\u2019 said the Colonel: \u2018Monsieur has not yet heard the circumstance, and is good enough to feel an interest.\u2019 Presently after, however, he began to lose the thread of his narrative; and at last: \u2018_Qu\u00e9 que j\u2019ai_?"}, {"size": 819, "text": "_Je m\u2019embrouille_!\u2019 says he, \u2018_Suffit_: _s\u2019m\u2019a la donn\u00e9_, _et Berthe en \u00e9tait bien contente_.\u2019 It struck me as the falling of the curtain or the closing of the sepulchre doors.

Sometimes, to minimise the risk, we would all dismount before we came in view of the house, straggle in severally, and give what orders we pleased, like disconnected strangers. In like manner we departed, to find the cart at an appointed place, some half a mile beyond. The Colonel and the Major had each a word or two of English\u2014God help their pronunciation!

His hat and wig were hanged upon the knob behind him, his head as bald as a bladder of lard, and his expression very shrewd, cantankerous, and inquisitive.

I was much deceived, or she had read the insidious paragraph and recognised the comminated pearl-grey suit.

They kept a close watch about the cottage; they had a beast of a watch-dog\u2014at least, unless I had settled it; and if I had, I knew its bereaved master would only watch the more indefatigably for the loss. In the pardonable ostentation of love I had given all the money I could spare to Flora; I had thought it glorious that the hunted exile should come down, like Jupiter, in a shower of gold, and pour thousands in the lap of the beloved.

This last alternative, involving as it did the most horrid risks, and the delay of forty-eight hours, I did but glance at with an averted head, and turned again to the consideration of the others.

Lastly, I must assure myself with my own eyes whether the bank in George Street were beleaguered. I called to Rowley and questioned him tightly as to the appearance of the Bow Street officer. \u2018What sort of looking man is he, Rowley?\u2019 I asked, as I began to dress. \u2018Wot sort of a looking man he is?\u2019 repeated Rowley. \u2018Well, I don\u2019t very well know wot you would say, Mr. Anne.

Meanwhile the appearance of my landlady added a great load of anxiety to what I already suffered. It was plain that she had not slept; equally plain that she had wept copiously. She sighed, she groaned, she drew in her breath, she shook her head, as she waited on table. In short, she seemed in so precarious a state, like a petard three times charged with hysteria, that I did not dare to address her; and stole out of the house on tiptoe, and actually ran downstairs, in the fear that she might call me back."}, {"size": 865, "text": "It was plain that this degree of tension could not last long.

This seemed to agree fairly well with Rowley\u2019s _signalement_: he had declared emphatically (if you remember), and had stuck to it besides, that the companion of the great Lavender was no beauty. Thence I made my way to Mr. Robbie\u2019s, where I rang the bell. A servant answered the summons, and told me the lawyer was engaged, as I had half expected. \u2018Wha shall I say was callin\u2019?\u2019 she pursued; and when I had told her \u2018Mr. Ducie,\u2019 \u2018I think this\u2019ll be for you, then?\u2019 she added, and handed me a letter from the hall table.

After this encounter I must, of course, ascend to the top story, ring the bell of a suite of apartments, inquire for Mr. Vavasour, learn (with no great surprise) that he did not live there, come down again and, again politely saluting the man from Bow Street, make my escape at last into the street."}, {"size": 669, "text": "I was now driven back upon the Assembly Ball.

And yet there was one thing I could not bring my mind to face up to, or my limbs to execute; and that was to cross the valley into the Old Town. It seemed to me I must be arrested immediately if I had done so; I must go straight into the twilight of a prison cell, and pass straight thence to the gross and final embraces of the nightcap and the halter.
