My position is a comfortable one. I have an income nearly sufficient for my wants (no one\u2019s income is ever quite sufficient, you know), I enjoy an enviable social position: I am brother to Lord Burlesdon, and brother-in-law to that charming lady, his countess. Behold, it is enough!\u201d \u201cYou are nine-and-twenty,\u201d she observed, \u201cand you\u2019ve done nothing but--\u201d \u201cKnock about?"}, {"size": 631, "text": "It is true. Our family doesn\u2019t need to do things.\u201d This remark of mine rather annoyed Rose, for everybody knows (and therefore there can be no harm in referring to the fact) that, pretty and accomplished as she herself is, her family is hardly of the same standing as the Rassendylls. Besides her attractions, she possessed a large fortune, and my brother Robert was wise enough not to mind about her ancestry. Ancestry is, in fact, a matter concerning which the next observation of Rose\u2019s has some truth. \u201cGood families are generally worse than any others,\u201d she said. Upon this I stroked my hair: I knew quite well what she meant."}, {"size": 756, "text": "\u201cI\u2019m so glad Robert\u2019s is black!\u201d she cried. At this moment Robert (who rises at seven and works before breakfast) came in. He glanced at his wife: her cheek was slightly flushed; he patted it caressingly. \u201cWhat\u2019s the matter, my dear?\u201d he asked. \u201cShe objects to my doing nothing and having red hair,\u201d said I, in an injured tone. \u201cOh! of course he can\u2019t help his hair,\u201d admitted Rose. \u201cIt generally crops out once in a generation,\u201d said my brother. \u201cSo does the nose. Rudolf has got them both.\u201d \u201cI wish they didn\u2019t crop out,\u201d said Rose, still flushed. \u201cI rather like them myself,\u201d said I, and, rising, I bowed to the portrait of Countess Amelia.

I laughed, and went on with my egg. At least I had shelved the question of what (if anything) I ought to do. And, by way of closing the discussion--and also, I must admit, of exasperating my strict little sister-in-law a trifle more--I observed: \u201cI rather like being an Elphberg myself.\u201dWhen I read a story, I skip the explanations; yet the moment I begin to write one, I find that I must have an explanation."}, {"size": 713, "text": "For it is manifest that I must explain why my sister-in-law was vexed with my nose and hair, and why I ventured to call myself an Elphberg. For eminent as, I must protest, the Rassendylls have been for many generations, yet participation in their blood of course does not, at first sight, justify the boast of a connection with the grander stock of the Elphbergs or a claim to be one of that Royal House. For what relationship is there between Ruritania and Burlesdon, between the Palace at Strelsau or the Castle of Zenda and Number 305 Park Lane, W.? Well then--and I must premise that I am going, perforce, to rake up the very scandal which my dear Lady Burlesdon wishes forgotten--in the year 1733, George II."}, {"size": 636, "text": "sitting then on the throne, peace reigning for the moment, and the King and the Prince of Wales being not yet at loggerheads, there came on a visit to the English Court a certain prince, who was afterwards known to history as Rudolf the Third of Ruritania. The prince was a tall, handsome young fellow, marked (maybe marred, it is not for me to say) by a somewhat unusually long, sharp and straight nose, and a mass of dark-red hair--in fact, the nose and the hair which have stamped the Elphbergs time out of mind. He stayed some months in England, where he was most courteously received; yet, in the end, he left rather under a cloud."}, {"size": 794, "text": "For he fought a duel (it was considered highly well bred of him to waive all question of his rank) with a nobleman, well known in the society of the day, not only for his own merits, but as the husband of a very beautiful wife. In that duel Prince Rudolf received a severe wound, and, recovering therefrom, was adroitly smuggled off by the Ruritanian ambassador, who had found him a pretty handful. The nobleman was not wounded in the duel; but the morning being raw and damp on the occasion of the meeting, he contracted a severe chill, and, failing to throw it off, he died some six months after the departure of Prince Rudolf, without having found leisure to adjust his relations with his wife--who, after another two months, bore an heir to the title and estates of the family of Burlesdon."}, {"size": 822, "text": "This lady was the Countess Amelia, whose picture my sister-in-law wished to remove from the drawing-room in Park Lane; and her husband was James, fifth Earl of Burlesdon and twenty-second Baron Rassendyll, both in the peerage of England, and a Knight of the Garter. As for Rudolf, he went back to Ruritania, married a wife, and ascended the throne, whereon his progeny in the direct line have sat from then till this very hour--with one short interval. And, finally, if you walk through the picture galleries at Burlesdon, among the fifty portraits or so of the last century and a half, you will find five or six, including that of the sixth earl, distinguished by long, sharp, straight noses and a quantity of dark-red hair; these five or six have also blue eyes, whereas among the Rassendylls dark eyes are the commoner."}, {"size": 749, "text": "That is the explanation, and I am glad to have finished it: the blemishes on honourable lineage are a delicate subject, and certainly this heredity we hear so much about is the finest scandalmonger in the world; it laughs at discretion, and writes strange entries between the lines of the \u201cPeerages\u201d. It will be observed that my sister-in-law, with a want of logic that must have been peculiar to herself (since we are no longer allowed to lay it to the charge of her sex), treated my complexion almost as an offence for which I was responsible, hastening to assume from that external sign inward qualities of which I protest my entire innocence; and this unjust inference she sought to buttress by pointing to the uselessness of the life I had led."}, {"size": 709, "text": "Well, be that as it may, I had picked up a good deal of pleasure and a good deal of knowledge. I had been to a German school and a German university, and spoke German as readily and perfectly as English; I was thoroughly at home in French; I had a smattering of Italian and enough Spanish to swear by. I was, I believe, a strong, though hardly fine swordsman and a good shot. I could ride anything that had a back to sit on; and my head was as cool a one as you could find, for all its flaming cover. If you say that I ought to have spent my time in useful labour, I am out of Court and have nothing to say, save that my parents had no business to leave me two thousand pounds a year and a roving disposition."}, {"size": 608, "text": "\u201cThe difference between you and Robert,\u201d said my sister-in-law, who often (bless her!) speaks on a platform, and oftener still as if she were on one, \u201cis that he recognizes the duties of his position, and you see the opportunities of yours.\u201d \u201cTo a man of spirit, my dear Rose,\u201d I answered, \u201copportunities are duties.\u201d \u201cNonsense!\u201d said she, tossing her head; and after a moment she went on: \u201cNow, here\u2019s Sir Jacob Borrodaile offering you exactly what you might be equal to.\u201d \u201cA thousand thanks!\u201d I murmured. \u201cHe\u2019s to have an Embassy in six months, and Robert says he is sure that he\u2019ll take you as an attache."}, {"size": 825, "text": "Do take it, Rudolf--to please me.\u201d Now, when my sister-in-law puts the matter in that way, wrinkling her pretty brows, twisting her little hands, and growing wistful in the eyes, all on account of an idle scamp like myself, for whom she has no natural responsibility, I am visited with compunction. Moreover, I thought it possible that I could pass the time in the position suggested with some tolerable amusement. Therefore I said: \u201cMy dear sister, if in six months\u2019 time no unforeseen obstacle has arisen, and Sir Jacob invites me, hang me if I don\u2019t go with Sir Jacob!\u201d \u201cOh, Rudolf, how good of you! I am glad!\u201d \u201cWhere\u2019s he going to?\u201d \u201cHe doesn\u2019t know yet; but it\u2019s sure to be a good Embassy.\u201d \u201cMadame,\u201d said I, \u201cfor your sake I\u2019ll go, if it\u2019s no more than a beggarly Legation. When I do a thing, I don\u2019t do it by halves.\u201d"}, {"size": 774, "text": "My promise, then, was given; but six months are six months, and seem an eternity, and, inasmuch as they stretched between me and my prospective industry (I suppose attaches are industrious; but I know not, for I never became attache to Sir Jacob or anybody else), I cast about for some desirable mode of spending them. And it occurred to me suddenly that I would visit Ruritania. It may seem strange that I had never visited that country yet; but my father (in spite of a sneaking fondness for the Elphbergs, which led him to give me, his second son, the famous Elphberg name of Rudolf) had always been averse from my going, and, since his death, my brother, prompted by Rose, had accepted the family tradition which taught that a wide berth was to be given to that country."}, {"size": 689, "text": "But the moment Ruritania had come into my head I was eaten up with a curiosity to see it. After all, red hair and long noses are not confined to the House of Elphberg, and the old story seemed a preposterously insufficient reason for debarring myself from acquaintance with a highly interesting and important kingdom, one which had played no small part in European history, and might do the like again under the sway of a young and vigorous ruler, such as the new King was rumoured to be. My determination was clinched by reading in _The Times_ that Rudolf the Fifth was to be crowned at Strelsau in the course of the next three weeks, and that great magnificence was to mark the occasion."}, {"size": 674, "text": "At once I made up my mind to be present, and began my preparations. But, inasmuch as it has never been my practice to furnish my relatives with an itinerary of my journeys and in this case I anticipated opposition to my wishes, I gave out that I was going for a ramble in the Tyrol--an old haunt of mine--and propitiated Rose\u2019s wrath by declaring that I intended to study the political and social problems of the interesting community which dwells in that neighbourhood. \u201cPerhaps,\u201d I hinted darkly, \u201cthere may be an outcome of the expedition.\u201d \u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d she asked. \u201cWell,\u201d said I carelessly, \u201cthere seems a gap that might be filled by an exhaustive work on--\u201d \u201cOh!"}, {"size": 642, "text": "will you write a book?\u201d she cried, clapping her hands. \u201cThat would be splendid, wouldn\u2019t it, Robert?\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s the best of introductions to political life nowadays,\u201d observed my brother, who has, by the way, introduced himself in this manner several times over. _Burlesdon on Ancient Theories and Modern Facts_ and _The Ultimate Outcome, by a Political Student_, are both works of recognized eminence. \u201cI believe you are right, Bob, my boy,\u201d said I. \u201cNow promise you\u2019ll do it,\u201d said Rose earnestly. \u201cNo, I won\u2019t promise; but if I find enough material, I will.\u201d \u201cThat\u2019s fair enough,\u201d said Robert. \u201cOh, material doesn\u2019t matter!\u201d she said, pouting."}, {"size": 617, "text": "But this time she could get no more than a qualified promise out of me.

Neither would it, I fear, please Lady Burlesdon, if I were to submit it to her critical eye--a step which I have no intention of taking."}, {"size": 604, "text": "Concerning the Colour of Men\u2019s HairIt was a maxim of my Uncle William\u2019s that no man should pass through Paris without spending four-and-twenty hours there. My uncle spoke out of a ripe experience of the world, and I honoured his advice by putting up for a day and a night at \u201cThe Continental\u201d on my way to--the Tyrol. I called on George Featherly at the Embassy, and we had a bit of dinner together at Durand\u2019s, and afterwards dropped in to the Opera; and after that we had a little supper, and after that we called on Bertram Bertrand, a versifier of some repute and Paris correspondent to _The Critic_."}, {"size": 619, "text": "He had a very comfortable suite of rooms, and we found some pleasant fellows smoking and talking. It struck me, however, that Bertram himself was absent and in low spirits, and when everybody except ourselves had gone, I rallied him on his moping preoccupation.

I am in love--infernally in love!\u201d \u201cOh, you\u2019ll write the better poetry,\u201d said I, by way of consolation. He ruffled his hair with his hand and smoked furiously.

By the way, Bert, I met a great man at her house the other night--at least, about a month ago. Did you ever meet him--the Duke of Strelsau?\u201d \u201cYes, I did,\u201d growled Bertram. \u201cAn extremely accomplished man, I thought him.\u201d It was not hard to see that George\u2019s references to the duke were intended to aggravate poor Bertram\u2019s sufferings, so that I drew the inference that the duke had distinguished Madame de Mauban by his attentions. She was a widow, rich, handsome, and, according to repute, ambitious. It was quite possible that she, as George put it, was flying as high as a personage who was everything he could be, short of enjoying strictly royal rank: for the duke was the son of the late King of Ruritania by a second and morganatic marriage, and half-brother to the new King."}, {"size": 898, "text": "He had been his father\u2019s favourite, and it had occasioned some unfavourable comment when he had been created a duke, with a title derived from no less a city than the capital itself. His mother had been of good, but not exalted, birth. \u201cHe\u2019s not in Paris now, is he?\u201d I asked. \u201cOh no! He\u2019s gone back to be present at the King\u2019s coronation; a ceremony which, I should say, he\u2019ll not enjoy much. But, Bert, old man, don\u2019t despair! He won\u2019t marry the fair Antoinette--at least, not unless another plan comes to nothing. Still perhaps she--\u201d He paused and added, with a laugh: \u201cRoyal attentions are hard to resist--you know that, don\u2019t you, Rudolf?\u201d \u201cConfound you!\u201d said I; and rising, I left the hapless Bertram in George\u2019s hands and went home to bed. The next day George Featherly went with me to the station, where I took a ticket for Dresden. \u201cGoing to see the pictures?\u201d asked George, with a grin."}, {"size": 782, "text": "George is an inveterate gossip, and had I told him that I was off to Ruritania, the news would have been in London in three days and in Park Lane in a week. I was, therefore, about to return an evasive answer, when he saved my conscience by leaving me suddenly and darting across the platform. Following him with my eyes, I saw him lift his hat and accost a graceful, fashionably dressed woman who had just appeared from the booking-office. She was, perhaps, a year or two over thirty, tall, dark, and of rather full figure. As George talked, I saw her glance at me, and my vanity was hurt by the thought that, muffled in a fur coat and a neck-wrapper (for it was a chilly April day) and wearing a soft travelling hat pulled down to my ears, I must be looking very far from my best."}, {"size": 650, "text": "A moment later, George rejoined me. \u201cYou\u2019ve got a charming travelling companion,\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s poor Bert Bertrand\u2019s goddess, Antoinette de Mauban, and, like you, she\u2019s going to Dresden--also, no doubt, to see the pictures. It\u2019s very queer, though, that she doesn\u2019t at present desire the honour of your acquaintance.\u201d \u201cI didn\u2019t ask to be introduced,\u201d I observed, a little annoyed. \u201cWell, I offered to bring you to her; but she said, \u2018Another time.\u2019 Never mind, old fellow, perhaps there\u2019ll be a smash, and you\u2019ll have a chance of rescuing her and cutting out the Duke of Strelsau!\u201d No smash, however, happened, either to me or to Madame de Mauban."}, {"size": 646, "text": "I can speak for her as confidently as for myself; for when, after a night\u2019s rest in Dresden, I continued my journey, she got into the same train. Understanding that she wished to be let alone, I avoided her carefully, but I saw that she went the same way as I did to the very end of my journey, and I took opportunities of having a good look at her, when I could do so unobserved. As soon as we reached the Ruritanian frontier (where the old officer who presided over the Custom House favoured me with such a stare that I felt surer than before of my Elphberg physiognomy), I bought the papers, and found in them news which affected my movements."}, {"size": 860, "text": "For some reason, which was not clearly explained, and seemed to be something of a mystery, the date of the coronation had been suddenly advanced, and the ceremony was to take place on the next day but one. The whole country seemed in a stir about it, and it was evident that Strelsau was thronged. Rooms were all let and hotels overflowing; there would be very little chance of my obtaining a lodging, and I should certainly have to pay an exorbitant charge for it. I made up my mind to stop at Zenda, a small town fifty miles short of the capital, and about ten from the frontier. My train reached there in the evening; I would spend the next day, Tuesday, in a wander over the hills, which were said to be very fine, and in taking a glance at the famous Castle, and go over by train to Strelsau on the Wednesday morning, returning at night to sleep at Zenda."}, {"size": 812, "text": "Accordingly at Zenda I got out, and as the train passed where I stood on the platform, I saw my friend Madame de Mauban in her place; clearly she was going through to Strelsau, having, with more providence than I could boast, secured apartments there. I smiled to think how surprised George Featherly would have been to know that she and I had been fellow travellers for so long. I was very kindly received at the hotel--it was really no more than an inn--kept by a fat old lady and her two daughters. They were good, quiet people, and seemed very little interested in the great doings at Strelsau. The old lady\u2019s hero was the duke, for he was now, under the late King\u2019s will, master of the Zenda estates and of the Castle, which rose grandly on its steep hill at the end of the valley a mile or so from the inn."}, {"size": 836, "text": "The old lady, indeed, did not hesitate to express regret that the duke was not on the throne, instead of his brother. \u201cWe know Duke Michael,\u201d said she. \u201cHe has always lived among us; every Ruritanian knows Duke Michael. But the King is almost a stranger; he has been so much abroad, not one in ten knows him even by sight.\u201d \u201cAnd now,\u201d chimed in one of the young women, \u201cthey say he has shaved off his beard, so that no one at all knows him.\u201d \u201cShaved his beard!\u201d exclaimed her mother. \u201cWho says so?\u201d \u201cJohann, the duke\u2019s keeper.

The King, sir, is now at the duke\u2019s hunting-lodge in the forest here; from here he goes to Strelsau to be crowned on Wednesday morning.\u201d I was interested to hear this, and made up my mind to walk next day in the direction of the lodge, on the chance of coming across the King."}, {"size": 715, "text": "The old lady ran on garrulously: \u201cAh, and I wish he would stay at his hunting--that and wine (and one thing more) are all he loves, they say--and suffer our duke to be crowned on Wednesday.

A moment later he saw me, and, to my amazement, he started back a step, as though he had seen something wonderful. \u201cWhat ails you, Johann?\u201d asked the elder girl. \u201cThis is a gentleman on his travels, come to see the coronation.\u201d The man had recovered himself, but he was staring at me with an intense, searching, almost fierce glance. \u201cGood evening to you,\u201d said I. \u201cGood evening, sir,\u201d he muttered, still scrutinizing me, and the merry girl began to laugh as she called-- \u201cSee, Johann, it is the colour you love!"}, {"size": 625, "text": "He started to see your hair, sir.

And when he saw me his red cheeks went pale all in a moment, and his helmet fell with a clatter on the floor.

Then the great organ pealed out again, the Marshal bade the heralds proclaim me, and Rudolf the Fifth was crowned King; of which imposing ceremony an excellent picture hangs now in my dining-room.

And then came the Duke of Strelsau. His step trembled, I swear, and he looked to the right and to the left, as a man looks who thinks on flight; and his face was patched with red and white, and his hand shook so that it jumped under mine, and I felt his lips dry and parched."}, {"size": 877, "text": "And I glanced at Sapt, who was smiling again into his beard, and, resolutely doing my duty in that station of life to which I had been marvellously called, I took my dear Michael by both hands and kissed him on the cheek.

Yet, had I and the King stood side by side, she could have told us in an instant, or, at least, on a little consideration. But neither she nor anyone else dreamed or imagined that I could be other than the King. So the likeness served, and for an hour I stood there, feeling as weary and blase as though I had been a king all my life; and everybody kissed my hand, and the ambassadors paid me their respects, among them old Lord Topham, at whose house in Grosvenor Square I had danced a score of times."}, {"size": 607, "text": "Thank heaven, the old man was as blind as a bat, and did not claim my acquaintance.

The outer of the two had no windows, but was always lighted with candles; the inner had one square window, which gave upon the moat. In the outer room there lay always, day and night, three of the Six; and the instructions of Duke Michael were, that on any attack being made on the outer room, the three were to defend the door of it so long as they could without risk to themselves."}, {"size": 646, "text": "But, so soon as the door should be in danger of being forced, then Rupert Hentzau or Detchard (for one of these two was always there) should leave the others to hold it as long as they could, and himself pass into the inner room, and, without more ado, kill the King who lay there, well-treated indeed, but without weapons, and with his arms confined in fine steel chains, which did not allow him to move his elbow more than three inches from his side. Thus, before the outer door were stormed, the King would be dead. And his body? For his body would be evidence as damning as himself. \u201cNay, sir,\u201d said Johann, \u201chis Highness has thought of that."}, {"size": 683, "text": "While the two hold the outer room, the one who has killed the King unlocks the bars in the square window (they turn on a hinge). The window now gives no light, for its mouth is choked by a great pipe of earthenware; and this pipe, which is large enough to let pass through it the body of a man, passes into the moat, coming to an end immediately above the surface of the water, so that there is no perceptible interval between water and pipe. The King being dead, his murderer swiftly ties a weight to the body, and, dragging it to the window, raises it by a pulley (for, lest the weight should prove too great, Detchard has provided one) till it is level with the mouth of the pipe."}, {"size": 611, "text": "He inserts the feet in the pipe, and pushes the body down.

But it is not to be used till the last; for, as we all know, he is not minded to kill the King unless he can, before or soon after, kill you also, sir. Now, sir, I have spoken the truth, as God is my witness, and I pray you to shield me from the vengeance of Duke Michael; for if, after he knows what I have done, I fall into his hands, I shall pray for one thing out of all the world--a speedy death, and that I shall not obtain from him!\u201d The fellow\u2019s story was rudely told, but our questions supplemented his narrative."}, {"size": 689, "text": "What he had told us applied to an armed attack; but if suspicions were aroused, and there came overwhelming force--such, for instance, as I, the King, could bring--the idea of resistance would be abandoned; the King would be quietly murdered and slid down the pipe.

At the worst, he would stand as well as he had stood before I crossed his path--with but one man between him and the throne, and that man an impostor; at best, there would be none left to stand against him.

Moreover, he, if any one of them, really loved Black Michael, and it might be that he would leave Bersonin to guard the King, and rush across the bridge to take part in the affray on the other side."}, {"size": 808, "text": "So I planned--desperately.

Strakencz would be there, and he was to conceal our departure, if he could, from Flavia. And if we came not again by the morning, he was to march, openly and in force to the Castle, and demand the person of the King; if Black Michael were not there, as I did not think he would be, the Marshal would take Flavia with him, as swiftly as he could, to Strelsau, and there proclaim Black Michael\u2019s treachery and the probable death of the King, and rally all that there was honest and true round the banner of the princess."}, {"size": 731, "text": "And, to say truth, this was what I thought most likely to happen.

It was late when we rose from conference, and I betook me to the princess\u2019s apartments.

Again, villain as the man was, I did not relish being one of a crowd against him--perhaps it was that.

Antoinette de Mauban was in a loose white robe, her dark hair streamed over her shoulders, her face was ghastly pale, and her eyes gleamed wildly in the light of the torches.

With a wonderful effort, she calmed herself till she stood still and rigid. Then very slowly and deliberately she began to raise her arm again, taking most careful aim. He would be mad to risk it. He must rush on her, chancing the bullet, or retreat towards me. I covered him with my weapon. He did neither.

How come you here, man?\u201d And so saying he gained the bank. I laid hold of the rope, but I paused.

He was in the act of lifting a girl down from her horse; doubtless it was her scream that I heard.

From this time she was with us; yet, from what she told me, I know that she still (as women will) loved Michael, and trusted to gain his life, if not his pardon, from the King, as the reward for her assistance.

On this they disputed some few minutes; then Sapt, persuaded by Fritz, detached a party under Bernenstein to gallop back to Tarlenheim and bring up the marshal, while the rest fell to on the great door of the chateau. For several minutes it resisted them; then, just as Antoinette de Mauban fired at Rupert of Hentzau on the bridge, they broke in, eight of them in all: and the first door they came to was the door of Michael\u2019s room; and Michael lay dead across the threshold, with a sword-thrust through his breast."}, {"size": 775, "text": "Sapt cried out at his death, as I had heard, and they rushed on the servants; but these, in fear, dropped their weapons, and Antoinette flung herself weeping at Sapt\u2019s feet.

There are moments when I dare not think of it, but there are others when I rise in spirit to where she ever dwells; then I can thank God that I love the noblest lady in the world, the most gracious and beautiful, and that there was nothing in my love that made her fall short in her high duty."}, {"size": 686, "text": "Shall I see her face again--the pale face and the glorious hair? Of that I know nothing; Fate has no hint, my heart no presentiment. I do not know. In this world, perhaps--nay, it is likely--never. And can it be that somewhere, in a manner whereof our flesh-bound minds have no apprehension, she and I will be together again, with nothing to come between us, nothing to forbid our love? That I know not, nor wiser heads than mine. But if it be never--if I can never hold sweet converse again with her, or look upon her face, or know from her her love; why, then, this side the grave, I will live as becomes the man whom she loves; and, for the other side, I must pray a dreamless sleep."}]}
