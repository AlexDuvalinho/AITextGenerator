They crossed the ocean at midsummer, and, arriving in New York on the first day of August, were much struck with the fervid temperature of that city. Disembarking upon the wharf, they climbed into one of those huge high-hung coaches which convey passengers to the hotels, and with a great deal of bouncing and bumping, took their course through Broadway. The midsummer aspect of New York is not, perhaps, the most favorable one; still, it is not without its picturesque and even brilliant side."}, {"size": 737, "text": "Nothing could well resemble less a typical English street than the interminable avenue, rich in incongruities, through which our two travelers advanced--looking out on each side of them at the comfortable animation of the sidewalks, the high-colored, heterogeneous architecture, the huge white marble facades glittering in the strong, crude light, and bedizened with gilded lettering, the multifarious awnings, banners, and streamers, the extraordinary number of omnibuses, horsecars, and other democratic vehicles, the vendors of cooling fluids, the white trousers and big straw hats of the policemen, the tripping gait of the modish young persons on the pavement, the general brightness, newness, juvenility, both of people and things."}, {"size": 635, "text": "The young men had exchanged few observations; but in crossing Union Square, in front of the monument to Washington--in the very shadow, indeed, projected by the image of the PATER PATRIAE--one of them remarked to the other, \u201cIt seems a rum-looking place.\u201d \u201cAh, very odd, very odd,\u201d said the other, who was the clever man of the two. \u201cPity it\u2019s so beastly hot,\u201d resumed the first speaker after a pause. \u201cYou know we are in a low latitude,\u201d said his friend. \u201cI daresay,\u201d remarked the other. \u201cI wonder,\u201d said the second speaker presently, \u201cif they can give one a bath?\u201d \u201cI daresay not,\u201d rejoined the other. \u201cOh, I say!\u201d cried his comrade."}, {"size": 758, "text": "This animated discussion was checked by their arrival at the hotel, which had been recommended to them by an American gentleman whose acquaintance they made--with whom, indeed, they became very intimate--on the steamer, and who had proposed to accompany them to the inn and introduce them, in a friendly way, to the proprietor. This plan, however, had been defeated by their friend\u2019s finding that his \u201cpartner\u201d was awaiting him on the wharf and that his commercial associate desired him instantly to come and give his attention to certain telegrams received from St. Louis. But the two Englishmen, with nothing but their national prestige and personal graces to recommend them, were very well received at the hotel, which had an air of capacious hospitality."}, {"size": 671, "text": "They found that a bath was not unattainable, and were indeed struck with the facilities for prolonged and reiterated immersion with which their apartment was supplied. After bathing a good deal--more, indeed, than they had ever done before on a single occasion--they made their way into the dining room of the hotel, which was a spacious restaurant, with a fountain in the middle, a great many tall plants in ornamental tubs, and an array of French waiters. The first dinner on land, after a sea voyage, is, under any circumstances, a delightful occasion, and there was something particularly agreeable in the circumstances in which our young Englishmen found themselves."}, {"size": 683, "text": "They were extremely good natured young men; they were more observant than they appeared; in a sort of inarticulate, accidentally dissimulative fashion, they were highly appreciative. This was, perhaps, especially the case with the elder, who was also, as I have said, the man of talent. They sat down at a little table, which was a very different affair from the great clattering seesaw in the saloon of the steamer. The wide doors and windows of the restaurant stood open, beneath large awnings, to a wide pavement, where there were other plants in tubs, and rows of spreading trees, and beyond which there was a large shady square, without any palings, and with marble-paved walks."}, {"size": 661, "text": "And above the vivid verdure rose other facades of white marble and of pale chocolate-colored stone, squaring themselves against the deep blue sky. Here, outside, in the light and the shade and the heat, there was a great tinkling of the bells of innumerable streetcars, and a constant strolling and shuffling and rustling of many pedestrians, a large proportion of whom were young women in Pompadour-looking dresses. Within, the place was cool and vaguely lighted, with the plash of water, the odor of flowers, and the flitting of French waiters, as I have said, upon soundless carpets. \u201cIt\u2019s rather like Paris, you know,\u201d said the younger of our two travelers."}, {"size": 641, "text": "\u201cIt\u2019s like Paris--only more so,\u201d his companion rejoined. \u201cI suppose it\u2019s the French waiters,\u201d said the first speaker. \u201cWhy don\u2019t they have French waiters in London?\u201d \u201cFancy a French waiter at a club,\u201d said his friend. The young Englishman started a little, as if he could not fancy it. \u201cIn Paris I\u2019m very apt to dine at a place where there\u2019s an English waiter. Don\u2019t you know what\u2019s-his-name\u2019s, close to the thingumbob? They always set an English waiter at me. I suppose they think I can\u2019t speak French.\u201d \u201cWell, you can\u2019t.\u201d And the elder of the young Englishmen unfolded his napkin. His companion took no notice whatever of this declaration."}, {"size": 653, "text": "\u201cI say,\u201d he resumed in a moment, \u201cI suppose we must learn to speak American. I suppose we must take lessons.\u201d \u201cI can\u2019t understand them,\u201d said the clever man. \u201cWhat the deuce is HE saying?\u201d asked his comrade, appealing from the French waiter. \u201cHe is recommending some soft-shell crabs,\u201d said the clever man. And so, in desultory observation of the idiosyncrasies of the new society in which they found themselves, the young Englishmen proceeded to dine--going in largely, as the phrase is, for cooling draughts and dishes, of which their attendant offered them a very long list. After dinner they went out and slowly walked about the neighboring streets."}, {"size": 643, "text": "The early dusk of waning summer was coming on, but the heat was still very great. The pavements were hot even to the stout boot soles of the British travelers, and the trees along the curbstone emitted strange exotic odors. The young men wandered through the adjoining square--that queer place without palings, and with marble walks arranged in black and white lozenges. There were a great many benches, crowded with shabby-looking people, and the travelers remarked, very justly, that it was not much like Belgrave Square. On one side was an enormous hotel, lifting up into the hot darkness an immense array of open, brightly lighted windows."}, {"size": 701, "text": "At the base of this populous structure was an eternal jangle of horsecars, and all round it, in the upper dusk, was a sinister hum of mosquitoes. The ground floor of the hotel seemed to be a huge transparent cage, flinging a wide glare of gaslight into the street, of which it formed a sort of public adjunct, absorbing and emitting the passersby promiscuously. The young Englishmen went in with everyone else, from curiosity, and saw a couple of hundred men sitting on divans along a great marble-paved corridor, with their legs stretched out, together with several dozen more standing in a queue, as at the ticket office of a railway station, before a brilliantly illuminated counter of vast extent."}, {"size": 676, "text": "These latter persons, who carried portmanteaus in their hands, had a dejected, exhausted look; their garments were not very fresh, and they seemed to be rendering some mysterious tribute to a magnificent young man with a waxed mustache, and a shirtfront adorned with diamond buttons, who every now and then dropped an absent glance over their multitudinous patience. They were American citizens doing homage to a hotel clerk. \u201cI\u2019m glad he didn\u2019t tell us to go there,\u201d said one of our Englishmen, alluding to their friend on the steamer, who had told them so many things. They walked up the Fifth Avenue, where, for instance, he had told them that all the first families lived."}, {"size": 743, "text": "But the first families were out of town, and our young travelers had only the satisfaction of seeing some of the second--or perhaps even the third--taking the evening air upon balconies and high flights of doorsteps, in the streets which radiate from the more ornamental thoroughfare. They went a little way down one of these side streets, and they saw young ladies in white dresses--charming-looking persons--seated in graceful attitudes on the chocolate-colored steps. In one or two places these young ladies were conversing across the street with other young ladies seated in similar postures and costumes in front of the opposite houses, and in the warm night air their colloquial tones sounded strange in the ears of the young Englishmen."}, {"size": 756, "text": "One of our friends, nevertheless--the younger one--intimated that he felt a disposition to interrupt a few of these soft familiarities; but his companion observed, pertinently enough, that he had better be careful. \u201cWe must not begin with making mistakes,\u201d said his companion. \u201cBut he told us, you know--he told us,\u201d urged the young man, alluding again to the friend on the steamer. \u201cNever mind what he told us!\u201d answered his comrade, who, if he had greater talents, was also apparently more of a moralist. By bedtime--in their impatience to taste of a terrestrial couch again our seafarers went to bed early--it was still insufferably hot, and the buzz of the mosquitoes at the open windows might have passed for an audible crepitation of the temperature."}, {"size": 682, "text": "\u201cWe can\u2019t stand this, you know,\u201d the young Englishmen said to each other; and they tossed about all night more boisterously than they had tossed upon the Atlantic billows. On the morrow, their first thought was that they would re-embark that day for England; and then it occured to them that they might find an asylum nearer at hand. The cave of Aeolus became their ideal of comfort, and they wondered where the Americans went when they wished to cool off. They had not the least idea, and they determined to apply for information to Mr. J. L. Westgate. This was the name inscribed in a bold hand on the back of a letter carefully preserved in the pocketbook of our junior traveler."}, {"size": 665, "text": "Beneath the address, in the left-hand corner of the envelope, were the words, \u201cIntroducing Lord Lambeth and Percy Beaumont, Esq.\u201d The letter had been given to the two Englishmen by a good friend of theirs in London, who had been in America two years previously, and had singled out Mr. J. L. Westgate from the many friends he had left there as the consignee, as it were, of his compatriots. \u201cHe is a capital fellow,\u201d the Englishman in London had said, \u201cand he has got an awfully pretty wife. He\u2019s tremendously hospitable--he will do everything in the world for you; and as he knows everyone over there, it is quite needless I should give you any other introduction."}, {"size": 843, "text": "He will make you see everyone; trust to him for putting you into circulation. He has got a tremendously pretty wife.\u201d It was natural that in the hour of tribulation Lord Lambeth and Mr. Percy Beaumont should have bethought themselves of a gentleman whose attractions had been thus vividly depicted; all the more so that he lived in the Fifth Avenue, and that the Fifth Avenue, as they had ascertained the night before, was contiguous to their hotel. \u201cTen to one he\u2019ll be out of town,\u201d said Percy Beaumont; \u201cbut we can at least find out where he has gone, and we can immediately start in pursuit. He can\u2019t possibly have gone to a hotter place, you know.\u201d \u201cOh, there\u2019s only one hotter place,\u201d said Lord Lambeth, \u201cand I hope he hasn\u2019t gone there.\u201d They strolled along the shady side of the street to the number indicated upon the precious letter."}, {"size": 767, "text": "The house presented an imposing chocolate-colored expanse, relieved by facings and window cornices of florid sculpture, and by a couple of dusty rose trees which clambered over the balconies and the portico. This last-mentioned feature was approached by a monumental flight of steps. \u201cRather better than a London house,\u201d said Lord Lambeth, looking down from this altitude, after they had rung the bell. \u201cIt depends upon what London house you mean,\u201d replied his companion. \u201cYou have a tremendous chance to get wet between the house door and your carriage.\u201d \u201cWell,\u201d said Lord Lambeth, glancing at the burning heavens, \u201cI \u2018guess\u2019 it doesn\u2019t rain so much here!\u201d The door was opened by a long Negro in a white jacket, who grinned familiarly when Lord Lambeth asked for Mr."}, {"size": 753, "text": "Westgate. \u201cHe ain\u2019t at home, sah; he\u2019s downtown at his o\u2019fice.\u201d \u201cOh, at his office?\u201d said the visitors. \u201cAnd when will he be at home?\u201d \u201cWell, sah, when he goes out dis way in de mo\u2019ning, he ain\u2019t liable to come home all day.\u201d This was discouraging; but the address of Mr. Westgate\u2019s office was freely imparted by the intelligent black and was taken down by Percy Beaumont in his pocketbook. The two gentlemen then returned, languidly, to their hotel, and sent for a hackney coach, and in this commodious vehicle they rolled comfortably downtown. They measured the whole length of Broadway again and found it a path of fire; and then, deflecting to the left, they were deposited by their conductor before a fresh, light, ornamental structure, ten stories"}, {"size": 632, "text": "high, in a street crowded with keen-faced, light-limbed young men, who were running about very quickly and stopping each other eagerly at corners and in doorways. Passing into this brilliant building, they were introduced by one of the keen-faced young men--he was a charming fellow, in wonderful cream-colored garments and a hat with a blue ribbon, who had evidently perceived them to be aliens and helpless--to a very snug hydraulic elevator, in which they took their place with many other persons, and which, shooting upward in its vertical socket, presently projected them into the seventh horizontal compartment of the edifice."}, {"size": 812, "text": "Here, after brief delay, they found themselves face to face with the friend of their friend in London. His office was composed of several different rooms, and they waited very silently in one of them after they had sent in their letter and their cards. The letter was not one which it would take Mr. Westgate very long to read, but he came out to speak to them more instantly than they could have expected; he had evidently jumped up from his work. He was a tall, lean personage and was dressed all in fresh white linen; he had a thin, sharp, familiar face, with an expression that was at one and the same time sociable and businesslike, a quick, intelligent eye, and a large brown mustache, which concealed his mouth and made his chin, beneath it, look small. Lord Lambeth thought he looked tremendously clever."}, {"size": 609, "text": "\u201cHow do you do, Lord Lambeth--how do you do, sir?\u201d he said, holding the open letter in his hand. \u201cI\u2019m very glad to see you; I hope you\u2019re very well. You had better come in here; I think it\u2019s cooler,\u201d and he led the way into another room, where there were law books and papers, and windows wide open beneath striped awning. Just opposite one of the windows, on a line with his eyes, Lord Lambeth observed the weathervane of a church steeple. The uproar of the street sounded infinitely far below, and Lord Lambeth felt very high in the air. \u201cI say it\u2019s cooler,\u201d pursued their host, \u201cbut everything is relative."}, {"size": 623, "text": "How do you stand the heat?\u201d \u201cI can\u2019t say we like it,\u201d said Lord Lambeth; \u201cbut Beaumont likes it better than I.\u201d \u201cWell, it won\u2019t last,\u201d Mr. Westgate very cheerfully declared; \u201cnothing unpleasant lasts over here. It was very hot when Captain Littledale was here; he did nothing but drink sherry cobblers. He expressed some doubt in his letter whether I will remember him--as if I didn\u2019t remember making six sherry cobblers for him one day in about twenty minutes. I hope you left him well, two years having elapsed since then.\u201d \u201cOh, yes, he\u2019s all right,\u201d said Lord Lambeth. \u201cI am always very glad to see your countrymen,\u201d Mr."}, {"size": 605, "text": "Westgate pursued. \u201cI thought it would be time some of you should be coming along.

You must go down to Newport.\u201d \u201cWe\u2019ll go anywhere,\u201d said Lord Lambeth. \u201cYes, you want to go to Newport; that\u2019s what you want to do,\u201d Mr. Westgate affirmed. \u201cBut let\u2019s see--when did you get here?\u201d \u201cOnly yesterday,\u201d said Percy Beaumont."}, {"size": 624, "text": "\u201cAh, yes, by the Russia.

Mr. Westgate stared and laughed. \u201cOh, no, of course you don\u2019t like the gnats. We shall expect you to like a good many things over here, but we shan\u2019t insist upon your liking the gnats; though certainly you\u2019ll admit that, as gnats, they are fine, eh?

The only mitigation of her felicity on this point was that, having inspected her visitor\u2019s own costume, she said to herself, \u201cShe won\u2019t know how well I am dressed!\u201d \u201cHe has asked me to go, but I am not sure I shall be able,\u201d murmured the duchess. \u201cHe had offered us the p--prospect of meeting you,\u201d said Mrs. Westgate."}, {"size": 602, "text": "\u201cI hate the country at this season,\u201d responded the duchess. Mrs. Westgate gave a little shrug. \u201cI think it is pleasanter than London.\u201d But the duchess\u2019s eyes were absent again; she was looking very fixedly at Bessie. In a moment she slowly rose, walked to a chair that stood empty at the young girl\u2019s right hand, and silently seated herself. As she was a majestic, voluminous woman, this little transaction had, inevitably, an air of somewhat impressive intention.
