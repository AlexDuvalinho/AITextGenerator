Looking-Glass house One thing was certain, that the WHITE kitten had had nothing to do with it:--it was the black kitten\u2019s fault entirely. For the white kitten had been having its face washed by the old cat for the last quarter of an hour (and bearing it pretty well, considering); so you see that it COULDN\u2019T have had any hand in the mischief. The way Dinah washed her children\u2019s faces was this: first she held the poor thing down by its ear with one paw, and then with the other paw she rubbed its face all over, the wrong way, beginning at the nose: and just now, as I said, she was hard at work on the white kitten, which was lying quite still and trying to purr--no doubt feeling that it was all meant for its good."}, {"size": 637, "text": "But the black kitten had been finished with earlier in the afternoon, and so, while Alice was sitting curled up in a corner of the great arm-chair, half talking to herself and half asleep, the kitten had been having a grand game of romps with the ball of worsted Alice had been trying to wind up, and had been rolling it up and down till it had all come undone again; and there it was, spread over the hearth-rug, all knots and tangles, with the kitten running after its own tail in the middle. \u2018Oh, you wicked little thing!\u2019 cried Alice, catching up the kitten, and giving it a little kiss to make it understand that it was in disgrace."}, {"size": 641, "text": "\u2018Really, Dinah ought to have taught you better manners! You OUGHT, Dinah, you know you ought!\u2019 she added, looking reproachfully at the old cat, and speaking in as cross a voice as she could manage--and then she scrambled back into the arm-chair, taking the kitten and the worsted with her, and began winding up the ball again. But she didn\u2019t get on very fast, as she was talking all the time, sometimes to the kitten, and sometimes to herself. Kitty sat very demurely on her knee, pretending to watch the progress of the winding, and now and then putting out one paw and gently touching the ball, as if it would be glad to help, if it might."}, {"size": 602, "text": "\u2018Do you know what to-morrow is, Kitty?\u2019 Alice began. \u2018You\u2019d have guessed if you\u2019d been up in the window with me--only Dinah was making you tidy, so you couldn\u2019t. I was watching the boys getting in sticks for the bonfire--and it wants plenty of sticks, Kitty! Only it got so cold, and it snowed so, they had to leave off. Never mind, Kitty, we\u2019ll go and see the bonfire to-morrow.\u2019 Here Alice wound two or three turns of the worsted round the kitten\u2019s neck, just to see how it would look: this led to a scramble, in which the ball rolled down upon the floor, and yards and yards of it got unwound again."}, {"size": 637, "text": "\u2018Do you know, I was so angry, Kitty,\u2019 Alice went on as soon as they were comfortably settled again, \u2018when I saw all the mischief you had been doing, I was very nearly opening the window, and putting you out into the snow! And you\u2019d have deserved it, you little mischievous darling! What have you got to say for yourself? Now don\u2019t interrupt me!\u2019 she went on, holding up one finger. \u2018I\u2019m going to tell you all your faults. Number one: you squeaked twice while Dinah was washing your face this morning. Now you can\u2019t deny it, Kitty: I heard you! What\u2019s that you say?\u2019 (pretending that the kitten was speaking.) \u2018Her paw went into your eye?"}, {"size": 657, "text": "Well, that\u2019s YOUR fault, for keeping your eyes open--if you\u2019d shut them tight up, it wouldn\u2019t have happened. Now don\u2019t make any more excuses, but listen! Number two: you pulled Snowdrop away by the tail just as I had put down the saucer of milk before her! What, you were thirsty, were you? How do you know she wasn\u2019t thirsty too? Now for number three: you unwound every bit of the worsted while I wasn\u2019t looking! \u2018That\u2019s three faults, Kitty, and you\u2019ve not been punished for any of them yet. You know I\u2019m saving up all your punishments for Wednesday week--Suppose they had saved up all MY punishments!\u2019 she went on, talking more to herself than the kitten."}, {"size": 751, "text": "\u2018What WOULD they do at the end of a year? I should be sent to prison, I suppose, when the day came. Or--let me see--suppose each punishment was to be going without a dinner: then, when the miserable day came, I should have to go without fifty dinners at once! Well, I shouldn\u2019t mind THAT much! I\u2019d far rather go without them than eat them! \u2018Do you hear the snow against the window-panes, Kitty? How nice and soft it sounds! Just as if some one was kissing the window all over outside. I wonder if the snow LOVES the trees and fields, that it kisses them so gently? And then it covers them up snug, you know, with a white quilt; and perhaps it says, \u201cGo to sleep, darlings, till the summer comes again.\u201d And when they wake up in the summer, Kitty, they"}, {"size": 614, "text": "dress themselves all in green, and dance about--whenever the wind blows--oh, that\u2019s very pretty!\u2019 cried Alice, dropping the ball of worsted to clap her hands. \u2018And I do so WISH it was true! I\u2019m sure the woods look sleepy in the autumn, when the leaves are getting brown. \u2018Kitty, can you play chess? Now, don\u2019t smile, my dear, I\u2019m asking it seriously. Because, when we were playing just now, you watched just as if you understood it: and when I said \u201cCheck!\u201d you purred! Well, it WAS a nice check, Kitty, and really I might have won, if it hadn\u2019t been for that nasty Knight, that came wiggling down among my pieces."}, {"size": 665, "text": "Kitty, dear, let\u2019s pretend--\u2019 And here I wish I could tell you half the things Alice used to say, beginning with her favourite phrase \u2018Let\u2019s pretend.\u2019 She had had quite a long argument with her sister only the day before--all because Alice had begun with \u2018Let\u2019s pretend we\u2019re kings and queens;\u2019 and her sister, who liked being very exact, had argued that they couldn\u2019t, because there were only two of them, and Alice had been reduced at last to say, \u2018Well, YOU can be one of them then, and I\u2019LL be all the rest.\u2019 And once she had really frightened her old nurse by shouting suddenly in her ear, \u2018Nurse!

Now do try, there\u2019s a dear!\u2019 And Alice got the Red Queen off the table, and set it up before the kitten as a model for it to imitate: however, the thing didn\u2019t succeed, principally, Alice said, because the kitten wouldn\u2019t fold its arms properly. So, to punish it, she held it up to the Looking-glass, that it might see how sulky it was--\u2018and if you\u2019re not good directly,\u2019 she added, \u2018I\u2019ll put you through into Looking-glass House.

I can see all of it when I get upon a chair--all but the bit behind the fireplace. Oh! I do so wish I could see THAT bit! I want so much to know whether they\u2019ve a fire in the winter: you never CAN tell, you know, unless our fire smokes, and then smoke comes up in that room too--but that may be only pretence, just to make it look as if they had a fire. Well then, the books are something like our books, only the words go the wrong way; I know that, because I\u2019ve held up one of our books to the glass, and then they hold up one in the other room."}, {"size": 631, "text": "\u2018How would you like to live in Looking-glass House, Kitty? I wonder if they\u2019d give you milk in there? Perhaps Looking-glass milk isn\u2019t good to drink--But oh, Kitty! now we come to the passage. You can just see a little PEEP of the passage in Looking-glass House, if you leave the door of our drawing-room wide open: and it\u2019s very like our passage as far as you can see, only you know it may be quite different on beyond. Oh, Kitty! how nice it would be if we could only get through into Looking-glass House! I\u2019m sure it\u2019s got, oh! such beautiful things in it!

And certainly the glass WAS beginning to melt away, just like a bright silvery mist. In another moment Alice was through the glass, and had jumped lightly down into the Looking-glass room. The very first thing she did was to look whether there was a fire in the fireplace, and she was quite pleased to find that there was a real one, blazing away as brightly as the one she had left behind."}, {"size": 651, "text": "\u2018So I shall be as warm here as I was in the old room,\u2019 thought Alice: \u2018warmer, in fact, because there\u2019ll be no one here to scold me away from the fire.

For instance, the pictures on the wall next the fire seemed to be all alive, and the very clock on the chimney-piece (you know you can only see the back of it in the Looking-glass) had got the face of a little old man, and grinned at her."}, {"size": 654, "text": "\u2018They don\u2019t keep this room so tidy as the other,\u2019 Alice thought to herself, as she noticed several of the chessmen down in the hearth among the cinders: but in another moment, with a little \u2018Oh!\u2019 of surprise, she was down on her hands and knees watching them. The chessmen were walking about, two and two! \u2018Here are the Red King and the Red Queen,\u2019 Alice said (in a whisper, for fear of frightening them), \u2018and there are the White King and the White Queen sitting on the edge of the shovel--and here are two castles walking arm in arm--I don\u2019t think they can hear me,\u2019 she went on, as she put her head closer down, \u2018and I\u2019m nearly sure they can\u2019t see me."}, {"size": 700, "text": "I feel somehow as if I were invisible--\u2019 Here something began squeaking on the table behind Alice, and made her turn her head just in time to see one of the White Pawns roll over and begin kicking: she watched it with great curiosity to see what would happen next. \u2018It is the voice of my child!\u2019 the White Queen cried out as she rushed past the King, so violently that she knocked him over among the cinders. \u2018My precious Lily! My imperial kitten!\u2019 and she began scrambling wildly up the side of the fender. \u2018Imperial fiddlestick!\u2019 said the King, rubbing his nose, which had been hurt by the fall. He had a right to be a LITTLE annoyed with the Queen, for he was covered with ashes from head to foot."}, {"size": 657, "text": "Alice was very anxious to be of use, and, as the poor little Lily was nearly screaming herself into a fit, she hastily picked up the Queen and set her on the table by the side of her noisy little daughter.

As soon as she had recovered her breath a little, she called out to the White King, who was sitting sulkily among the ashes, \u2018Mind the volcano!\u2019 \u2018What volcano?\u2019 said the King, looking up anxiously into the fire, as if he thought that was the most likely place to find one."}, {"size": 693, "text": "\u2018Blew--me--up,\u2019 panted the Queen, who was still a little out of breath. \u2018Mind you come up--the regular way--don\u2019t get blown up!\u2019 Alice watched the White King as he slowly struggled up from bar to bar, till at last she said, \u2018Why, you\u2019ll be hours and hours getting to the table, at that rate. I\u2019d far better help you, hadn\u2019t I?\u2019 But the King took no notice of the question: it was quite clear that he could neither hear her nor see her. So Alice picked him up very gently, and lifted him across more slowly than she had lifted the Queen, that she mightn\u2019t take his breath away: but, before she put him on the table, she thought she might as well dust him a little, he was so covered with ashes."}, {"size": 731, "text": "She said afterwards that she had never seen in all her life such a face as the King made, when he found himself held in the air by an invisible hand, and being dusted: he was far too much astonished to cry out, but his eyes and his mouth went on getting larger and larger, and rounder and rounder, till her hand shook so with laughing that she nearly let him drop upon the floor. \u2018Oh! PLEASE don\u2019t make such faces, my dear!\u2019 she cried out, quite forgetting that the King couldn\u2019t hear her. \u2018You make me laugh so that I can hardly hold you! And don\u2019t keep your mouth so wide open!

However, she could find nothing but a bottle of ink, and when she got back with it she found he had recovered, and he and the Queen were talking together in a frightened whisper--so low, that Alice could hardly hear what they said. The King was saying, \u2018I assure, you my dear, I turned cold to the very ends of my whiskers!\u2019 To which the Queen replied, \u2018You haven\u2019t got any whiskers.\u2019 \u2018The horror of that moment,\u2019 the King went on, \u2018I shall never, NEVER forget!\u2019 \u2018You will, though,\u2019 the Queen said, \u2018if you don\u2019t make a memorandum of it.\u2019 Alice looked on with great interest as the King took an enormous memorandum-book out of his pocket, and began writing."}, {"size": 751, "text": "A sudden thought struck her, and she took hold of the end of the pencil, which came some way over his shoulder, and began writing for him.

All the time you\u2019re eating your breakfast, I\u2019ll repeat \u201cThe Walrus and the Carpenter\u201d to you; and then you can make believe it\u2019s oysters, dear! \u2018Now, Kitty, let\u2019s consider who it was that dreamed it all. This is a serious question, my dear, and you should NOT go on licking your paw like that--as if Dinah hadn\u2019t washed you this morning! You see, Kitty, it MUST have been either me or the Red King. He was part of my dream, of course--but then I was part of his dream, too! WAS it the Red King, Kitty? You were his wife, my dear, so you ought to know--Oh, Kitty, DO help to settle it! I\u2019m sure your paw can wait!\u2019 But the provoking kitten only began on the other paw, and pretended it hadn\u2019t heard the question. Which do YOU think it was?"}, {"size": 611, "text": "A boat beneath a sunny sky, Lingering onward dreamily In an evening of July-- Children three that nestle near, Eager eye and willing ear, Pleased a simple tale to hear-- Long has paled that sunny sky: Echoes fade and memories die. Autumn frosts have slain July. Still she haunts me, phantomwise, Alice moving under skies Never seen by waking eyes. Children yet, the tale to hear, Eager eye and willing ear, Lovingly shall nestle near. In a Wonderland they lie, Dreaming as the days go by, Dreaming as the summers die: Ever drifting down the stream-- Lingering in the golden gleam-- Life, what is it but a dream?"}]}
