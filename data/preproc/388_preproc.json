THE BLUE WALL I was born under the Blue Ridge, and under that side which is blue in the evening light, in a wild land of game and forest and rushing waters. There, on the borders of a creek that runs into the Yadkin River, in a cabin that was chinked with red mud, I came into the world a subject of King George the Third, in that part of his realm known as the province of North Carolina."}, {"size": 871, "text": "The cabin reeked of corn-pone and bacon, and the odor of pelts. It had two shakedowns, on one of which I slept under a bearskin. A rough stone chimney was reared outside, and the fireplace was as long as my father was tall. There was a crane in it, and a bake kettle; and over it great buckhorns held my father\u2019s rifle when it was not in use. On other horns hung jerked bear\u2019s meat and venison hams, and gourds for drinking cups, and bags of seed, and my father\u2019s best hunting shirt; also, in a neglected corner, several articles of woman\u2019s attire from pegs. These once belonged to my mother. Among them was a gown of silk, of a fine, faded pattern, over which I was wont to speculate. The women at the Cross-Roads, twelve miles away, were dressed in coarse butternut wool and huge sunbonnets. But when I questioned my father on these matters he would give me no answers."}, {"size": 665, "text": "My father was--how shall I say what he was? To this day I can only surmise many things of him. He was a Scotchman born, and I know now that he had a slight Scotch accent. At the time of which I write, my early childhood, he was a frontiersman and hunter. I can see him now, with his hunting shirt and leggings and moccasins; his powder horn, engraved with wondrous scenes; his bullet pouch and tomahawk and hunting knife. He was a tall, lean man with a strange, sad face. And he talked little save when he drank too many \u201chorns,\u201d as they were called in that country. These lapses of my father\u2019s were a perpetual source of wonder to me,--and, I must say, of delight."}, {"size": 606, "text": "They occurred only when a passing traveller who hit his fancy chanced that way, or, what was almost as rare, a neighbor. Many a winter night I have lain awake under the skins, listening to a flow of language that held me spellbound, though I understood scarce a word of it. \u201cVirtuous and vicious every man must be, Few in the extreme, but all in a degree.\u201d The chance neighbor or traveller was no less struck with wonder. And many the time have I heard the query, at the Cross-Roads and elsewhere, \u201cWhar Alec Trimble got his larnin\u2019?\u201d The truth is, my father was an object of suspicion to the frontiersmen."}, {"size": 700, "text": "Even as a child I knew this, and resented it. He had brought me up in solitude, and I was old for my age, learned in some things far beyond my years, and ignorant of others I should have known. I loved the man passionately. In the long winter evenings, when the howl of wolves and \u201cpainters\u201d rose as the wind lulled, he taught me to read from the Bible and the \u201cPilgrim\u2019s Progress.\u201d I can see his long, slim fingers on the page. They seemed but ill fitted for the life he led. The love of rhythmic language was somehow born into me, and many\u2019s the time I have held watch in the cabin day and night while my father was away on his hunts, spelling out the verses that have since become part of my life."}, {"size": 627, "text": "As I grew older I went with him into the mountains, often on his back; and spent the nights in open camp with my little moccasins drying at the blaze. So I learned to skin a bear, and fleece off the fat for oil with my hunting knife; and cure a deerskin and follow a trail. At seven I even shot the long rifle, with a rest. I learned to endure cold and hunger and fatigue and to walk in silence over the mountains, my father never saying a word for days at a spell. And often, when he opened his mouth, it would be to recite a verse of Pope\u2019s in a way that moved me strangely. For a poem is not a poem unless it be well spoken."}, {"size": 628, "text": "In the hot days of summer, over against the dark forest the bright green of our little patch of Indian corn rippled in the wind. And towards night I would often sit watching the deep blue of the mountain wall and dream of the mysteries of the land that lay beyond. And by chance, one evening as I sat thus, my father reading in the twilight, a man stood before us. So silently had he come up the path leading from the brook that we had not heard him. Presently my father looked up from his book, but did not rise. As for me, I had been staring for some time in astonishment, for he was a better-looking man than I had ever seen."}, {"size": 683, "text": "He wore a deerskin hunting shirt dyed black, but, in place of a coonskin cap with the tail hanging down, a hat. His long rifle rested on the ground, and he held a roan horse by the bridle. \u201cHowdy, neighbor?\u201d said he. I recall a fear that my father would not fancy him. In such cases he would give a stranger food, and leave him to himself. My father\u2019s whims were past understanding. But he got up. \u201cGood evening,\u201d said he. The visitor looked a little surprised, as I had seen many do, at my father\u2019s accent. \u201cNeighbor,\u201d said he, \u201ckin you keep me over night?\u201d \u201cCome in,\u201d said my father. We sat down to our supper of corn and beans and venison, of all of which our guest ate sparingly."}, {"size": 622, "text": "He, too, was a silent man, and scarcely a word was spoken during the meal. Several times he looked at me with such a kindly expression in his blue eyes, a trace of a smile around his broad mouth, that I wished he might stay with us always. But once, when my father said something about Indians, the eyes grew hard as flint. It was then I remarked, with a boy\u2019s wonder, that despite his dark hair he had yellow eyebrows. After supper the two men sat on the log step, while I set about the task of skinning the deer my father had shot that day. Presently I felt a heavy hand on my shoulder. \u201cWhat\u2019s your name, lad?\u201d he said."}, {"size": 609, "text": "\u201cDavy, I\u2019ll larn ye a trick worth a little time,\u201d said he, whipping out a knife. In a trice the red carcass hung between the forked stakes, while I stood with my mouth open. He turned to me and laughed gently. \u201cSome day you\u2019ll cross the mountains and skin twenty of an evening,\u201d he said. \u201cYe\u2019ll make a woodsman sure. You\u2019ve got the eye, and the hand.\u201d This little piece of praise from him made me hot all over. \u201cGame rare?\u201d said he to my father. \u201cNone sae good, now,\u201d said my father. \u201cI reckon not. My cabin\u2019s on Beaver Creek some forty mile above, and game\u2019s going there, too.\u201d \u201cSettlements,\u201d said my father."}, {"size": 765, "text": "But presently, after a few whiffs of his pipe, he added, \u201cI hear fine things of this land across the mountains, that the Indians call the Dark and Bluidy Ground.\u201d \u201cAnd well named,\u201d said the stranger. \u201cBut a brave country,\u201d said my father, \u201cand all tramped down with game. I hear that Daniel Boone and others have gone into it and come back with marvellous tales. They tell me Boone was there alone three months. He\u2019s saething of a man. D\u2019ye ken him?\u201d The ruddy face of the stranger grew ruddier still. \u201cMy name\u2019s Boone,\u201d he said. \u201cWhat!\u201d cried my father, \u201cit wouldn\u2019t be Daniel?\u201d \u201cYou\u2019ve guessed it, I reckon.\u201d My father rose without a word, went into the cabin, and immediately reappeared with a flask and a couple of gourds, one of which he handed to our visitor."}, {"size": 772, "text": "\u201cTell me aboot it,\u201d said he. That was the fairy tale of my childhood. Far into the night I lay on the dewy grass listening to Mr. Boone\u2019s talk. It did not at first flow in a steady stream, for he was not a garrulous man, but my father\u2019s questions presently fired his enthusiasm. I recall but little of it, being so small a lad, but I crept closer and closer until I could touch this superior being who had been beyond the Wall. Marco Polo was no greater wonder to the Venetians than Boone to me. He spoke of leaving wife and children, and setting out for the Unknown with other woodsmen. He told how, crossing over our blue western wall into a valley beyond, they found a \u201cWarrior\u2019s Path\u201d through a gap across another range, and so down into the fairest of promised lands."}, {"size": 635, "text": "And as he talked he lost himself in the tale of it, and the very quality of his voice changed. He told of a land of wooded hill and pleasant vale, of clear water running over limestone down to the great river beyond, the Ohio--a land of glades, the fields of which were pied with flowers of wondrous beauty, where roamed the buffalo in countless thousands, where elk and deer abounded, and turkeys and feathered game, and bear in the tall brakes of cane. And, simply, he told how, when the others had left him, he stayed for three months roaming the hills alone with Nature herself. \u201cBut did you no\u2019 meet the Indians?\u201d asked my father."}, {"size": 610, "text": "\u201cI seed one fishing on a log once,\u201d said our visitor, laughing, \u201cbut he fell into the water. I reckon he was drowned.\u201d My father nodded comprehendingly,--even admiringly. \u201cAnd again!\u201d said he. \u201cWal,\u201d said Mr. Boone, \u201cwe fell in with a war party of Shawnees going back to their lands north of the great river. The critters took away all we had. It was hard,\u201d he added reflectively; \u201cI had staked my fortune on the venter, and we\u2019d got enough skins to make us rich. But, neighbor, there is land enough for you and me, as black and rich as Canaan.\u201d \u201c\u2018The Lord is my shepherd,\u2019\u201d said my father, lapsing into verse."}, {"size": 701, "text": "\u201c\u2018The Lord is my shepherd. I shall not want. He leadeth me into green pastures, and beside still waters.\u2019\u201d For a time they were silent, each wrapped in his own thought, while the crickets chirped and the frogs sang. From the distant forest came the mournful hoot of an owl. \u201cAnd you are going back?\u201d asked my father, presently. \u201cAye, that I am. There are many families on the Yadkin below going, too. And you, neighbor, you might come with us. Davy is the boy that would thrive in that country.\u201d My father did not answer. It was late indeed when we lay down to rest, and the night I spent between waking and dreaming of the wonderland beyond the mountains, hoping against hope that my father would go."}, {"size": 542, "text": "The sun was just flooding the slopes when our guest arose to leave, and my father bade him God-speed with a heartiness that was rare to him. But, to my bitter regret, neither spoke of my father\u2019s going. Being a man of understanding, Mr. Boone knew it were little use to press. He patted me on the head. \u201cYou\u2019re a wise lad, Davy,\u201d said he. \u201cI hope we shall meet again.\u201d He mounted his roan and rode away down the slope, waving his hand to us. And it was with a heavy heart that I went to feed our white mare, whinnying for food in the lean-to."}, {"size": 630, "text": "CHAPTER II. WARS AND RUMORS OF WARS And so our life went on the same, but yet not the same. For I had the Land of Promise to dream of, and as I went about my tasks I conjured up in my mind pictures of its beauty. You will forgive a backwoods boy,--self-centred, for lack of wider interest, and with a little imagination. Bear hunting with my father, and an occasional trip on the white mare twelve miles to the Cross-Roads for salt and other necessaries, were the only diversions to break the routine of my days. But at the Cross-Roads, too, they were talking of Kaintuckee. For so the Land was called, the Dark and Bloody Ground."}, {"size": 817, "text": "The next year came a war on the Frontier, waged by Lord Dunmore, Governor of Virginia. Of this likewise I heard at the Cross-Roads, though few from our part seemed to have gone to it. And I heard there, for rumors spread over mountains, that men blazing in the new land were in danger, and that my hero, Boone, was gone out to save them. But in the autumn came tidings of a great battle far to the north, and of the Indians suing for peace. The next year came more tidings of a sort I did not understand. I remember once bringing back from the Cross-Roads a crumpled newspaper, which my father read again and again, and then folded up and put in his pocket. He said nothing to me of these things. But the next time I went to the Cross-Roads, the woman asked me:-- \u201cIs your Pa for the Congress?\u201d \u201cWhat\u2019s that?\u201d said I."}, {"size": 690, "text": "\u201cI reckon he ain\u2019t,\u201d said the woman, tartly. I recall her dimly, a slattern creature in a loose gown and bare feet, wife of the storekeeper and wagoner, with a swarm of urchins about her. They were all very natural to me thus. And I remember a battle with one of these urchins in the briers, an affair which did not add to the love of their family for ours. There was no money in that country, and the store took our pelts in exchange for what we needed from civilization. Once a month would I load these pelts on the white mare, and make the journey by the path down the creek. At times I met other settlers there, some of them not long from Ireland, with the brogue still in their mouths."}, {"size": 652, "text": "And again, I saw the wagoner with his great canvas-covered wagon standing at the door, ready to start for the town sixty miles away. \u2018Twas he brought the news of this latest war. One day I was surprised to see the wagoner riding up the path to our cabin, crying out for my father, for he was a violent man. And a violent scene followed. They remained for a long time within the house, and when they came out the wagoner\u2019s face was red with rage. My father, too, was angry, but no more talkative than usual. \u201cYe say ye\u2019ll not help the Congress?\u201d shouted the wagoner. \u201cI\u2019ll not,\u201d said my father. \u201cYe\u2019ll live to rue this day, Alec Trimble,\u201d cried the man."}, {"size": 627, "text": "\u201cYe may think ye\u2019re too fine for the likes of us, but there\u2019s them in the settlement that knows about ye.\u201d With that he flung himself on his horse, and rode away. But the next time I went to the Cross-Roads the woman drove me away with curses, and called me an aristocrat. Wearily I tramped back the dozen miles up the creek, beside the mare, carrying my pelts with me; stumbling on the stones, and scratched by the dry briers. For it was autumn, the woods all red and yellow against the green of the pines. I sat down beside the old beaver dam to gather courage to tell my father. But he only smiled bitterly when he heard it."}, {"size": 461, "text": "Nor would he tell me what the word aristocrat meant. That winter we spent without bacon, and our salt gave out at Christmas. It was at this season, if I remember rightly, that we had another visitor. He arrived about nightfall one gray day, his horse jaded and cut, and he was dressed all in wool, with a great coat wrapped about him, and high boots. This made me stare at him. When my father drew back the bolt of the door he, too, stared and fell back a step."}, {"size": 637, "text": "\u201cD\u2019ye ken me, Alec?\u201d said the man. He was a tall, spare man like my father, a Scotchman, but his hair was in a cue. \u201cCome in, Duncan,\u201d said my father, quietly. \u201cDavy, run out for wood.\u201d Loath as I was to go, I obeyed. As I came back dragging a log behind me I heard them in argument, and in their talk there was much about the Congress, and a woman named Flora Macdonald, and a British fleet sailing southward. \u201cWe\u2019ll have two thousand Highlanders and more to meet the fleet. And ye\u2019ll sit at hame, in this hovel ye\u2019ve made yeresel\u201d (and he glanced about disdainfully) \u201cand no help the King?\u201d He brought his fist down on the pine boards."}, {"size": 601, "text": "\u201cYe did no help the King greatly at Culloden, Duncan,\u201d said my father, dryly. Our visitor did not answer at once. \u201cThe Yankee Rebels \u2018ll no help the House of Stuart,\u201d said he, presently. \u201cAnd Hanover\u2019s coom to stay. Are ye, too, a Rebel, Alec Ritchie?\u201d I remember wondering why he said Ritchie. \u201cI\u2019ll no take a hand in this fight,\u201d answered my father. And that was the end of it. The man left with scant ceremony, I guiding him down the creek to the main trail. He did not open his mouth until I parted with him. \u201cPuir Davy,\u201d said he, and rode away in the night, for the moon shone through the clouds."}, {"size": 386, "text": "I remember these things, I suppose, because I had nothing else to think about. And the names stuck in my memory, intensified by later events, until I began to write a diary. And now I come to my travels.

We loaded the white mare with the pelts, and my father wore a woollen suit like that of our Scotch visitor, which I had never seen before. He had clubbed his hair. But, strangest of all, he carried in a small parcel the silk gown that had been my mother\u2019s. We had scant other baggage.We crossed the Yadkin at a ford, and climbing the hills to the south of it we went down over stony traces, down and down, through rain and sun; stopping at rude cabins or taverns, until we came into the valley of another river."}, {"size": 656, "text": "This I know now was the Catawba. My memories of that ride are as misty as the spring weather in the mountains. But presently the country began to open up into broad fields, some of these abandoned to pines. And at last, splashing through the stiff red clay that was up to the mare\u2019s fetlocks, we came to a place called Charlotte Town. What a day that was for me! And how I gaped at the houses there, finer than any I had ever dreamed of! That was my first sight of a town. And how I listened open-mouthed to the gentlemen at the tavern! One I recall had a fighting head with a lock awry, and a negro servant to wait on him, and was the principal spokesman."}, {"size": 719, "text": "He, too, was talking of war. The Cherokees had risen on the western border. He was telling of the massacre of a settlement, in no mild language. \u201cSirs,\u201d he cried, \u201cthe British have stirred the redskins to this. Will you sit here while women and children are scalped, and those devils\u201d (he called them worse names) \u201cStuart and Cameron go unpunished?\u201d My father got up from the corner where he sat, and stood beside the man. \u201cI ken Alec Cameron,\u201d said he.

The next morning we sold our pelts. And though the mare was tired, we pushed southward, I behind the saddle. I had much to think about, wondering what was to become of me while my father went to skin Cameron. I had not the least doubt that he would do it. The world is a storybook to a lad of nine, and the thought of Charlestown filled me with a delight unspeakable. Perchance he would leave me in Charlestown. At nightfall we came into a settlement called the Waxhaws. And there being no tavern there, and the mare being very jaded and the roads heavy, we cast about for a place to sleep."}, {"size": 613, "text": "The sunlight slanting over the pine forest glistened on the pools in the wet fields. And it so chanced that splashing across these, swinging a milk-pail over his head, shouting at the top of his voice, was a red-headed lad of my own age.

He stood before us, eying me with a most mischievous look in his blue eyes, and dabbling in the red mud with his toes. I remember I thought him a queer-looking boy. He was lanky, and he had a very long face under his tousled hair.

But when she was gone out, Andy stumped his toe getting into bed in the dark and swore with a brilliancy and vehemence that astonished me.

They put me in mind of the palaces in Bunyan, their windows all golden in the morning sun; and as we jogged ahead, I pondered on the delights within them. I saw gangs of negroes plodding to work along the road, an overseer riding behind them with his gun on his back; and there were whole cotton fields in these domains blazing in primrose flower,--a new plant here, so my father said.

Men clad in homespun, perspiring and spattered with mud, were straggling along the road by fours, laughing and joking together.

White puffs, like cotton balls, would dart one after another from a ship\u2019s side, melt into a cloud, float over her spars, and hide her from my view.

But at noon it seemed to me as though some of the ships were sailing. It was true. Slowly they drew away from the others, and presently I thought they had stopped again. Surely two of them were stuck together, then three were fast on a shoal. Boats, like black bugs in the water, came and went between them and the others.

The cabin stood on a terrace that nature had levelled, looking across a swift and shallow stream towards the mountains. There was the truck patch, with its yellow squashes and melons, and cabbages and beans, where Polly Ann and I worked through the hot mornings; and the corn patch, with the great stumps of the primeval trees standing in it.

All day I waited, until the forest light grew gray, when a buck came and stood over the water, raising his head and stamping from time to time.

For a moment he looked at the face of Polly Ann, sleeping peacefully, and the fierce light faded from his eyes. He brushed her on the cheek and she awoke and smiled at him, trustfully, lovingly. He put his finger to his lips."}, {"size": 612, "text": "\u201cStay with Davy,\u201d he said. Turning to me, he added: \u201cWhen you wake Weldon, wake him easy. So.\u201d He put his hand in mine, and gradually tightened it. \u201cWake him that way, and he won\u2019t jump.\u201d Polly Ann asked no questions. She looked at Tom, and her soul was in her face. She seized the pistol from the blanket. Then we watched him creeping down the creek on his belly, close to the bank. Next we moved behind the fallen tree, and I put my hand in Weldon\u2019s. He woke with a sigh, started, but we drew him down behind the log. Presently he climbed cautiously up the bank and took station in the muddy roots of the tree."}, {"size": 704, "text": "Then we waited, watching Tom with a prayer in our hearts. Those who have not felt it know not the fearfulness of waiting for an Indian attack. At last Tom reached the bend in the bank, beside some red-bud bushes, and there he stayed. A level shaft of light shot through the forest. The birds, twittering, awoke. A great hawk soared high in the blue over our heads. An hour passed. I had sighted the rifle among the yellow leaves of the fallen oak an hundred times. But Polly Ann looked not once to the right or left. Her eyes and her prayers followed the form of her husband. Then, like the cracking of a great drover\u2019s whip, a shot rang out in the stillness, and my hands tightened over the rifle-stock."}, {"size": 644, "text": "A piece of bark struck me in the face, and a dead leaf fluttered to the ground. Almost instantly there was another shot, and a blue wisp of smoke rose from the red-bud bushes, where Tom was. The horses whinnied, there was a rustle in the cane, and silence. Weldon bent over. \u201cMy God!\u201d he whispered hoarsely, \u201che hit one. Tom hit one.\u201d I felt Polly Ann\u2019s hand on my face. \u201cDavy dear,\u201d she said, \u201care ye hurt?\u201d \u201cNo,\u201d said I, dazed, and wondering why Weldon had not been shot long ago as he slumbered. I was burning to climb the bank and ask him whether he had seen the Indian fall. Again there was silence,--a silence even more awful than before."}, {"size": 653, "text": "The sun crept higher, the magic of his rays turning the creek from black to crystal, and the birds began to sing again. And still there was no sign of the treacherous enemy that lurked about us. Could Tom get back? I glanced at Polly Ann. The same question was written in her yearning eyes, staring at the spot where the gray of his hunting shirt showed through the bushes at the bend. Suddenly her hand tightened on mine. The hunting shirt was gone! After that, in the intervals when my terror left me, I tried to speculate upon the plan of the savages. Their own numbers could not be great, and yet they must have known from our trace how few we were."}, {"size": 643, "text": "Scanning the ground, I noted that the forest was fairly clean of undergrowth on both sides of us. Below, the stream ran straight, but there were growths of cane and briers. Looking up, I saw Weldon faced about. It was the obvious move. But where had Tom gone? Next my eye was caught by a little run fringed with bushes that curved around the cane near the bend. I traced its course, unconsciously, bit by bit, until it reached the edge of a bank not fifty feet away. All at once my breath left me. Through the tangle of bramble stems at the mouth of the run, above naked brown shoulders there glared at me, hideously streaked with red, a face."}, {"size": 806, "text": "Had my fancy lied? I stared again until my eyes were blurred, now tortured by doubt, now so completely convinced that my fingers almost released the trigger,--for I had thrown the sights into line over the tree. I know not to this day whether I shot from determination or nervousness. My shoulder bruised by the kick, the smoke like a veil before my face, it was some moments ere I knew that the air was full of whistling bullets; and then the gun was torn from my hands, and I saw Polly Ann ramming in a new charge. \u201cThe pistol, Davy,\u201d she cried. One torture was over, another on. Crack after crack sounded from the forest--from here and there and everywhere, it seemed--and with a song that like a hurtling insect ran the scale of notes, the bullets buried themselves in the trunk of our oak with a chug."}, {"size": 652, "text": "Once in a while I heard Weldon\u2019s answering shot, but I remembered my promise to Tom not to waste powder unless I were sure. The agony was the breathing space we had while they crept nearer. Then we thought of Tom, and I dared not glance at Polly Ann for fear that the sight of her face would unnerve me. Then a longing to kill seized me, a longing so strange and fierce that I could scarce be still. I know now that it comes in battle to all men, and with intensity to the hunted, and it explained to me more clearly what followed. I fairly prayed for the sight of a painted form, and time after time my fancy tricked me into the notion that I had one."}, {"size": 625, "text": "And even as I searched the brambles at the top of the run a puff of smoke rose out of them, a bullet burying itself in the roots near Weldon, who fired in return. I say that I have some notion of what possessed the man, for he was crazed with passion at fighting the race which had so cruelly wronged him. Horror-struck, I saw him swing down from the bank, splash through the water with raised tomahawk, and gain the top of the run. In less time than it takes me to write these words he had dragged a hideous, naked warrior out of the brambles, and with an avalanche of crumbling earth they slid into the waters of the creek."}, {"size": 760, "text": "Polly Ann and I stared transfixed at the fearful fight that followed, nor can I give any adequate description of it. Weldon had struck through the brambles, but the savage had taken the blow on his gun-barrel and broken the handle of the tomahawk, and it was man to man as they rolled in the shallow water, locked in a death embrace. Neither might reach for his knife, neither was able to hold the other down, Weldon\u2019s curses surcharged with hatred, the Indian straining silently save for a gasp or a guttural note, the white a bearded madman, the savage a devil with a glistening, paint-streaked body, his features now agonized as his muscles strained and cracked, now lighted with a diabolical joy. But the pent-up rage of months gave the white man strength."}, {"size": 867, "text": "Polly Ann and I were powerless for fear of shooting Weldon, and gazed absorbed at the fiendish scene with eyes not to be withdrawn. The tree-trunk shook. A long, bronze arm reached out from above, and a painted face glowered at us from the very roots where Weldon had lain. That moment I took to be my last, and in it I seemed to taste all eternity. I heard but faintly a noise beyond. It was the shock of the heavy Indian falling on Polly Ann and me as we cowered under the trunk, and even then there was an instant that we stood gazing at him as at a worm writhing in the clay. It was she who fired the pistol and made the great hole in his head, and so he twitched and died. After that a confusion of shots, war-whoops, a vision of two naked forms flying from tree to tree towards the cane, and then--God be praised--Tom\u2019s voice shouting:-- \u201cPolly Ann! Polly Ann!\u201d"}, {"size": 663, "text": "Before she had reached the top of the bank Tom had her in his arms, and a dozen tall gray figures leaped the six feet into the stream and stopped. My own eyes turned with theirs to see the body of poor Weldon lying face downward in the water. But beyond it a tragedy awaited me. Defiant, immovable, save for the heaving of his naked chest, the savage who had killed him stood erect with folded arms facing us. The smoke cleared away from a gleaming rifle-barrel, and the brave staggered and fell and died as silent as he stood, his feathers making ripples in the stream. It was cold-blooded, if you like, but war in those days was to the death, and knew no mercy."}, {"size": 790, "text": "The tall backwoodsman who had shot him waded across the stream, and in the twinkling of an eye seized the scalp-lock and ran it round with his knife, holding up the bleeding trophy with a shout.

I looked up, burning with this praise from Tom (for I had never thought of praise nor of anything save his happiness and Polly Ann\u2019s). I looked up, and my eyes were caught and held with a strange fascination by fearless blue ones that gazed down into them. I give you but a poor description of the owner of these blue eyes, for personal magnetism springs not from one feature or another.

Young Colonel Clark glanced at the lithe figure of Polly Ann."}, {"size": 606, "text": "He seemed a man of few words, for he did not add to his praise of Tom\u2019s achievement by complimenting her as Captain Sevier had done. In fact, he said nothing more, but leaped down the bank and strode into the water where the body of Weldon lay, and dragged it out himself. We gathered around it silently, and two great tears rolled down Polly Ann\u2019s cheeks as she parted the hair with tenderness and loosened the clenched hands. Nor did any of the tall woodsmen speak. Poor Weldon! The tragedy of his life and death was the tragedy of Kentucky herself. They buried him by the waterside, where he had fallen."}, {"size": 671, "text": "But there was little time for mourning on the border.

Nor did I have any other feeling than fierce hatred of the race which had killed my father. Those who have known armies in their discipline will find it difficult to understand the leadership of the border."}, {"size": 703, "text": "Such leadership was granted only to those whose force and individuality compelled men to obey them. I had my first glimpse of it that day. This Colonel Clark to whom Tom delivered Mr. Robertson\u2019s letter was perchance the youngest man in the company that had rescued us, saving only a slim lad of seventeen whom I noticed and envied, and whose name was James Ray. Colonel Clark, so I was told by my friend Cowan, held that title in Kentucky by reason of his prowess. Clark had been standing quietly on the bank while I had scalped my first redskin.

Nay, she went so far as to tell how she came by me. The young Colonel listened gravely, though with a gleam now and then in his blue eyes.

Mr. Clark walked mostly alone, seemingly wrapped in thought. At times he had short talks with different men, oftenest--I noted with pride--with Tom McChesney.

Indeed, I became a kind of pet with the backwoodsmen, Cowan often flinging me to his shoulder as he swung along. The pack was taken from the sorrel mare and divided among the party, and Polly Ann made to ride that we might move the faster.

Nearer the stockade, where the keepers of the fort might venture out at times, a more orderly growth met the eye.

I have read in my old age the books of travellers in Kentucky, English and French, who wrote much of squalor and strife and sin and little of those qualities that go to the conquest of an empire and the making of a people. Perchance my own pages may be colored by gratitude and love for the pioneers amongst whom I found myself, and thankfulness to God that we had reached them alive."}, {"size": 863, "text": "I know not how many had been cooped up in the little fort since the early spring, awaiting the chance to go back to their weed-choked clearings. The fort at Harrodstown was like an hundred others I have since seen, but sufficiently surprising to me then. Imagine a great parallelogram made of log cabins set end to end, their common outside wall being the wall of the fort, and loopholed. At the four corners of the parallelogram the cabins jutted out, with ports in the angle in order to give a flanking fire in case the savages reached the palisade. And then there were huge log gates with watch-towers on either side where sentries sat day and night scanning the forest line. Within the fort was a big common dotted with forest trees, where such cattle as had been saved browsed on the scanty grass. There had been but the one scrawny horse before our arrival."}, {"size": 664, "text": "And the settlers! How shall I describe them as they crowded around us inside the gate? Some stared at us with sallow faces and eyes brightened by the fever, yet others had the red glow of health.

The barefooted women wore sunbonnets and loose homespun gowns, some of linen made from nettles, while the children swarmed here and there and everywhere in any costume that chance had given them.

Within, the greater souls alone were calm, and a man\u2019s worth was set down to a hair\u2019s breadth. Some were always to be found squatting on their door-steps cursing the hour which had seen them depart for this land; some wrestled and fought on the common, for a fist fight with a fair field and no favor was a favorite amusement of the backwoodsmen."}, {"size": 645, "text": "My big friend, Cowan, was the champion of these, and often of an evening the whole of the inhabitants would gather near the spring to see him fight those who had the courage to stand up to him.

Strangely enough, he never fought in anger, and was the first to the spring for a gourd of water after the fight was over.

Until Tom came, one only had been successful,--that lad of seventeen, whose achievements were the envy of my boyish soul, James Ray. He slept in the cabin next to Cowan\u2019s, and long before the dawn had revealed the forest line had been wont to steal out of the gates on the one scrawny horse the Indians had left them, gain the Salt River, and make his way thence through the water to some distant place where the listening savages could not hear his shot."}, {"size": 659, "text": "And now Tom took his turn.

I cleaned his gun, filled his powder flask, and ran to do his every bidding.

But their anger seemed to blaze most fiercely when they spoke of a mysterious British general named Hamilton, whom they called \u201cthe ha\u2019r buyer,\u201d and who from his stronghold in the north country across the great Ohio sent down these hordes of savages to harry us."}, {"size": 670, "text": "I learned to hate Hamilton with the rest, and pictured him with the visage of a fiend.

Clark told them first that they had been given a false and a wicked notion of the American cause, and he spoke of the tyranny of the English king, which had become past endurance to a free people.

It had neither glass in the window nor an attractive display of goods; it was merely a log cabin set down on a weedy, sun-baked plot. The stuffy smell of skins and furs came out of the doorway. Within, when he was in Kaskaskia, Monsieur Vigo was wont to sit behind his rough walnut table, writing with a fine quill, or dispensing the news of the villages to the priest and other prominent citizens, or haggling with persistent blanketed braves over canoe-loads of ill-smelling pelts which they brought down from the green forests of the north. Monsieur Vigo\u2019s clothes were the color of the tobacco he gave in exchange; his eyes were not unlike the black beads he traded, but shrewd and kindly withal, set in a square saffron face that had the contradiction of a small chin."}, {"size": 693, "text": "As the days wore into months, Monsieur Vigo\u2019s place very naturally became the headquarters for our army, if army it might be called.

A few braves usually stood like statues at the corner, and in front of the door another group of hunting shirts. Without was the paper money of the Continental Congress, within the good tafia and tobacco of Monsieur Vigo. One day Monsieur Vigo\u2019s young Creole clerk stood shrugging his shoulders in the doorway.

The sacrifice of the good priest had not been in vain, and he came back with the joyous news of a peaceful conquest. The stars and stripes now waved over the fort, and the French themselves had put it there. And the vast stretch of country from that place westward to the Father of Waters was now American."}, {"size": 669, "text": "And that brings me to the second oversight. The surprise and conquest of Cahokia by Bowman and his men was like that of Kaskaskia. And the French there were loyal, too, offering their militia for service in the place of those men of Bowman\u2019s company who would not re\u00ebnlist. These came to Kaskaskia to join our home-goers, and no sooner had the hundred marched out of the gate and taken up their way for Kentucky than Colonel Clark began the drilling of the new troops. Captain Leonard Helm was sent to take charge of Vincennes, and Captain Montgomery set out across the mountains for Williamsburg with letters praying the governor of Virginia to come to our assistance."}, {"size": 701, "text": "For another cloud had risen in the horizon: another problem for Clark to face of greater portent than all the others. A messenger from Captain Bowman at Cohos came riding down the street on a scraggly French pony, and pulled up before headquarters. The messenger was Sergeant Thomas McChesney, and his long legs almost reached the ground on either side of the little beast. Leaping from the saddle, he seized me in his arms, set me down, and bade me tell Colonel Clark of his arrival. It was a sultry August morning. Within the hour Colonel Clark and Tom and myself were riding over the dusty trace that wound westward across the common lands of the village, which was known as the Fort Chartres road."}, {"size": 669, "text": "The heat-haze shimmered in the distance, and there was no sound in plain or village save the tinkle of a cowbell from the clumps of shade. Colonel Clark rode twenty paces in front, alone, his head bowed with thinking. \u201cThey\u2019re coming into Cahokia as thick as bees out\u2019n a gum, Davy,\u201d said Tom; \u201cseems like there\u2019s thousands of \u2018em. Nothin\u2019 will do \u2018em but they must see the Colonel,--the varmints. And they\u2019ve got patience, they\u2019ll wait thar till the b\u2019ars git fat. I reckon they \u2018low Clark\u2019s got the armies of Congress behind him. If they knowed,\u201d said Tom, with a chuckle, \u201cif they knowed that we\u2019d only got seventy of the boys and some hundred Frenchies in the army!"}, {"size": 803, "text": "I reckon the Colonel\u2019s too cute for \u2018em.\u201d The savages in Cahokia were as the leaves of the forest. Curiosity, that mainspring of the Indian character, had brought the chiefs, big and little, to see with their own eyes the great Captain of the Long Knives. In vain had the faithful Bowman put them off. They would wait. Clark must come. And Clark was coming, for he was not the man to quail at such a crisis. For the crux of the whole matter was here. And if he failed to impress them with his power, with the might of the Congress for which he fought, no man of his would ever see Kentucky again. As we rode through the bottom under the pecan trees we talked of Polly Ann, Tom and I, and of our little home by the Salt River far to the southward, where we would live in peace when the campaign was over."}, {"size": 655, "text": "Tom had written her, painfully enough, an affectionate scrawl, which he sent by one of Captain Linn\u2019s men. And I, too, had written. My letter had been about Tom, and how he had become a sergeant, and what a favorite he was with Bowman and the Colonel. Poor Polly Ann! She could not write, but a runner from Harrodstown who was a friend of Tom\u2019s had carried all the way to Cahokia, in the pocket with his despatches, a fold of nettle-bark linen. Tom pulled it from the bosom of his hunting shirt to show me, and in it was a little ring of hair like unto the finest spun red-gold. This was the message Polly Ann had sent,--a message from little Tom as well."}, {"size": 694, "text": "At Prairie du Rocher, at St. Philippe, the inhabitants lined the streets to do homage to this man of strange power who rode, unattended and unafraid, to the council of the savage tribes which had terrorized his people of Kentucky. From the ramparts of Fort Chartres (once one of the mighty chain of strongholds to protect a new France, and now deserted like Massacre), I gazed for the first time in awe at the turgid flood of the Mississippi, and at the lands of the Spanish king beyond. With never ceasing fury the river tore at his clay banks and worried the green islands that braved his charge. And my boyish fancy pictured to itself the monsters which might lie hidden in his muddy depths."}, {"size": 766, "text": "We lay that night in the open at a spring on the bluffs, and the next morning beheld the church tower of Cahokia. A little way from the town we perceived an odd gathering on the road, the yellowed and weathered hunting shirts of Bowman\u2019s company mixed with the motley dress of the Creole volunteers. Some of these gentlemen wore the costume of coureurs du bois, others had odd regimental coats and hats which had seen much service. Besides the military was a sober deputation of citizens, and hovering behind the whole a horde of curious, blanketed braves, come to get a first glimpse of the great white captain. So escorted, we crossed at the mill, came to a shady street that faced the little river, and stopped at the stone house where Colonel Clark was to abide."}, {"size": 727, "text": "On that day, and for many days more, that street was thronged with warriors. Chiefs in gala dress strutted up and down, feathered and plumed and blanketed, smeared with paint, bedecked with rude jewellery,--earrings and bracelets. From the remote forests of the north they had come, where the cold winds blow off the blue lakes; from the prairies to the east; from the upper running waters, where the Mississippi flows clear and undefiled by the muddy flood; from the villages and wigwams of the sluggish Wabash; and from the sandy, piny country between the great northern seas where Michilimackinac stands guard alone,--Sacs and Foxes, Chippeways and Maumies and Missesogies, Puans and Pottawattomies, chiefs and medicine men."}, {"size": 743, "text": "Well might the sleep of the good citizens be disturbed, and the women fear to venture to the creek with their linen and their paddles! The lives of these people hung in truth upon a slender thing--the bearing of one man. All day long the great chiefs sought an audience with him, but he sent them word that matters would be settled in the council that was to come. All day long the warriors lined the picket fence in front of the house, and more than once Tom McChesney roughly shouldered a lane through them that timid visitors might pass. Like a pack of wolves, they watched narrowly for any sign of weakness. As for Tom, they were to him as so many dogs. \u201cYe varmints!\u201d he cried, \u201cI\u2019ll take a blizz\u2019rd at ye if ye don\u2019t keep the way clear.\u201d"}, {"size": 635, "text": "At that they would give back grudgingly with a chorus of grunts, only to close in again as tightly as before.

Then I was snatched up, bumped against heads and shoulders, and deposited somewhere. Now it was Tom\u2019s face that was close to mine, and the light of a fierce anger was in his blue eyes. \u201cDid they hurt ye, Davy?\u201d he asked.

And that day he found what his Colonel had long since learned to be true--that in courage is the greater safety.

He listened to the advice of Monsieur Gratiot and other Creole gentlemen of weight, to the Spanish officers who came in their regimentals from St. Louis out of curiosity to see how this man would treat with the tribes.

Around him were ringed the gathered tribes, each chief in the order of his importance squatted in the inner circle, their blankets making patches of bright color against the green.

Then for three days the chiefs spoke, and a man listened, unmoved. The sound of these orations, wild and fearful to my boyish ear, comes back to me now.

The North Wind and two others were easily singled out as the leaders, and were straightway escorted to the garrison house, their air of injured innocence availing them not a whit."}, {"size": 628, "text": "The militia was dismissed, and the village was hushed once more. But all night long the chiefs went to and fro, taking counsel among themselves. What would the Chief of the Pale Faces do? The morning came with a cloudy, damp dawning. Within a decent time (for the Indian is decorous) blanketed deputations filled the archways under the trees and waited there as the minutes ran into hours. The Chief of the Long Knives surveyed the morning from his door-step, and his eyes rested on a solemn figure at the gate. It was the Hungry Wolf. Sorrow was in his voice, and he bore messages from the twenty great chiefs who stood beyond."}, {"size": 615, "text": "They were come to express their abhorrence of the night\u2019s doings, of which they were as innocent as the deer of the forest. \u201cLet the Hungry Wolf tell the chiefs,\u201d said Colonel Clark, briefly, \u201cthat the council is the place for talk.\u201d And he went back into the house again. Then he bade me run to Captain Bowman with an order to bring the North Wind and his confederates to the council field in irons. The day followed the promise of the dawn. The clouds hung low, and now and again great drops struck the faces of the people in the field. And like the heavens, the assembly itself was charged with we knew not what."}, {"size": 669, "text": "Was it peace or war? As before, a white man sat with supreme indifference at a table, and in front of him three most unhappy chiefs squatted in the grass, the shame of their irons hidden under the blanket folds. Audacity is truly a part of the equipment of genius. To have rescued the North Wind and his friends would have been child\u2019s play; to have retired from the council with threats of war, as easy. And yet they craved pardon. One chief after another rose with dignity in the ring and came to the table to plead. An argument deserving mention was that the North Wind had desired to test the friendship of the French for the Big Knives,--set forth without a smile."}, {"size": 648, "text": "To all pleaders Colonel Clark shook his head. He, being a warrior, cared little whether such people were friends or foes. He held them in the hollow of his hand. And at length they came no more. The very clouds seemed to hang motionless when he rose to speak, and you who will may read in his memoir what he said. The Hungry Wolf caught the spirit of it, and was eloquent in his own tongue, and no word of it was lost. First he told them of the causes of war, of the thirteen council fires with the English, and in terms that the Indian mind might grasp, and how their old father, the French King, had joined the Big Knives in this righteous fight."}, {"size": 691, "text": "\u201cWarriors,\u201d said he, \u201chere is a bloody belt and a white one; take which you choose.

But, should it be the path of peace as brothers of the Big Knives and of their friends the French, and then you go to your homes and listen to the bad birds, you will then no longer deserve to be called men and warriors,--but creatures of two tongues, which ought to be destroyed. Let us then part this evening in the hope that the Great Spirit will bring us together again with the sun as brothers.\u201d So the council broke up."}, {"size": 608, "text": "White man and red went trooping into town, staring curiously at the guard which was leading the North Wind and his friends to another night of meditation.

It was the loom of many fires at Cahokia, and around them the chiefs of the forty tribes--all save the three in durance vile--were gathered in solemn talk. Would they take the bloody belt or the white one? No man cared so little as the Pale Face Chief."}, {"size": 618, "text": "When their eyes were turned from the fitful blaze of the logs, the gala light of many candles greeted them.

The man at whose bidding this merrymaking was held stood in a corner watching with folded arms, and none to look at him might know that he was playing for a stake. The troubled fires of the Indians had died to embers long before the candles were snuffed in the garrison house and the music ceased."}, {"size": 699, "text": "The sun himself was pleased to hail that last morning of the great council, and beamed with torrid tolerance upon the ceremony of kindling the greatest of the fires. On this morning Colonel Clark did not sit alone, but was surrounded by men of weight,--by Monsieur Gratiot and other citizens, Captain Bowman and the Spanish officers. And when at length the brush crackled and the flames caught the logs, three of the mightiest chiefs arose. The greatest, victor in fifty tribal wars, held in his hand the white belt of peace. The second bore a long-stemmed pipe with a huge bowl. And after him, with measured steps, a third came with a smoking censer,--the sacred fire with which to kindle the pipe."}, {"size": 633, "text": "Halting before Clark, he first swung the censer to the heavens, then to the earth, then to all the spirits of the air,--calling these to witness that peace was come at last,--and finally to the Chief of the Long Knives and to the gentlemen of dignity about his person. Next the Indian turned, and spoke to his brethren in measured, sonorous tones. He bade them thank that Great Spirit who had cleared the sky and opened their ears and hearts that they might receive the truth,--who had laid bare to their understanding the lies of the English. Even as these English had served the Big Knives, so might they one day serve the Indians."}, {"size": 712, "text": "Therefore he commanded them to cast the tomahawk into the river, and when they should return to their land to drive the evil birds from it. And they must send their wise men to Kaskaskia to hear the words of wisdom of the Great White Chief, Clark. He thanked the Great Spirit for this council fire which He had kindled at Cahokia. Lifting the bowl of the censer, in the eyes of all the people he drew in a long whiff to bear witness of peace. After him the pipe went the interminable rounds of the chiefs. Colonel Clark took it, and puffed; Captain Bowman puffed,--everybody puffed. \u201cDavy must have a pull,\u201d cried Tom; and even the chiefs smiled as I coughed and sputtered, while my friends roared with laughter."}, {"size": 871, "text": "It gave me no great notion of the fragrance of tobacco. And then came such a hand-shaking and grunting as a man rarely sees in a lifetime. There was but one disquieting question left: What was to become of the North Wind and his friends? None dared mention the matter at such a time. But at length, as the day wore on to afternoon, the Colonel was seen to speak quietly to Captain Bowman, and several backwoodsmen went off toward the town. And presently a silence fell on the company as they beheld the dejected three crossing the field with a guard. They were led before Clark, and when he saw them his face hardened to sternness. \u201cIt is only women who watch to catch a bear sleeping,\u201d he said. \u201cThe Big Knives do not kill women. I shall give you meat for your journey home, for women cannot hunt. If you remain here, you shall be treated as squaws. Set the women free.\u201d"}, {"size": 645, "text": "Tom McChesney cast off their irons. As for Clark, he began to talk immediately with Monsieur Gratiot, as though he had dismissed them from his mind. And their agitation was a pitiful thing to see. In vain they pressed about him, in vain they even pulled the fringe of his shirt to gain his attention. And then they went about among the other chiefs, but these dared not intercede. Uneasiness was written on every man\u2019s face, and the talk went haltingly. But Clark was serenity itself. At length with a supreme effort they plucked up courage to come again to the table, one holding out the belt of peace, and the other the still smouldering pipe."}, {"size": 760, "text": "Clark paused in his talk. He took the belt, and flung it away over the heads of those around him. He seized the pipe, and taking up his sword from the table drew it, and with one blow clave the stem in half. There was no anger in either act, but much deliberation. \u201cThe Big Knives,\u201d he said scornfully, \u201cdo not treat with women.\u201d The pleading began again, the Hungry Wolf interpreting with tremors of earnestness. Their lives were spared, but to what purpose, since the White Chief looked with disfavor upon them? Let him know that bad men from Michilimackinac put the deed into their hearts. \u201cWhen the Big Knives come upon such people in the wilderness,\u201d Clark answered, \u201cthey shoot them down that they may not eat the deer. But they have never talked of it.\u201d"}, {"size": 610, "text": "He turned from them once more; they went away in a dejection to wring our compassion, and we thought the matter ended at last. The sun was falling low, the people beginning to move away, when, to the astonishment of all, the culprits were seen coming back again. With them were two young men of their own nation. The Indians opened up a path for them to pass through, and they came as men go to the grave. So mournful, so impressive withal, that the crowd fell into silence again, and the Colonel turned his eyes. The two young men sank down on the ground before him and shrouded their heads in their blankets."}, {"size": 620, "text": "\u201cWhat is this?\u201d Clark demanded. The North Wind spoke in a voice of sorrow:-- \u201cAn atonement to the Great White Chief for the sins of our nation.

Still they stood irresolute, their minds now bereft of expedients. And the young men sat motionless on the ground. As Clark talked they peered out from under their blankets, once, twice, thrice. He was still talking to the wondering Monsieur Gratiot."}, {"size": 651, "text": "But no other voice was heard, and the eyes of all were turned on him in amazement.

Wonderful, fine-limbed men they were, and for the first time Clark\u2019s eyes were seen to kindle. \u201cI thank the Great Spirit,\u201d said he, in a loud voice, \u201cthat I have found men among your nation.

But Clark did not stop there. He presented them to Captain Bowman and to the French and Spanish gentlemen present, and they were hailed by their own kind as chiefs of their nation. To cap it all our troops, backwoodsmen and Creole militia, paraded in line on the common, and fired a salute in their honor. Thus did Clark gain the friendship of the forty tribes in the Northwest country."}, {"size": 652, "text": "CHAPTER XVIII. \u201cAN\u2019 YE HAD BEEN WHERE I HAD BEEN\u201d We went back to Kaskaskia, Colonel Clark, Tom, and myself, and a great weight was lifted from our hearts. A peaceful autumn passed, and we were happy save when we thought of those we had left at home. There is no space here to tell of many incidents. Great chiefs who had not been to the council came hundreds of leagues across wide rivers that they might see with their own eyes this man who had made peace without gold, and these had to be amused and entertained. The apples ripened, and were shaken to the ground by the winds. The good Father Gibault, true to his promise, strove to teach me French."}, {"size": 772, "text": "Indeed, I picked up much of that language in my intercourse with the inhabitants of Kaskaskia. How well I recall that simple life,--its dances, its songs, and the games with the laughing boys and girls on the common! And the good people were very kind to the orphan that dwelt with Colonel Clark, the drummer boy of his regiment. But winter brought forebodings. When the garden patches grew bare and brown, and the bleak winds from across the Mississippi swept over the common, untoward tidings came like water dripping from a roof, bit by bit. And day by day Colonel Clark looked graver. The messengers he had sent to Vincennes came not back, and the coureurs and traders from time to time brought rumors of a British force gathering like a thundercloud in the northeast."}, {"size": 890, "text": "Monsieur Vigo himself, who had gone to Vincennes on his own business, did not return. As for the inhabitants, some of them who had once bowed to us with a smile now passed with faces averted. The cold set the miry roads like cement, in ruts and ridges. A flurry of snow came and powdered the roofs even as the French loaves are powdered. It was January. There was Colonel Clark on a runt of an Indian pony; Tom McChesney on another, riding ahead, several French gentlemen seated on stools in a two-wheeled cart, and myself. We were going to Cahokia, and it was very cold, and when the tireless wheels bumped from ridge to gully, the gentlemen grabbed each other as they slid about, and laughed. All at once the merriment ceased, and looking forward we saw that Tom had leaped from his saddle and was bending over something in the snow. These chanced to be the footprints of some twenty men."}, {"size": 719, "text": "The immediate result of this alarming discovery was that Tom went on express to warn Captain Bowman, and the rest of us returned to a painful scene at Kaskaskia. We reached the village, the French gentlemen leaped down from their stools in the cart, and in ten minutes the streets were filled with frenzied, hooded figures. Hamilton, called the Hair Buyer, was upon them with no less than six hundred, and he would hang them to their own gateposts for listening to the Long Knives. These were but a handful after all was said. There was Father Gibault, for example. Father Gibault would doubtless be exposed to the crows in the belfry of his own church because he had busied himself at Vincennes and with other matters."}, {"size": 770, "text": "Father Gibault was human, and therefore lovable. He bade his parishioners a hasty and tearful farewell, and he made a cold and painful journey to the territories of his Spanish Majesty across the Mississippi.

In the fort the men stood to their guns, their faces flushed with staring at the burning houses. Only a few were burned,--enough to give no cover for Hamilton and his six hundred if they came. But they did not come. The faithful Bowman and his men arrived instead, with the news that there had been only a roving party of forty, and these were now in full retreat. Father Gibault came back. But where was Hamilton? This was the disquieting thing."}, {"size": 618, "text": "One bitter day, when the sun smiled mockingly on the powdered common, a horseman was perceived on the Fort Chartres road.

The Governor could do nothing now, but would move as soon as the rigors of winter had somewhat relented. Monsieur Vigo shook his head and shrugged his shoulders. He loved les Am\u00e9ricains.

There was no chance, then, of Hamilton moving at present? Monsieur Vigo threw up his hands. Never had he made such a trip, and he had been forced to come back by a northern route.

I leaned forward in my corner by the hickory fire. \u201cThen we will be fish,\u201d said Colonel Clark. \u201cBetter that than food for the crows. For, if we stay here, we shall be caught like bears in a trap, and Kentucky will be at Hamilton\u2019s mercy.\u201d \u201cSacr\u00e9!\u201d exclaimed Monsieur Vigo, \u201cyou are mad, mon ami.

They surrounded the Colonel. Pardieu, what was he to do now? For the British governor and his savages were coming to take revenge on them because, in their necessity, they had declared for Congress.

Monsieur Vigo, for instance, agreed to pay the expenses of the expedition, though in his heart he thought we should never get to Vincennes. Incidentally, he was never repaid.

Now hickory and maple, oak and cottonwood, stood shivering in three feet of water on what had been a league of dry land.

Choosing a great poplar, these he set to hollowing out a pirogue, and himself came among the others and played leap-frog and the Indian game of ball until night fell. And these, instead of moping and quarrelling, forgot. That night, as I cooked him a buffalo steak, he drew near the fire with Bowman. \u201cFor the love of God keep up their spirits, Bowman,\u201d said the Colonel; \u201ckeep up their spirits until we get them across.

Even now the pains shoot through my body when I think of how man after man plunged waist-deep into the icy water toward the farther branch.

Unfortunately, Mr. Willing brought no food. Next in order came five Frenchmen, trapped by our scouts, nor had they any provisions.

Nevertheless there was a kind of oratory to fit the case. To picture the misery of these men is well-nigh impossible.

He said more, and they cheered him. These are the bare facts.

In my day I have beheld great suffering and hardship, and none of it compared to this.

Another page--nay, a dozen--could be filled with Indian horrors, ambuscades and massacres. And also I might have told how there drifted into this land, hitherto unsoiled, the refuse cast off by the older colonies. I must add quickly that we got more than our share of their best stock along with this. No sooner had the sun begun to pit the snow hillocks than wild creatures came in from the mountains, haggard with hunger and hardship."}, {"size": 732, "text": "They had left their homes in Virginia and the Carolinas in the autumn; an unheralded winter of Arctic fierceness had caught them in its grip. Bitter tales they told of wives and children buried among the rocks. Fast on the heels of these wretched ones trooped the spring settlers in droves; and I have seen whole churches march singing into the forts, the preacher leading, and thanking God loudly that He had delivered them from the wilderness and the savage. The little forts would not hold them; and they went out to hew clearings from the forest, and to build cabins and stockades. And our own people, starved and snowbound, went out likewise,--Tom and Polly Ann and their little family and myself to the farm at the river-side."}, {"size": 750, "text": "And while the water flowed between the stumps over the black land, we planted and ploughed and prayed, always alert, watching north and south, against the coming of the Indians. But Tom was no husbandman. He and his kind were the scouts, the advance guard of civilization, not tillers of the soil or lovers of close communities. Farther and farther they went afield for game, and always they grumbled sorely against this horde which had driven the deer from his cover and the buffalo from his wallow. Looking back, I can recall one evening when the long summer twilight lingered to a close. Tom was lounging lazily against the big persimmon tree, smoking his pipe, the two children digging at the roots, and Polly Ann, seated on the door-log, sewing."}, {"size": 828, "text": "As I drew near, she looked up at me from her work.

For a month I had had the scheme in my mind, where the dam was to be put, the race, and the wondrous wheel rimmed with cow horns to dip the water. And fixed on the wheel there was to be a crank that worked the pounder in the mortar. So we were to grind until I could arrange with Mr. Scarlett, the new storekeeper in Harrodstown, to have two grinding-stones fetched across the mountains. While the corn ripened and the melons swelled and the flax flowered, our axes rang by the river\u2019s side; and sometimes, as we worked, Cowan and Terrell and McCann and other Long Hunters would come and jeer good-naturedly because we were turning civilized.

These he sold at great profit.

Keen-faced speculators bought acre upon acre and tract upon tract from the State, and crossed the mountains to extort. Claims conflicted, titles lapped.

To us it had an Old World, almost Oriental flavor of mystery and luxury and pleasure, and we imagined it swathed in the moisture of the Delta, built of quaint houses, with courts of shining orange trees and magnolias, and surrounded by flowering plantations of unimagined beauty. It was most fitting that such a place should be the seat of dark intrigues against material progress, and this notion lent added zest to my errand thither. As for Nick, it took no great sagacity on my part to predict that he would forget Suzanne and begin to look forward to the Creole beauties of the Mysterious City."}, {"size": 811, "text": "First, there was the fur-laden keel boat in which we travelled, gone forever now from Western navigation. It had its rude square sail to take advantage of the river winds, its mast strongly braced to hold the long tow-ropes.

Now we were light-manned, two half-breeds and two Canadians to handle the oars in time of peril, and Captain Xavier, who stood aft on the cabin roof, leaning against the heavy beam of the long, curved tiller, watching hawklike for snag and eddy and bar.

We awoke again as the moon was shrinking abashed before the light that glowed above these cliffs, and the river was turned from brown to gold and then to burnished copper, the forest to a thousand shades of green from crest to the banks where the river was licking the twisted roots to nakedness.

We stared down it, overwhelmed, until we had passed beyond its line. \u201cIt is as straight,\u201d said Nick, \u201cas straight as one of her Majesty\u2019s alleys I saw cut through the forest at Saint-Cloud.\u201d Had I space and time to give a faithful account of this journey it would be chiefly a tribute to Xavier\u2019s skill, for they who have not put themselves at the mercy of the Mississippi in a small craft can have no idea of the dangers of such a voyage. Infinite experience, a keen eye, a steady hand, and a nerve of iron are required."}, {"size": 675, "text": "Now, when the current swirled almost to a rapid, we grazed a rock by the width of a ripple; and again, despite the effort of Xavier and the crew, we would tear the limbs from a huge tree, which, had we hit it fair, would have ripped us from bow to stern. Once, indeed, we were fast on a sand-bar, whence (as Nick said) Xavier fairly cursed us off. We took care to moor at night, where we could be seen as little as possible from the river, and divided the watches lest we should be surprised by Indians. And, as we went southward, our hands and faces became blotched all over by the bites of mosquitoes and flies, and we smothered ourselves under blankets to get rid of them."}, {"size": 765, "text": "At times we fished, and one evening, after we had passed the expanse of water at the mouth of the Ohio, Nick pulled a hideous thing from the inscrutable yellow depths,--a slimy, scaleless catfish. He came up like a log, and must have weighed seventy pounds. Xavier and his men and myself made two good meals of him, but Nick would not touch the meat. The great river teemed with life. There were flocks of herons and cranes and water pelicans, and I know not what other birds, and as we slipped under the banks we often heard the paroquets chattering in the forests. And once, as we drifted into an inlet at sunset, we caught sight of the shaggy head of a bear above the brown water, and leaping down into the cabin I primed the rifle that stood there and shot him."}, {"size": 674, "text": "It took the seven of us to drag him on board, and then I cleaned and skinned him as Tom had taught me, and showed Jean how to put the caul fat and liver in rows on a skewer and wrap it in the bear\u2019s handkerchief and roast it before the fire. Nick found no difficulty in eating this--it was a dish fit for any gourmand. We passed the great, red Chickasaw Bluff, which sits facing westward looking over the limitless Louisiana forests, where new and wondrous vines and flowers grew, and came to the beautiful Walnut Hills crowned by a Spanish fort. We did not stop there to exchange courtesies, but pressed on to the Grand Gulf, the grave of many a keel boat before and since."}, {"size": 713, "text": "This was by far the most dangerous place on the Mississippi, and Xavier was never weary of recounting many perilous escapes there, or telling how such and such a priceless cargo had sunk in the mud by reason of the lack of skill of particular boatmen he knew of. And indeed, the Canadian\u2019s face assumed a graver mien after the Walnut Hills were behind us. \u201cYou laugh, Michi\u00e9,\u201d he said to Nick, a little resentfully. \u201cI who speak to you say that there is four foot on each side of ze bateau. Too much tafia, a little too much excite--\u201d and he made a gesture with his hand expressive of total destruction; \u201cze tornado, I would sooner have him--\u201d \u201cBah!\u201d said Nick, stroking Xavier\u2019s black beard, \u201cgive me the tiller."}, {"size": 708, "text": "I will see you through safely, and we will not spare the tafia either.\u201d And he began to sing a song of Xavier\u2019s own:-- \u201c\u2018Marianson, dame jolie, O\u00f9 est all\u00e9 votre mari?\u2019\u201d \u201cAh, toujours les dames!\u201d said Xavier. \u201cBut I tell you, Michi\u00e9, le diable,--he is at ze bottom of ze Grand Gulf and his mouth open--so.\u201d And he suited the action to the word. At night we tied up under the shore within earshot of the mutter of the place, and twice that night I awoke with clinched hands from a dream of being spun fiercely against the rock of which Xavier had told, and sucked into the devil\u2019s mouth under the water. Dawn came as I was fighting the mosquitoes,--a still, sultry dawn with thunder muttering in the distance."}, {"size": 734, "text": "We breakfasted in silence, and with the crew standing ready at the oars and Xavier scanning the wide expanse of waters ahead, seeking for that unmarked point whence to embark on this perilous journey, we floated down the stream. The prospect was sufficiently disquieting on that murky day. Below us, on the one hand, a rocky bluff reached out into the river, and on the far side was a timber-clad point round which the Mississippi doubled and flowed back on itself. It needed no trained eye to guess at the perils of the place. On the one side the mighty current charged against the bluff and, furious at the obstacle, lashed itself into a hundred sucks and whirls, their course marked by the flotsam plundered from the forests above."}, {"size": 701, "text": "Woe betide the boat that got into this devil\u2019s caldron! And on the other side, near the timbered point, ran a counter current marked by forest wreckage flowing up-stream. To venture too far on this side was to be grounded or at least to be sent back to embark once more on the trial. But where was the channel? We watched Xavier with bated breath. Not once did he take his eyes from the swirling water ahead, but gave the tiller a touch from time to time, now right, now left, and called in a monotone for the port or starboard oars. Nearer and nearer we sped, dodging the snags, until the water boiled around us, and suddenly the boat shot forward as in a mill-race, and we clutched the cabin\u2019s roof."}, {"size": 826, "text": "A triumphant gleam was in Xavier\u2019s eyes, for he had hit the channel squarely. And then, like a monster out of the deep, the scaly, black back of a great northern pine was flung up beside us and sheered us across the channel until we were at the very edge of the foam-specked, spinning water. But Xavier saw it, and quick as lightning brought his helm over and laughed as he heard it crunching along our keel. And so we came swiftly around the bend and into safety once more. The next day there was the Petite Gulf, which bothered Xavier very little, and the day after that we came in sight of Natchez on her heights and guided our boat in amongst the others that lined the shore, scowled at by lounging Indians there, and eyed suspiciously by a hatchet-faced Spaniard in a tawdry uniform who represented his Majesty\u2019s customs."}, {"size": 845, "text": "Here we stopped for a day and a night that Xavier and his crew might get properly drunk on tafia, while Nick and I walked about the town and waited until his Excellency, the commandant, had finished dinner that we might present our letters and obtain his passport. Natchez at that date was a sufficiently unkempt and evil place of dirty, ramshackle houses and gambling dens, where men of the four nations gamed and quarrelled and fought. We were glad enough to get away the following morning, Xavier somewhat saddened by the loss of thirty livres of which he had no memory, and Nick and myself relieved at having the passports in our pockets.

The rivers now flowed out of, and not into the Mississippi, and Xavier called them bayous, and often it took much skill and foresight on his part not to be shot into the lane they made in the dark forest of an evening. And the forest,--it seemed an impenetrable mystery, a strange tangle of fantastic growths: the live-oak (ch\u00eane vert), its wide-spreading limbs hung funereally with Spanish moss and twined in the mistletoe\u2019s death embrace; the dark cypress swamp with the conelike knees above the yellow back-waters; and here and there grew the bridelike magnolia which we had known in Kentucky, wafting its perfume over the waters, and wondrous flowers"}, {"size": 731, "text": "and vines and trees with French names that bring back the scene to me even now with a whiff of romance, bois d\u2019arc, lilac, grande volaille (water-lily). Birds flew hither and thither (the names of every one of which Xavier knew),--the whistling papabot, the mournful bittern (garde-soleil), and the night-heron (grosbeck), who stood like a sentinel on the points. One night I awoke with the sweat starting from my brow, trying to collect my senses, and I lay on my blanket listening to such plaintive and heart-rending cries as I had never known. Human cries they were, cries as of children in distress, and I rose to a sitting posture on the deck with my hair standing up straight, to discover Nick beside me in the same position."}, {"size": 611, "text": "\u201cGod have mercy on us,\u201d I heard him mutter, \u201cwhat\u2019s that?

We lay in a swampy little inlet, and the forest wall made a dark blur against the star-studded sky. There was a splash near the boat that made me clutch my legs, the wails ceased and began again with redoubled intensity. Nick and I leaped to our feet and stood staring, horrified, over the gunwale into the black water. Presently there was a laugh behind us, and we saw Xavier resting on his elbow."}, {"size": 730, "text": "\u201cWhat devil-haunted place is this?\u201d demanded Nick. \u201cHa, ha,\u201d said Xavier, shaking with unseemly mirth, \u201cyou have never heard ze alligator sing, Michi\u00e9?\u201d \u201cAlligator!\u201d cried Nick; \u201cthere are babies in the water, I tell you.\u201d \u201cHa, ha,\u201d laughed Xavier, flinging off his blanket and searching for his flint and tinder. He lighted a pine knot, and in the red pulsing flare we saw what seemed to be a dozen black logs floating on the surface. And then Xavier flung the cresset at them, fire and all. There was a lashing, a frightful howl from one of the logs, and the night\u2019s silence once more. Often after that our slumbers were disturbed, and we would rise with maledictions in our mouths to fling the handiest thing at the serenaders."}, {"size": 615, "text": "When we arose in the morning we would often see them by the dozens, basking in the shallows, with their wide mouths flapped open waiting for their prey. Sometimes we ran upon them in the water, where they looked like the rough-bark pine logs from the North, and Nick would have a shot at them. When he hit one fairly there would be a leviathan-like roar and a churning of the river into suds. At length there were signs that we were drifting out of the wilderness, and one morning we came in sight of a rich plantation with its dark orange trees and fields of indigo, with its wide-galleried manor-house in a grove."}, {"size": 633, "text": "And as we drifted we heard the negroes chanting at their work, the plaintive cadence of the strange song adding to the mystery of the scene. Here in truth was a new world, a land of peaceful customs, green and moist. The soft-toned bells of it seemed an expression of its life,--so far removed from our own striving and fighting existence in Kentucky. Here and there, between plantations, a belfry could be seen above the cluster of the little white village planted in the green; and when we went ashore amongst these simple French people they treated us with such gentle civility and kindness that we would fain have lingered there."}, {"size": 286, "text": "The river had become a vast yellow lake, and often as we drifted of an evening the wail of a slave dance and monotonous beating of a tom-tom would float to us over the water. At last, late one afternoon, we came in sight of that strange city which had filled our thoughts for many days."}, {"size": 718, "text": "CHAPTER XI. THE STRANGE CITYNick and I stood by the mast on the forward part of the cabin, staring at the distant, low-lying city, while Xavier sought for the entrance to the eddy which here runs along the shore. If you did not gain this entrance,--so he explained,--you were carried by a swift current below New Orleans and might by no means get back save by the hiring of a crew. Xavier, however, was not to be caught thus, and presently we were gliding quietly along the eastern bank, or levee, which held back the river from the lowlands. Then, as we looked, the levee became an esplanade shaded by rows of willows, and through them we caught sight of the upper galleries and low, curving roofs of the city itself."}, {"size": 690, "text": "There, cried Xavier, was the Governor\u2019s house on the corner, where the great Miro lived, and beyond it the house of the Intendant; and then, gliding into an open space between the keel boats along the bank, stared at by a score of boatmen and idlers from above, we came to the end of our long journey. No sooner had we made fast than we were boarded by a shabby customs officer who, when he had seen our passports, bowed politely and invited us to land. We leaped ashore, gained the gravelled walk on the levee, and looked about us. Squalidity first met our eyes. Below us, crowded between the levee and the row of houses, were dozens of squalid market-stalls tended by cotton-clad negroes."}, {"size": 722, "text": "Beyond, across the bare Place d\u2019Armes, a blackened gap in the line of houses bore witness to the devastation of the year gone by, while here and there a roof, struck by the setting sun, gleamed fiery red with its new tiles.

The narrow, muddy streets ran with filth, and on each side along the houses was a sun-baked walk held up by the curved sides of broken flatboats, where two men might scarcely pass. The houses, too, had an odd and foreign look, some of wood, some of upright logs and plaster, and newer ones, Spanish in style, of adobe, with curving roofs of red tiles and strong eaves spreading over the banquette (as the sidewalk was called), casting shadows on lemon-colored walls."}, {"size": 622, "text": "Since New Orleans was in a swamp, the older houses for the most part were lifted some seven feet above the ground, and many of these houses had wide galleries on the street side. Here and there a shop was set in the wall; a watchmaker was to be seen poring over his work at a tiny window, a shoemaker cross-legged on the floor. Again, at an open wicket, we caught a glimpse through a cool archway into a flowering court-yard. Stalwart negresses with bright kerchiefs made way for us on the banquette. Hands on hips, they swung along erect, with baskets of cakes and sweetmeats on their heads, musically crying their wares."}, {"size": 662, "text": "At length, turning a corner, we came to a white wooden house on the Rue Royale, with a flight of steps leading up to the entrance. In place of a door a flimsy curtain hung in the doorway, and, pushing this aside, we followed Xavier through a darkened hall to a wide gallery that overlooked a court-yard. This court-yard was shaded by several great trees which grew there; the house and gallery ran down one other side of it; and the two remaining sides were made up of a series of low cabins, these forming the various outhouses and the kitchen. At the far end of this gallery a sallow, buxom lady sat sewing at a table, and Xavier saluted her very respectfully."}, {"size": 654, "text": "\u201cMadame,\u201d he said, \u201cI have brought you from St. Louis with Michi\u00e9 Gratiot\u2019s compliments two young American gentlemen, who are travelling to amuse themselves.\u201d The lady rose and beamed upon us. \u201cFrom Monsieur Gratiot,\u201d she said; \u201cyou are very welcome, gentlemen, to such poor accommodations as I have. It is not unusual to have American gentlemen in New Orleans, for many come here first and last. And I am happy to say that two of my best rooms are vacant. Zoey!\u201d There was a shrill answer from the court below, and a negro girl in a yellow turban came running up, while Madame Bouvet bustled along the gallery and opened the doors of two darkened rooms."}, {"size": 693, "text": "Within I could dimly see a walnut dresser, a chair, and a walnut bed on which was spread a mosquito bar. \u201cVoil\u00e1!

No siesta!\u201d cried Madame, eying us aghast; \u201cah, the Americans they never rest--never.\u201d We bade farewell to the good Xavier, promising to see him soon; and Nick, shouting to Benjy to open the saddle-bags, proceeded to array himself in the clothes which had made so much havoc at St. Louis. I boded no good from this proceeding, but I reflected, as I watched him dress, that I might as well try to turn the Mississippi from its course as to attempt to keep my cousin from the search for gallant adventure."}, {"size": 869, "text": "And I reflected that his indulgence in pleasure-seeking would serve the more to divert any suspicions which might fall upon my own head. At last, when the setting sun was flooding the court-yard, he stood arrayed upon the gallery, ready to venture forth to conquest. Madame Bouvet\u2019s tavern, or hotel, or whatever she was pleased to call it, was not immaculately clean. Before passing into the street we stood for a moment looking into the public room on the left of the hallway, a long saloon, evidently used in the early afternoon for a dining room, and at the back of it a wide, many-paned window, capped by a Spanish arch, looked out on the gallery. Near this window was a gay party of young men engaged at cards, waited on by the yellow-turbaned Zoey, and drinking what evidently was claret punch. The sounds of their jests and laughter pursued us out of the house."}, {"size": 822, "text": "The town was waking from its siesta, the streets filling, and people stopped to stare at Nick as we passed. But Nick, who was plainly in search of something he did not find, hurried on. We soon came to the quarter which had suffered most from the fire, where new houses had gone up or were in the building beside the blackened logs of many of Bienville\u2019s time. Then we came to a high white wall that surrounded a large garden, and within it was a long, massive building of some beauty and pretension, with a high, latticed belfry and heavy walls and with arched dormers in the sloping roof. As we stood staring at it through the iron grille set in the archway of the lodge, Nick declared that it put him in mind of some of the ch\u00e2teaux he had seen in France, and he crossed the street to get a better view of the premises."}, {"size": 743, "text": "An old man in coarse blue linen came out of the lodge and spoke to me. \u201cIt is the convent of the good nuns, the Ursulines, Monsieur,\u201d he said in French, \u201cand it was built long ago in the Sieur de Bienville\u2019s time, when the colony was young. For forty-five years, Monsieur, the young ladies of the city have come here to be educated.\u201d \u201cWhat does he say?\u201d demanded Nick, pricking up his ears as he came across the street. \u201cThat young men have been sent to the mines of Brazil for climbing the walls,\u201d I answered. \u201cWho wants to climb the walls?\u201d said Nick, disgusted. \u201cThe young ladies of the town go to school here,\u201d I answered; \u201cit is a convent.\u201d \u201cIt might serve to pass the time,\u201d said Nick, gazing with a new interest at the latticed windows."}, {"size": 691, "text": "\u201cHow much would you take, my friend, to let us in at the back way this evening?\u201d he demanded of the porter in French. The good man gasped, lifted his hands in horror, and straightway let loose upon Nick a torrent of French invectives that had not the least effect except to cause a blacksmith\u2019s apprentice and two negroes to stop and stare at us. \u201cPooh!\u201d exclaimed Nick, when the man had paused for want of breath, \u201cit is no trick to get over that wall.\u201d \u201cBon Dieu!\u201d cried the porter, \u201cyou are Kentuckians, yes?

Then we went away, Nick following the convent wall down to the river. Turning southward under the bank past the huddle of market-stalls, we came suddenly upon a sight that made us pause and wonder. New Orleans was awake. A gay and laughing throng paced the esplanade on the levee under the willows, with here and there a cavalier on horseback on the Royal Road below."}, {"size": 612, "text": "Across the Place d\u2019Armes the spire of the parish church stood against the fading sky, and to the westward the mighty river stretched away like a gilded floor.

Some occasion (so Madame Bouvet had told us) had brought a sprinkling of fashion to town that day, and it was a fashion to astonish me. There were fine gentlemen with swords and silk waistcoats and silver shoe-buckles, and ladies in filmy summer gowns. Greuze ruled the mode in France then, but New Orleans had not got beyond Watteau. As for Nick and me, we knew nothing of Greuze and Watteau then, and we could only stare in astonishment. And for once we saw an officer of the Louisiana Regiment resplendent in a uniform that might have served at court. Ay, and there was yet another sort."}, {"size": 892, "text": "Every flatboatman who returned to Kentucky was full of tales of the marvellous beauty of the quadroons and octoroons, stories which I had taken with a grain of salt; but they had not indeed been greatly overdrawn.

Their faces were like old ivory, their dress the stern Miro himself could scarce repress. In former times they had been lavish in their finery, and even now earrings still gleamed and color broke out irrepressibly. Nick was delighted, but he had not dragged me twice the length of the esplanade ere his eye was caught by a young lady in pink who sauntered between an elderly gentleman in black silk and a young man more gayly dressed. \u201cEgad,\u201d said Nick, \u201cthere is my divinity, and I need not look a step farther.\u201d"}, {"size": 658, "text": "\u201cYou have but to choose, I suppose, and all falls your way,\u201d I answered. \u201cBut look!\u201d he cried, halting me to stare after the girl, \u201cwhat a face, and what a form!

Twilight had set in strongly, the gay crowd was beginning to disperse, and in the distance the three figures could be seen making their way across the Place d\u2019Armes, the girl hanging on the elderly gentleman\u2019s arm, and the young man following with seeming sullenness behind. They turned into one of the narrower streets, and we quickened our steps.

But presently I began to reflect upon the consequences of being taken in such a situation by a constable and dragged into the light of a public examination.

The lady in the miniature might have been eighteen, or thirty-five. Her features were of the clearest cut, the nose the least trifle aquiline, and by a blurred outline the painter had given to the black hair piled high upon the head a suggestion of waviness.

Washed by her light, the quaintly wrought balconies and heavy-tiled roofs of the Spanish buildings, risen from the charred embers, took on a touch of romance. I paused once with a twinge of remembrance before the long line of the Ursuline convent, with its latticed belfry against the sky. There was the lodge, with its iron gates shut, and the wall which Nick had threatened to climb. As I passed the great square of the new barracks, a sereno (so the night watchmen were called) was crying the hour.

And yet I could have taken oath that the square, diminutive figure, with the head set forward on the shoulders, was Gignoux\u2019s. If this man were not Gignoux, then the Lord had cast two in a strange mould. And what was Gignoux doing in New Orleans?

It was a small note.

Hers was the dignity that comes from unselfish service, the calm that is far from resignation, though the black veil caught up on her chapeau de paille gave her the air of a Sister of Mercy.

There was a sentry standing under a crape-myrtle where the Royal Road ran through the gateway. Behind him was a diminutive five-sided brick fort with a dozen little cannon on top of it. The sentry came forward, brought his musket to a salute, and halted before my horse. \u201cYou will have to show your passport,\u201d murmured Madame la Vicomtesse.

The forest pools were cracked and dry, the Spanish moss was a haggard gray, and under the sun was the haze which covered the land like a saffron mantle. At times a listlessness came over me such as I had never known, to make me forget the presence of the women at my side, the very errand on which we rode.

I can see St. Gr\u00e9 now,\u201d said the Vicomtesse, \u201cthe thatched houses of the little village on either side of the high-road, the honest, red-faced peasants courtesying in their doorways at our berline, the brick wall of the park, the iron gates beside the lodge, the long avenue of poplars, the deer feeding in the beechwood, the bridge over the shining stream and the long, weather-beaten ch\u00e2teau beyond it."}, {"size": 302, "text": "Paris and the muttering of the storm were far away.

I thought it my duty. I was at Versailles that terrible summer when the States General met, when the National Assembly grew out of it, when the Bastille was stormed, when the King was throwing away his prerogatives like confetti. Never did the gardens of the Trianon seem more beautiful, or more sad. Sometimes the Queen would laugh even then when I mimicked Bailly, Des Moulins, Mirabeau. I was with her Majesty in the gardens on that dark, rainy day when the fishwomen came to Versailles. The memory of that night will haunt me as long as I live. The wind howled, the rain lashed with fury against the windows, the mob tore through the streets of the town, sacked the wine-shops, built great fires at the corners."}, {"size": 642, "text": "Before the day dawned again the furies had broken into the palace and murdered what was left of the Guard.

At that moment she seemed more distant to me than ever before."}, {"size": 652, "text": "She rose, went into the house, and left me thinking of the presumptions of the hopes I had dared to entertain, left me picturing sadly the existence of which she had spoken. Why had she told me of it? Perchance she had thought to do me a kindness! She came back to me--I had not thought she would. She sat down with her embroidery in her lap, and for some moments busied herself with it in silence. Then she said, without looking up:-- \u201cI do not know why I have tired you with this, why I have saddened myself. It is past and gone.\u201d \u201cI was not tired, Madame.

No, don\u2019t tell me about Colonel Clark--at least not until you come to him. Begin at the beginning, at the cabin in the mountains.\u201d \u201cYou want the whole of it!\u201d I exclaimed.

I cannot say that I ever forgot she was listening, but I lost myself in the narrative. It presented to me, for the first time, many aspects that I had not thought of. For instance, that I should be here now in Louisiana telling it to one who had been the companion and friend of the Queen of France. Once in a while the Vicomtesse would look up at me swiftly, when I paused, and then go on with her work again.

Her fingers still stitched, her head was bent and I could not see her face,--only the knot of her hair coiled with an art that struck me suddenly. Then she spoke, and her voice was very low. \u201cI love Polly Ann,\u201d she said; \u201cI should like to know her.\u201d \u201cI wish that you could know her,\u201d I answered, quickening."}, {"size": 625, "text": "She raised her head, and looked at me with an expression that was not a smile.

I can scarcely realize that you have seen all this, have done all this, have felt all this. You are a lawyer, a man of affairs, and yet you could guide me over the hidden paths of half a continent.

I would have got to my feet had she not come to me swiftly, that I might not rise. She stood above me, I lifted up my arms; she bent to me with a movement that conferred a priceless thing. \u201cDavid,\u201d she said, \u201ccould you not tell that I loved you, that you were he who has been in my mind for so many years, and in my heart since I saw you?\u201d \u201cI could not tell,\u201d I said."}, {"size": 708, "text": "\u201cI dared not think it.

CHAPTER XV. AN EPISODE IN THE LIFE OF A MANOut of the blood and ashes of France a Man had arisen who moved real kings and queens on his chess-board--which was a large part of the world."}, {"size": 651, "text": "The Man was Napoleon Buonaparte, at present, for lack of a better name, First Consul of the French Republic. The Man\u2019s eye, sweeping the world for a new plaything, had rested upon one which had excited the fancy of lesser adventurers, of one John Law, for instance. It was a large, unwieldy plaything indeed, and remote. It was nothing less than that vast and mysterious country which lay beyond the monster yellow River of the Wilderness, the country bordered on the south by the Gulf swamps, on the north by no man knew what forests,--as dark as those the Romans found in Gaul,--on the west by a line which other generations might be left to settle."}, {"size": 678, "text": "This land was Louisiana. A future king of France, while an \u00e9migr\u00e9, had been to Louisiana. This is merely an interesting fact worth noting. It was not interesting to Napoleon. Napoleon, by dint of certain screws which he tightened on his Catholic Majesty, King Charles of Spain, in the Treaty of San Ildefonso on the 1st of October, 1800, got his plaything. Louisiana was French again,--whatever French was in those days. The treaty was a profound secret. But secrets leak out, even the profoundest; and this was wafted across the English Channel to the ears of Mr. Rufus King, American Minister at London, who wrote of it to one Thomas Jefferson, President of the United States."}, {"size": 626, "text": "Mr. Jefferson was interested, not to say alarmed. Mr. Robert Livingston was about to depart on his mission from the little Republic of America to the great Republic of France. Mr. Livingston was told not to make himself disagreeable, but to protest. If Spain was to give up the plaything, the Youngest Child among the Nations ought to have it. It lay at her doors, it was necessary for her growth. Mr. Livingston arrived in France to find that Louisiana was a mere pawn on the chess-board, the Republic he represented little more. He protested, and the great Talleyrand shrugged his shoulders. What was Monsieur talking about?"}, {"size": 605, "text": "A treaty. What treaty? A treaty with Spain ceding back Louisiana to France after forty years. Who said there was such a treaty? Did Monsieur take snuff? Would Monsieur call again when the Minister was less busy? Monsieur did call again, taking care not to make himself disagreeable. He was offered snuff. He called again, pleasantly. He was offered snuff. He called again. The great Talleyrand laughed. He was always so happy to see Monsieur when he (Talleyrand) was not busy. He would give Monsieur a certificate of importunity. He had quite forgotten what Monsieur was talking about on former occasions."}, {"size": 722, "text": "Oh, yes, a treaty. Well, suppose there was such a treaty, what then? What then? Mr. Livingston, the agreeable but importunate, went home and wrote a memorial, and was presently assured that the inaccessible Man who was called First Consul had read it with interest--great interest. Mr. Livingston did not cease to indulge in his enjoyable visits to Talleyrand--not he. But in the intervals he sat down to think. What did the inaccessible Man himself have in his mind? The Man had been considering the Anglo-Saxon race, and in particular that portion of it which inhabited the Western Hemisphere. He perceived that they were a quarrelsome people, which possessed the lust for land and conquest like the rest of their blood."}, {"size": 608, "text": "He saw with astonishment something that had happened, something that they had done. Unperceived by the world, in five and twenty years they had swept across a thousand miles of mountain and forest wilderness in ever increasing thousands, had beaten the fiercest of savage tribes before them, stolidly unmindful of their dead. They had come at length to the great yellow River, and finding it closed had cried aloud in their anger. What was beyond it to stop them? Spain, with a handful of subjects inherited from the France of Louis the Fifteenth. Could Spain stop them? No. But he, the Man, would stop them."}, {"size": 669, "text": "He would raise up in Louisiana as a monument to himself a daughter of France to curb their ambition. America should not be all Anglo-Saxon. Already the Americans had compelled Spain to open the River. How long before they would overrun Louisiana itself, until a Frenchman or a Spaniard could scarce be found in the land? Sadly, in accordance with the treaty which Monsieur Talleyrand had known nothing about, his Catholic Majesty instructed his Intendant at New Orleans to make ready to deliver Louisiana to the French Commission. That was in July, 1802. This was not exactly an order to close the River again--in fact, his Majesty said nothing about closing the River."}, {"size": 625, "text": "Mark the reasoning of the Spanish mind. The Intendant closed the River as his plain duty. And Kentucky and Tennessee, wayward, belligerent infants who had outgrown their swaddling clothes, were heard from again. The Nation had learned to listen to them. The Nation was very angry. Mr. Hamilton and the Federalists and many others would have gone to war and seized the Floridas. Mr. Jefferson said, \u201cWait and see what his Catholic Majesty has to say.\u201d Mr. Jefferson was a man of great wisdom, albeit he had mistaken Jacobinism for something else when he was younger. And he knew that Napoleon could not play chess in the wind."}, {"size": 842, "text": "The wind was rising. Mr. Livingston was a patriot, able, importunate, but getting on in years and a little hard of hearing. Importunity without an Army and a Navy behind it is not effective--especially when there is no wind. But Mr. Jefferson heard the wind rising, and he sent Mr. Monroe to Mr. Livingston\u2019s aid. Mr. Monroe was young, witty, lively, popular with people he met. He, too, heard the wind rising, and so now did Mr. Livingston. The ships containing the advance guard of the colonists destined for the new Louisiana lay in the roads at Dunkirk, their anchors ready to weigh,--three thousand men, three thousand horses, for the Man did things on a large scale. The anchors were not weighed. His Catholic Majesty sent word from Spain to Mr. Jefferson that he was sorry his Intendant had been so foolish. The River was opened again."}, {"size": 694, "text": "The Treaty of Amiens was a poor wind-shield. It blew down, and the chessmen began to totter. One George of England, noted for his frugal table and his quarrelsome disposition, who had previously fought with France, began to call the Man names. The Man called George names, and sat down to think quickly. George could not be said to be on the best of terms with his American relations, but the Anglo-Saxon is unsentimental, phlegmatic, setting money and trade and lands above ideals. George meant to go to war again. Napoleon also meant to go to war again. But George meant to go to war again right away, which was inconvenient and inconsiderate, for Napoleon had not finished his game of chess."}, {"size": 636, "text": "The obvious outcome of the situation was that George with his Navy would get Louisiana, or else help his relations to get it. In either case Louisiana would become Anglo-Saxon. This was the wind which Mr. Jefferson had heard. The Man, being a genius who let go gracefully when he had to, decided between two bad bargains. He would sell Louisiana to the Americans as a favor; they would be very, very grateful, and they would go on hating George. Moreover, he would have all the more money with which to fight George. The inaccessible Man suddenly became accessible. Nay, he became gracious, smiling, full of loving-kindness, charitable."}, {"size": 604, "text": "Certain dickerings followed by a bargain passed between the American Minister and Monsieur Barb\u00e9-Marbois. Then Mr. Livingston and Mr. Monroe dined with the hitherto inaccessible. And the Man, after the manner of Continental Personages, asked questions. Frederick the Great has started this fashion, and many have imitated it. Louisiana became American at last. Whether by destiny or chance, whether by the wisdom of Jefferson or the necessity of Napoleon, who can say? It seems to me, David Ritchie, writing many years after the closing words of the last chapter were penned, that it was ours inevitably."}, {"size": 651, "text": "For I have seen and known and loved the people with all their crudities and faults, whose inheritance it was by right of toil and suffering and blood. And I, David Ritchie, saw the flags of three nations waving over it in the space of two days. And it came to pass in this wise. Rumors of these things which I have told above had filled Kentucky from time to time, and in November of 1803 there came across the mountains the news that the Senate of the United States had ratified the treaty between our ministers and Napoleon. I will not mention here what my life had become, what my fortune, save to say that both had been far beyond my expectations."}, {"size": 651, "text": "In worldly goods and honors, in the respect and esteem of my fellow-men, I had been happy indeed. But I had been blessed above other men by one whose power it was to lift me above the mean and sordid things of this world. Many times in the pursuit of my affairs I journeyed over that country which I had known when it belonged to the Indian and the deer and the elk and the wolf and the buffalo. Often did she ride by my side, making light of the hardships which, indeed, were no hardships to her, wondering at the settlements which had sprung up like magic in the wilderness, which were the heralds of the greatness of the Republic,--her country now."}, {"size": 632, "text": "So, in the bright and boisterous March weather of the year 1804, we found ourselves riding together along the way made memorable by the footsteps of Clark and his backwoodsmen. For I had an errand in St. Louis with Colonel Chouteau. A subtle change had come upon Kaskaskia with the new blood which was flowing into it: we passed Cahokia, full of memories to the drummer boy whom she loved. There was the church, the garrison, the stream, and the little house where my Colonel and I had lived together. She must see them all, she must hear the story from my lips again; and the telling of it to her gave it a new fire and a new life."}, {"size": 656, "text": "At evening, when the March wind had torn the cotton clouds to shreds, we stood on the Mississippi\u2019s bank, gazing at the western shore, at Louisiana. The low, forest-clad hills made a black band against the sky, and above the band hung the sun, a red ball. He was setting, and man might look upon his face without fear. The sight of the waters of that river stirred me to think of many things. What had God in store for the vast land out of which the waters flowed? Had He, indeed, saved it for a People, a People to be drawn from all nations, from all classes? Was the principle of the Republic to prevail and spread and change the complexion of the world?"}, {"size": 619, "text": "Or were the lusts of greed and power to increase until in the end they had swallowed the leaven? Who could say? What man of those who, soberly, had put his hand to the Paper which declared the opportunities of generations to come, could measure the Force which he had helped to set in motion. We crossed the river to the village where I had been so kindly received many years ago--to St. Louis. The place was little changed. The wind was stilled, the blue wood smoke curled lazily from the wide stone chimneys of the houses nestling against the hill. The afterglow was fading into night; lights twinkled in the windows."}, {"size": 812, "text": "Followed by our servants we climbed the bank, H\u00e9l\u00e8ne and I, and walked the quiet streets bordered by palings. The evening was chill. We passed a bright cabaret from which came the sound of many voices; in the blacksmith\u2019s shop another group was gathered, and we saw faces eager in the red light. They were talking of the Cession. We passed that place where Nick had stopped Suzanne in the cart, and laughed at the remembrance. We came to Monsieur Gratiot\u2019s, for he had bidden us to stay with him. And with Madame he gave us a welcome to warm our hearts after our journey. \u201cDavid,\u201d he said, \u201cI have seen many strange things happen in my life, but the strangest of all is that Clark\u2019s drummer boy should have married a Vicomtesse of the old r\u00e9gime.\u201d And she was ever Madame la Vicomtesse to our good friends in St."}, {"size": 671, "text": "Louis, for she was a woman to whom a title came as by nature\u2019s right. \u201cAnd you are about to behold another strange thing, David,\u201d Monsieur Gratiot continued. \u201cTo-day you are on French territory.\u201d \u201cFrench territory!\u201d I exclaimed. \u201cTo-day Upper Louisiana is French,\u201d he answered. \u201cTo-morrow it will be American forever. This morning Captain Stoddard of the United States Army, empowered to act as a Commissioner of the French Republic, arrived with Captain Lewis and a guard of American troops. Today, at noon, the flag of Spain was lowered from the staff at the headquarters. To-night a guard of honor watches with the French Tricolor, and we are French for the last time."}, {"size": 430, "text": "To-morrow we shall be Americans.\u201d I saw that simple ceremony. The little company of soldiers was drawn up before the low stone headquarters, the villagers with heads uncovered gathered round about. I saw the Stars and Stripes rising, the Tricolor setting. They met midway on the staff, hung together for a space, and a salute to the two nations echoed among the hills across the waters of the great River that rolled impassive by."}, {"size": 807, "text": "This book has been named \u201cThe Crossing\u201d because I have tried to express in it the beginnings of that great movement across the mountains which swept resistless over the Continent until at last it saw the Pacific itself. The Crossing was the first instinctive reaching out of an infant nation which was one day to become a giant. No annals in the world\u2019s history are more wonderful than the story of the conquest of Kentucky and Tennessee by the pioneers.This name, \u201cThe Crossing,\u201d is likewise typical in another sense. The political faith of our forefathers, of which the Constitution is the creed, was made to fit a more or less homogeneous body of people who proved that they knew the meaning of the word \u201cLiberty.\u201d By Liberty, our forefathers meant the Duty as well as the Right of man to govern himself."}, {"size": 771, "text": "The Constitution amply attests the greatness of its authors, but it was a compromise. It was an attempt to satisfy thirteen colonies, each of which clung tenaciously to its identity. It suited the eighteenth-century conditions of a little English-speaking confederacy along the seaboard, far removed from the world\u2019s strife and jealousy. It scarcely contemplated that the harassed millions of Europe would flock to its fold, and it did not foresee that, in less than a hundred years, its own citizens would sweep across the three thousand miles of forest and plain and mountain to the Western Ocean, absorb French and Spanish Louisiana, Spanish Texas, Mexico, and California, fill this land with broad farmsteads and populous cities, cover it with a network of railroads."}, {"size": 757, "text": "Would the Constitution, made to meet the needs of the little confederacy of the seaboard, stretch over a Continent and an Empire? We are fighting out that question to-day. But The Crossing was in Daniel Boone\u2019s time, in George Rogers Clark\u2019s. Would the Constitution stand the strain? And will it stand the strain now that the once remote haven of the oppressed has become a world-power? It was a difficult task in a novel to gather the elements necessary to picture this movement: the territory was vast, the types bewildering. The lonely mountain cabin; the seigniorial life of the tide-water; the foothills and mountains which the Scotch-Irish have marked for their own to this day; the Wilderness Trail; the wonderland of Kentucky, and the cruel fighting"}, {"size": 892, "text": "in the border forts there against the most relentless of foes; George Rogers Clark and his momentous campaign which gave to the Republic Ohio, Indiana, and Illinois; the transition period--the coming of the settler after the pioneer; Louisiana, St. Louis, and New Orleans,--to cover this ground, to picture the passions and politics of the time, to bring the counter influence of the French Revolution as near as possible to reality, has been a three years\u2019 task. The autobiography of David Ritchie is as near as I can get to its solution, and I have a great sense of its incompleteness. I had hoped when I planned the series to bring down this novel through the stirring period which ended, by a chance, when a steamboat brought supplies to Jackson\u2019s army in New Orleans--the beginning of the era of steam commerce on our Western waters. This work will have to be reserved for a future time."}, {"size": 669, "text": "I have tried to give a true history of Clark\u2019s campaign as seen by an eyewitness, trammelled as little as possible by romance. Elsewhere, as I look back through these pages, I feel as though the soil had only been scraped. What principality in the world has the story to rival that of John Sevier and the State of Franklin? I have tried to tell the truth as I went along. General Jackson was a boy at the Waxhaws and dug his toes in the red mud. He was a man at Jonesboro, and tradition says that he fought with a fence-rail. Sevier was captured as narrated. Monsieur Gratiot, Monsieur Vigo, and Father Gibault lost the money which they gave to Clark and their country."}, {"size": 810, "text": "Monsieur Vigo actually travelled in the state which Davy describes when he went down the river with him.

Among the many to whom my apologies and thanks are due is Mr. Pierre Chouteau of St. Louis, whose unremitting labors have preserved and perpetuated the history and traditions of the country of his ancestors. I would that I had been better able to picture the character, the courage, the ability, and patriotism of the French who settled Louisiana.

Another inconsistency was the author italicizing banquette and piastre as part of his rule of italicizing foreign words, but failing to do so all the time. We retained these inconsistencies in transcribing the book. There were some cases where it was difficult to distinguish whether there was or was not a space before 'll. The contraction 'll was not spaced for common contractions, such as I'll, he'll, they'll. However, there was a space for \u201cBreed 'll\u201d, \u201cwhat 'll\u201d, \u201cM'lisse 'll\u201d, and other uncommon contractions formed with 'll.

We changed double quotes nested inside of double quotes to single quotes because our error-checking utilities flag the second double quote as an error."}]}
