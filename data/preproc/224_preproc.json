To restore the grey carcases of a mediaevalism whose spirit had fled, seemed a not less incongruous act than to set about renovating the adjoining crags themselves."}, {"size": 728, "text": "Hence it happened that an imaginary history of three human hearts, whose emotions were not without correspondence with these material circumstances, found in the ordinary incidents of such church-renovations a fitting frame for its presentation.

The spot is, I may add, the furthest westward of all those convenient corners wherein I have ventured to erect my theatre for these imperfect little dramas of country life and passions; and it lies near to, or no great way beyond, the vague border of the Wessex kingdom on that side, which, like the westering verge of modern American settlements, was progressive and uncertain."}, {"size": 724, "text": "This, however, is of little importance.

One enormous sea-bord cliff in particular figures in the narrative; and for some forgotten reason or other this cliff was described in the story as being without a name.

I am very strict on that point. But you, Smith, there is something in your face which makes me feel quite at home; no nonsense about you, in short. Ah, it reminds me of a splendid story I used to hear when I was a helter-skelter young fellow--such a story!

Such writing is out of date now, I know; but I like doing it.\u2019 \u2018A romance carried in a purse!

For by this time they had reached the precincts of Endelstow House. Driving through an ancient gate-way of dun-coloured stone, spanned by the high-shouldered Tudor arch, they found themselves in a spacious court, closed by a facade on each of its three sides.

The windows on all sides were long and many-mullioned; the roof lines broken up by dormer lights of the same pattern. The apex stones of these dormers, together with those of the gables, were surmounted by grotesque figures in rampant, passant, and couchant variety.

The old Gothic quarries still remained in the upper portion of the large window at the end, though they had made way for a more modern form of glazing elsewhere. Stephen was at one end of the gallery looking towards Elfride, who stood in the midst, beginning to feel somewhat depressed by the society of Luxellian shades of cadaverous complexion fixed by Holbein, Kneller, and Lely, and seeming to gaze at and through her in a moralizing mood."}, {"size": 696, "text": "The silence, which cast almost a spell upon them, was broken by the sudden opening of a door at the far end. Out bounded a pair of little girls, lightly yet warmly dressed.

You are our little mamma, are you not--our big mamma is gone to London,\u2019 said one. \u2018Let me tiss you,\u2019 said the other, in appearance very much like the first, but to a smaller pattern.

As Elfride did not stand on a sufficiently intimate footing with the object of her interest to justify her, as a proper young lady, to commence the active search for him that youthful impulsiveness prompted, and as, nevertheless, for a nascent reason connected with those divinely cut lips of his, she did not like him to be absent from her side, she wandered desultorily back to the oak staircase, pouting and casting her eyes about in hope of discerning his boyish figure."}, {"size": 841, "text": "Though daylight still prevailed in the rooms, the corridors were in a depth of shadow--chill, sad, and silent; and it was only by looking along them towards light spaces beyond that anything or anybody could be discerned therein.

Elfride opened it, and found herself confronting a secondary or inner lawn, separated from the principal lawn front by a shrubbery. And now she saw a perplexing sight. At right angles to the face of the wing she had emerged from, and within a few feet of the door, jutted out another wing of the mansion, lower and with less architectural character.

She turned her back towards Stephen: he lifted and held out what now proved to be a shawl or mantle--placed it carefully--so carefully--round the lady; disappeared; reappeared in her front--fastened the mantle. Did he then kiss her? Surely not. Yet the motion might have been a kiss.

Her unpractised mind was completely occupied in fathoming its recent acquisition. The young man who had inspired her with such novelty of feeling, who had come directly from London on business to her father, having been brought by chance to Endelstow House had, by some means or other, acquired the privilege of approaching some lady he had found therein, and of honouring her by petits soins of a marked kind,--all in the space of half an hour.

The more Elfride reflected, the more certain did it appear that the meeting was a chance rencounter, and not an appointment.

It was Elfride\u2019s first kiss. And so awkward and unused was she; full of striving--no relenting.

And I am going to-morrow. I should have called you up to bid you good-bye.\u2019 \u2018But he didn\u2019t say you were to go--O Stephen, he didn\u2019t say that?\u2019 \u2018No; not in words. But I cannot stay.\u2019 \u2018Oh, don\u2019t, don\u2019t go! Do come and let us talk.

Elfride softly opened the drawing-room door and they both went in. When she had placed the candle on the table, he enclosed her with his arms, dried her eyes with his handkerchief, and kissed their lids. \u2018Stephen, it is over--happy love is over; and there is no more sunshine now!\u2019 \u2018I will make a fortune, and come to you, and have you."}, {"size": 641, "text": "Yes, I will!\u2019 \u2018Papa will never hear of it--never--never!

And, worse than that general feeling, there of course remained the sadness which arose from the special features of his own case. However remote a desired issue may be, the mere fact of having entered the groove which leads to it, cheers to some extent with a sense of accomplishment."}, {"size": 610, "text": "Had Mr. Swancourt consented to an engagement of no less length than ten years, Stephen would have been comparatively cheerful in waiting; they would have felt that they were somewhere on the road to Cupid\u2019s garden. But, with a possibility of a shorter probation, they had not as yet any prospect of the beginning; the zero of hope had yet to be reached. Mr. Swancourt would have to revoke his formidable words before the waiting for marriage could even set in.

During a pause which followed Stephen\u2019s last remark, a fascinating perception, then an alluring conviction, flashed along the brain of both. The perception was that an immediate marriage COULD be contrived; the conviction that such an act, in spite of its daring, its fathomless results, its deceptiveness, would be preferred by each to the life they must lead under any other conditions."}, {"size": 681, "text": "The youth spoke first, and his voice trembled with the magnitude of the conception he was cherishing. \u2018How strong we should feel, Elfride! going on our separate courses as before, without the fear of ultimate separation!

He would then be convinced that hearts cannot be played with; love encouraged be ready to grow, love discouraged be ready to die, at a moment\u2019s notice.

Throughout the night he had intended to see Mr. Swancourt again, but the sharp rebuff of the previous evening rendered such an interview particularly distasteful. Perhaps there was another and less honest reason. He decided to put it off. Whatever of moral timidity or obliquity may have lain in such a decision, no perception of it was strong enough to detain him."}, {"size": 657, "text": "He wrote a note in his room, which stated simply that he did not feel happy in the house after Mr. Swancourt\u2019s sudden veto on what he had favoured a few hours before; but that he hoped a time would come, and that soon, when his original feelings of pleasure as Mr. Swancourt\u2019s guest might be recovered. He expected to find the downstairs rooms wearing the gray and cheerless aspect that early morning gives to everything out of the sun. He found in the dining room a breakfast laid, of which somebody had just partaken. Stephen gave the maid-servant his note of adieu. She stated that Mr. Swancourt had risen early that morning, and made an early breakfast."}, {"size": 600, "text": "He was not going away that she knew of. Stephen took a cup of coffee, left the house of his love, and turned into the lane. It was so early that the shaded places still smelt like night time, and the sunny spots had hardly felt the sun. The horizontal rays made every shallow dip in the ground to show as a well-marked hollow. Even the channel of the path was enough to throw shade, and the very stones of the road cast tapering dashes of darkness westward, as long as Jael\u2019s tent-nail. At a spot not more than a hundred yards from the vicar\u2019s residence the lane leading thence crossed the high road."}, {"size": 644, "text": "Stephen reached the point of intersection, stood still and listened. Nothing could be heard save the lengthy, murmuring line of the sea upon the adjacent shore. He looked at his watch, and then mounted a gate upon which he seated himself, to await the arrival of the carrier. Whilst he sat he heard wheels coming in two directions. The vehicle approaching on his right he soon recognized as the carrier\u2019s. There were the accompanying sounds of the owner\u2019s voice and the smack of his whip, distinct in the still morning air, by which he encouraged his horses up the hill. The other set of wheels sounded from the lane Stephen had just traversed."}, {"size": 615, "text": "On closer observation, he perceived that they were moving from the precincts of the ancient manor-house adjoining the vicarage grounds. A carriage then left the entrance gates of the house, and wheeling round came fully in sight. It was a plain travelling carriage, with a small quantity of luggage, apparently a lady\u2019s. The vehicle came to the junction of the four ways half-a-minute before the carrier reached the same spot, and crossed directly in his front, proceeding by the lane on the other side. Inside the carriage Stephen could just discern an elderly lady with a younger woman, who seemed to be her maid."}, {"size": 670, "text": "The road they had taken led to Stratleigh, a small watering-place sixteen miles north. He heard the manor-house gates swing again, and looking up saw another person leaving them, and walking off in the direction of the parsonage. \u2018Ah, how much I wish I were moving that way!\u2019 felt he parenthetically. The gentleman was tall, and resembled Mr. Swancourt in outline and attire. He opened the vicarage gate and went in. Mr. Swancourt, then, it certainly was. Instead of remaining in bed that morning Mr. Swancourt must have taken it into his head to see his new neighbour off on a journey. He must have been greatly interested in that neighbour to do such an unusual thing."}, {"size": 694, "text": "The carrier\u2019s conveyance had pulled up, and Stephen now handed in his portmanteau and mounted the shafts. \u2018Who is that lady in the carriage?\u2019 he inquired indifferently of Lickpan the carrier. \u2018That, sir, is Mrs. Troyton, a widder wi\u2019 a mint o\u2019 money. She\u2019s the owner of all that part of Endelstow that is not Lord Luxellian\u2019s. Only been here a short time; she came into it by law. The owner formerly was a terrible mysterious party--never lived here--hardly ever was seen here except in the month of September, as I might say.\u2019 The horses were started again, and noise rendered further discourse a matter of too great exertion. Stephen crept inside under the tilt, and was soon lost in reverie."}, {"size": 701, "text": "Three hours and a half of straining up hills and jogging down brought them to St. Launce\u2019s, the market town and railway station nearest to Endelstow, and the place from which Stephen Smith had journeyed over the downs on the, to him, memorable winter evening at the beginning of the same year. The carrier\u2019s van was so timed as to meet a starting up-train, which Stephen entered. Two or three hours\u2019 railway travel through vertical cuttings in metamorphic rock, through oak copses rich and green, stretching over slopes and down delightful valleys, glens, and ravines, sparkling with water like many-rilled Ida, and he plunged amid the hundred and fifty thousand people composing the town of Plymouth."}, {"size": 837, "text": "There being some time upon his hands he left his luggage at the cloak-room, and went on foot along Bedford Street to the nearest church. Here Stephen wandered among the multifarious tombstones and looked in at the chancel window, dreaming of something that was likely to happen by the altar there in the course of the coming month. He turned away and ascended the Hoe, viewed the magnificent stretch of sea and massive promontories of land, but without particularly discerning one feature of the varied perspective. He still saw that inner prospect--the event he hoped for in yonder church. The wide Sound, the Breakwater, the light-house on far-off Eddystone, the dark steam vessels, brigs, barques, and schooners, either floating stilly, or gliding with tiniest motion, were as the dream, then; the dreamed-of event was as the reality."}, {"size": 123, "text": "Soon Stephen went down from the Hoe, and returned to the railway station. He took his ticket, and entered the London train."}, {"size": 717, "text": "That day was an irksome time at Endelstow vicarage. Neither father nor daughter alluded to the departure of Stephen. Mr. Swancourt\u2019s manner towards her partook of the compunctious kindness that arises from a misgiving as to the justice of some previous act. Either from lack of the capacity to grasp the whole coup d\u2019oeil, or from a natural endowment for certain kinds of stoicism, women are cooler than men in critical situations of the passive form. Probably, in Elfride\u2019s case at least, it was blindness to the greater contingencies of the future she was preparing for herself, which enabled her to ask her father in a quiet voice if he could give her a holiday soon, to ride to St. Launce\u2019s and go on to Plymouth."}, {"size": 611, "text": "Now, she had only once before gone alone to Plymouth, and that was in consequence of some unavoidable difficulty. Being a country girl, and a good, not to say a wild, horsewoman, it had been her delight to canter, without the ghost of an attendant, over the fourteen or sixteen miles of hard road intervening between their home and the station at St. Launce\u2019s, put up the horse, and go on the remainder of the distance by train, returning in the same manner in the evening. It was then resolved that, though she had successfully accomplished this journey once, it was not to be repeated without some attendance."}, {"size": 713, "text": "But Elfride must not be confounded with ordinary young feminine equestrians. The circumstances of her lonely and narrow life made it imperative that in trotting about the neighbourhood she must trot alone or else not at all. Usage soon rendered this perfectly natural to herself. Her father, who had had other experiences, did not much like the idea of a Swancourt, whose pedigree could be as distinctly traced as a thread in a skein of silk, scampering over the hills like a farmer\u2019s daughter, even though he could habitually neglect her. But what with his not being able to afford her a regular attendant, and his inveterate habit of letting anything be to save himself trouble, the circumstance grew customary."}, {"size": 604, "text": "And so there arose a chronic notion in the villagers\u2019 minds that all ladies rode without an attendant, like Miss Swancourt, except a few who were sometimes visiting at Lord Luxellian\u2019s. \u2018I don\u2019t like your going to Plymouth alone, particularly going to St. Launce\u2019s on horseback. Why not drive, and take the man?\u2019 \u2018It is not nice to be so overlooked.\u2019 Worm\u2019s company would not seriously have interfered with her plans, but it was her humour to go without him. \u2018When do you want to go?\u2019 said her father. She only answered, \u2018Soon.\u2019 \u2018I will consider,\u2019 he said. Only a few days elapsed before she asked again."}, {"size": 625, "text": "A letter had reached her from Stephen. It had been timed to come on that day by special arrangement between them. In it he named the earliest morning on which he could meet her at Plymouth. Her father had been on a journey to Stratleigh, and returned in unusual buoyancy of spirit. It was a good opportunity; and since the dismissal of Stephen her father had been generally in a mood to make small concessions, that he might steer clear of large ones connected with that outcast lover of hers. \u2018Next Thursday week I am going from home in a different direction,\u2019 said her father. \u2018In fact, I shall leave home the night before."}, {"size": 737, "text": "You might choose the same day, for they wish to take up the carpets, or some such thing, I think.

Her father had named the very day that Stephen also had named that morning as the earliest on which it would be of any use to meet her; that was, about fifteen days from the day on which he had left Endelstow. Fifteen days--that fragment of duration which has acquired such an interesting individuality from its connection with the English marriage law. She involuntarily looked at her father so strangely, that on becoming conscious of the look she paled with embarrassment. Her father, too, looked confused. What was he thinking of?"}, {"size": 781, "text": "There seemed to be a special facility offered her by a power external to herself in the circumstance that Mr. Swancourt had proposed to leave home the night previous to her wished-for day. Her father seldom took long journeys; seldom slept from home except perhaps on the night following a remote Visitation. Well, she would not inquire too curiously into the reason of the opportunity, nor did he, as would have been natural, proceed to explain it of his own accord. In matters of fact there had hitherto been no reserve between them, though they were not usually confidential in its full sense. But the divergence of their emotions on Stephen\u2019s account had produced an estrangement which just at present went even to the extent of reticence on the most ordinary household topics."}, {"size": 697, "text": "Elfride was almost unconsciously relieved, persuading herself that her father\u2019s reserve on his business justified her in secrecy as regarded her own--a secrecy which was necessarily a foregone decision with her. So anxious is a young conscience to discover a palliative, that the ex post facto nature of a reason is of no account in excluding it. The intervening fortnight was spent by her mostly in walking by herself among the shrubs and trees, indulging sometimes in sanguine anticipations; more, far more frequently, in misgivings. All her flowers seemed dull of hue; her pets seemed to look wistfully into her eyes, as if they no longer stood in the same friendly relation to her as formerly."}, {"size": 623, "text": "She wore melancholy jewellery, gazed at sunsets, and talked to old men and women. It was the first time that she had had an inner and private world apart from the visible one about her. She wished that her father, instead of neglecting her even more than usual, would make some advance--just one word; she would then tell all, and risk Stephen\u2019s displeasure. Thus brought round to the youth again, she saw him in her fancy, standing, touching her, his eyes full of sad affection, hopelessly renouncing his attempt because she had renounced hers; and she could not recede. On the Wednesday she was to receive another letter."}, {"size": 652, "text": "She had resolved to let her father see the arrival of this one, be the consequences what they might: the dread of losing her lover by this deed of honesty prevented her acting upon the resolve. Five minutes before the postman\u2019s expected arrival she slipped out, and down the lane to meet him. She met him immediately upon turning a sharp angle, which hid her from view in the direction of the vicarage. The man smilingly handed one missive, and was going on to hand another, a circular from some tradesman. \u2018No,\u2019 she said; \u2018take that on to the house.\u2019 \u2018Why, miss, you are doing what your father has done for the last fortnight.\u2019 She did not comprehend."}, {"size": 485, "text": "\u2018Why, come to this corner, and take a letter of me every morning, all writ in the same handwriting, and letting any others for him go on to the house.\u2019 And on the postman went.

Her father was in his old hearty spirits. He smiled to himself at stories too bad to tell, and called Elfride a little scamp for surreptitiously preserving some blind kittens that ought to have been drowned. After this expression, she said to him suddenly: \u2018If Mr. Smith had been already in the family, you would not have been made wretched by discovering he had poor relations?\u2019 \u2018Do you mean in the family by marriage?\u2019 he replied inattentively, and continuing to peel his egg.

The present seemed to be cast so precisely in the mould of previous ones that, not being given to syntheses of circumstances, he answered it with customary complacency. \u2018If he were allied to us irretrievably, of course I, or any sensible man, should accept conditions that could not be altered; certainly not be hopelessly melancholy about it."}, {"size": 623, "text": "I don\u2019t believe anything in the world would make me hopelessly melancholy.

Certainly Mr. Swancourt must have been far from thinking that the brightness came from an exhilarating intention to hold back no longer from the mad action she had planned. In the evening he drove away towards Stratleigh, quite alone. It was an unusual course for him. At the door Elfride had been again almost impelled by her feelings to pour out all. \u2018Why are you going to Stratleigh, papa?\u2019 she said, and looked at him longingly."}, {"size": 610, "text": "\u2018I will tell you to-morrow when I come back,\u2019 he said cheerily; \u2018not before then, Elfride.

He went away. His jocularity made her intention seem the lighter, as his indifference made her more resolved to do as she liked.

After looking westward for a considerable time, she blamed herself for not looking eastward to where Stephen was, and turned round. Ultimately her eyes fell upon the ground. A peculiarity was observable beneath her. A green field spread itself on each side of the hedge, one belonging to the glebe, the other being a part of the land attached to the manor-house adjoining. On the vicarage side she saw a little footpath, the distinctive and altogether exceptional feature of which consisted in its being only about ten yards long; it terminated abruptly at each end."}, {"size": 709, "text": "A footpath, suddenly beginning and suddenly ending, coming from nowhere and leading nowhere, she had never seen before. Yes, she had, on second thoughts. She had seen exactly such a path trodden in the front of barracks by the sentry. And this recollection explained the origin of the path here. Her father had trodden it by pacing up and down, as she had once seen him doing. Sitting on the hedge as she sat now, her eyes commanded a view of both sides of it. And a few minutes later, Elfride looked over to the manor side. Here was another sentry path. It was like the first in length, and it began and ended exactly opposite the beginning and ending of its neighbour, but it was thinner, and less distinct."}, {"size": 629, "text": "Two reasons existed for the difference.

At Easters we shall fly to town for the usual three months--I shall have a curate of course by that time. Elfride, I am past love, you know, and I honestly confess that I married her for your sake.

You might have made a point of taking tea with them every day, for all that I knew.\u2019 Elfride swallowed her feelings as she best could, and languidly though flatly asked a question. \u2018Did you kiss Mrs. Troyton on the lawn about three weeks ago?

No further observed, she was not a woman to like. But there was more to see. To the most superficial critic it was apparent that she made no attempt to disguise her age.

It expressed humour subjective as well as objective--which could survey the peculiarities of self in as whimsical a light as those of other people. This is not all of Mrs. Swancourt. She had held out to Elfride hands whose fingers were literally stiff with rings, signis auroque rigentes, like Helen\u2019s robe. These rows of rings were not worn in vanity apparently.

His very kindness in letting her return was his offence. Elfride had her sex\u2019s love of sheer force in a man, however ill-directed; and at that critical juncture in London Stephen\u2019s only chance of retaining the ascendancy over her that his face and not his parts had acquired for him, would have been by doing what, for one thing, he was too youthful to undertake--that was, dragging her by the wrist to the rails of some altar, and peremptorily marrying her."}, {"size": 342, "text": "Decisive action is seen by appreciative minds to be frequently objectless, and sometimes fatal; but decision, however suicidal, has more charm for a woman than the most unequivocal Fabian success.

The moral consequences are, first, that those who occupy chambers in the Inn may see a great deal of shirtless humanity\u2019s habits and enjoyments without doing more than look down from a back window; and second they may hear wholesome though unpleasant social reminders through the medium of a harsh voice, an unequal footstep, the echo of a blow or a fall, which originates in the person of some drunkard or wife-beater, as he crosses and interferes with the quiet of the square."}, {"size": 712, "text": "Characters of this kind frequently pass through the Inn from a little foxhole of an alley at the back, but they never loiter there. It is hardly necessary to state that all the sights and movements proper to the Inn are most orderly.

He looked at a timepiece on the mantelshelf, then turned again to his letters, pointing to a chair. \u2018Well, I am glad you have come.

Portions of the floor, and half the wall-space, were taken up by book-shelves ordinary and extraordinary; the remaining parts, together with brackets, side-tables, &c., being occupied by casts, statuettes, medallions, and plaques of various descriptions, picked up by the owner in his wanderings through France and Italy.

Youths and girls who are men and women before they come of age are nobodies by the time that backward people have shown their full compass.\u2019 \u2018Yes,\u2019 said Knight thoughtfully."}, {"size": 700, "text": "\u2018There is really something in that remark. But at the risk of offence I must remind you that you there take it for granted that the woman behind her time at a given age has not reached the end of her tether.

Mrs. Swancourt, to whom match-making by any honest means was meat and drink, had now a little scheme of that nature concerning this pair.

It was impossible for any man not to know the colour of Elfride\u2019s hair. In women who wear it plainly such a feature may be overlooked by men not given to ocular intentness. But hers was always in the way. You saw her hair as far as you could see her sex, and knew that it was the palest brown. She knew instantly that Knight, being perfectly aware of this, had an independent standard of admiration in the matter. Elfride was thoroughly vexed.

So no more was said by either on the subject of hair, eyes, or development. Elfride\u2019s mind had been impregnated with sentiments of her own smallness to an uncomfortable degree of distinctness, and her discomfort was visible in her face.

True, Stephen had declared he loved her: Mr. Knight had never done anything of the sort. Somehow this did not mend matters, and the sensation of her smallness in Knight\u2019s eyes still remained. Had the position been reversed--had Stephen loved her in spite of a differing taste, and had Knight been indifferent in spite of her resemblance to his ideal, it would have engendered far happier thoughts. As matters stood, Stephen\u2019s admiration might have its root in a blindness the result of passion."}, {"size": 740, "text": "Perhaps any keen man\u2019s judgment was condemnatory of her. During the remainder of Saturday they were more or less thrown with their seniors, and no conversation arose which was exclusively their own. When Elfride was in bed that night her thoughts recurred to the same subject. At one moment she insisted that it was ill-natured of him to speak so decisively as he had done; the next, that it was sterling honesty. \u2018Ah, what a poor nobody I am!\u2019 she said, sighing. \u2018People like him, who go about the great world, don\u2019t care in the least what I am like either in mood or feature.\u2019 Perhaps a man who has got thoroughly into a woman\u2019s mind in this manner, is half way to her heart; the distance between those two stations is proverbially short."}, {"size": 633, "text": "\u2018And are you really going away this week?\u2019 said Mrs. Swancourt to Knight on the following evening, which was Sunday.

The sun streamed across from the dilapidated west window, and lighted all the assembled worshippers with a golden glow, Knight as he read being illuminated by the same mellow lustre. Elfride at the organ regarded him with a throbbing sadness of mood which was fed by a sense of being far removed from his sphere. As he went deliberately through the chapter appointed--a portion of the history of Elijah--and ascended that magnificent climax of the wind, the earthquake, the fire, and the still small voice, his deep tones echoed past with such apparent disregard of her existence, that his presence inspired her with a forlorn sense of unapproachableness, which his absence would hardly have been able to cause."}, {"size": 663, "text": "At the same time, turning her face for a moment to catch the glory of the dying sun as it fell on his form, her eyes were arrested by the shape and aspect of a woman in the west gallery.

Possessing the smallest of competencies, this unhappy woman appeared to spend her life in journeyings between Endelstow Churchyard and that of a village near Southampton, where her father and mother were laid. She had not attended the service here for a considerable time, and she now seemed to have a reason for her choice of seat."}, {"size": 677, "text": "From the gallery window the tomb of her son was plainly visible--standing as the nearest object in a prospect which was closed outwardly by the changeless horizon of the sea. The streaming rays, too, flooded her face, now bent towards Elfride with a hard and bitter expression that the solemnity of the place raised to a tragic dignity it did not intrinsically possess. The girl resumed her normal attitude with an added disquiet. Elfride\u2019s emotion was cumulative, and after a while would assert itself on a sudden. A slight touch was enough to set it free--a poem, a sunset, a cunningly contrived chord of music, a vague imagining, being the usual accidents of its exhibition."}, {"size": 666, "text": "The longing for Knight\u2019s respect, which was leading up to an incipient yearning for his love, made the present conjuncture a sufficient one. Whilst kneeling down previous to leaving, when the sunny streaks had gone upward to the roof, and the lower part of the church was in soft shadow, she could not help thinking of Coleridge\u2019s morbid poem \u2018The Three Graves,\u2019 and shuddering as she wondered if Mrs. Jethway were cursing her, she wept as if her heart would break.

Knight\u2019s sentiments were only the ordinary ones of a man of his age who loves genuinely, perhaps exaggerated a little by his pursuits. When men first love as lads, it is with the very centre of their hearts, nothing else being concerned in the operation."}, {"size": 871, "text": "With added years, more of the faculties attempt a partnership in the passion, till at Knight\u2019s age the understanding is fain to have a hand in it. It may as well be left out. A man in love setting up his brains as a gauge of his position is as one determining a ship\u2019s longitude from a light at the mast-head. Knight argued from Elfride\u2019s unwontedness of manner, which was matter of fact, to an unwontedness in love, which was matter of inference only. Incredules les plus credules. \u2018Elfride,\u2019 he said, \u2018had hardly looked upon a man till she saw me.\u2019 He had never forgotten his severity to her because she preferred ornament to edification, and had since excused her a hundred times by thinking how natural to womankind was a love of adornment, and how necessary became a mild infusion of personal vanity to complete the delicate and fascinating dye of the feminine mind."}, {"size": 723, "text": "So at the end of the week\u2019s absence, which had brought him as far as Dublin, he resolved to curtail his tour, return to Endelstow, and commit himself by making a reality of the hypothetical offer of that Sunday evening. Notwithstanding that he had concocted a great deal of paper theory on social amenities and modern manners generally, the special ounce of practice was wanting, and now for his life Knight could not recollect whether it was considered correct to give a young lady personal ornaments before a regular engagement to marry had been initiated. But the day before leaving Dublin he looked around anxiously for a high-class jewellery establishment, in which he purchased what he considered would suit her best."}, {"size": 781, "text": "It was with a most awkward and unwonted feeling that after entering and closing the door of his room he sat down, opened the morocco case, and held up each of the fragile bits of gold-work before his eyes. Many things had become old to the solitary man of letters, but these were new, and he handled like a child an outcome of civilization which had never before been touched by his fingers. A sudden fastidious decision that the pattern chosen would not suit her after all caused him to rise in a flurry and tear down the street to change them for others. After a great deal of trouble in reselecting, during which his mind became so bewildered that the critical faculty on objects of art seemed to have vacated his person altogether, Knight carried off another pair of ear-rings."}, {"size": 804, "text": "These remained in his possession till the afternoon, when, after contemplating them fifty times with a growing misgiving that the last choice was worse than the first, he felt that no sleep would visit his pillow till he had improved upon his previous purchases yet again. In a perfect heat of vexation with himself for such tergiversation, he went anew to the shop-door, was absolutely ashamed to enter and give further trouble, went to another shop, bought a pair at an enormously increased price, because they seemed the very thing, asked the goldsmiths if they would take the other pair in exchange, was told that they could not exchange articles bought of another maker, paid down the money, and went off with the two pairs in his possession, wondering what on earth to do with the superfluous pair."}, {"size": 624, "text": "He almost wished he could lose them, or that somebody would steal them, and was burdened with an interposing sense that, as a capable man, with true ideas of economy, he must necessarily sell them somewhere, which he did at last for a mere song. Mingled with a blank feeling of a whole day being lost to him in running about the city on this new and extraordinary class of errand, and of several pounds being lost through his bungling, was a slight sense of satisfaction that he had emerged for ever from his antediluvian ignorance on the subject of ladies\u2019 jewellery, as well as secured a truly artistic production at last."}, {"size": 734, "text": "During the remainder of that day he scanned the ornaments of every lady he met with the profoundly experienced eye of an appraiser. Next morning Knight was again crossing St. George\u2019s Channel--not returning to London by the Holyhead route as he had originally intended, but towards Bristol--availing himself of Mr. and Mrs. Swancourt\u2019s invitation to revisit them on his homeward journey. We flit forward to Elfride. Woman\u2019s ruling passion--to fascinate and influence those more powerful than she--though operant in Elfride, was decidedly purposeless. She had wanted her friend Knight\u2019s good opinion from the first: how much more than that elementary ingredient of friendship she now desired, her fears would hardly allow her to think."}, {"size": 895, "text": "In originally wishing to please the highest class of man she had ever intimately known, there was no disloyalty to Stephen Smith. She could not--and few women can--realize the possible vastness of an issue which has only an insignificant begetting. Her letters from Stephen were necessarily few, and her sense of fidelity clung to the last she had received as a wrecked mariner clings to flotsam. The young girl persuaded herself that she was glad Stephen had such a right to her hand as he had acquired (in her eyes) by the elopement. She beguiled herself by saying, \u2018Perhaps if I had not so committed myself I might fall in love with Mr. Knight.\u2019 All this made the week of Knight\u2019s absence very gloomy and distasteful to her. She retained Stephen in her prayers, and his old letters were re-read--as a medicine in reality, though she deceived herself into the belief that it was as a pleasure."}, {"size": 745, "text": "These letters had grown more and more hopeful. He told her that he finished his work every day with a pleasant consciousness of having removed one more stone from the barrier which divided them. Then he drew images of what a fine figure they two would cut some day. People would turn their heads and say, \u2018What a prize he has won!\u2019 She was not to be sad about that wild runaway attempt of theirs (Elfride had repeatedly said that it grieved her). Whatever any other person who knew of it might think, he knew well enough the modesty of her nature. The only reproach was a gentle one for not having written quite so devotedly during her visit to London. Her letter had seemed to have a liveliness derived from other thoughts than thoughts of him."}, {"size": 669, "text": "Knight\u2019s intention of an early return to Endelstow having originally been faint, his promise to do so had been fainter. He was a man who kept his words well to the rear of his possible actions. The vicar was rather surprised to see him again so soon: Mrs. Swancourt was not. Knight found, on meeting them all, after his arrival had been announced, that they had formed an intention to go to St. Leonards for a few days at the end of the month. No satisfactory conjuncture offered itself on this first evening of his return for presenting Elfride with what he had been at such pains to procure. He was fastidious in his reading of opportunities for such an intended act."}, {"size": 635, "text": "The next morning chancing to break fine after a week of cloudy weather, it was proposed and decided that they should all drive to Barwith Strand, a local lion which neither Mrs. Swancourt nor Knight had seen. Knight scented romantic occasions from afar, and foresaw that such a one might be expected before the coming night. The journey was along a road by neutral green hills, upon which hedgerows lay trailing like ropes on a quay. Gaps in these uplands revealed the blue sea, flecked with a few dashes of white and a solitary white sail, the whole brimming up to a keen horizon which lay like a line ruled from hillside to hillside."}, {"size": 774, "text": "Then they rolled down a pass, the chocolate-toned rocks forming a wall on both sides, from one of which fell a heavy jagged shade over half the roadway. A spout of fresh water burst from an occasional crevice, and pattering down upon broad green leaves, ran along as a rivulet at the bottom. Unkempt locks of heather overhung the brow of each steep, whence at divers points a bramble swung forth into mid-air, snatching at their head-dresses like a claw. They mounted the last crest, and the bay which was to be the end of their pilgrimage burst upon them. The ocean blueness deepened its colour as it stretched to the foot of the crags, where it terminated in a fringe of white--silent at this distance, though moving and heaving like a counterpane upon a restless sleeper."}, {"size": 716, "text": "The shadowed hollows of the purple and brown rocks would have been called blue had not that tint been so entirely appropriated by the water beside them. The carriage was put up at a little cottage with a shed attached, and an ostler and the coachman carried the hamper of provisions down to the shore. Knight found his opportunity. \u2018I did not forget your wish,\u2019 he began, when they were apart from their friends. Elfride looked as if she did not understand. \u2018And I have brought you these,\u2019 he continued, awkwardly pulling out the case, and opening it while holding it towards her. \u2018O Mr. Knight!\u2019 said Elfride confusedly, and turning to a lively red; \u2018I didn\u2019t know you had any intention or meaning in what you said."}, {"size": 600, "text": "I thought it a mere supposition.

They are beautiful--more beautiful than any I have ever seen,\u2019 she answered earnestly, looking half-wishfully at the temptation, as Eve may have looked at the apple. \u2018But I don\u2019t want to have them, if you will kindly forgive me, Mr. Knight.\u2019 \u2018No kindness at all,\u2019 said Mr."}, {"size": 465, "text": "Knight, brought to a full stop at this unexpected turn of events. A silence followed. Knight held the open case, looking rather wofully at the glittering forms he had forsaken his orbit to procure; turning it about and holding it up as if, feeling his gift to be slighted by her, he were endeavouring to admire it very much himself. \u2018Shut them up, and don\u2019t let me see them any longer--do!\u2019 she said laughingly, and with a quaint mixture of reluctance and entreaty."}, {"size": 785, "text": "\u2018Not Elfie to you, Mr. Knight.

I don\u2019t like to take them.\u2019 \u2018I have read a fact of distressing significance in that,\u2019 said Knight. \u2018Since you like them, your dislike to having them must be towards me?\u2019 \u2018What, then? Do you like me?\u2019 Elfride deepened in tint, and looked into the distance with features shaped to an expression of the nicest criticism as regarded her answer. \u2018I like you pretty well,\u2019 she at length murmured mildly."}, {"size": 778, "text": "\u2018You are so sharp with me, and say hard things, and so how can I?\u2019 she replied evasively. \u2018You think me a fogey, I suppose?\u2019 \u2018No, I don\u2019t--I mean I do--I don\u2019t know what I think you, I mean. Let us go to papa,\u2019 responded Elfride, with somewhat of a flurried delivery. \u2018Well, I\u2019ll tell you my object in getting the present,\u2019 said Knight, with a composure intended to remove from her mind any possible impression of his being what he was--her lover. \u2018You see it was the very least I could do in common civility.\u2019 Elfride felt rather blank at this lucid statement. Knight continued, putting away the case: \u2018I felt as anybody naturally would have, you know, that my words on your choice the other day were invidious and unfair, and thought an apology should take a practical shape.\u2019"}, {"size": 685, "text": "Elfride was sorry--she could not tell why--that he gave such a legitimate reason. It was a disappointment that he had all the time a cool motive, which might be stated to anybody without raising a smile. Had she known they were offered in that spirit, she would certainly have accepted the seductive gift. And the tantalizing feature was that perhaps he suspected her to imagine them offered as a lover\u2019s token, which was mortifying enough if they were not. Mrs. Swancourt came now to where they were sitting, to select a flat boulder for spreading their table-cloth upon, and, amid the discussion on that subject, the matter pending between Knight and Elfride was shelved for a while."}, {"size": 691, "text": "He read her refusal so certainly as the bashfulness of a girl in a novel position, that, upon the whole, he could tolerate such a beginning. Could Knight have been told that it was a sense of fidelity struggling against new love, whilst no less assuring as to his ultimate victory, it might have entirely abstracted the wish to secure it. At the same time a slight constraint of manner was visible between them for the remainder of the afternoon. The tide turned, and they were obliged to ascend to higher ground. The day glided on to its end with the usual quiet dreamy passivity of such occasions--when every deed done and thing thought is in endeavouring to avoid doing and thinking more."}, {"size": 656, "text": "Looking idly over the verge of a crag, they beheld their stone dining-table gradually being splashed upon and their crumbs and fragments all washed away by the incoming sea. The vicar drew a moral lesson from the scene; Knight replied in the same satisfied strain. And then the waves rolled in furiously--the neutral green-and-blue tongues of water slid up the slopes, and were metamorphosed into foam by a careless blow, falling back white and faint, and leaving trailing followers behind. The passing of a heavy shower was the next scene--driving them to shelter in a shallow cave--after which the horses were put in, and they started to return homeward."}, {"size": 855, "text": "By the time they reached the higher levels the sky had again cleared, and the sunset rays glanced directly upon the wet uphill road they had climbed. The ruts formed by their carriage-wheels on the ascent--a pair of Liliputian canals--were as shining bars of gold, tapering to nothing in the distance. Upon this also they turned their backs, and night spread over the sea. The evening was chilly, and there was no moon. Knight sat close to Elfride, and, when the darkness rendered the position of a person a matter of uncertainty, particularly close. Elfride edged away. \u2018I hope you allow me my place ungrudgingly?\u2019 he whispered. \u2018Oh yes; \u2018tis the least I can do in common civility,\u2019 she said, accenting the words so that he might recognize them as his own returned. Both of them felt delicately balanced between two possibilities. Thus they reached home."}, {"size": 733, "text": "To Knight this mild experience was delightful. It was to him a gentle innocent time--a time which, though there may not be much in it, seldom repeats itself in a man\u2019s life, and has a peculiar dearness when glanced at retrospectively. He is not inconveniently deep in love, and is lulled by a peaceful sense of being able to enjoy the most trivial thing with a childlike enjoyment. The movement of a wave, the colour of a stone, anything, was enough for Knight\u2019s drowsy thoughts of that day to precipitate themselves upon. Even the sermonizing platitudes the vicar had delivered himself of--chiefly because something seemed to be professionally required of him in the presence of a man of Knight\u2019s proclivities--were swallowed whole."}, {"size": 605, "text": "The presence of Elfride led him not merely to tolerate that kind of talk from the necessities of ordinary courtesy; but he listened to it--took in the ideas with an enjoyable make-believe that they were proper and necessary, and indulged in a conservative feeling that the face of things was complete. Entering her room that evening Elfride found a packet for herself on the dressing-table. How it came there she did not know. She tremblingly undid the folds of white paper that covered it. Yes; it was the treasure of a morocco case, containing those treasures of ornament she had refused in the daytime."}, {"size": 618, "text": "Elfride dressed herself in them for a moment, looked at herself in the glass, blushed red, and put them away. They filled her dreams all that night. Never had she seen anything so lovely, and never was it more clear that as an honest woman she was in duty bound to refuse them. Why it was not equally clear to her that duty required more vigorous co-ordinate conduct as well, let those who dissect her say. The next morning glared in like a spectre upon her. It was Stephen\u2019s letter-day, and she was bound to meet the postman--to stealthily do a deed she had never liked, to secure an end she now had ceased to desire."}, {"size": 623, "text": "There were two letters. One was from the bank at St. Launce\u2019s, in which she had a small private deposit--probably something about interest. She put that in her pocket for a moment, and going indoors and upstairs to be safer from observation, tremblingly opened Stephen\u2019s. What was this he said to her? She was to go to the St. Launce\u2019s Bank and take a sum of money which they had received private advices to pay her. The sum was two hundred pounds. There was no check, order, or anything of the nature of guarantee. In fact the information amounted to this: the money was now in the St. Launce\u2019s Bank, standing in her name."}, {"size": 621, "text": "She instantly opened the other letter. It contained a deposit-note from the bank for the sum of two hundred pounds which had that day been added to her account. Stephen\u2019s information, then, was correct, and the transfer made. \u2018I have saved this in one year,\u2019 Stephen\u2019s letter went on to say, \u2018and what so proper as well as pleasant for me to do as to hand it over to you to keep for your use? I have plenty for myself, independently of this. Should you not be disposed to let it lie idle in the bank, get your father to invest it in your name on good security. It is a little present to you from your more than betrothed."}, {"size": 634, "text": "He will, I think, Elfride, feel now that my pretensions to your hand are anything but the dream of a silly boy not worth rational consideration.\u2019 With a natural delicacy, Elfride, in mentioning her father\u2019s marriage, had refrained from all allusion to the pecuniary resources of the lady. Leaving this matter-of-fact subject, he went on, somewhat after his boyish manner: \u2018Do you remember, darling, that first morning of my arrival at your house, when your father read at prayers the miracle of healing the sick of the palsy--where he is told to take up his bed and walk? I do, and I can now so well realize the force of that passage."}, {"size": 688, "text": "The smallest piece of mat is the bed of the Oriental, and yesterday I saw a native perform the very action, which reminded me to mention it. But you are better read than I, and perhaps you knew all this long ago....One day I bought some small native idols to send home to you as curiosities, but afterwards finding they had been cast in England, made to look old, and shipped over, I threw them away in disgust. \u2018Speaking of this reminds me that we are obliged to import all our house-building ironwork from England. Never was such foresight required to be exercised in building houses as here. Before we begin, we have to order every column, lock, hinge, and screw that will be required."}, {"size": 628, "text": "We cannot go into the next street, as in London, and get them cast at a minute\u2019s notice. Mr. L. says somebody will have to go to England very soon and superintend the selection of a large order of this kind. I only wish I may be the man.\u2019 There before her lay the deposit-receipt for the two hundred pounds, and beside it the elegant present of Knight. Elfride grew cold--then her cheeks felt heated by beating blood. If by destroying the piece of paper the whole transaction could have been withdrawn from her experience, she would willingly have sacrificed the money it represented. She did not know what to do in either case."}, {"size": 778, "text": "She almost feared to let the two articles lie in juxtaposition: so antagonistic were the interests they represented that a miraculous repulsion of one by the other was almost to be expected. That day she was seen little of. By the evening she had come to a resolution, and acted upon it. The packet was sealed up--with a tear of regret as she closed the case upon the pretty forms it contained--directed, and placed upon the writing-table in Knight\u2019s room. And a letter was written to Stephen, stating that as yet she hardly understood her position with regard to the money sent; but declaring that she was ready to fulfil her promise to marry him. After this letter had been written she delayed posting it--although never ceasing to feel strenuously that the deed must be done."}, {"size": 815, "text": "Several days passed. There was another Indian letter for Elfride. Coming unexpectedly, her father saw it, but made no remark--why, she could not tell. The news this time was absolutely overwhelming. Stephen, as he had wished, had been actually chosen as the most fitting to execute the iron-work commission he had alluded to as impending. This duty completed he would have three months\u2019 leave. His letter continued that he should follow it in a week, and should take the opportunity to plainly ask her father to permit the engagement. Then came a page expressive of his delight and hers at the reunion; and finally, the information that he would write to the shipping agents, asking them to telegraph and tell her when the ship bringing him home should be in sight--knowing how acceptable such information would be."}, {"size": 637, "text": "Elfride lived and moved now as in a dream. Knight had at first become almost angry at her persistent refusal of his offering--and no less with the manner than the fact of it. But he saw that she began to look worn and ill--and his vexation lessened to simple perplexity. He ceased now to remain in the house for long hours together as before, but made it a mere centre for antiquarian and geological excursions in the neighbourhood. Throw up his cards and go away he fain would have done, but could not. And, thus, availing himself of the privileges of a relative, he went in and out the premises as fancy led him--but still lingered on."}, {"size": 663, "text": "\u2018I don\u2019t wish to stay here another day if my presence is distasteful,\u2019 he said one afternoon. \u2018At first you used to imply that I was severe with you; and when I am kind you treat me unfairly.\u2019 \u2018No, no. Don\u2019t say so.\u2019 The origin of their acquaintanceship had been such as to render their manner towards each other peculiar and uncommon. It was of a kind to cause them to speak out their minds on any feelings of objection and difference: to be reticent on gentler matters. \u2018I have a good mind to go away and never trouble you again,\u2019 continued Knight. She said nothing, but the eloquent expression of her eyes and wan face was enough to reproach him for harshness."}, {"size": 616, "text": "\u2018Do you like me to be here, then?\u2019 inquired Knight gently. \u2018Yes,\u2019 she said. Fidelity to the old love and truth to the new were ranged on opposite sides, and truth virtuelessly prevailed. \u2018Then I\u2019ll stay a little longer,\u2019 said Knight. \u2018Don\u2019t be vexed if I keep by myself a good deal, will you? Perhaps something may happen, and I may tell you something.\u2019 \u2018Mere coyness,\u2019 said Knight to himself; and went away with a lighter heart. The trick of reading truly the enigmatical forces at work in women at given times, which with some men is an unerring instinct, is peculiar to minds less direct and honest than Knight\u2019s."}, {"size": 449, "text": "The next evening, about five o\u2019clock, before Knight had returned from a pilgrimage along the shore, a man walked up to the house. He was a messenger from Camelton, a town a few miles off, to which place the railway had been advanced during the summer. \u2018A telegram for Miss Swancourt, and three and sixpence to pay for the special messenger.\u2019 Miss Swancourt sent out the money, signed the paper, and opened her letter with a trembling hand.

Three mornings later he brought an inland letter from Stephen. It contained very little matter, having been written in haste; but the meaning was bulky enough. Stephen said that, having executed a commission in Liverpool, he should arrive at his father\u2019s house, East Endelstow, at five or six o\u2019clock that same evening; that he would after dusk walk on to the next village, and meet her, if she would, in the church porch, as in the old time."}, {"size": 610, "text": "He proposed this plan because he thought it unadvisable to call formally at her house so late in the evening; yet he could not sleep without having seen her. The minutes would seem hours till he clasped her in his arms. Elfride was still steadfast in her opinion that honour compelled her to meet him. Probably the very longing to avoid him lent additional weight to the conviction; for she was markedly one of those who sigh for the unattainable--to whom, superlatively, a hope is pleasing because not a possession. And she knew it so well that her intellect was inclined to exaggerate this defect in herself."}, {"size": 602, "text": "So during the day she looked her duty steadfastly in the face; read Wordsworth\u2019s astringent yet depressing ode to that Deity; committed herself to her guidance; and still felt the weight of chance desires. But she began to take a melancholy pleasure in contemplating the sacrifice of herself to the man whom a maidenly sense of propriety compelled her to regard as her only possible husband. She would meet him, and do all that lay in her power to marry him. To guard against a relapse, a note was at once despatched to his father\u2019s cottage for Stephen on his arrival, fixing an hour for the interview."}, {"size": 603, "text": "\u2018On thy cold grey stones, O sea!\u2019 Stephen had said that he should come by way of Bristol, and thence by a steamer to Castle Boterel, in order to avoid the long journey over the hills from St. Launce\u2019s. He did not know of the extension of the railway to Camelton. During the afternoon a thought occurred to Elfride, that from any cliff along the shore it would be possible to see the steamer some hours before its arrival. She had accumulated religious force enough to do an act of supererogation. The act was this--to go to some point of land and watch for the ship that brought her future husband home."}, {"size": 682, "text": "It was a cloudy afternoon. Elfride was often diverted from a purpose by a dull sky; and though she used to persuade herself that the weather was as fine as possible on the other side of the clouds, she could not bring about any practical result from this fancy. Now, her mood was such that the humid sky harmonized with it. Having ascended and passed over a hill behind the house, Elfride came to a small stream. She used it as a guide to the coast. It was smaller than that in her own valley, and flowed altogether at a higher level. Bushes lined the slopes of its shallow trough; but at the bottom, where the water ran, was a soft green carpet, in a strip two or three yards wide."}, {"size": 627, "text": "In winter, the water flowed over the grass; in summer, as now, it trickled along a channel in the midst.

Elfride had already scanned the small surface of ocean visible, and had seen no ship. They walked along in company, sometimes with the brook between them--for it was no wider than a man\u2019s stride--sometimes close together. The green carpet grew swampy, and they kept higher up. One of the two ridges between which they walked dwindled lower and became insignificant."}, {"size": 691, "text": "That on the right hand rose with their advance, and terminated in a clearly defined edge against the light, as if it were abruptly sawn off. A little further, and the bed of the rivulet ended in the same fashion. They had come to a bank breast-high, and over it the valley was no longer to be seen. It was withdrawn cleanly and completely. In its place was sky and boundless atmosphere; and perpendicularly down beneath them--small and far off--lay the corrugated surface of the Atlantic. The small stream here found its death. Running over the precipice it was dispersed in spray before it was half-way down, and falling like rain upon projecting ledges, made minute grassy meadows of them."}, {"size": 676, "text": "At the bottom the water-drops soaked away amid the debris of the cliff.

Will you give me the glass?\u2019 Knight pulled open the old-fashioned but powerful telescope, and handed it to Elfride, who had looked on with heavy eyes. \u2018I can\u2019t keep it up now,\u2019 she said. \u2018Rest it on my shoulder.\u2019"}, {"size": 658, "text": "\u2018Too low.

And I can see the black forms of the passengers against its white surface. One of them has taken something from another--a glass, I think--yes, it is--and he is levelling it in this direction.

How is that?\u2019 \u2018Something in the air affects my face.\u2019 \u2018Those fair cheeks are very fastidious, I fear,\u2019 returned Knight tenderly. \u2018This air would make those rosy that were never so before, one would think--eh, Nature\u2019s spoilt child?\u2019 Elfride\u2019s colour returned again. \u2018There is more to see behind us, after all,\u2019 said Knight."}, {"size": 704, "text": "She turned her back upon the boat and Stephen Smith, and saw, towering still higher than themselves, the vertical face of the hill on the right, which did not project seaward so far as the bed of the valley, but formed the back of a small cove, and so was visible like a concave wall, bending round from their position towards the left. The composition of the huge hill was revealed to its backbone and marrow here at its rent extremity. It consisted of a vast stratification of blackish-gray slate, unvaried in its whole height by a single change of shade. It is with cliffs and mountains as with persons; they have what is called a presence, which is not necessarily proportionate to their actual bulk."}, {"size": 629, "text": "A little cliff will impress you powerfully; a great one not at all.

Reaching the very top, they sat down to rest by mutual consent. \u2018Heavens, what an altitude!\u2019 said Knight between his pants, and looking far over the sea. The cascade at the bottom of the slope appeared a mere span in height from where they were now. Elfride was looking to the left.

In fact, an inverted cascade is there--as perfect as the Niagara Falls--but rising instead of falling, and air instead of water. Now look here.\u2019 Knight threw a stone over the bank, aiming it as if to go onward over the cliff.

No sooner was his head above it than his hat appeared to be sucked from his head--slipping over his forehead in a seaward direction. \u2018That\u2019s the backward eddy, as I told you,\u2019 he cried, and vanished over the little bank after his hat."}, {"size": 612, "text": "Elfride waited one minute; he did not return. She waited another, and there was no sign of him. A few drops of rain fell, then a sudden shower. She arose, and looked over the bank.

He was on his hands and knees, trying to climb back to the level ground. The rain had wetted the shaly surface of the incline. A slight superficial wetting of the soil hereabout made it far more slippery to stand on than the same soil thoroughly drenched."}, {"size": 638, "text": "The inner substance was still hard, and was lubricated by the moistened film. \u2018I find a difficulty in getting back,\u2019 said Knight.

Knight strove with all his might for two or three minutes, and the drops of perspiration began to bead his brow. \u2018No, I am unable to do it,\u2019 he answered. Elfride, by a wrench of thought, forced away from her mind the sensation that Knight was in bodily danger. But attempt to help him she must.

His foot was propped by a bracket of quartz rock, balanced on the verge of the precipice. Fixed by this, he steadied her, her head being about a foot below the beginning of the slope. Elfride had dropped the glass; it rolled to the edge and vanished over it into a nether sky. \u2018Hold tightly to me,\u2019 he said.

Two glances told him a tale with ghastly distinctness. It was that, unless they performed their feat of getting up the slope with the precision of machines, they were over the edge and whirling in mid-air. For this purpose it was necessary that he should recover the breath and strength which his previous efforts had cost him.

It rolled over, out of sight, and away into the same nether sky that had engulfed the telescope. One of the tufts by which he held came out at the root, and Knight began to follow the quartz.

It arrested his further descent.

Knight pondered on the meaning of Elfride\u2019s hasty disappearance, but could not avoid an instinctive conclusion that there existed but a doubtful hope for him.

He could only look sternly at Nature\u2019s treacherous attempt to put an end to him, and strive to thwart her.

There is no place like a cleft landscape for bringing home such imaginings as these. Time closed up like a fan before him. He saw himself at one extremity of the years, face to face with the beginning and all the intermediate centuries simultaneously.

Further back, and overlapped by these, were perched huge-billed birds and swinish creatures as large as horses. Still more shadowy were the sinister crocodilian outlines--alligators and other uncouth shapes, culminating in the colossal lizard, the iguanodon. Folded behind were dragon forms and clouds of flying reptiles: still underneath were fishy beings of lower development; and so on, till the lifetime scenes of the fossil confronting him were a present and modern condition of things."}, {"size": 776, "text": "These images passed before Knight\u2019s inner eye in less than half a minute, and he was again considering the actual present. Was he to die? The mental picture of Elfride in the world, without himself to cherish her, smote his heart like a whip. He had hoped for deliverance, but what could a girl do? He dared not move an inch. Was Death really stretching out his hand? The previous sensation, that it was improbable he would die, was fainter now. However, Knight still clung to the cliff. To those musing weather-beaten West-country folk who pass the greater part of their days and nights out of doors, Nature seems to have moods in other than a poetical sense: predilections for certain deeds at certain times, without any apparent law to govern or season to account for them."}, {"size": 737, "text": "She is read as a person with a curious temper; as one who does not scatter kindnesses and cruelties alternately, impartially, and in order, but heartless severities or overwhelming generosities in lawless caprice.

In her unfriendly moments there seems a feline fun in her tricks, begotten by a foretaste of her pleasure in swallowing the victim. Such a way of thinking had been absurd to Knight, but he began to adopt it now. He was first spitted on to a rock. New tortures followed.

It rained upwards instead of down. The strong ascending air carried the rain-drops with it in its race up the escarpment, coming to him with such velocity that they stuck into his flesh like cold needles. Each drop was virtually a shaft, and it pierced him to his skin. The water-shafts seemed to lift him on their points: no downward rain ever had such a torturing effect.

Knight had over-estimated the strength of his hands. They were getting weak already. \u2018She will never come again; she has been gone ten minutes,\u2019 he said to himself.

The rain was quite ordinary in quantity; the air in temperature. It was, as is usual, the menacing attitude in which they approached him that magnified their powers.

The second and distant one was the moan of that unplummetted ocean below and afar--rubbing its restless flank against the Cliff without a Name. Knight perseveringly held fast.

Renounce a desire for a long-contested position, and go on another tack, and after a while the prize is thrown at you, seemingly in disappointment that no more tantalizing is possible.

In rowing seaward to a light-ship or sea-girt lighthouse, where, without any immediate terror of death, the inmates experience the gloom of monotonous seclusion, the grateful eloquence of their countenances at the greeting, expressive of thankfulness for the visit, is enough to stir the emotions of the most careless observer."}, {"size": 636, "text": "Knight\u2019s upward look at Elfride was of a nature with, but far transcending, such an instance as this.

His eyes passed all description in their combination of the whole diapason of eloquence, from lover\u2019s deep love to fellow-man\u2019s gratitude for a token of remembrance from one of his kind.

She looked down upon him, her face glistening with rain and tears. He smiled faintly. \u2018How calm he is!\u2019 she thought. \u2018How great and noble he is to be so calm!\u2019 She would have died ten times for him then.

There is nothing like a thorough drenching for reducing the protuberances of clothes, but Elfride\u2019s seemed to cling to her like a glove. Without heeding the attack of the clouds further than by raising her hand and wiping away the spirts of rain when they went more particularly into her eyes, she sat down and hurriedly began rending the linen into strips."}, {"size": 635, "text": "These she knotted end to end, and afterwards twisted them like the strands of a cord. In a short space of time she had formed a perfect rope by this means, six or seven yards long. \u2018Can you wait while I bind it?\u2019 she said, anxiously extending her gaze down to him. \u2018Yes, if not very long. Hope has given me a wonderful instalment of strength.\u2019 Elfride dropped her eyes again, tore the remaining material into narrow tape-like ligaments, knotted each to each as before, but on a smaller scale, and wound the lengthy string she had thus formed round and round the linen rope, which, without this binding, had a tendency to spread abroad."}, {"size": 722, "text": "\u2018Now,\u2019 said Knight, who, watching the proceedings intently, had by this time not only grasped her scheme, but reasoned further on, \u2018I can hold three minutes longer yet. And do you use the time in testing the strength of the knots, one by one.\u2019 She at once obeyed, tested each singly by putting her foot on the rope between each knot, and pulling with her hands. One of the knots slipped. \u2018Oh, think! It would have broken but for your forethought,\u2019 Elfride exclaimed apprehensively. She retied the two ends. The rope was now firm in every part. \u2018When you have let it down,\u2019 said Knight, already resuming his position of ruling power, \u2018go back from the edge of the slope, and over the bank as far as the rope will allow you."}, {"size": 694, "text": "Then lean down, and hold the end with both hands.\u2019 He had first thought of a safer plan for his own deliverance, but it involved the disadvantage of possibly endangering her life. \u2018I have tied it round my waist,\u2019 she cried, \u2018and I will lean directly upon the bank, holding with my hands as well.\u2019 It was the arrangement he had thought of, but would not suggest. \u2018I will raise and drop it three times when I am behind the bank,\u2019 she continued, \u2018to signify that I am ready. Take care, oh, take the greatest care, I beg you!\u2019 She dropped the rope over him, to learn how much of its length it would be necessary to expend on that side of the bank, went back, and disappeared as she had done before."}, {"size": 664, "text": "The rope was trailing by Knight\u2019s shoulders. In a few moments it twitched three times. He waited yet a second or two, then laid hold. The incline of this upper portion of the precipice, to the length only of a few feet, useless to a climber empty-handed, was invaluable now. Not more than half his weight depended entirely on the linen rope. Half a dozen extensions of the arms, alternating with half a dozen seizures of the rope with his feet, brought him up to the level of the soil. He was saved, and by Elfride. He extended his cramped limbs like an awakened sleeper, and sprang over the bank. At sight of him she leapt to her feet with almost a shriek of joy."}, {"size": 634, "text": "Knight\u2019s eyes met hers, and with supreme eloquence the glance of each told a long-concealed tale of emotion in that short half-moment. Moved by an impulse neither could resist, they ran together and into each other\u2019s arms. At the moment of embracing, Elfride\u2019s eyes involuntarily flashed towards the Puffin steamboat. It had doubled the point, and was no longer to be seen. An overwhelming rush of exultation at having delivered the man she revered from one of the most terrible forms of death, shook the gentle girl to the centre of her soul. It merged in a defiance of duty to Stephen, and a total recklessness as to plighted faith."}, {"size": 714, "text": "Every nerve of her will was now in entire subjection to her feeling--volition as a guiding power had forsaken her. To remain passive, as she remained now, encircled by his arms, was a sufficiently complete result--a glorious crown to all the years of her life. Perhaps he was only grateful, and did not love her. No matter: it was infinitely more to be even the slave of the greater than the queen of the less. Some such sensation as this, though it was not recognized as a finished thought, raced along the impressionable soul of Elfride. Regarding their attitude, it was impossible for two persons to go nearer to a kiss than went Knight and Elfride during those minutes of impulsive embrace in the pelting rain."}, {"size": 654, "text": "Yet they did not kiss. Knight\u2019s peculiarity of nature was such that it would not allow him to take advantage of the unguarded and passionate avowal she had tacitly made. Elfride recovered herself, and gently struggled to be free. He reluctantly relinquished her, and then surveyed her from crown to toe. She seemed as small as an infant. He perceived whence she had obtained the rope. \u2018Elfride, my Elfride!\u2019 he exclaimed in gratified amazement. \u2018I must leave you now,\u2019 she said, her face doubling its red, with an expression between gladness and shame \u2018You follow me, but at some distance.\u2019 \u2018The rain and wind pierce you through; the chill will kill you."}, {"size": 610, "text": "God bless you for such devotion! Take my coat and put it on.\u2019 \u2018No; I shall get warm running.\u2019 Elfride had absolutely nothing between her and the weather but her exterior robe or \u2018costume.\u2019 The door had been made upon a woman\u2019s wit, and it had found its way out. Behind the bank, whilst Knight reclined upon the dizzy slope waiting for death, she had taken off her whole clothing, and replaced only her outer bodice and skirt. Every thread of the remainder lay upon the ground in the form of a woollen and cotton rope. \u2018I am used to being wet through,\u2019 she added. \u2018I have been drenched on Pansy dozens of times."}, {"size": 680, "text": "Good-bye till we meet, clothed and in our right minds, by the fireside at home!\u2019 She then ran off from him through the pelting rain like a hare; or more like a pheasant when, scampering away with a lowered tail, it has a mind to fly, but does not. Elfride was soon out of sight. Knight felt uncomfortably wet and chilled, but glowing with fervour nevertheless. He fully appreciated Elfride\u2019s girlish delicacy in refusing his escort in the meagre habiliments she wore, yet felt that necessary abstraction of herself for a short half-hour as a most grievous loss to him. He gathered up her knotted and twisted plumage of linen, lace, and embroidery work, and laid it across his arm."}, {"size": 815, "text": "He noticed on the ground an envelope, limp and wet. In endeavouring to restore this to its proper shape, he loosened from the envelope a piece of paper it had contained, which was seized by the wind in falling from Knight\u2019s hand. It was blown to the right, blown to the left--it floated to the edge of the cliff and over the sea, where it was hurled aloft. It twirled in the air, and then flew back over his head. Knight followed the paper, and secured it. Having done so, he looked to discover if it had been worth securing. The troublesome sheet was a banker\u2019s receipt for two hundred pounds, placed to the credit of Miss Swancourt, which the impractical girl had totally forgotten she carried with her. Knight folded it as carefully as its moist condition would allow, put it in his pocket, and followed Elfride."}, {"size": 624, "text": "\u2018Should auld acquaintance be forgot?\u2019 By this time Stephen Smith had stepped out upon the quay at Castle Boterel, and breathed his native air. A darker skin, a more pronounced moustache, and an incipient beard, were the chief additions and changes noticeable in his appearance.In spite of the falling rain, which had somewhat lessened, he took a small valise in his hand, and, leaving the remainder of his luggage at the inn, ascended the hills towards East Endelstow. This place lay in a vale of its own, further inland than the west village, and though so near it, had little of physical feature in common with the latter."}, {"size": 879, "text": "East Endelstow was more wooded and fertile: it boasted of Lord Luxellian\u2019s mansion and park, and was free from those bleak open uplands which lent such an air of desolation to the vicinage of the coast--always excepting the small valley in which stood the vicarage and Mrs. Swancourt\u2019s old house, The Crags. Stephen had arrived nearly at the summit of the ridge when the rain again increased its volume, and, looking about for temporary shelter, he ascended a steep path which penetrated dense hazel bushes in the lower part of its course. Further up it emerged upon a ledge immediately over the turnpike-road, and sheltered by an overhanging face of rubble rock, with bushes above. For a reason of his own he made this spot his refuge from the storm, and turning his face to the left, conned the landscape as a book. He was overlooking the valley containing Elfride\u2019s residence."}, {"size": 715, "text": "From this point of observation the prospect exhibited the peculiarity of being either brilliant foreground or the subdued tone of distance, a sudden dip in the surface of the country lowering out of sight all the intermediate prospect. In apparent contact with the trees and bushes growing close beside him appeared the distant tract, terminated suddenly by the brink of the series of cliffs which culminated in the tall giant without a name--small and unimportant as here beheld. A leaf on a bough at Stephen\u2019s elbow blotted out a whole hill in the contrasting district far away; a green bunch of nuts covered a complete upland there, and the great cliff itself was outvied by a pigmy crag in the bank hard by him."}, {"size": 661, "text": "Stephen had looked upon these things hundreds of times before to-day, but he had never viewed them with such tenderness as now. Stepping forward in this direction yet a little further, he could see the tower of West Endelstow Church, beneath which he was to meet his Elfride that night. And at the same time he noticed, coming over the hill from the cliffs, a white speck in motion. It seemed first to be a sea-gull flying low, but ultimately proved to be a human figure, running with great rapidity. The form flitted on, heedless of the rain which had caused Stephen\u2019s halt in this place, dropped down the heathery hill, entered the vale, and was out of sight."}, {"size": 626, "text": "Whilst he meditated upon the meaning of this phenomenon, he was surprised to see swim into his ken from the same point of departure another moving speck, as different from the first as well could be, insomuch that it was perceptible only by its blackness. Slowly and regularly it took the same course, and there was not much doubt that this was the form of a man. He, too, gradually descended from the upper levels, and was lost in the valley below. The rain had by this time again abated, and Stephen returned to the road. Looking ahead, he saw two men and a cart. They were soon obscured by the intervention of a high hedge."}, {"size": 610, "text": "Just before they emerged again he heard voices in conversation. \u2018\u2019A must soon be in the naibourhood, too, if so be he\u2019s a-coming,\u2019 said a tenor tongue, which Stephen instantly recognized as Martin Cannister\u2019s. \u2018\u2019A must \u2018a b\u2019lieve,\u2019 said another voice--that of Stephen\u2019s father.

The presence of William Worm was the most awkward feature of the case, for, though Worm had left the house of Mr. Swancourt, the being hand-in-glove with a ci-devant servitor reminded Stephen too forcibly of the vicar\u2019s classification of himself before he went from England.

Soon ascending from the lower levels he turned a corner, followed a cart-track, and saw the tower of the church he was in quest of distinctly shaped forth against the sky. In less than half an hour from the time of starting he swung himself over the churchyard stile. The wild irregular enclosure was as much as ever an integral part of the old hill. The grass was still long, the graves were shaped precisely as passing years chose to alter them from their orthodox form as laid down by Martin Cannister, and by Stephen\u2019s own grandfather before him."}, {"size": 644, "text": "A sound sped into the air from the direction in which Castle Boterel lay.

Nine o\u2019clock. It was the hour Elfride had herself named as the most convenient for meeting him. Stephen stood at the door of the porch and listened. He could have heard the softest breathing of any person within the porch; nobody was there."}, {"size": 642, "text": "He went inside the doorway, sat down upon the stone bench, and waited with a beating heart. The faint sounds heard only accentuated the silence. The rising and falling of the sea, far away along the coast, was the most important. A minor sound was the scurr of a distant night-hawk. Among the minutest where all were minute were the light settlement of gossamer fragments floating in the air, a toad humbly labouring along through the grass near the entrance, the crackle of a dead leaf which a worm was endeavouring to pull into the earth, a waft of air, getting nearer and nearer, and expiring at his feet under the burden of a winged seed."}, {"size": 627, "text": "Among all these soft sounds came not the only soft sound he cared to hear--the footfall of Elfride. For a whole quarter of an hour Stephen sat thus intent, without moving a muscle. At the end of that time he walked to the west front of the church. Turning the corner of the tower, a white form stared him in the face. He started back, and recovered himself. It was the tomb of young farmer Jethway, looking still as fresh and as new as when it was first erected, the white stone in which it was hewn having a singular weirdness amid the dark blue slabs from local quarries, of which the whole remaining gravestones were formed."}, {"size": 674, "text": "He thought of the night when he had sat thereon with Elfride as his companion, and well remembered his regret that she had received, even unwillingly, earlier homage than his own. But his present tangible anxiety reduced such a feeling to sentimental nonsense in comparison; and he strolled on over the graves to the border of the churchyard, whence in the daytime could be clearly seen the vicarage and the present residence of the Swancourts. No footstep was discernible upon the path up the hill, but a light was shining from a window in the last-named house. Stephen knew there could be no mistake about the time or place, and no difficulty about keeping the engagement."}, {"size": 735, "text": "He waited yet longer, passing from impatience into a mood which failed to take any account of the lapse of time. He was awakened from his reverie by Castle Boterel clock. One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, TEN. One little fall of the hammer in addition to the number it had been sharp pleasure to hear, and what a difference to him! He left the churchyard on the side opposite to his point of entrance, and went down the hill. Slowly he drew near the gate of her house. This he softly opened, and walked up the gravel drive to the door. Here he paused for several minutes. At the expiration of that time the murmured speech of a manly voice came out to his ears through an open window behind the corner of the house."}, {"size": 653, "text": "This was responded to by a clear soft laugh. It was the laugh of Elfride. Stephen was conscious of a gnawing pain at his heart. He retreated as he had come. There are disappointments which wring us, and there are those which inflict a wound whose mark we bear to our graves. Such are so keen that no future gratification of the same desire can ever obliterate them: they become registered as a permanent loss of happiness. Such a one was Stephen\u2019s now: the crowning aureola of the dream had been the meeting here by stealth; and if Elfride had come to him only ten minutes after he had turned away, the disappointment would have been recognizable still."}, {"size": 780, "text": "When the young man reached home he found there a letter which had arrived in his absence. Believing it to contain some reason for her non-appearance, yet unable to imagine one that could justify her, he hastily tore open the envelope. The paper contained not a word from Elfride. It was the deposit-note for his two hundred pounds. On the back was the form of a cheque, and this she had filled up with the same sum, payable to the bearer. Stephen was confounded. He attempted to divine her motive. Considering how limited was his knowledge of her later actions, he guessed rather shrewdly that, between the time of her sending the note in the morning and the evening\u2019s silent refusal of his gift, something had occurred which had caused a total change in her attitude towards him."}, {"size": 662, "text": "He knew not what to do. It seemed absurd now to go to her father next morning, as he had purposed, and ask for an engagement with her, a possibility impending all the while that Elfride herself would not be on his side. Only one course recommended itself as wise. To wait and see what the days would bring forth; to go and execute his commissions in Birmingham; then to return, learn if anything had happened, and try what a meeting might do; perhaps her surprise at his backwardness would bring her forward to show latent warmth as decidedly as in old times. This act of patience was in keeping only with the nature of a man precisely of Stephen\u2019s constitution."}, {"size": 457, "text": "Nine men out of ten would perhaps have rushed off, got into her presence, by fair means or foul, and provoked a catastrophe of some sort. Possibly for the better, probably for the worse. He started for Birmingham the next morning. A day\u2019s delay would have made no difference; but he could not rest until he had begun and ended the programme proposed to himself. Bodily activity will sometimes take the sting out of anxiety as completely as assurance itself."}, {"size": 665, "text": "\u2018Mine own familiar friend.\u2019 During these days of absence Stephen lived under alternate conditions. Whenever his emotions were active, he was in agony. Whenever he was not in agony, the business in hand had driven out of his mind by sheer force all deep reflection on the subject of Elfride and love. By the time he took his return journey at the week\u2019s end, Stephen had very nearly worked himself up to an intention to call and see her face to face. On this occasion also he adopted his favourite route--by the little summer steamer from Bristol to Castle Boterel; the time saved by speed on the railway being wasted at junctions, and in following a devious course."}, {"size": 888, "text": "It was a bright silent evening at the beginning of September when Smith again set foot in the little town. He felt inclined to linger awhile upon the quay before ascending the hills, having formed a romantic intention to go home by way of her house, yet not wishing to wander in its neighbourhood till the evening shades should sufficiently screen him from observation. And thus waiting for night\u2019s nearer approach, he watched the placid scene, over which the pale luminosity of the west cast a sorrowful monochrome, that became slowly embrowned by the dusk. A star appeared, and another, and another. They sparkled amid the yards and rigging of the two coal brigs lying alangside, as if they had been tiny lamps suspended in the ropes. The masts rocked sleepily to the infinitesimal flux of the tide, which clucked and gurgled with idle regularity in nooks and holes of the harbour wall."}, {"size": 687, "text": "The twilight was now quite pronounced enough for his purpose; and as, rather sad at heart, he was about to move on, a little boat containing two persons glided up the middle of the harbour with the lightness of a shadow. The boat came opposite him, passed on, and touched the landing-steps at the further end. One of its occupants was a man, as Stephen had known by the easy stroke of the oars. When the pair ascended the steps, and came into greater prominence, he was enabled to discern that the second personage was a woman; also that she wore a white decoration--apparently a feather--in her hat or bonnet, which spot of white was the only distinctly visible portion of her clothing."}, {"size": 830, "text": "Stephen remained a moment in their rear, and they passed on, when he pursued his way also, and soon forgot the circumstance. Having crossed a bridge, forsaken the high road, and entered the footpath which led up the vale to West Endelstow, he heard a little wicket click softly together some yards ahead. By the time that Stephen had reached the wicket and passed it, he heard another click of precisely the same nature from another gate yet further on. Clearly some person or persons were preceding him along the path, their footsteps being rendered noiseless by the soft carpet of turf. Stephen now walked a little quicker, and perceived two forms. One of them bore aloft the white feather he had noticed in the woman\u2019s hat on the quay: they were the couple he had seen in the boat. Stephen dropped a little further to the rear."}, {"size": 602, "text": "From the bottom of the valley, along which the path had hitherto lain, beside the margin of the trickling streamlet, another path now diverged, and ascended the slope of the left-hand hill. This footway led only to the residence of Mrs. Swancourt and a cottage or two in its vicinity. No grass covered this diverging path in portions of its length, and Stephen was reminded that the pair in front of him had taken this route by the occasional rattle of loose stones under their feet. Stephen climbed in the same direction, but for some undefined reason he trod more softly than did those preceding him."}, {"size": 832, "text": "His mind was unconsciously in exercise upon whom the woman might be--whether a visitor to The Crags, a servant, or Elfride. He put it to himself yet more forcibly; could the lady be Elfride? A possible reason for her unaccountable failure to keep the appointment with him returned with painful force. They entered the grounds of the house by the side wicket, whence the path, now wide and well trimmed, wound fantastically through the shrubbery to an octagonal pavilion called the Belvedere, by reason of the comprehensive view over the adjacent district that its green seats afforded. The path passed this erection and went on to the house as well as to the gardener\u2019s cottage on the other side, straggling thence to East Endelstow; so that Stephen felt no hesitation in entering a promenade which could scarcely be called private."}, {"size": 607, "text": "He fancied that he heard the gate open and swing together again behind him. Turning, he saw nobody. The people of the boat came to the summer-house. One of them spoke. \u2018I am afraid we shall get a scolding for being so late.\u2019 Stephen instantly recognised the familiar voice, richer and fuller now than it used to be. \u2018Elfride!\u2019 he whispered to himself, and held fast by a sapling, to steady himself under the agitation her presence caused him. His heart swerved from its beat; he shunned receiving the meaning he sought. \u2018A breeze is rising again; how the ash tree rustles!\u2019 said Elfride. \u2018Don\u2019t you hear it?"}, {"size": 644, "text": "I wonder what the time is.\u2019 Stephen relinquished the sapling. \u2018I will get a light and tell you. Step into the summer-house; the air is quiet there.\u2019 The cadence of that voice--its peculiarity seemed to come home to him like that of some notes of the northern birds on his return to his native clime, as an old natural thing renewed, yet not particularly noticed as natural before that renewal. They entered the Belvedere. In the lower part it was formed of close wood-work nailed crosswise, and had openings in the upper by way of windows. The scratch of a striking light was heard, and a bright glow radiated from the interior of the building."}, {"size": 638, "text": "The light gave birth to dancing leaf-shadows, stem-shadows, lustrous streaks, dots, sparkles, and threads of silver sheen of all imaginable variety and transience. It awakened gnats, which flew towards it, revealed shiny gossamer threads, disturbed earthworms. Stephen gave but little attention to these phenomena, and less time. He saw in the summer-house a strongly illuminated picture. First, the face of his friend and preceptor Henry Knight, between whom and himself an estrangement had arisen, not from any definite causes beyond those of absence, increasing age, and diverging sympathies. Next, his bright particular star, Elfride."}, {"size": 614, "text": "The face of Elfride was more womanly than when she had called herself his, but as clear and healthy as ever. Her plenteous twines of beautiful hair were looking much as usual, with the exception of a slight modification in their arrangement in deference to the changes of fashion. Their two foreheads were close together, almost touching, and both were looking down. Elfride was holding her watch, Knight was holding the light with one hand, his left arm being round her waist. Part of the scene reached Stephen\u2019s eyes through the horizontal bars of woodwork, which crossed their forms like the ribs of a skeleton."}, {"size": 635, "text": "Knight\u2019s arm stole still further round the waist of Elfride. \u2018It is half-past eight,\u2019 she said in a low voice, which had a peculiar music in it, seemingly born of a thrill of pleasure at the new proof that she was beloved. The flame dwindled down, died away, and all was wrapped in a darkness to which the gloom before the illumination bore no comparison in apparent density. Stephen, shattered in spirit and sick to his heart\u2019s centre, turned away. In turning, he saw a shadowy outline behind the summer-house on the other side. His eyes grew accustomed to the darkness. Was the form a human form, or was it an opaque bush of juniper?"}, {"size": 710, "text": "The lovers arose, brushed against the laurestines, and pursued their way to the house. The indistinct figure had moved, and now passed across Smith\u2019s front. So completely enveloped was the person, that it was impossible to discern him or her any more than as a shape. The shape glided noiselessly on. Stephen stepped forward, fearing any mischief was intended to the other two. \u2018Who are you?\u2019 he said. \u2018Never mind who I am,\u2019 answered a weak whisper from the enveloping folds. \u2018WHAT I am, may she be! Perhaps I knew well--ah, so well!--a youth whose place you took, as he there now takes yours. Will you let her break your heart, and bring you to an untimely grave, as she did the one before you?\u2019 \u2018You are Mrs."}, {"size": 637, "text": "Jethway, I think. What do you do here? And why do you talk so wildly?\u2019 \u2018Because my heart is desolate, and nobody cares about it. May hers be so that brought trouble upon me!\u2019 \u2018Silence!\u2019 said Stephen, staunch to Elfride in spite of himself. \u2018She would harm nobody wilfully, never would she! How do you come here?\u2019 \u2018I saw the two coming up the path, and wanted to learn if she were not one of them. Can I help disliking her if I think of the past? Can I help watching her if I remember my boy? Can I help ill-wishing her if I well-wish him?\u2019 The bowed form went on, passed through the wicket, and was enveloped by the shadows of the field."}, {"size": 660, "text": "Stephen had heard that Mrs. Jethway, since the death of her son, had become a crazed, forlorn woman; and bestowing a pitying thought upon her, he dismissed her fancied wrongs from his mind, but not her condemnation of Elfride\u2019s faithlessness. That entered into and mingled with the sensations his new experience had begotten. The tale told by the little scene he had witnessed ran parallel with the unhappy woman\u2019s opinion, which, however baseless it might have been antecedently, had become true enough as regarded himself. A slow weight of despair, as distinct from a violent paroxysm as starvation from a mortal shot, filled him and wrung him body and soul."}, {"size": 872, "text": "The discovery had not been altogether unexpected, for throughout his anxiety of the last few days since the night in the churchyard, he had been inclined to construe the uncertainty unfavourably for himself. His hopes for the best had been but periodic interruptions to a chronic fear of the worst. A strange concomitant of his misery was the singularity of its form. That his rival should be Knight, whom once upon a time he had adored as a man is very rarely adored by another in modern times, and whom he loved now, added deprecation to sorrow, and cynicism to both. Henry Knight, whose praises he had so frequently trumpeted in her ears, of whom she had actually been jealous, lest she herself should be lessened in Stephen\u2019s love on account of him, had probably won her the more easily by reason of those very praises which he had only ceased to utter by her command."}, {"size": 764, "text": "She had ruled him like a queen in that matter, as in all others. Stephen could tell by her manner, brief as had been his observation of it, and by her words, few as they were, that her position was far different with Knight. That she looked up at and adored her new lover from below his pedestal, was even more perceptible than that she had smiled down upon Stephen from a height above him. The suddenness of Elfride\u2019s renunciation of himself was food for more torture. To an unimpassioned outsider, it admitted of at least two interpretations--it might either have proceeded from an endeavour to be faithful to her first choice, till the lover seen absolutely overpowered the lover remembered, or from a wish not to lose his love till sure of the love of another."}, {"size": 600, "text": "But to Stephen Smith the motive involved in the latter alternative made it untenable where Elfride was the actor. He mused on her letters to him, in which she had never mentioned a syllable concerning Knight. It is desirable, however, to observe that only in two letters could she possibly have done so. One was written about a week before Knight\u2019s arrival, when, though she did not mention his promised coming to Stephen, she had hardly a definite reason in her mind for neglecting to do it. In the next she did casually allude to Knight. But Stephen had left Bombay long before that letter arrived."}, {"size": 791, "text": "Stephen looked at the black form of the adjacent house, where it cut a dark polygonal notch out of the sky, and felt that he hated the spot. He did not know many facts of the case, but could not help instinctively associating Elfride\u2019s fickleness with the marriage of her father, and their introduction to London society. He closed the iron gate bounding the shrubbery as noiselessly as he had opened it, and went into the grassy field. Here he could see the old vicarage, the house alone that was associated with the sweet pleasant time of his incipient love for Elfride.

An unusual feature in the tolling was that it had not been begun according to the custom in Endelstow and other parishes in the neighbourhood. At every death the sex and age of the deceased were announced by a system of changes. Three times three strokes signified that the departed one was a man; three times two, a woman; twice three, a boy; twice two, a girl.

Stephen reached the brow of the hill, and felt inclined to renounce his idea. His mood was such that talking to any person to whom he could not unburden himself would be wearisome. However, before he could put any inclination into effect, the young man saw from amid the trees a bright light shining, the rays from which radiated like needles through the sad plumy foliage of the yews.

His old sense of indebtedness to Knight had never wholly forsaken him; his love for Elfride was generous now.

It is difficult to frame rules which shall apply to both sexes, and Elfride, an undeveloped girl, must, perhaps, hardly be laden with the moral responsibilities which attach to a man in like circumstances.

I specially mean by honesty, fairness not only in matters of business and social detail, but in all the delicate dealings of love, to which the licence given to your sex particularly refers.\u2019 Elfride looked troublously at the trees. \u2018Now let us go on to the river, Elfie.\u2019 \u2018I would if I had a hat on,\u2019 she said with a sort of suppressed woe."}, {"size": 696, "text": "\u2018I will get it for you,\u2019 said Knight, very willing to purchase her companionship at so cheap a price. \u2018You sit down there a minute.\u2019 And he turned and walked rapidly back to the house for the article in question. Elfride sat down upon one of the rustic benches which adorned this portion of the grounds, and remained with her eyes upon the grass. She was induced to lift them by hearing the brush of light and irregular footsteps hard by. Passing along the path which intersected the one she was in and traversed the outer shrubberies, Elfride beheld the farmer\u2019s widow, Mrs. Jethway.

Why did you disturb me? Mustn\u2019t I trespass here?\u2019 \u2018You may walk here if you like, Mrs. Jethway. I do not disturb you.\u2019 \u2018You disturb my mind, and my mind is my whole life; for my boy is there still, and he is gone from my body.\u2019 \u2018Yes, poor young man.

Yes, Miss Swancourt,\u2019 she said in an excited whisper, \u2018you killed my son!\u2019 \u2018How can you be so wicked and foolish!\u2019 replied Elfride, rising indignantly.

And if you consider that nothing, Miss Swancourt,\u2019 she continued, drawing closer; \u2018it led on to what was very serious indeed. Have you forgotten the would-be runaway marriage?

It was the last day but one previous to their departure for St. Leonards; and Knight seemed to have a purpose in being much in her company that day. They rambled along the valley.

The river--such as it was--here pursued its course amid flagstones as level as a pavement, but divided by crevices of irregular width. With the summer drought the torrent had narrowed till it was now but a thread of crystal clearness, meandering along a central channel in the rocky bed of the winter current."}, {"size": 622, "text": "Knight scrambled through the bushes which at this point nearly covered the brook from sight, and leapt down upon the dry portion of the river bottom. \u2018Elfride, I never saw such a sight!\u2019 he exclaimed. \u2018The hazels overhang the river\u2019s course in a perfect arch, and the floor is beautifully paved. The place reminds one of the passages of a cloister. Let me help you down.\u2019 He assisted her through the marginal underwood and down to the stones.

I believe--am almost sure, in fact--that if statistics could be obtained on the subject, you would find the persons with thin hair were those who had a superabundance originally, and that those who start with a moderate quantity retain it without much loss.\u2019 Elfride\u2019s troubles sat upon her face as well as in her heart.

The stillness of things was disturbed by a bird coming to the streamlet to drink.

My thought was, would it be right to let you?\u2019 \u2018Then I will!\u2019 he rejoined, with that singular earnestness about a small matter--in the eyes of a ladies\u2019 man but a momentary peg for flirtation or jest--which is only found in deep natures who have been wholly unused to toying with womankind, and which, from its unwontedness, is in itself a tribute the most precious that can be rendered, and homage the most exquisite to be received."}, {"size": 508, "text": "\u2018And you shall,\u2019 she whispered, without reserve, and no longer mistress of the ceremonies.

At the touch, the sensation of both seemed to be concentrated at the point of contact.

Now turn round, dearest.\u2019 She was powerless to disobey, and turned forthwith; and then, without any defined intention in either\u2019s mind, his face and hers drew closer together; and he supported her there, and kissed her. Knight was at once the most ardent and the coolest man alive. When his emotions slumbered he appeared almost phlegmatic; when they were moved he was no less than passionate. And now, without having quite intended an early marriage, he put the question plainly."}, {"size": 619, "text": "It came with all the ardour which was the accumulation of long years behind a natural reserve. \u2018Elfride, when shall we be married?\u2019 The words were sweet to her; but there was a bitter in the sweet. These newly-overt acts of his, which had culminated in this plain question, coming on the very day of Mrs. Jethway\u2019s blasting reproaches, painted distinctly her fickleness as an enormity. Loving him in secret had not seemed such thorough-going inconstancy as the same love recognized and acted upon in the face of threats.

It may be said that his blindness in love proved the point, for shrewdness in love usually goes with meanness in general. Once the passion had mastered him, the intellect had gone for naught. Knight, as a lover, was more single-minded and far simpler than his friend Stephen, who in other capacities was shallow beside him. Without saying more on the subject of their marriage, Knight held her at arm\u2019s length, as if she had been a large bouquet, and looked at her with critical affection."}, {"size": 516, "text": "\u2018Does your pretty gift become me?\u2019 she inquired, with tears of excitement on the fringes of her eyes. \u2018Undoubtedly, perfectly!\u2019 said her lover, adopting a lighter tone to put her at her ease. \u2018Ah, you should see them; you look shinier than ever.

Elfride objected to a second, and flung away her face, the movement causing a slight disarrangement of hat and hair. Hardly thinking what she said in the trepidation of the moment, she exclaimed, clapping her hand to her ear-- \u2018Ah, we must be careful!

All animation was suspended till Providence should raise the water and let them go. \u2018I have been thinking,\u2019 said Knight, \u2018that we have come amongst the rarest class of people in the kingdom.

The afternoon wore on. Mrs. Swancourt kindly sat apart by herself reading, and the betrothed pair were left to themselves. Elfride clung trustingly to Knight\u2019s arm, and proud was she to walk with him up and down the deck, or to go forward, and leaning with him against the forecastle rails, watch the setting sun gradually withdrawing itself over their stern into a huge bank of livid cloud with golden edges that rose to meet it."}, {"size": 889, "text": "She was childishly full of life and spirits, though in walking up and down with him before the other passengers, and getting noticed by them, she was at starting rather confused, it being the first time she had shown herself so openly under that kind of protection. \u2018I expect they are envious and saying things about us, don\u2019t you?\u2019 she would whisper to Knight with a stealthy smile. \u2018Oh no,\u2019 he would answer unconcernedly. \u2018Why should they envy us, and what can they say?\u2019 \u2018Not any harm, of course,\u2019 Elfride replied, \u2018except such as this: \u201cHow happy those two are! she is proud enough now.\u201d What makes it worse,\u2019 she continued in the extremity of confidence, \u2018I heard those two cricketing men say just now, \u201cShe\u2019s the nobbiest girl on the boat.\u201d But I don\u2019t mind it, you know, Harry.\u2019 \u2018I should hardly have supposed you did, even if you had not told me,\u2019 said Knight with great blandness."}, {"size": 662, "text": "She was never tired of asking her lover questions and admiring his answers, good, bad, or indifferent as they might be.

This fair daybreak, however, soon changed its aspect. A cold wind and a pale mist descended upon the sea, and seemed to threaten a dreary day."}, {"size": 670, "text": "When they were nearing Southampton, Mrs. Swancourt came to say that her husband was so ill that he wished to be put on shore here, and left to do the remainder of the journey by land. \u2018He will be perfectly well directly he treads firm ground again. Which shall we do--go with him, or finish our voyage as we intended?\u2019 Elfride was comfortably housed under an umbrella which Knight was holding over her to keep off the wind. \u2018Oh, don\u2019t let us go on shore!\u2019 she said with dismay. \u2018It would be such a pity!\u2019 \u2018That\u2019s very fine,\u2019 said Mrs. Swancourt archly, as to a child. \u2018See, the wind has increased her colour, the sea her appetite and spirits, and somebody her happiness."}, {"size": 630, "text": "Yes, it would be a pity, certainly.\u2019 \u2018\u2019Tis my misfortune to be always spoken to from a pedestal,\u2019 sighed Elfride. \u2018Well, we will do as you like, Mrs. Swancourt,\u2019 said Knight, \u2018but----\u2019 \u2018I myself would rather remain on board,\u2019 interrupted the elder lady. \u2018And Mr. Swancourt particularly wishes to go by himself. So that shall settle the matter.\u2019 The vicar, now a drab colour, was put ashore, and became as well as ever forthwith. Elfride, sitting alone in a retired part of the vessel, saw a veiled woman walk aboard among the very latest arrivals at this port. She was clothed in black silk, and carried a dark shawl upon her arm."}, {"size": 702, "text": "The woman, without looking around her, turned to the quarter allotted to the second-cabin passengers. All the carnation Mrs. Swancourt had complimented her step-daughter upon possessing left Elfride\u2019s cheeks, and she trembled visibly. She ran to the other side of the boat, where Mrs. Swancourt was standing. \u2018Let us go home by railway with papa, after all,\u2019 she pleaded earnestly. \u2018I would rather go with him--shall we?\u2019 Mrs. Swancourt looked around for a moment, as if unable to decide. \u2018Ah,\u2019 she exclaimed, \u2018it is too late now. Why did not you say so before, when we had plenty of time?\u2019 The Juliet had at that minute let go, the engines had started, and they were gliding slowly away from the quay."}, {"size": 732, "text": "There was no help for it but to remain, unless the Juliet could be made to put back, and that would create a great disturbance. Elfride gave up the idea and submitted quietly. Her happiness was sadly mutilated now. The woman whose presence had so disturbed her was exactly like Mrs. Jethway. She seemed to haunt Elfride like a shadow. After several minutes\u2019 vain endeavour to account for any design Mrs. Jethway could have in watching her, Elfride decided to think that, if it were the widow, the encounter was accidental. She remembered that the widow in her restlessness was often visiting the village near Southampton, which was her original home, and it was possible that she chose water-transit with the idea of saving expense."}, {"size": 701, "text": "\u2018What is the matter, Elfride?\u2019 Knight inquired, standing before her. \u2018Nothing more than that I am rather depressed.\u2019 \u2018I don\u2019t much wonder at it; that wharf was depressing. We seemed underneath and inferior to everything around us. But we shall be in the sea breeze again soon, and that will freshen you, dear.\u2019 The evening closed in and dusk increased as they made way down Southampton Water and through the Solent. Elfride\u2019s disturbance of mind was such that her light spirits of the foregoing four and twenty hours had entirely deserted her. The weather too had grown more gloomy, for though the showers of the morning had ceased, the sky was covered more closely than ever with dense leaden clouds."}, {"size": 889, "text": "How beautiful was the sunset when they rounded the North Foreland the previous evening! now it was impossible to tell within half an hour the time of the luminary\u2019s going down. Knight led her about, and being by this time accustomed to her sudden changes of mood, overlooked the necessity of a cause in regarding the conditions--impressionableness and elasticity. Elfride looked stealthily to the other end of the vessel. Mrs. Jethway, or her double, was sitting at the stern--her eye steadily regarding Elfride. \u2018Let us go to the forepart,\u2019 she said quickly to Knight. \u2018See there--the man is fixing the lights for the night.\u2019 Knight assented, and after watching the operation of fixing the red and the green lights on the port and starboard bows, and the hoisting of the white light to the masthead, he walked up and down with her till the increase of wind rendered promenading difficult."}, {"size": 690, "text": "Elfride\u2019s eyes were occasionally to be found furtively gazing abaft, to learn if her enemy were really there. Nobody was visible now. \u2018Shall we go below?\u2019 said Knight, seeing that the deck was nearly deserted. \u2018No,\u2019 she said. \u2018If you will kindly get me a rug from Mrs. Swancourt, I should like, if you don\u2019t mind, to stay here.\u2019 She had recently fancied the assumed Mrs. Jethway might be a first-class passenger, and dreaded meeting her by accident. Knight appeared with the rug, and they sat down behind a weather-cloth on the windward side, just as the two red eyes of the Needles glared upon them from the gloom, their pointed summits rising like shadowy phantom figures against the sky."}, {"size": 612, "text": "It became necessary to go below to an eight-o\u2019clock meal of nondescript kind, and Elfride was immensely relieved at finding no sign of Mrs. Jethway there. They again ascended, and remained above till Mrs. Snewson staggered up to them with the message that Mrs. Swancourt thought it was time for Elfride to come below. Knight accompanied her down, and returned again to pass a little more time on deck. Elfride partly undressed herself and lay down, and soon became unconscious, though her sleep was light. How long she had lain, she knew not, when by slow degrees she became cognizant of a whispering in her ear."}, {"size": 662, "text": "\u2018You are well on with him, I can see. Well, provoke me now, but my day will come, you will find.\u2019 That seemed to be the utterance, or words to that effect. Elfride became broad awake and terrified. She knew the words, if real, could be only those of one person, and that person the widow Jethway. The lamp had gone out and the place was in darkness. In the next berth she could hear her stepmother breathing heavily, further on Snewson breathing more heavily still. These were the only other legitimate occupants of the cabin, and Mrs. Jethway must have stealthily come in by some means and retreated again, or else she had entered an empty berth next Snewson\u2019s."}, {"size": 677, "text": "The fear that this was the case increased Elfride\u2019s perturbation, till it assumed the dimensions of a certainty, for how could a stranger from the other end of the ship possibly contrive to get in? Could it have been a dream? Elfride raised herself higher and looked out of the window. There was the sea, floundering and rushing against the ship\u2019s side just by her head, and thence stretching away, dim and moaning, into an expanse of indistinctness; and far beyond all this two placid lights like rayless stars. Now almost fearing to turn her face inwards again, lest Mrs. Jethway should appear at her elbow, Elfride meditated upon whether to call Snewson to keep her company."}, {"size": 654, "text": "\u2018Four bells\u2019 sounded, and she heard voices, which gave her a little courage. It was not worth while to call Snewson. At any rate Elfride could not stay there panting longer, at the risk of being again disturbed by that dreadful whispering. So wrapping herself up hurriedly she emerged into the passage, and by the aid of a faint light burning at the entrance to the saloon found the foot of the stairs, and ascended to the deck. Dreary the place was in the extreme. It seemed a new spot altogether in contrast with its daytime self. She could see the glowworm light from the binnacle, and the dim outline of the man at the wheel; also a form at the bows."}, {"size": 634, "text": "Not another soul was apparent from stem to stern. Yes, there were two more--by the bulwarks. One proved to be her Harry, the other the mate. She was glad indeed, and on drawing closer found they were holding a low slow chat about nautical affairs. She ran up and slipped her hand through Knight\u2019s arm, partly for love, partly for stability. \u2018Elfie! not asleep?\u2019 said Knight, after moving a few steps aside with her. \u2018No: I cannot sleep. May I stay here? It is so dismal down there, and--and I was afraid. Where are we now?\u2019 \u2018Due south of Portland Bill. Those are the lights abeam of us: look.

Yes: we will stay, and watch the approach of day.\u2019 So they again sought out the sheltered nook, and sitting down wrapped themselves in the rug as before. \u2018What were you going to ask me?\u2019 he inquired, as they undulated up and down."}, {"size": 758, "text": "\u2018Oh, it was not much--perhaps a thing I ought not to ask,\u2019 she said hesitatingly.

Mrs. Jethway\u2019s seeming words had so depressed the girl that she herself now painted her flight in the darkest colours, and longed to ease her burdened mind by an instant confession. If Knight had ever been imprudent himself, he might, she hoped, forgive all. \u2018I wanted to ask you,\u2019 she went on, \u2018if--you had ever been engaged before.\u2019 She added tremulously, \u2018I hope you have--I mean, I don\u2019t mind at all if you have.\u2019 \u2018No, I never was,\u2019 Knight instantly and heartily replied."}, {"size": 361, "text": "\u2018Elfride\u2019--and there was a certain happy pride in his tone--\u2018I am twelve years older than you, and I have been about the world, and, in a way, into society, and you have not.

Perhaps it was human and correctly natural that Knight never once thought whether he did not owe her a little sacrifice for her unchary devotion in saving his life.

His former friend\u2019s days had become cankered in some way: Knight was a changed man. He himself had changed much, but not as Knight had changed. \u2018Yesterday I came home,\u2019 continued Knight, \u2018without having, to the best of my belief, imbibed half-a-dozen ideas worth retaining.\u2019 \u2018You out-Hamlet Hamlet in morbidness of mood,\u2019 said Stephen, with regretful frankness."}, {"size": 378, "text": "Knight made no reply. \u2018Do you know,\u2019 Stephen continued, \u2018I could almost have sworn that you would be married before this time, from what I saw?\u2019 Knight\u2019s face grew harder. \u2018Could you?\u2019 he said. Stephen was powerless to forsake the depressing, luring subject. \u2018Yes; and I simply wonder at it.\u2019 \u2018Whom did you expect me to marry?\u2019 \u2018Her I saw you with.\u2019 \u2018Thank you for that wonder.\u2019"}, {"size": 619, "text": "\u2018Smith, now one word to you,\u2019 Knight returned steadily. \u2018Don\u2019t you ever question me on that subject.

As good a reason as you had for not marrying her.\u2019 \u2018You talk insidiously.

You were always from the first reserved to me, though I was confidential to you. That was, I suppose, the natural issue of our differing positions in life.

Good-bye.\u2019 \u2018Jealousy is cruel as the grave.\u2019Stephen pondered not a little on this meeting with his old friend and once-beloved exemplar. He was grieved, for amid all the distractions of his latter years a still small voice of fidelity to Knight had lingered on in him.

Knight, on his part, was vexed, after they had parted, that he had not taken Stephen in hand a little after the old manner. Those words which Smith had let fall concerning somebody having a prior claim to Elfride, would, if uttered when the man was younger, have provoked such a query as, \u2018Come, tell me all about it, my lad,\u2019 from Knight, and Stephen would straightway have delivered himself of all he knew on the subject."}, {"size": 664, "text": "Stephen the ingenuous boy, though now obliterated externally by Stephen the contriving man, returned to Knight\u2019s memory vividly that afternoon. He was at present but a sojourner in London; and after attending to the two or three matters of business which remained to be done that day, he walked abstractedly into the gloomy corridors of the British Museum for the half-hour previous to their closing. That meeting with Smith had reunited the present with the past, closing up the chasm of his absence from England as if it had never existed, until the final circumstances of his previous time of residence in London formed but a yesterday to the circumstances now."}, {"size": 861, "text": "The conflict that then had raged in him concerning Elfride Swancourt revived, strengthened by its sleep. Indeed, in those many months of absence, though quelling the intention to make her his wife, he had never forgotten that she was the type of woman adapted to his nature; and instead of trying to obliterate thoughts of her altogether, he had grown to regard them as an infirmity it was necessary to tolerate. Knight returned to his hotel much earlier in the evening than he would have done in the ordinary course of things. He did not care to think whether this arose from a friendly wish to close the gap that had slowly been widening between himself and his earliest acquaintance, or from a hankering desire to hear the meaning of the dark oracles Stephen had hastily pronounced, betokening that he knew something more of Elfride than Knight had supposed."}, {"size": 679, "text": "He made a hasty dinner, inquired for Smith, and soon was ushered into the young man\u2019s presence, whom he found sitting in front of a comfortable fire, beside a table spread with a few scientific periodicals and art reviews. \u2018I have come to you, after all,\u2019 said Knight. \u2018My manner was odd this morning, and it seemed desirable to call; but that you had too much sense to notice, Stephen, I know. Put it down to my wanderings in France and Italy.\u2019 \u2018Don\u2019t say another word, but sit down.

The familiar sights and sounds of London, the meeting with his friend, had with him also revived that sense of abiding continuity with regard to Elfride and love which his absence at the other side of the world had to some extent suspended, though never ruptured. He at first intended only to look over these letters on the outside; then he read one; then another; until the whole was thus re-used as a stimulus to sad memories."}, {"size": 692, "text": "He folded them away again, placed them in his pocket, and instead of going on with an examination into the state of the artistic world, had remained musing on the strange circumstance that he had returned to find Knight not the husband of Elfride after all. The possibility of any given gratification begets a cumulative sense of its necessity. Stephen gave the rein to his imagination, and felt more intensely than he had felt for many months that, without Elfride, his life would never be any great pleasure to himself, or honour to his Maker. They sat by the fire, chatting on external and random subjects, neither caring to be the first to approach the matter each most longed to discuss."}, {"size": 842, "text": "On the table with the periodicals lay two or three pocket-books, one of them being open. Knight seeing from the exposed page that the contents were sketches only, began turning the leaves over carelessly with his finger. When, some time later, Stephen was out of the room, Knight proceeded to pass the interval by looking at the sketches more carefully. The first crude ideas, pertaining to dwellings of all kinds, were roughly outlined on the different pages. Antiquities had been copied; fragments of Indian columns, colossal statues, and outlandish ornament from the temples of Elephanta and Kenneri, were carelessly intruded upon by outlines of modern doors, windows, roofs, cooking-stoves, and household furniture; everything, in short, which comes within the range of a practising architect\u2019s experience, who travels with his eyes open."}, {"size": 703, "text": "Among these occasionally appeared rough delineations of mediaeval subjects for carving or illumination--heads of Virgins, Saints, and Prophets. Stephen was not professedly a free-hand draughtsman, but he drew the human figure with correctness and skill. In its numerous repetitions on the sides and edges of the leaves, Knight began to notice a peculiarity. All the feminine saints had one type of feature. There were large nimbi and small nimbi about their drooping heads, but the face was always the same. That profile--how well Knight knew that profile! Had there been but one specimen of the familiar countenance, he might have passed over the resemblance as accidental; but a repetition meant more."}, {"size": 465, "text": "Knight thought anew of Smith\u2019s hasty words earlier in the day, and looked at the sketches again and again. On the young man\u2019s entry, Knight said with palpable agitation-- \u2018Stephen, who are those intended for?\u2019 Stephen looked over the book with utter unconcern, \u2018Saints and angels, done in my leisure moments. They were intended as designs for the stained glass of an English church.\u2019 \u2018But whom do you idealize by that type of woman you always adopt for the Virgin?\u2019"}, {"size": 774, "text": "And then a thought raced along Stephen\u2019s mind and he looked up at his friend.The truth is, Stephen\u2019s introduction of Elfride\u2019s lineaments had been so unconscious that he had not at first understood his companion\u2019s drift. The hand, like the tongue, easily acquires the trick of repetition by rote, without calling in the mind to assist at all; and this had been the case here. Young men who cannot write verses about their Loves generally take to portraying them, and in the early days of his attachment Smith had never been weary of outlining Elfride. The lay-figure of Stephen\u2019s sketches now initiated an adjustment of many things. Knight had recognized her. The opportunity of comparing notes had come unsought. \u2018Elfride Swancourt, to whom I was engaged,\u2019 he said quietly."}, {"size": 649, "text": "\u2018I know what you mean by speaking like that.\u2019 \u2018Was it Elfride?

To fancy otherwise accorded better with the hope to which Knight\u2019s estrangement had given birth: that love for his friend was not the direct cause, but a result of her suspension of love for himself. \u2018Such a matter must not be allowed to breed discord between us,\u2019 Knight returned, relapsing into a manner which concealed all his true feeling, as if confidence now was intolerable."}, {"size": 617, "text": "\u2018I do see that your reticence towards me in the vault may have been dictated by prudential considerations.\u2019 He concluded artificially, \u2018It was a strange thing altogether; but not of much importance, I suppose, at this distance of time; and it does not concern me now, though I don\u2019t mind hearing your story.\u2019 These words from Knight, uttered with such an air of renunciation and apparent indifference, prompted Smith to speak on--perhaps with a little complacency--of his old secret engagement to Elfride.

Their love seemed so innocent and childlike thus far. \u2018It is a nice point in casuistry,\u2019 he observed, \u2018to decide whether you were culpable or not in not telling Swancourt that your friends were parishioners of his."}, {"size": 374, "text": "It was only human nature to hold your tongue under the circumstances.

He believed that in doing so he established word by word the reasonableness of his claim to Elfride. \u2018Curse her! curse that woman!--that miserable letter that parted us! O God!\u2019 Knight began pacing the room again, and uttered this at further end. \u2018What did you say?\u2019 said Stephen, turning round. \u2018Say? Did I say anything? Oh, I was merely thinking about your story, and the oddness of my having a fancy for the same woman afterwards."}, {"size": 612, "text": "And that now I--I have forgotten her almost; and neither of us care about her, except just as a friend, you know, eh?\u2019 Knight still continued at the further end of the room, somewhat in shadow. \u2018Exactly,\u2019 said Stephen, inwardly exultant, for he was really deceived by Knight\u2019s off-hand manner. Yet he was deceived less by the completeness of Knight\u2019s disguise than by the persuasive power which lay in the fact that Knight had never before deceived him in anything.

There was an anti-climax of absurdity which Knight, wretched and conscience-stricken as he was, could not help recognizing. Stephen was but a boy to him.

It smote his heart like a switch when he remembered how gently she had borne his scourging speeches, never answering him with a single reproach, only assuring him of her unbounded love.

Their rupture must have occurred soon after Stephen\u2019s discovery of the fact of their union; and, Stephen went on to think, what so probable as that a return of her errant affection to himself was the cause? Stephen\u2019s opinions in this matter were those of a lover, and not the balanced judgment of an unbiassed spectator.

To have got there he must have driven like the wind to Bede\u2019s Inn, and hardly have alighted before starting again. No, it could not be he; that was not his way of doing things.

Where she went to, I never knew--but she was very unwell for weeks afterwards. And she said to me that she didn\u2019t care what became of her, and she wished she could die. When she was better, I said she would live to be married yet, and she said then, \u201cYes; I\u2019ll do anything for the benefit of my family, so as to turn my useless life to some practical account.\u201d Well, it began like this about Lord Luxellian courting her. The first Lady Luxellian had died, and he was in great trouble because the little girls were left motherless."}, {"size": 671, "text": "After a while they used to come and see her in their little black frocks, for they liked her as well or better than their own mother---that\u2019s true. They used to call her \u201clittle mamma.\u201d These children made her a shade livelier, but she was not the girl she had been--I could see that--and she grew thinner a good deal. Well, my lord got to ask the Swancourts oftener and oftener to dinner--nobody else of his acquaintance--and at last the vicar\u2019s family were backwards and forwards at all hours of the day. Well, people say that the little girls asked their father to let Miss Elfride come and live with them, and that he said perhaps he would if they were good children."}, {"size": 766, "text": "However, the time went on, and one day I said, \u201cMiss Elfride, you don\u2019t look so well as you used to; and though nobody else seems to notice it I do.\u201d She laughed a little, and said, \u201cI shall live to be married yet, as you told me.\u201d \u2018\u201cShall you, miss? I am glad to hear that,\u201d I said. \u2018\u201cWhom do you think I am going to be married to?\u201d she said again. \u2018\u201cMr. Knight, I suppose,\u201d said I. \u2018\u201cOh!\u201d she cried, and turned off so white, and afore I could get to her she had sunk down like a heap of clothes, and fainted away. Well, then, she came to herself after a time, and said, \u201cUnity, now we\u2019ll go on with our conversation.\u201d \u2018\u201cBetter not to-day, miss,\u201d I said. \u2018\u201cYes, we will,\u201d she said. \u201cWhom do you think I am going to be married to?\u201d \u2018\u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d I said this time."}, {"size": 623, "text": "\u2018\u201c\u2018Tisn\u2019t my lord, is it?\u201d says I. \u2018\u201cYes, \u2018tis,\u201d says she, in a sick wild way. \u2018\u201cBut he don\u2019t come courting much,\u201d I said.\u201c\u2018Ah! you don\u2019t know,\u201d she said, and told me \u2018twas going to be in October. After that she freshened up a bit--whether \u2018twas with the thought of getting away from home or not, I don\u2019t know. For, perhaps, I may as well speak plainly, and tell you that her home was no home to her now. Her father was bitter to her and harsh upon her; and though Mrs. Swancourt was well enough in her way, \u2018twas a sort of cold politeness that was not worth much, and the little thing had a worrying time of it altogether."}, {"size": 673, "text": "About a month before the wedding, she and my lord and the two children used to ride about together upon horseback, and a very pretty sight they were; and if you\u2019ll believe me, I never saw him once with her unless the children were with her too--which made the courting so strange-looking. Ay, and my lord is so handsome, you know, so that at last I think she rather liked him; and I have seen her smile and blush a bit at things he said. He wanted her the more because the children did, for everybody could see that she would be a most tender mother to them, and friend and playmate too. And my lord is not only handsome, but a splendid courter, and up to all the ways o\u2019t."}, {"size": 767, "text": "So he made her the beautifullest presents; ah, one I can mind--a lovely bracelet, with diamonds and emeralds. Oh, how red her face came when she saw it! The old roses came back to her cheeks for a minute or two then. I helped dress her the day we both were married--it was the last service I did her, poor child! When she was ready, I ran upstairs and slipped on my own wedding gown, and away they went, and away went Martin and I; and no sooner had my lord and my lady been married than the parson married us. It was a very quiet pair of weddings--hardly anybody knew it. Well, hope will hold its own in a young heart, if so be it can; and my lady freshened up a bit, for my lord was SO handsome and kind.\u2019 \u2018How came she to die--and away from home?\u2019 murmured Knight."}, {"size": 301, "text": "\u2018Don\u2019t you see, sir, she fell off again afore they\u2019d been married long, and my lord took her abroad for change of scene. They were coming home, and had got as far as London, when she was taken very ill and couldn\u2019t be moved, and there she died.\u2019 \u2018Was he very fond of her?\u2019 \u2018What, my lord? Oh, he was!\u2019"}, {"size": 643, "text": "\u2018VERY, beyond everything. Not suddenly, but by slow degrees. \u2018Twas her nature to win people more when they knew her well. He\u2019d have died for her, I believe. Poor my lord, he\u2019s heart-broken now!\u2019 \u2018The funeral is to-morrow?\u2019 \u2018Yes; my husband is now at the vault with the masons, opening the steps and cleaning down the walls.\u2019 The next day two men walked up the familiar valley from Castle Boterel to East Endelstow Church. And when the funeral was over, and every one had left the lawn-like churchyard, the pair went softly down the steps of the Luxellian vault, and under the low-groined arches they had beheld once before, lit up then as now."}, {"size": 602, "text": "In the new niche of the crypt lay a rather new coffin, which had lost some of its lustre, and a newer coffin still, bright and untarnished in the slightest degree. Beside the latter was the dark form of a man, kneeling on the damp floor, his body flung across the coffin, his hands clasped, and his whole frame seemingly given up in utter abandonment to grief. He was still young--younger, perhaps, than Knight--and even now showed how graceful was his figure and symmetrical his build. He murmured a prayer half aloud, and was quite unconscious that two others were standing within a few yards of him."}, {"size": 702, "text": "Knight and Stephen had advanced to where they once stood beside Elfride on the day all three had met there, before she had herself gone down into silence like her ancestors, and shut her bright blue eyes for ever. Not until then did they see the kneeling figure in the dim light. Knight instantly recognized the mourner as Lord Luxellian, the bereaved husband of Elfride. They felt themselves to be intruders. Knight pressed Stephen back, and they silently withdrew as they had entered. \u2018Come away,\u2019 he said, in a broken voice. \u2018We have no right to be there. Another stands before us--nearer to her than we!\u2019 And side by side they both retraced their steps down the grey still valley to Castle Boterel."}]}
