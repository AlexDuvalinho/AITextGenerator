I don\u2019t want to have to drive ten miles to see somebody else\u2019s ghost. I want one of my own on the premises.

It was to sit, in the thick December dusk, by just such a wide-hooded fireplace, under just such black oak rafters, with the sense that beyond the mullioned panes the downs were darkening to a deeper solitude: it was for the ultimate indulgence in such sensations that Mary Boyne had endured for nearly fourteen"}, {"size": 751, "text": "years the soul-deadening ugliness of the Middle West, and that Boyne had ground on doggedly at his engineering till, with a suddenness that still made her blink, the prodigious windfall of the Blue Star Mine had put them at a stroke in possession of life and the leisure to taste it. They had never for a moment meant their new state to be one of idleness; but they meant to give themselves only to harmonious activities. She had her vision of painting and gardening (against a background of gray walls), he dreamed of the production of his long-planned book on the \u201cEconomic Basis of Culture\u201d; and with such absorbing work ahead no existence could be too sequestered; they could not get far enough from the world, or plunge deep enough into the past."}, {"size": 804, "text": "Dorsetshire had attracted them from the first by a semblance of remoteness out of all proportion to its geographical position. But to the Boynes it was one of the ever-recurring wonders of the whole incredibly compressed island--a nest of counties, as they put it--that for the production of its effects so little of a given quality went so far: that so few miles made a distance, and so short a distance a difference. \u201cIt\u2019s that,\u201d Ned had once enthusiastically explained, \u201cthat gives such depth to their effects, such relief to their least contrasts. They\u2019ve been able to lay the butter so thick on every exquisite mouthful.\u201d The butter had certainly been laid on thick at Lyng: the old gray house, hidden under a shoulder of the downs, had almost all the finer marks of commerce with a protracted past."}, {"size": 608, "text": "The mere fact that it was neither large nor exceptional made it, to the Boynes, abound the more richly in its special sense--the sense of having been for centuries a deep, dim reservoir of life. The life had probably not been of the most vivid order: for long periods, no doubt, it had fallen as noiselessly into the past as the quiet drizzle of autumn fell, hour after hour, into the green fish-pond between the yews; but these back-waters of existence sometimes breed, in their sluggish depths, strange acuities of emotion, and Mary Boyne had felt from the first the occasional brush of an intenser memory."}, {"size": 734, "text": "The feeling had never been stronger than on the December afternoon when, waiting in the library for the belated lamps, she rose from her seat and stood among the shadows of the hearth. Her husband had gone off, after luncheon, for one of his long tramps on the downs. She had noticed of late that he preferred to be unaccompanied on these occasions; and, in the tried security of their personal relations, had been driven to conclude that his book was bothering him, and that he needed the afternoons to turn over in solitude the problems left from the morning\u2019s work. Certainly the book was not going as smoothly as she had imagined it would, and the lines of perplexity between his eyes had never been there in his engineering days."}, {"size": 632, "text": "Then he had often looked fagged to the verge of illness, but the native demon of \u201cworry\u201d had never branded his brow. Yet the few pages he had so far read to her--the introduction, and a synopsis of the opening chapter--gave evidences of a firm possession of his subject, and a deepening confidence in his powers. The fact threw her into deeper perplexity, since, now that he had done with \u201cbusiness\u201d and its disturbing contingencies, the one other possible element of anxiety was eliminated. Unless it were his health, then? But physically he had gained since they had come to Dorsetshire, grown robuster, ruddier, and fresher-eyed."}, {"size": 705, "text": "It was only within a week that she had felt in him the undefinable change that made her restless in his absence, and as tongue-tied in his presence as though it were SHE who had a secret to keep from him! The thought that there WAS a secret somewhere between them struck her with a sudden smart rap of wonder, and she looked about her down the dim, long room. \u201cCan it be the house?\u201d she mused. The room itself might have been full of secrets. They seemed to be piling themselves up, as evening fell, like the layers and layers of velvet shadow dropping from the low ceiling, the dusky walls of books, the smoke-blurred sculpture of the hooded hearth. \u201cWhy, of course--the house is haunted!\u201d she reflected."}, {"size": 695, "text": "The ghost--Alida\u2019s imperceptible ghost--after figuring largely in the banter of their first month or two at Lyng, had been gradually discarded as too ineffectual for imaginative use. Mary had, indeed, as became the tenant of a haunted house, made the customary inquiries among her few rural neighbors, but, beyond a vague, \u201cThey du say so, Ma\u2019am,\u201d the villagers had nothing to impart. The elusive specter had apparently never had sufficient identity for a legend to crystallize about it, and after a time the Boynes had laughingly set the matter down to their profit-and-loss account, agreeing that Lyng was one of the few houses good enough in itself to dispense with supernatural enhancements."}, {"size": 643, "text": "\u201cAnd I suppose, poor, ineffectual demon, that\u2019s why it beats its beautiful wings in vain in the void,\u201d Mary had laughingly concluded. \u201cOr, rather,\u201d Ned answered, in the same strain, \u201cwhy, amid so much that\u2019s ghostly, it can never affirm its separate existence as THE ghost.\u201d And thereupon their invisible housemate had finally dropped out of their references, which were numerous enough to make them promptly unaware of the loss. Now, as she stood on the hearth, the subject of their earlier curiosity revived in her with a new sense of its meaning--a sense gradually acquired through close daily contact with the scene of the lurking mystery."}, {"size": 705, "text": "It was the house itself, of course, that possessed the ghost-seeing faculty, that communed visually but secretly with its own past; and if one could only get into close enough communion with the house, one might surprise its secret, and acquire the ghost-sight on one\u2019s own account. Perhaps, in his long solitary hours in this very room, where she never trespassed till the afternoon, her husband HAD acquired it already, and was silently carrying the dread weight of whatever it had revealed to him. Mary was too well-versed in the code of the spectral world not to know that one could not talk about the ghosts one saw: to do so was almost as great a breach of good-breeding as to name a lady in a club."}, {"size": 758, "text": "But this explanation did not really satisfy her. \u201cWhat, after all, except for the fun of the frisson,\u201d she reflected, \u201cwould he really care for any of their old ghosts?\u201d And thence she was thrown back once more on the fundamental dilemma: the fact that one\u2019s greater or less susceptibility to spectral influences had no particular bearing on the case, since, when one DID see a ghost at Lyng, one did not know it. \u201cNot till long afterward,\u201d Alida Stair had said. Well, supposing Ned HAD seen one when they first came, and had known only within the last week what had happened to him? More and more under the spell of the hour, she threw back her searching thoughts to the early days of their tenancy, but at first only to recall a gay confusion of unpacking,"}, {"size": 643, "text": "settling, arranging of books, and calling to each other from remote corners of the house as treasure after treasure of their habitation revealed itself to them. It was in this particular connection that she presently recalled a certain soft afternoon of the previous October, when, passing from the first rapturous flurry of exploration to a detailed inspection of the old house, she had pressed (like a novel heroine) a panel that opened at her touch, on a narrow flight of stairs leading to an unsuspected flat ledge of the roof--the roof which, from below, seemed to slope away on all sides too abruptly for any but practised feet to scale."}, {"size": 878, "text": "The view from this hidden coign was enchanting, and she had flown down to snatch Ned from his papers and give him the freedom of her discovery. She remembered still how, standing on the narrow ledge, he had passed his arm about her while their gaze flew to the long, tossed horizon-line of the downs, and then dropped contentedly back to trace the arabesque of yew hedges about the fish-pond, and the shadow of the cedar on the lawn. \u201cAnd now the other way,\u201d he had said, gently turning her about within his arm; and closely pressed to him, she had absorbed, like some long, satisfying draft, the picture of the gray-walled court, the squat lions on the gates, and the lime-avenue reaching up to the highroad under the downs. It was just then, while they gazed and held each other, that she had felt his arm relax, and heard a sharp \u201cHullo!\u201d that made her turn to glance at him."}, {"size": 710, "text": "Distinctly, yes, she now recalled she had seen, as she glanced, a shadow of anxiety, of perplexity, rather, fall across his face; and, following his eyes, had beheld the figure of a man--a man in loose, grayish clothes, as it appeared to her--who was sauntering down the lime-avenue to the court with the tentative gait of a stranger seeking his way. Her short-sighted eyes had given her but a blurred impression of slightness and grayness, with something foreign, or at least unlocal, in the cut of the figure or its garb; but her husband had apparently seen more--seen enough to make him push past her with a sharp \u201cWait!\u201d and dash down the twisting stairs without pausing to give her a hand for the descent."}, {"size": 637, "text": "A slight tendency to dizziness obliged her, after a provisional clutch at the chimney against which they had been leaning, to follow him down more cautiously; and when she had reached the attic landing she paused again for a less definite reason, leaning over the oak banister to strain her eyes through the silence of the brown, sun-flecked depths below. She lingered there till, somewhere in those depths, she heard the closing of a door; then, mechanically impelled, she went down the shallow flights of steps till she reached the lower hall. The front door stood open on the mild sunlight of the court, and hall and court were empty."}, {"size": 715, "text": "The library door was open, too, and after listening in vain for any sound of voices within, she quickly crossed the threshold, and found her husband alone, vaguely fingering the papers on his desk. He looked up, as if surprised at her precipitate entrance, but the shadow of anxiety had passed from his face, leaving it even, as she fancied, a little brighter and clearer than usual. \u201cWhat was it? Who was it?\u201d she asked. \u201cWho?\u201d he repeated, with the surprise still all on his side. \u201cThe man we saw coming toward the house.\u201d He seemed honestly to reflect. \u201cThe man? Why, I thought I saw Peters; I dashed after him to say a word about the stable-drains, but he had disappeared before I could get down.\u201d \u201cDisappeared?"}, {"size": 775, "text": "Why, he seemed to be walking so slowly when we saw him.\u201d Boyne shrugged his shoulders. \u201cSo I thought; but he must have got up steam in the interval. What do you say to our trying a scramble up Meldon Steep before sunset?\u201d That was all. At the time the occurrence had been less than nothing, had, indeed, been immediately obliterated by the magic of their first vision from Meldon Steep, a height which they had dreamed of climbing ever since they had first seen its bare spine heaving itself above the low roof of Lyng. Doubtless it was the mere fact of the other incident\u2019s having occurred on the very day of their ascent to Meldon that had kept it stored away in the unconscious fold of association from which it now emerged; for in itself it had no mark of the portentous."}, {"size": 632, "text": "At the moment there could have been nothing more natural than that Ned should dash himself from the roof in the pursuit of dilatory tradesmen. It was the period when they were always on the watch for one or the other of the specialists employed about the place; always lying in wait for them, and dashing out at them with questions, reproaches, or reminders. And certainly in the distance the gray figure had looked like Peters. Yet now, as she reviewed the rapid scene, she felt her husband\u2019s explanation of it to have been invalidated by the look of anxiety on his face. Why had the familiar appearance of Peters made him anxious?"}, {"size": 432, "text": "Why, above all, if it was of such prime necessity to confer with that authority on the subject of the stable-drains, had the failure to find him produced such a look of relief? Mary could not say that any one of these considerations had occurred to her at the time, yet, from the promptness with which they now marshaled themselves at her summons, she had a sudden sense that they must all along have been there, waiting their hour."}, {"size": 717, "text": "Weary with her thoughts, she moved toward the window. The library was now completely dark, and she was surprised to see how much faint light the outer world still held. As she peered out into it across the court, a figure shaped itself in the tapering perspective of bare lines: it looked a mere blot of deeper gray in the grayness, and for an instant, as it moved toward her, her heart thumped to the thought, \u201cIt\u2019s the ghost!\u201d She had time, in that long instant, to feel suddenly that the man of whom, two months earlier, she had a brief distant vision from the roof was now, at his predestined hour, about to reveal himself as NOT having been Peters; and her spirit sank under the impending fear of the disclosure."}, {"size": 644, "text": "But almost with the next tick of the clock the ambiguous figure, gaining substance and character, showed itself even to her weak sight as her husband\u2019s; and she turned away to meet him, as he entered, with the confession of her folly. \u201cIt\u2019s really too absurd,\u201d she laughed out from the threshold, \u201cbut I never CAN remember!\u201d \u201cRemember what?\u201d Boyne questioned as they drew together. \u201cThat when one sees the Lyng ghost one never knows it.\u201d Her hand was on his sleeve, and he kept it there, but with no response in his gesture or in the lines of his fagged, preoccupied face. \u201cDid you think you\u2019d seen it?\u201d he asked, after an appreciable interval."}, {"size": 706, "text": "\u201cWhy, I actually took YOU for it, my dear, in my mad determination to spot it!\u201d \u201cMe--just now?\u201d His arm dropped away, and he turned from her with a faint echo of her laugh. \u201cReally, dearest, you\u2019d better give it up, if that\u2019s the best you can do.\u201d \u201cYes, I give it up--I give it up. Have YOU?\u201d she asked, turning round on him abruptly. The parlor-maid had entered with letters and a lamp, and the light struck up into Boyne\u2019s face as he bent above the tray she presented. \u201cHave YOU?\u201d Mary perversely insisted, when the servant had disappeared on her errand of illumination. \u201cHave I what?\u201d he rejoined absently, the light bringing out the sharp stamp of worry between his brows as he turned over the letters."}, {"size": 641, "text": "\u201cGiven up trying to see the ghost.\u201d Her heart beat a little at the experiment she was making. Her husband, laying his letters aside, moved away into the shadow of the hearth. \u201cI never tried,\u201d he said, tearing open the wrapper of a newspaper. \u201cWell, of course,\u201d Mary persisted, \u201cthe exasperating thing is that there\u2019s no use trying, since one can\u2019t be sure till so long afterward.\u201d He was unfolding the paper as if he had hardly heard her; but after a pause, during which the sheets rustled spasmodically between his hands, he lifted his head to say abruptly, \u201cHave you any idea HOW LONG?\u201d Mary had sunk into a low chair beside the fireplace."}, {"size": 610, "text": "From her seat she looked up, startled, at her husband\u2019s profile, which was darkly projected against the circle of lamplight. \u201cNo; none. Have YOU?\u201d she retorted, repeating her former phrase with an added keenness of intention. Boyne crumpled the paper into a bunch, and then inconsequently turned back with it toward the lamp. \u201cLord, no! I only meant,\u201d he explained, with a faint tinge of impatience, \u201cis there any legend, any tradition, as to that?\u201d \u201cNot that I know of,\u201d she answered; but the impulse to add, \u201cWhat makes you ask?\u201d was checked by the reappearance of the parlor-maid with tea and a second lamp."}, {"size": 628, "text": "With the dispersal of shadows, and the repetition of the daily domestic office, Mary Boyne felt herself less oppressed by that sense of something mutely imminent which had darkened her solitary afternoon. For a few moments she gave herself silently to the details of her task, and when she looked up from it she was struck to the point of bewilderment by the change in her husband\u2019s face. He had seated himself near the farther lamp, and was absorbed in the perusal of his letters; but was it something he had found in them, or merely the shifting of her own point of view, that had restored his features to their normal aspect?"}, {"size": 749, "text": "The longer she looked, the more definitely the change affirmed itself. The lines of painful tension had vanished, and such traces of fatigue as lingered were of the kind easily attributable to steady mental effort. He glanced up, as if drawn by her gaze, and met her eyes with a smile. \u201cI\u2019m dying for my tea, you know; and here\u2019s a letter for you,\u201d he said. She took the letter he held out in exchange for the cup she proffered him, and, returning to her seat, broke the seal with the languid gesture of the reader whose interests are all inclosed in the circle of one cherished presence. Her next conscious motion was that of starting to her feet, the letter falling to them as she rose, while she held out to her husband a long newspaper clipping."}, {"size": 600, "text": "\u201cNed! What\u2019s this? What does it mean?\u201d He had risen at the same instant, almost as if hearing her cry before she uttered it; and for a perceptible space of time he and she studied each other, like adversaries watching for an advantage, across the space between her chair and his desk. \u201cWhat\u2019s what? You fairly made me jump!\u201d Boyne said at length, moving toward her with a sudden, half-exasperated laugh. The shadow of apprehension was on his face again, not now a look of fixed foreboding, but a shifting vigilance of lips and eyes that gave her the sense of his feeling himself invisibly surrounded."}, {"size": 620, "text": "Her hand shook so that she could hardly give him the clipping. \u201cThis article--from the \u2018Waukesha Sentinel\u2019--that a man named Elwell has brought suit against you--that there was something wrong about the Blue Star Mine. I can\u2019t understand more than half.\u201d They continued to face each other as she spoke, and to her astonishment, she saw that her words had the almost immediate effect of dissipating the strained watchfulness of his look. \u201cOh, THAT!\u201d He glanced down the printed slip, and then folded it with the gesture of one who handles something harmless and familiar. \u201cWhat\u2019s the matter with you this afternoon, Mary?"}, {"size": 676, "text": "I thought you\u2019d got bad news.\u201d She stood before him with her undefinable terror subsiding slowly under the reassuring touch of his composure. \u201cYou knew about this, then--it\u2019s all right?\u201d \u201cCertainly I knew about it; and it\u2019s all right.\u201d \u201cBut what IS it? I don\u2019t understand. What does this man accuse you of?\u201d \u201cOh, pretty nearly every crime in the calendar.\u201d Boyne had tossed the clipping down, and thrown himself comfortably into an arm-chair near the fire. \u201cDo you want to hear the story? It\u2019s not particularly interesting--just a squabble over interests in the Blue Star.\u201d \u201cBut who is this Elwell? I don\u2019t know the name.\u201d \u201cOh, he\u2019s a fellow I put into it--gave him a hand up."}, {"size": 624, "text": "I told you all about him at the time.\u201d \u201cI daresay. I must have forgotten.\u201d Vainly she strained back among her memories. \u201cBut if you helped him, why does he make this return?\u201d \u201cOh, probably some shyster lawyer got hold of him and talked him over. It\u2019s all rather technical and complicated. I thought that kind of thing bored you.\u201d His wife felt a sting of compunction. Theoretically, she deprecated the American wife\u2019s detachment from her husband\u2019s professional interests, but in practice she had always found it difficult to fix her attention on Boyne\u2019s report of the transactions in which his varied interests involved him."}, {"size": 705, "text": "Besides, she had felt from the first that, in a community where the amenities of living could be obtained only at the cost of efforts as arduous as her husband\u2019s professional labors, such brief leisure as they could command should be used as an escape from immediate preoccupations, a flight to the life they always dreamed of living. Once or twice, now that this new life had actually drawn its magic circle about them, she had asked herself if she had done right; but hitherto such conjectures had been no more than the retrospective excursions of an active fancy. Now, for the first time, it startled her a little to find how little she knew of the material foundation on which her happiness was built."}, {"size": 716, "text": "She glanced again at her husband, and was reassured by the composure of his face; yet she felt the need of more definite grounds for her reassurance. \u201cBut doesn\u2019t this suit worry you? Why have you never spoken to me about it?\u201d He answered both questions at once: \u201cI didn\u2019t speak of it at first because it DID worry me--annoyed me, rather. But it\u2019s all ancient history now. Your correspondent must have got hold of a back number of the \u2018Sentinel.\u2019\u201d She felt a quick thrill of relief. \u201cYou mean it\u2019s over?

The Van Sideren set were tired of the conventional color-scheme in art and conduct. Julia Westall had long had her own views on the immorality of marriage; she might indeed have claimed her husband as a disciple.

In this connection, she was beginning to think that almost every one was vulgar; certainly there were few to whom she would have cared to intrust the defence of so esoteric a doctrine.

If THEY were to be a part of the modern girl\u2019s trousseau-- Mrs. Westall caught herself up with a start.

John Arment was impossible; but the sting of his impossibility lay in the fact that he made it impossible for those about him to be other than himself.

He had the kind of sporadic shrewdness which causes it to be said of a dull man that he is \u201cno fool\u201d; and it was this quality that his wife found most trying.

She stood up again and walked to the door: she thought she would go up stairs to her room. HER room? Again the word derided her. She opened the door, crossed the narrow hall, and walked up the stairs. As she passed, she noticed Westall\u2019s sticks and umbrellas: a pair of his gloves lay on the hall table. The same stair-carpet mounted between the same walls; the same old French print, in its narrow black frame, faced her on the landing. This visual continuity was intolerable. Within, a gaping chasm; without, the same untroubled and familiar surface. She must get away from it before she could attempt to think.

Life could not be broken off short like this, for a whim, a fancy; the law itself would side with her, would defend her. The law? What claim had she upon it?

SHE had been allowed to go free when she claimed her freedom--should she show less magnanimity than she had exacted? Magnanimity? The word lashed her with its irony--one does not strike an attitude when one is fighting for life! She would threaten, grovel, cajole... she would yield anything to keep her hold on happiness. Ah, but the difficulty lay deeper! The law could not help her--her own apostasy could not help her. She was the victim of the theories she renounced.

She walked with an aimless haste, fearing to meet familiar faces. The day was radiant, metallic: one of those searching American days so calculated to reveal the shortcomings of our street-cleaning and the excesses of our architecture. The streets looked bare and hideous; everything stared and glittered. She called a passing hansom, and gave Mrs. Van Sideren\u2019s address. She did not know what had led up to the act; but she found herself suddenly resolved to speak, to cry out a warning. It was too late to save herself--but the girl might still be told. The hansom rattled up Fifth Avenue; she sat with her eyes fixed, avoiding recognition. At the Van Siderens\u2019 door she sprang out and rang the bell.

She entered, and a young woman with a weak mouth and a brazen eye cleared a table for her near the window. The table was covered with a red and white cotton cloth and adorned with a bunch of celery in a thick tumbler and a salt-cellar full of grayish lumpy salt. Julia ordered tea, and sat a long time waiting for it."}, {"size": 706, "text": "She was glad to be away from the noise and confusion of the streets. The low-ceilinged room was empty, and two or three waitresses with thin pert faces lounged in the background staring at her and whispering together.

She was almost dizzy with exhilaration. Oh, how tired, how unutterably tired she had been! She drank a second cup, blacker and bitterer, and now her mind was once more working clearly.

The pity of it was that she did not know what to do next. The short winter day was fading, and she realized that she could not remain much longer in the restaurant without attracting notice. She paid for her tea and went out into the street. The lamps were alight, and here and there a basement shop cast an oblong of gas-light across the fissured pavement.

The blinds were drawn, and only a faint translucence marked the windows and the transom above the door. As she stood there she heard a step behind her, and a man walked by in the direction of the house. He walked slowly, with a heavy middle-aged gait, his head sunk a little between the shoulders, the red crease of his neck visible above the fur collar of his overcoat.

Presently she heard another step draw near, and moving quickly away, she too crossed the street and mounted the steps of the house.

But she noted this insensibly: her one conscious thought was that, now she was face to face with him, she must not let him escape till he had heard her. Every pulse in her body throbbed with the urgency of her message. She went up to him as he drew back. \u201cI must speak to you,\u201d she said. Arment hesitated, red and stammering.

The place was alive with memories: they started out from every fold of the yellow satin curtains and glided between the angles of the rosewood furniture.
