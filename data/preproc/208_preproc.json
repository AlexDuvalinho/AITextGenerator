There are, indeed, many hotels, for the entertainment of tourists is the business of the place, which, as many travelers will remember, is seated upon the edge of a remarkably blue lake--a lake that it behooves every tourist to visit. The shore of the lake presents an unbroken array of establishments of this order, of every category, from the \u201cgrand hotel\u201d of the newest fashion, with a chalk-white front, a hundred balconies, and a dozen flags flying from its roof, to the little Swiss pension of an elder day, with its name inscribed in German-looking lettering upon a pink or yellow wall and an awkward summerhouse in the angle of the garden."}, {"size": 629, "text": "One of the hotels at Vevey, however, is famous, even classical, being distinguished from many of its upstart neighbors by an air both of luxury and of maturity. In this region, in the month of June, American travelers are extremely numerous; it may be said, indeed, that Vevey assumes at this period some of the characteristics of an American watering place. There are sights and sounds which evoke a vision, an echo, of Newport and Saratoga. There is a flitting hither and thither of \u201cstylish\u201d young girls, a rustling of muslin flounces, a rattle of dance music in the morning hours, a sound of high-pitched voices at all times."}, {"size": 823, "text": "You receive an impression of these things at the excellent inn of the \u201cTrois Couronnes\u201d and are transported in fancy to the Ocean House or to Congress Hall. But at the \u201cTrois Couronnes,\u201d it must be added, there are other features that are much at variance with these suggestions: neat German waiters, who look like secretaries of legation; Russian princesses sitting in the garden; little Polish boys walking about held by the hand, with their governors; a view of the sunny crest of the Dent du Midi and the picturesque towers of the Castle of Chillon. I hardly know whether it was the analogies or the differences that were uppermost in the mind of a young American, who, two or three years ago, sat in the garden of the \u201cTrois Couronnes,\u201d looking about him, rather idly, at some of the graceful objects I have mentioned."}, {"size": 730, "text": "It was a beautiful summer morning, and in whatever fashion the young American looked at things, they must have seemed to him charming. He had come from Geneva the day before by the little steamer, to see his aunt, who was staying at the hotel--Geneva having been for a long time his place of residence. But his aunt had a headache--his aunt had almost always a headache--and now she was shut up in her room, smelling camphor, so that he was at liberty to wander about. He was some seven-and-twenty years of age; when his friends spoke of him, they usually said that he was at Geneva \u201cstudying.\u201d When his enemies spoke of him, they said--but, after all, he had no enemies; he was an extremely amiable fellow, and universally liked."}, {"size": 678, "text": "What I should say is, simply, that when certain persons spoke of him they affirmed that the reason of his spending so much time at Geneva was that he was extremely devoted to a lady who lived there--a foreign lady--a person older than himself. Very few Americans--indeed, I think none--had ever seen this lady, about whom there were some singular stories. But Winterbourne had an old attachment for the little metropolis of Calvinism; he had been put to school there as a boy, and he had afterward gone to college there--circumstances which had led to his forming a great many youthful friendships. Many of these he had kept, and they were a source of great satisfaction to him."}, {"size": 736, "text": "After knocking at his aunt\u2019s door and learning that she was indisposed, he had taken a walk about the town, and then he had come in to his breakfast. He had now finished his breakfast; but he was drinking a small cup of coffee, which had been served to him on a little table in the garden by one of the waiters who looked like an attache. At last he finished his coffee and lit a cigarette. Presently a small boy came walking along the path--an urchin of nine or ten. The child, who was diminutive for his years, had an aged expression of countenance, a pale complexion, and sharp little features. He was dressed in knickerbockers, with red stockings, which displayed his poor little spindle-shanks; he also wore a brilliant red cravat."}, {"size": 825, "text": "He carried in his hand a long alpenstock, the sharp point of which he thrust into everything that he approached--the flowerbeds, the garden benches, the trains of the ladies\u2019 dresses. In front of Winterbourne he paused, looking at him with a pair of bright, penetrating little eyes. \u201cWill you give me a lump of sugar?\u201d he asked in a sharp, hard little voice--a voice immature and yet, somehow, not young. Winterbourne glanced at the small table near him, on which his coffee service rested, and saw that several morsels of sugar remained. \u201cYes, you may take one,\u201d he answered; \u201cbut I don\u2019t think sugar is good for little boys.\u201d This little boy stepped forward and carefully selected three of the coveted fragments, two of which he buried in the pocket of his knickerbockers, depositing the other as promptly in another place."}, {"size": 616, "text": "He poked his alpenstock, lance-fashion, into Winterbourne\u2019s bench and tried to crack the lump of sugar with his teeth. \u201cOh, blazes; it\u2019s har-r-d!\u201d he exclaimed, pronouncing the adjective in a peculiar manner. Winterbourne had immediately perceived that he might have the honor of claiming him as a fellow countryman. \u201cTake care you don\u2019t hurt your teeth,\u201d he said, paternally. \u201cI haven\u2019t got any teeth to hurt. They have all come out. I have only got seven teeth. My mother counted them last night, and one came out right afterward. She said she\u2019d slap me if any more came out. I can\u2019t help it. It\u2019s this old Europe."}, {"size": 602, "text": "It\u2019s the climate that makes them come out. In America they didn\u2019t come out. It\u2019s these hotels.\u201d Winterbourne was much amused. \u201cIf you eat three lumps of sugar, your mother will certainly slap you,\u201d he said. \u201cShe\u2019s got to give me some candy, then,\u201d rejoined his young interlocutor. \u201cI can\u2019t get any candy here--any American candy. American candy\u2019s the best candy.\u201d \u201cAnd are American little boys the best little boys?\u201d asked Winterbourne. \u201cI don\u2019t know. I\u2019m an American boy,\u201d said the child. \u201cI see you are one of the best!\u201d laughed Winterbourne. \u201cAre you an American man?\u201d pursued this vivacious infant."}, {"size": 619, "text": "And then, on Winterbourne\u2019s affirmative reply--\u201cAmerican men are the best,\u201d he declared. His companion thanked him for the compliment, and the child, who had now got astride of his alpenstock, stood looking about him, while he attacked a second lump of sugar. Winterbourne wondered if he himself had been like this in his infancy, for he had been brought to Europe at about this age. \u201cHere comes my sister!\u201d cried the child in a moment. \u201cShe\u2019s an American girl.\u201d Winterbourne looked along the path and saw a beautiful young lady advancing. \u201cAmerican girls are the best girls,\u201d he said cheerfully to his young companion."}, {"size": 640, "text": "\u201cMy sister ain\u2019t the best!\u201d the child declared. \u201cShe\u2019s always blowing at me.\u201d \u201cI imagine that is your fault, not hers,\u201d said Winterbourne. The young lady meanwhile had drawn near. She was dressed in white muslin, with a hundred frills and flounces, and knots of pale-colored ribbon. She was bareheaded, but she balanced in her hand a large parasol, with a deep border of embroidery; and she was strikingly, admirably pretty. \u201cHow pretty they are!\u201d thought Winterbourne, straightening himself in his seat, as if he were prepared to rise. The young lady paused in front of his bench, near the parapet of the garden, which overlooked the lake."}, {"size": 624, "text": "The little boy had now converted his alpenstock into a vaulting pole, by the aid of which he was springing about in the gravel and kicking it up not a little. \u201cRandolph,\u201d said the young lady, \u201cwhat ARE you doing?\u201d \u201cI\u2019m going up the Alps,\u201d replied Randolph. \u201cThis is the way!\u201d And he gave another little jump, scattering the pebbles about Winterbourne\u2019s ears. \u201cThat\u2019s the way they come down,\u201d said Winterbourne. \u201cHe\u2019s an American man!\u201d cried Randolph, in his little hard voice. The young lady gave no heed to this announcement, but looked straight at her brother. \u201cWell, I guess you had better be quiet,\u201d she simply observed."}, {"size": 711, "text": "It seemed to Winterbourne that he had been in a manner presented. He got up and stepped slowly toward the young girl, throwing away his cigarette. \u201cThis little boy and I have made acquaintance,\u201d he said, with great civility. In Geneva, as he had been perfectly aware, a young man was not at liberty to speak to a young unmarried lady except under certain rarely occurring conditions; but here at Vevey, what conditions could be better than these?--a pretty American girl coming and standing in front of you in a garden. This pretty American girl, however, on hearing Winterbourne\u2019s observation, simply glanced at him; she then turned her head and looked over the parapet, at the lake and the opposite mountains."}, {"size": 631, "text": "He wondered whether he had gone too far, but he decided that he must advance farther, rather than retreat. While he was thinking of something else to say, the young lady turned to the little boy again. \u201cI should like to know where you got that pole,\u201d she said. \u201cI bought it,\u201d responded Randolph. \u201cYou don\u2019t mean to say you\u2019re going to take it to Italy?\u201d \u201cYes, I am going to take it to Italy,\u201d the child declared. The young girl glanced over the front of her dress and smoothed out a knot or two of ribbon. Then she rested her eyes upon the prospect again. \u201cWell, I guess you had better leave it somewhere,\u201d she said after a moment."}, {"size": 805, "text": "\u201cAre you going to Italy?\u201d Winterbourne inquired in a tone of great respect. The young lady glanced at him again. \u201cYes, sir,\u201d she replied. And she said nothing more. \u201cAre you--a--going over the Simplon?\u201d Winterbourne pursued, a little embarrassed. \u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d she said. \u201cI suppose it\u2019s some mountain. Randolph, what mountain are we going over?\u201d \u201cGoing where?\u201d the child demanded. \u201cTo Italy,\u201d Winterbourne explained. \u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d said Randolph. \u201cI don\u2019t want to go to Italy. I want to go to America.\u201d \u201cOh, Italy is a beautiful place!\u201d rejoined the young man. \u201cCan you get candy there?\u201d Randolph loudly inquired. \u201cI hope not,\u201d said his sister. \u201cI guess you have had enough candy, and mother thinks so too.\u201d \u201cI haven\u2019t had any for ever so long--for a hundred weeks!\u201d cried the boy, still jumping about."}, {"size": 777, "text": "The young lady inspected her flounces and smoothed her ribbons again; and Winterbourne presently risked an observation upon the beauty of the view. He was ceasing to be embarrassed, for he had begun to perceive that she was not in the least embarrassed herself. There had not been the slightest alteration in her charming complexion; she was evidently neither offended nor flattered. If she looked another way when he spoke to her, and seemed not particularly to hear him, this was simply her habit, her manner. Yet, as he talked a little more and pointed out some of the objects of interest in the view, with which she appeared quite unacquainted, she gradually gave him more of the benefit of her glance; and then he saw that this glance was perfectly direct and unshrinking."}, {"size": 661, "text": "It was not, however, what would have been called an immodest glance, for the young girl\u2019s eyes were singularly honest and fresh. They were wonderfully pretty eyes; and, indeed, Winterbourne had not seen for a long time anything prettier than his fair countrywoman\u2019s various features--her complexion, her nose, her ears, her teeth. He had a great relish for feminine beauty; he was addicted to observing and analyzing it; and as regards this young lady\u2019s face he made several observations. It was not at all insipid, but it was not exactly expressive; and though it was eminently delicate, Winterbourne mentally accused it--very forgivingly--of a want of finish."}, {"size": 715, "text": "He thought it very possible that Master Randolph\u2019s sister was a coquette; he was sure she had a spirit of her own; but in her bright, sweet, superficial little visage there was no mockery, no irony. Before long it became obvious that she was much disposed toward conversation. She told him that they were going to Rome for the winter--she and her mother and Randolph. She asked him if he was a \u201creal American\u201d; she shouldn\u2019t have taken him for one; he seemed more like a German--this was said after a little hesitation--especially when he spoke. Winterbourne, laughing, answered that he had met Germans who spoke like Americans, but that he had not, so far as he remembered, met an American who spoke like a German."}, {"size": 626, "text": "Then he asked her if she should not be more comfortable in sitting upon the bench which he had just quitted. She answered that she liked standing up and walking about; but she presently sat down. She told him she was from New York State--\u201cif you know where that is.\u201d Winterbourne learned more about her by catching hold of her small, slippery brother and making him stand a few minutes by his side. \u201cTell me your name, my boy,\u201d he said. \u201cRandolph C. Miller,\u201d said the boy sharply. \u201cAnd I\u2019ll tell you her name;\u201d and he leveled his alpenstock at his sister. \u201cYou had better wait till you are asked!\u201d said this young lady calmly."}, {"size": 717, "text": "\u201cI should like very much to know your name,\u201d said Winterbourne. \u201cHer name is Daisy Miller!\u201d cried the child. \u201cBut that isn\u2019t her real name; that isn\u2019t her name on her cards.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s a pity you haven\u2019t got one of my cards!\u201d said Miss Miller. \u201cHer real name is Annie P. Miller,\u201d the boy went on. \u201cAsk him HIS name,\u201d said his sister, indicating Winterbourne. But on this point Randolph seemed perfectly indifferent; he continued to supply information with regard to his own family. \u201cMy father\u2019s name is Ezra B. Miller,\u201d he announced. \u201cMy father ain\u2019t in Europe; my father\u2019s in a better place than Europe.\u201d Winterbourne imagined for a moment that this was the manner in which the child had been taught to intimate that Mr."}, {"size": 673, "text": "Miller had been removed to the sphere of celestial reward. But Randolph immediately added, \u201cMy father\u2019s in Schenectady. He\u2019s got a big business. My father\u2019s rich, you bet!\u201d \u201cWell!\u201d ejaculated Miss Miller, lowering her parasol and looking at the embroidered border. Winterbourne presently released the child, who departed, dragging his alpenstock along the path. \u201cHe doesn\u2019t like Europe,\u201d said the young girl. \u201cHe wants to go back.\u201d \u201cTo Schenectady, you mean?\u201d \u201cYes; he wants to go right home. He hasn\u2019t got any boys here. There is one boy here, but he always goes round with a teacher; they won\u2019t let him play.\u201d \u201cAnd your brother hasn\u2019t any teacher?\u201d Winterbourne inquired."}, {"size": 651, "text": "\u201cMother thought of getting him one, to travel round with us. There was a lady told her of a very good teacher; an American lady--perhaps you know her--Mrs. Sanders. I think she came from Boston. She told her of this teacher, and we thought of getting him to travel round with us. But Randolph said he didn\u2019t want a teacher traveling round with us. He said he wouldn\u2019t have lessons when he was in the cars. And we ARE in the cars about half the time. There was an English lady we met in the cars--I think her name was Miss Featherstone; perhaps you know her. She wanted to know why I didn\u2019t give Randolph lessons--give him \u2018instruction,\u2019 she called it."}, {"size": 750, "text": "I guess he could give me more instruction than I could give him. He\u2019s very smart.\u201d \u201cYes,\u201d said Winterbourne; \u201che seems very smart.\u201d \u201cMother\u2019s going to get a teacher for him as soon as we get to Italy. Can you get good teachers in Italy?\u201d \u201cVery good, I should think,\u201d said Winterbourne. \u201cOr else she\u2019s going to find some school. He ought to learn some more. He\u2019s only nine. He\u2019s going to college.\u201d And in this way Miss Miller continued to converse upon the affairs of her family and upon other topics. She sat there with her extremely pretty hands, ornamented with very brilliant rings, folded in her lap, and with her pretty eyes now resting upon those of Winterbourne, now wandering over the garden, the people who passed by, and the beautiful view."}, {"size": 657, "text": "She talked to Winterbourne as if she had known him a long time. He found it very pleasant. It was many years since he had heard a young girl talk so much. It might have been said of this unknown young lady, who had come and sat down beside him upon a bench, that she chattered. She was very quiet; she sat in a charming, tranquil attitude; but her lips and her eyes were constantly moving. She had a soft, slender, agreeable voice, and her tone was decidedly sociable. She gave Winterbourne a history of her movements and intentions and those of her mother and brother, in Europe, and enumerated, in particular, the various hotels at which they had stopped."}, {"size": 856, "text": "\u201cThat English lady in the cars,\u201d she said--\u201cMiss Featherstone--asked me if we didn\u2019t all live in hotels in America. I told her I had never been in so many hotels in my life as since I came to Europe. I have never seen so many--it\u2019s nothing but hotels.\u201d But Miss Miller did not make this remark with a querulous accent; she appeared to be in the best humor with everything. She declared that the hotels were very good, when once you got used to their ways, and that Europe was perfectly sweet. She was not disappointed--not a bit. Perhaps it was because she had heard so much about it before. She had ever so many intimate friends that had been there ever so many times. And then she had had ever so many dresses and things from Paris. Whenever she put on a Paris dress she felt as if she were in Europe. \u201cIt was a kind of a wishing cap,\u201d said Winterbourne."}, {"size": 609, "text": "\u201cYes,\u201d said Miss Miller without examining this analogy; \u201cit always made me wish I was here. But I needn\u2019t have done that for dresses. I am sure they send all the pretty ones to America; you see the most frightful things here. The only thing I don\u2019t like,\u201d she proceeded, \u201cis the society. There isn\u2019t any society; or, if there is, I don\u2019t know where it keeps itself. Do you? I suppose there is some society somewhere, but I haven\u2019t seen anything of it. I\u2019m very fond of society, and I have always had a great deal of it. I don\u2019t mean only in Schenectady, but in New York. I used to go to New York every winter."}, {"size": 767, "text": "In New York I had lots of society. Last winter I had seventeen dinners given me; and three of them were by gentlemen,\u201d added Daisy Miller. \u201cI have more friends in New York than in Schenectady--more gentleman friends; and more young lady friends too,\u201d she resumed in a moment. She paused again for an instant; she was looking at Winterbourne with all her prettiness in her lively eyes and in her light, slightly monotonous smile. \u201cI have always had,\u201d she said, \u201ca great deal of gentlemen\u2019s society.\u201d Poor Winterbourne was amused, perplexed, and decidedly charmed. He had never yet heard a young girl express herself in just this fashion; never, at least, save in cases where to say such things seemed a kind of demonstrative evidence of a certain laxity of deportment."}, {"size": 635, "text": "And yet was he to accuse Miss Daisy Miller of actual or potential inconduite, as they said at Geneva? He felt that he had lived at Geneva so long that he had lost a good deal; he had become dishabituated to the American tone. Never, indeed, since he had grown old enough to appreciate things, had he encountered a young American girl of so pronounced a type as this. Certainly she was very charming, but how deucedly sociable! Was she simply a pretty girl from New York State? Were they all like that, the pretty girls who had a good deal of gentlemen\u2019s society? Or was she also a designing, an audacious, an unscrupulous young person?"}, {"size": 686, "text": "Winterbourne had lost his instinct in this matter, and his reason could not help him. Miss Daisy Miller looked extremely innocent. Some people had told him that, after all, American girls were exceedingly innocent; and others had told him that, after all, they were not. He was inclined to think Miss Daisy Miller was a flirt--a pretty American flirt. He had never, as yet, had any relations with young ladies of this category. He had known, here in Europe, two or three women--persons older than Miss Daisy Miller, and provided, for respectability\u2019s sake, with husbands--who were great coquettes--dangerous, terrible women, with whom one\u2019s relations were liable to take a serious turn."}, {"size": 634, "text": "But this young girl was not a coquette in that sense; she was very unsophisticated; she was only a pretty American flirt. Winterbourne was almost grateful for having found the formula that applied to Miss Daisy Miller. He leaned back in his seat; he remarked to himself that she had the most charming nose he had ever seen; he wondered what were the regular conditions and limitations of one\u2019s intercourse with a pretty American flirt. It presently became apparent that he was on the way to learn. \u201cHave you been to that old castle?\u201d asked the young girl, pointing with her parasol to the far-gleaming walls of the Chateau de Chillon."}, {"size": 612, "text": "\u201cYes, formerly, more than once,\u201d said Winterbourne. \u201cYou too, I suppose, have seen it?\u201d \u201cNo; we haven\u2019t been there. I want to go there dreadfully. Of course I mean to go there. I wouldn\u2019t go away from here without having seen that old castle.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s a very pretty excursion,\u201d said Winterbourne, \u201cand very easy to make. You can drive, you know, or you can go by the little steamer.\u201d \u201cYou can go in the cars,\u201d said Miss Miller. \u201cYes; you can go in the cars,\u201d Winterbourne assented. \u201cOur courier says they take you right up to the castle,\u201d the young girl continued. \u201cWe were going last week, but my mother gave out."}, {"size": 649, "text": "She suffers dreadfully from dyspepsia. She said she couldn\u2019t go. Randolph wouldn\u2019t go either; he says he doesn\u2019t think much of old castles. But I guess we\u2019ll go this week, if we can get Randolph.\u201d \u201cYour brother is not interested in ancient monuments?\u201d Winterbourne inquired, smiling. \u201cHe says he don\u2019t care much about old castles. He\u2019s only nine. He wants to stay at the hotel. Mother\u2019s afraid to leave him alone, and the courier won\u2019t stay with him; so we haven\u2019t been to many places. But it will be too bad if we don\u2019t go up there.\u201d And Miss Miller pointed again at the Chateau de Chillon. \u201cI should think it might be arranged,\u201d said Winterbourne."}, {"size": 616, "text": "\u201cCouldn\u2019t you get some one to stay for the afternoon with Randolph?\u201d Miss Miller looked at him a moment, and then, very placidly, \u201cI wish YOU would stay with him!\u201d she said. Winterbourne hesitated a moment. \u201cI should much rather go to Chillon with you.\u201d \u201cWith me?\u201d asked the young girl with the same placidity. She didn\u2019t rise, blushing, as a young girl at Geneva would have done; and yet Winterbourne, conscious that he had been very bold, thought it possible she was offended. \u201cWith your mother,\u201d he answered very respectfully. But it seemed that both his audacity and his respect were lost upon Miss Daisy Miller."}, {"size": 681, "text": "\u201cI guess my mother won\u2019t go, after all,\u201d she said. \u201cShe don\u2019t like to ride round in the afternoon. But did you really mean what you said just now--that you would like to go up there?\u201d \u201cMost earnestly,\u201d Winterbourne declared. \u201cThen we may arrange it. If mother will stay with Randolph, I guess Eugenio will.\u201d \u201cEugenio?\u201d the young man inquired. \u201cEugenio\u2019s our courier. He doesn\u2019t like to stay with Randolph; he\u2019s the most fastidious man I ever saw. But he\u2019s a splendid courier. I guess he\u2019ll stay at home with Randolph if mother does, and then we can go to the castle.\u201d Winterbourne reflected for an instant as lucidly as possible--\u201cwe\u201d could only mean Miss Daisy Miller and himself."}, {"size": 651, "text": "This program seemed almost too agreeable for credence; he felt as if he ought to kiss the young lady\u2019s hand. Possibly he would have done so and quite spoiled the project, but at this moment another person, presumably Eugenio, appeared. A tall, handsome man, with superb whiskers, wearing a velvet morning coat and a brilliant watch chain, approached Miss Miller, looking sharply at her companion. \u201cOh, Eugenio!\u201d said Miss Miller with the friendliest accent.

But the young man was conscious, at the same moment, that it had ceased to be a matter of serious regret to him that the little American flirt should be \u201ctalked about\u201d by low-minded menials. These people, a day or two later, had serious information to give: the little American flirt was alarmingly ill. Winterbourne, when the rumor came to him, immediately went to the hotel for more news. He found that two or three charitable friends had preceded him, and that they were being entertained in Mrs."}, {"size": 649, "text": "Miller\u2019s salon by Randolph. \u201cIt\u2019s going round at night,\u201d said Randolph--\u201cthat\u2019s what made her sick. She\u2019s always going round at night. I shouldn\u2019t think she\u2019d want to, it\u2019s so plaguy dark. You can\u2019t see anything here at night, except when there\u2019s a moon. In America there\u2019s always a moon!\u201d Mrs. Miller was invisible; she was now, at least, giving her daughter the advantage of her society. It was evident that Daisy was dangerously ill. Winterbourne went often to ask for news of her, and once he saw Mrs. Miller, who, though deeply alarmed, was, rather to his surprise, perfectly composed, and, as it appeared, a most efficient and judicious nurse."}, {"size": 663, "text": "She talked a good deal about Dr. Davis, but Winterbourne paid her the compliment of saying to himself that she was not, after all, such a monstrous goose. \u201cDaisy spoke of you the other day,\u201d she said to him. \u201cHalf the time she doesn\u2019t know what she\u2019s saying, but that time I think she did. She gave me a message she told me to tell you. She told me to tell you that she never was engaged to that handsome Italian. I am sure I am very glad; Mr. Giovanelli hasn\u2019t been near us since she was taken ill. I thought he was so much of a gentleman; but I don\u2019t call that very polite! A lady told me that he was afraid I was angry with him for taking Daisy round at night."}, {"size": 713, "text": "Well, so I am, but I suppose he knows I\u2019m a lady. I would scorn to scold him. Anyway, she says she\u2019s not engaged. I don\u2019t know why she wanted you to know, but she said to me three times, \u2018Mind you tell Mr. Winterbourne.\u2019 And then she told me to ask if you remembered the time you went to that castle in Switzerland. But I said I wouldn\u2019t give any such messages as that. Only, if she is not engaged, I\u2019m sure I\u2019m glad to know it.\u201d But, as Winterbourne had said, it mattered very little. A week after this, the poor girl died; it had been a terrible case of the fever. Daisy\u2019s grave was in the little Protestant cemetery, in an angle of the wall of imperial Rome, beneath the cypresses and the thick spring flowers."}, {"size": 604, "text": "Winterbourne stood there beside it, with a number of other mourners, a number larger than the scandal excited by the young lady\u2019s career would have led you to expect. Near him stood Giovanelli, who came nearer still before Winterbourne turned away. Giovanelli was very pale: on this occasion he had no flower in his buttonhole; he seemed to wish to say something. At last he said, \u201cShe was the most beautiful young lady I ever saw, and the most amiable;\u201d and then he added in a moment, \u201cand she was the most innocent.\u201d Winterbourne looked at him and presently repeated his words, \u201cAnd the most innocent?\u201d"}, {"size": 613, "text": "Winterbourne felt sore and angry. \u201cWhy the devil,\u201d he asked, \u201cdid you take her to that fatal place?\u201d Mr. Giovanelli\u2019s urbanity was apparently imperturbable. He looked on the ground a moment, and then he said, \u201cFor myself I had no fear; and she wanted to go.\u201d \u201cThat was no reason!\u201d Winterbourne declared. The subtle Roman again dropped his eyes. \u201cIf she had lived, I should have got nothing. She would never have married me, I am sure.\u201d \u201cShe would never have married you?\u201d \u201cFor a moment I hoped so. But no. I am sure.\u201d Winterbourne listened to him: he stood staring at the raw protuberance among the April daisies."}, {"size": 614, "text": "When he turned away again, Mr. Giovanelli, with his light, slow step, had retired. Winterbourne almost immediately left Rome; but the following summer he again met his aunt, Mrs. Costello at Vevey. Mrs. Costello was fond of Vevey. In the interval Winterbourne had often thought of Daisy Miller and her mystifying manners. One day he spoke of her to his aunt--said it was on his conscience that he had done her injustice. \u201cI am sure I don\u2019t know,\u201d said Mrs. Costello. \u201cHow did your injustice affect her?\u201d \u201cShe sent me a message before her death which I didn\u2019t understand at the time; but I have understood it since."}, {"size": 595, "text": "She would have appreciated one\u2019s esteem.\u201d \u201cIs that a modest way,\u201d asked Mrs. Costello, \u201cof saying that she would have reciprocated one\u2019s affection?\u201d Winterbourne offered no answer to this question; but he presently said, \u201cYou were right in that remark that you made last summer. I was booked to make a mistake. I have lived too long in foreign parts.\u201d Nevertheless, he went back to live at Geneva, whence there continue to come the most contradictory accounts of his motives of sojourn: a report that he is \u201cstudying\u201d hard--an intimation that he is much interested in a very clever foreign lady."}]}
