It was a Thursday evening, the fifteenth of October; and although only half-past six o\u2019clock, it had been dark for some time already. The weather was cold, and the sky was as black as ink, while the wind blew tempestuously, and the rain fell in torrents.The servants at the Hotel de Chalusse, one of the most magnificent mansions in the Rue de Courcelles in Paris, were assembled in the porter\u2019s lodge, a little building comprising a couple of rooms standing on the right hand side of the great gateway."}, {"size": 632, "text": "Here, as in all large mansions, the \u201cconcierge\u201d or porter, M. Bourigeau, was a person of immense importance, always able and disposed to make any one who was inclined to doubt his authority, feel it in cruel fashion. As could be easily seen, he held all the other servants in his power. He could let them absent themselves without leave, if he chose, and conceal all returns late at night after the closing of public balls and wine-shops. Thus, it is needless to say that M.

For the time being, a pert little waiting-maid, with an odious turn-up nose, had the floor. She was addressing her remarks to a big, burly, and rather insolent-looking fellow, who had been added only the evening before to the corps of footmen. \u201cThe place is really intolerable,\u201d she was saying. \u201cThe wages are high, the food of the very best, the livery just such as would show off a good-looking man to the best advantage, and Madame Leon, the housekeeper, who has entire charge of everything, is not too lynx-eyed.\u201d"}, {"size": 613, "text": "\u201cA mere nothing.

No receptions, no dinners--nothing. Would you believe it, I have never seen the reception-rooms! They are always closed; and the furniture is dropping to pieces under its coverings.

In spite of every precaution, he had been wounded as he was removed from the cab. His forehead had been grazed by a piece of iron, and a tiny stream of blood was trickling down upon his face.

The person whom they called \u201cmademoiselle\u201d was standing on the threshold. Mademoiselle Marguerite was a beautiful young girl, about twenty years of age. She was a brunette of medium height, with big gloomy eyes shaded by thick eyebrows. Heavy masses of jet-black hair wreathed her lofty but rather sad and thoughtful forehead."}, {"size": 661, "text": "There was something peculiar in her face--an expression of concentrated suffering, and a sort of proud resignation, mingled with timidity. \u201cWhat has happened?\u201d she asked, gently. \u201cWhat is the cause of all the noise I have heard? I have rung three times and the bell was not answered.\u201d No one ventured to reply, and in her surprise she cast a hasty glance around.

But Mademoiselle Marguerite had understood him. She clasped both hands to her heart, as if she had received a fatal wound, and uttered the single word: \u201cLost!\u201d The next moment she turned as pale as death, her head drooped, her eyes closed, and she staggered as if about to fall."}, {"size": 623, "text": "Two maids sprang forward to support her, but she gently repulsed them, murmuring, \u201cThanks! thanks! I am strong now.\u201d She was, in fact, sufficiently strong to conquer her weakness. She summoned all her resolution, and, paler than a statue, with set teeth and dry, glittering eyes, she approached the alcove. She stood there for a moment perfectly motionless, murmuring a few unintelligible words; but at last, crushed by her sorrow, she sank upon her knees beside the bed, buried her face in the counterpane and wept. Deeply moved by the sight of this despair, the servants held their breath, wondering how it would all end."}, {"size": 626, "text": "It ended suddenly. The girl sprang from her knees, as if a gleam of hope had darted through her heart. \u201cA physician!\u201d she said, eagerly. \u201cI have sent for one, mademoiselle,\u201d replied M. Casimir. And hearing a voice and a sound of footsteps on the staircase, he added: \u201cAnd fortunately, here he comes.\u201d The doctor entered. He was a young man, although his head was almost quite bald. He was short, very thin, clean-shaven, and clad in black from head to foot. Without a word, without a bow, he walked straight to the bedside, lifted the unconscious man\u2019s eyelids, felt his pulse, and uncovered his chest, applying his ear to it."}, {"size": 682, "text": "\u201cThis is a serious case,\u201d he said at the close of his examination.

He had drawn his case of instruments from his pocket, and was testing the points of his lancets on the tip of his finger.

Meanwhile, inside the room, the physician was proceeding slowly, not from temperament however, but from principle. Dr. Jodon--for such was his name--was an ambitious man who played a part. Educated by a \u201cprince of science,\u201d more celebrated for the money he gained than for the cures he effected, he copied his master\u2019s method, his gestures, and even the inflections of his voice."}, {"size": 818, "text": "By casting in people\u2019s eyes the same powder as his teacher had employed, he hoped to obtain the same results: a large practice and an immense fortune. In his secret heart he was by no means disconcerted by his patient\u2019s condition; on the contrary, he did not consider the count\u2019s state nearly as precarious as it really was. But bleeding and cupping alike failed to bring the sick man to consciousness. He remained speechless and motionless; the only result obtained, was that his breathing became a trifle easier. Finding his endeavors fruitless, the doctor at last declared that all immediate remedies were exhausted, that \u201cthe women\u201d might be allowed to return, and that nothing now remained but to wait for the effect of the remedies he was about to prescribe, and which they must procure from the nearest chemist."}, {"size": 850, "text": "Any other man would have been touched by the agony of entreaty contained in the glance that Mademoiselle Marguerite cast upon the physician as she returned into the room; but it did not affect him in the least.

Casimir, \u201cI desire to make a few inquiries. Is this the first time the Count de Chalusse has had such an attack?\u201d \u201cYes, sir--at least since I have been in attendance upon him.\u201d \u201cVery good. That is a chance in our favor.

It will be necessary for you to give me the particulars, mademoiselle.\u201d The young girl hesitated.

As for this coarse examination in the presence of all these servants, and by the bedside of a man who, in spite of his apparent unconsciousness, was, perhaps, able to hear and to comprehend, she looked upon it as a breach of delicacy, even of propriety. \u201cIt is of the most urgent importance that I should be fully informed of these particulars,\u201d repeated the physician peremptorily. After such an assertion, further hesitation was out of the question. Mademoiselle Marguerite seemed to collect her thoughts, and then she sadly said: \u201cJust as we sat down to breakfast this morning, a letter was handed to the count."}, {"size": 331, "text": "No sooner had his eyes fallen upon it, than he turned as white as his napkin.

He tore the letter to pieces, and threw the pieces out of the window that opens upon the garden.\u201d Mademoiselle Marguerite expressed herself with the utmost simplicity, and there was certainly nothing particularly extraordinary in her story.

He could not be far away, for his vehicle was still standing in the courtyard. They found him in a wine-shop near by.

It would bring him into notice; he would be mentioned in the papers; and his increased practice would fill his hands with gold.

Above all, why this angry outburst for no other apparent cause than a very natural and exceedingly insignificant request on his part?

He proved to her what was indeed the truth--that by superintending his establishment, she would save more than she made in her present position. From that time the mother and the son had good reason to believe that their heroic energy had conquered fate.

She hastened to his room--he was not there. And it was nearly eight o\u2019clock.

Her first impulse was to run to the Commissary of Police\u2019s office or to the house of Pascal\u2019s friend; but on the other hand, she dared not go out, for fear he might return in her absence.

His eyes stared vacantly, and his features had an almost idiotic expression. \u201cPascal, what has happened to you?\u201d she asked.

The strangest thing connected with this scandal is, that M.

I will drop in again about midnight. I still have several urgent visits to make.\u201d Thus had Dr. Jodon spoken to Mademoiselle Marguerite; and yet, when he left the Hotel de Chalusse, after assuring himself that Casimir would have some straw spread over the street, the doctor quietly walked home.

He was a man of the present age, and wished to rise speedily with as little trouble as possible. A certain amount of display and assurance, a little luck, and a good deal of advertising would, in his opinion, suffice to bring about this result. It was with this conviction, indeed, that he had taken up his abode in the Rue de Courcelles, situated in one of the most aristocratic quarters of Paris. But so far, events had shown his theory to be incorrect. In spite of the greatest economy, very cleverly concealed, he had seen the little capital which constituted his entire fortune dwindle away."}, {"size": 759, "text": "He had originally possessed but twenty thousand francs, a sum which in no wise corresponded with his lofty pretensions.

When he thought of this contingency, and it was a subject that filled his mind to the exclusion of all other matters, he felt the fires of wrath and hatred kindle in his soul. He utterly refused to regard himself as the cause of his own misfortunes; on the contrary, following the example of many other disappointed individuals, he railed at mankind and everything in general--at circumstances, envious acquaintances, and enemies, whom he certainly did not possess."}, {"size": 869, "text": "At times he was capable of doing almost anything to gratify his lust for gold, for the privations which he had endured so long were like oil cast upon the flame of covetousness which was ever burning in his breast.

Sometimes he thought of turning dentist, or of trying to find some capitalist who would join him in manufacturing one of those patent medicines which are warranted to yield their promoters a hundred thousand francs a year. On other occasions he dreamed of establishing a monster pharmacy, or of opening a private hospital. But money was needed to carry out any one of these plans, and he had no money. There was the rub.

Faithful to his system, or, rather, to his master\u2019s system, he had sacrificed everything to show. The display of gilding in his apartments was such as to make a man of taste shut his eyes to escape the sight of it. There were gorgeous carpets and hangings, frescoed ceilings, spurious objects of virtu, and pier-tables loaded with ornaments.

Under no circumstances whatever would he have admitted a patient immediately; he wished him to wait so that he might have an opportunity of reflecting on the advantages of consulting a physician whose time was constantly occupied.

Reverses of fortune are not rare in these days; and were it not for the consoling influences of religion, one would not have strength to endure them.\u201d The physician was greatly puzzled. \u201cWhat can she want of me?\u201d he thought.

Suddenly she stopped short. It was in front of a tobacconist\u2019s shop, where there was a post-office letter-box. The shop was closed, but the box was there with its little slit for letters to be dropped into it. Madame Leon evidently hesitated.

But a gleam of common sense warned him that this would be a terrible blunder. Once already during the evening his conduct had attracted attention; and he began to realize that there was a better way of winning confidence than by intruding almost forcibly into other people\u2019s affairs. Accordingly he thoughtfully retraced his steps, feeling intensely disgusted with himself. \u201cWhat a fool I am!\u201d he grumbled. \u201cIf I had kept the old woman in suspense, instead of blurting out the truth, I might have learned the real object of her visit; for she had an object.

There was only one certain point, that Madame Leon and Mademoiselle Marguerite were equally interested in the question as to whether the count would regain consciousness or not. As to their interests in the matter, the doctor felt confident that they were not identical; he was persuaded that a secret enmity existed between them, and that the housekeeper had visited him without Mademoiselle Marguerite\u2019s knowledge."}, {"size": 606, "text": "For he was not deceived by Madame Leon, or by her pretended devotion to Mademoiselle Marguerite. Her manner, her smooth words, her tone of pious resignation, and the allusion to the grand name she had the right to bear, were all calculated to impose upon one; but she had been too much disconcerted toward the last to remember her part. Dr. Jodon lacked the courage to return to his sumptuous rooms, and it was in a little cafe that he thus reflected upon the situation, while drinking some execrable beer brewed in Paris out of a glass manufactured in Bavaria. At last midnight sounded--the hour had come."}, {"size": 652, "text": "Still the doctor did not move. Having been obliged to wait himself, he wished, in revenge, to make the others wait, and it was not until the cafe closed that he again walked up the Rue de Courcelles.

As in the earlier part of the evening, the servants were assembled in the concierge\u2019s lodge; but the careless gayety which shone upon their faces a few hours before had given place to evident anxiety respecting their future prospects.

Do you desire anything more?\u2019 The gentlemen at once became silent, and the superior hastily declared that M. de Chalusse was a thousand times too good, but that one could expect no less of him, the last representative of one of the greatest and oldest families of France. \u201cI cannot describe the surprise and indignation that were raging in my soul.

One of them, a little old man with a vapid smile and twinkling eyes, tapped me on the cheek, and said: \u2018So she is as good as she is pretty!\u2019 I could have struck him; but all the others laughed approvingly, with the exception of M. de Chalusse, whose manner became more and more frigid, and whose lips wore a constrained smile, as if he had resolved to keep his temper despite all provocation."}, {"size": 646, "text": "It seemed to me that he was suffering terribly, and I afterward learned that I had not been mistaken.

More than this, the thought of yielding myself up to a stranger terrified me. Forty-eight hours had been granted me to consider my decision, and till the very last instant I remained in doubt.

So she took her son\u2019s arm, and led him away, saying: \u201cCome, let us go.\u201d Pascal had kept the cab which he had been using during the afternoon; and having installed his mother inside, he got in himself, and gave his new address to the driver. \u201cNow tell me all,\u201d said Madame Ferailleur."}, {"size": 618, "text": "Poor Pascal was in that state of mind in which it costs one actual suffering to talk; but he wished to mitigate his mother\u2019s anxiety as much as possible; and moreover, he did not like her to suppose him wanting in endurance. So, with a powerful effort, he shook off the lethargy that was creeping over him, and in a voice loud enough to be heard above the noise of the carriage wheels, he began: \u201cThis is what I have done, mother, since I left you. I remembered that some time ago, while I was appraising some property, I had seen three or four houses on the Route de la Revolte, admirably suited to our present wants."}, {"size": 679, "text": "Naturally I went there first.

Maumejan the sum of three hundred and fifty francs for two quarters\u2019 rent, etc. \u201cMy bargain concluded,\u201d he resumed, \u201cI returned into Paris, and entered the first furniture shop I saw. I meant to hire the necessary things to furnish our little home, but the dealer made all sorts of objections."}, {"size": 781, "text": "He trembled for his furniture, he wanted a sum of money to be deposited as security, or the guarantee of three responsible business men. Seeing this, and knowing that I had no time to lose, I preferred to purchase such articles as were absolutely necessary. One of the conditions of the purchase was that everything should be in the house and in its place by eleven o\u2019clock to-night. As I stipulated in writing that the dealer should forfeit three hundred francs in case he failed to fulfil his agreement, I can rely upon his punctuality; I confided the key of our lodgings to him, and he must now be there waiting for us.\u201d So, before thinking of his love, and Mademoiselle Marguerite, Pascal had taken the necessary measures for the execution of his plan to regain his lost honor."}, {"size": 763, "text": "Madame Ferailleur had scarcely supposed him capable of so much courage and firmness, and she rewarded him with a warm pressure of the hand. Then, as he was silent: \u201cWhen did you see Madame Leon, then?\u201d she asked. \u201cWhen all the household arrangements were completed, mother. On leaving the furniture-shop, I found that I had still an hour and a quarter before me. I could defer no longer, and at the risk of obliging you to wait for me, I hastened to the Rue de Courcelles.\u201d It was evident that Pascal felt extreme embarrassment in speaking of Mademoiselle Marguerite. There is an instinctive delicacy and dislike of publicity in all deep passion, and true and chaste love is ever averse to laying aside the veil with which it conceals itself from the inquisitive."}, {"size": 647, "text": "Madame Ferailleur understood this feeling; but she was a mother, and as such, jealous of her son\u2019s tenderness, and anxious for particulars concerning this rival who had suddenly usurped her place in the heart where she had long reigned supreme. She was also a woman--that is to say, distrustful and suspicious in reference to all other women. So, without taking pity on Pascal\u2019s embarrassment, she urged him to continue. \u201cI gave the driver five francs on condition that he would hurry his horses,\u201d he resumed, \u201cand we were rattling along at a rapid rate, when, suddenly, near the Hotel de Chalusse, I noticed a change in the motion of the vehicle."}, {"size": 612, "text": "I looked out and saw that we were driving over a thick layer of straw which had been spread across the street.

Without waiting for the vehicle to stop, I sprang to the ground, and was obliged to exercise all my self-control to prevent myself from rushing into the concierge\u2019s lodge, and wildly asking: \u2018Who is dying here?\u2019 But an unforeseen difficulty presented itself. It was evident that I ought not to go in person to inquire for Madame Leon."}, {"size": 608, "text": "Whom could I send?

Ten minutes later, Madame Leon left the house and came to meet me.

Everybody will be up and moving about the house to-night, and she said she could easily make her escape for a few moments. So, at half-past twelve to-night she will be at the little garden gate, and if I am promptly at hand, I shall have a reply from Marguerite.\u201d Madame Ferailleur seemed to be expecting something more, and as Pascal remained silent, she remarked: \u201cYou spoke of a great misfortune."}, {"size": 752, "text": "In what does it consist?

How can I marry her? Would it be right for me to think of offering her a dishonored name?

But in the meantime, what is to become of HER? Think, mother, she is alone in the world, without a single friend. It is enough to drive one mad!\u201d \u201cShe loves you, you tell me. What have you to fear?

By to-morrow evening you won\u2019t recognize the place. I have saved a few trifles from the wreck--some curtains, a couple of lamps, a clock--you\u2019ll see.

The air was chilly, the night dark, and the street deserted. The gloomy silence was only disturbed at long intervals by the opening or shutting of a door, or by the distant tread of some belated pedestrian.

He found it impossible to reflect, to deliberate, to decide on any plan of action.

There was a strange ringing in his ears, and a mist swam before his eyes. At last the bell at the Beaujon Hospital tolled the appointed hour, and roused him from his lethargy.

He had been listening to that mysterious echo of our own desires which we so often mistake for a presentiment; and it had whispered in his heart: \u201cMarguerite herself will come!\u201d With the candor of wretchedness, he could not refrain from telling Madame Leon the hope he had entertained.

It was not a letter that Marguerite had sent him, but a short note, written on a scrap of crumpled paper, folded, and not sealed. It was written in pencil; and the handwriting was irregular and indistinct. Still, by the flickering light of the gas, Pascal deciphered the word \u201cMonsieur.\u201d It made him shudder. \u201cMonsieur!\u201d What did this mean? In writing to him of recent times, Marguerite had always said, \u201cMy dear Pascal,\u201d or, \u201cMy friend.\u201d Nevertheless, he continued: \u201cI have not had the courage to resist the entreaties made to me by the Count de Chalusse, my father, in his last agony."}, {"size": 656, "text": "I have solemnly pledged myself to become the wife of the Marquis de Valorsay. \u201cOne cannot break a promise made to the dying.

Having discovered one at last, he called him, gave him the missive, and then pursued his way more leisurely. He had reached the boulevard, when a florid-faced youth, remarkably short and stout, rushed toward him with both hands amicably extended, at the same time crying, loud enough to attract the attention of the passers-by: \u201cIs it possible that this is my dear Wilkie?\u201d \u201cYes--alive and in the flesh,\u201d replied the young man."}, {"size": 770, "text": "\u201cWell, and what the devil have you been doing with yourself?

I staked everything on Domingo, the Marquis de Valorsay\u2019s horse. I thought I was sure to win--yes, sure. Well, Domingo came in third. Can you understand that? If every one didn\u2019t know that Valorsay was a millionaire, it might be supposed there had been some foul play--yes, upon my word--that he had bet against his own horse, and forbidden his jockey to win the race.\u201d But the speaker did not really believe this, so he continued, more gayly: \u201cFortunately, I shall retrieve my losses to-morrow, at Vincennes.

Nor was this any great privation to him, since he gained a penny by it--and a penny was another grain of sand added to the foundation of his future wealth.

Wilkie who monopolized the conversation, while his companion listened with his elbow resting on the table, occasionally nodding his head in token of approbation. One thing that incensed Chupin was that they loitered there, when one of them had a ticket for a box at the theatre in his pocket. \u201cIdiots!\u201d he growled; \u201cthey\u2019ll wait till the play\u2019s half over before they go in.

Fortunat\u2019s emissary did not hear twenty words of it. He was so overcome with fatigue that he soon fell asleep.

She ruled her husband with a rod of iron.
