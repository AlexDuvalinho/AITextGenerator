It was here that Claverhouse shot with his own hand the Praying Weaver of Balweary, and the chisel of Old Mortality has clinked on that lonely gravestone. Public and domestic history have thus marked with a bloody finger this hollow among the hills; and since the Cameronian gave his life there, two hundred years ago, in a glorious folly, and without comprehension or regret, the silence of the moss has been broken once again by the report of firearms and the cry of the dying."}, {"size": 614, "text": "The Deil\u2019s Hags was the old name. But the place is now called Francie\u2019s Cairn. For a while it was told that Francie walked. Aggic Hogg met him in the gloaming by the cairnside, and he spoke to her, with chattering teeth, so that his words were lost. He pursued Rob Todd (if any one could have believed Robbie) for the space of half a mile with pitiful entreaties. But the age is one of incredulity; these superstitious decorations speedily fell off; and the facts of the story itself, like the bones of a giant buried there and half dug up, survived, naked and imperfect, in the memory of the scattered neighbours."}, {"size": 476, "text": "To this day, of winter nights, when the sleet is on the window and the cattle are quiet in the byre, there will be told again, amid the silence of the young and the additions and corrections of the old, the tale of the Justice-Clerk and of his son, young Hermiston, that vanished from men\u2019s knowledge; of the two Kirsties and the Four Black Brothers of the Cauldstaneslap; and of Frank Innes, \u201cthe young fool advocate,\u201d that came into these moorland parts to find his destiny."}, {"size": 771, "text": "CHAPTER I\u2014LIFE AND DEATH OF MRS. WEIRThe Lord Justice-Clerk was a stranger in that part of the country; but his lady wife was known there from a child, as her race had been before her. The old \u201criding Rutherfords of Hermiston,\u201d of whom she was the last descendant, had been famous men of yore, ill neighbours, ill subjects, and ill husbands to their wives though not their properties. Tales of them were rife for twenty miles about; and their name was even printed in the page of our Scots histories, not always to their credit. One bit the dust at Flodden; one was hanged at his peel door by James the Fifth; another fell dead in a carouse with Tom Dalyell; while a fourth (and that was Jean\u2019s own father) died presiding at a Hell-Fire Club, of which he was the founder."}, {"size": 808, "text": "There were many heads shaken in Crossmichael at that judgment; the more so as the man had a villainous reputation among high and low, and both with the godly and the worldly. At that very hour of his demise, he had ten going pleas before the Session, eight of them oppressive. And the same doom extended even to his agents; his grieve, that had been his right hand in many a left-hand business, being cast from his horse one night and drowned in a peat-hag on the Kye-skairs; and his very doer (although lawyers have long spoons) surviving him not long, and dying on a sudden in a bloody flux. In all these generations, while a male Rutherford was in the saddle with his lads, or brawling in a change-house, there would be always a white-faced wife immured at home in the old peel or the later mansion-house."}, {"size": 709, "text": "It seemed this succession of martyrs bided long, but took their vengeance in the end, and that was in the person of the last descendant, Jean. She bore the name of the Rutherfords, but she was the daughter of their trembling wives. At the first she was not wholly without charm. Neighbours recalled in her, as a child, a strain of elfin wilfulness, gentle little mutinies, sad little gaieties, even a morning gleam of beauty that was not to be fulfilled. She withered in the growing, and (whether it was the sins of her sires or the sorrows of her mothers) came to her maturity depressed, and, as it were, defaced; no blood of life in her, no grasp or gaiety; pious, anxious, tender, tearful, and incompetent."}, {"size": 712, "text": "It was a wonder to many that she had married\u2014seeming so wholly of the stuff that makes old maids. But chance cast her in the path of Adam Weir, then the new Lord-Advocate, a recognised, risen man, the conqueror of many obstacles, and thus late in the day beginning to think upon a wife. He was one who looked rather to obedience than beauty, yet it would seem he was struck with her at the first look. \u201cWha\u2019s she?\u201d he said, turning to his host; and, when he had been told, \u201cAy,\u201d says he, \u201cshe looks menseful. She minds me\u2014\u201d; and then, after a pause (which some have been daring enough to set down to sentimental recollections), \u201cIs she releegious?\u201d he asked, and was shortly after, at his own request, presented."}, {"size": 667, "text": "The acquaintance, which it seems profane to call a courtship, was pursued with Mr. Weir\u2019s accustomed industry, and was long a legend, or rather a source of legends, in the Parliament House. He was described coming, rosy with much port, into the drawing-room, walking direct up to the lady, and assailing her with pleasantries, to which the embarrassed fair one responded, in what seemed a kind of agony, \u201cEh, Mr. Weir!\u201d or \u201cO, Mr. Weir!\u201d or \u201cKeep me, Mr. Weir!\u201d On the very eve of their engagement, it was related that one had drawn near to the tender couple, and had overheard the lady cry out, with the tones of one who talked for the sake of talking, \u201cKeep me, Mr."}, {"size": 650, "text": "Weir, and what became of him?\u201d and the profound accents of the suitor reply, \u201cHaangit, mem, haangit.\u201d The motives upon either side were much debated. Mr. Weir must have supposed his bride to be somehow suitable; perhaps he belonged to that class of men who think a weak head the ornament of women\u2014an opinion invariably punished in this life. Her descent and her estate were beyond question. Her wayfaring ancestors and her litigious father had done well by Jean. There was ready money and there were broad acres, ready to fall wholly to the husband, to lend dignity to his descendants, and to himself a title, when he should be called upon the Bench."}, {"size": 700, "text": "On the side of Jean, there was perhaps some fascination of curiosity as to this unknown male animal that approached her with the roughness of a ploughman and the _aplomb_ of an advocate. Being so trenchantly opposed to all she knew, loved, or understood, he may well have seemed to her the extreme, if scarcely the ideal, of his sex. And besides, he was an ill man to refuse. A little over forty at the period of his marriage, he looked already older, and to the force of manhood added the senatorial dignity of years; it was, perhaps, with an unreverend awe, but he was awful. The Bench, the Bar, and the most experienced and reluctant witness, bowed to his authority\u2014and why not Jeannie Rutherford?"}, {"size": 864, "text": "The heresy about foolish women is always punished, I have said, and Lord Hermiston began to pay the penalty at once. His house in George Square was wretchedly ill-guided; nothing answerable to the expense of maintenance but the cellar, which was his own private care. When things went wrong at dinner, as they continually did, my lord would look up the table at his wife: \u201cI think these broth would be better to sweem in than to sup.\u201d Or else to the butler: \u201cHere, M\u2018Killop, awa\u2019 wi\u2019 this Raadical gigot\u2014tak\u2019 it to the French, man, and bring me some puddocks! It seems rather a sore kind of a business that I should be all day in Court haanging Raadicals, and get nawthing to my denner.\u201d Of course this was but a manner of speaking, and he had never hanged a man for being a Radical in his life; the law, of which he was the faithful minister, directing otherwise."}, {"size": 610, "text": "And of course these growls were in the nature of pleasantry, but it was of a recondite sort; and uttered as they were in his resounding voice, and commented on by that expression which they called in the Parliament House \u201cHermiston\u2019s hanging face\u201d\u2014they struck mere dismay into the wife. She sat before him speechless and fluttering; at each dish, as at a fresh ordeal, her eye hovered toward my lord\u2019s countenance and fell again; if he but ate in silence, unspeakable relief was her portion; if there were complaint, the world was darkened. She would seek out the cook, who was always her _sister in the Lord_."}, {"size": 725, "text": "\u201cO, my dear, this is the most dreidful thing that my lord can never be contented in his own house!\u201d she would begin; and weep and pray with the cook; and then the cook would pray with Mrs. Weir; and the next day\u2019s meal would never be a penny the better\u2014and the next cook (when she came) would be worse, if anything, but just as pious. It was often wondered that Lord Hermiston bore it as he did; indeed, he was a stoical old voluptuary, contented with sound wine and plenty of it. But there were moments when he overflowed. Perhaps half a dozen times in the history of his married life\u2014\u201cHere! tak\u2019 it awa\u2019, and bring me a piece bread and kebbuck!\u201d he had exclaimed, with an appalling explosion of his voice and rare gestures."}, {"size": 895, "text": "None thought to dispute or to make excuses; the service was arrested; Mrs. Weir sat at the head of the table whimpering without disguise; and his lordship opposite munched his bread and cheese in ostentatious disregard. Once only, Mrs. Weir had ventured to appeal. He was passing her chair on his way into the study. \u201cO, Edom!\u201d she wailed, in a voice tragic with tears, and reaching out to him both hands, in one of which she held a sopping pocket-handkerchief. He paused and looked upon her with a face of wrath, into which there stole, as he looked, a twinkle of humour. \u201cNoansense!\u201d he said. \u201cYou and your noansense! What do I want with a Christian faim\u2019ly? I want Christian broth! Get me a lass that can plain-boil a potato, if she was a wh\u00fcre off the streets.\u201d And with these words, which echoed in her tender ears like blasphemy, he had passed on to his study and shut the door behind him."}, {"size": 650, "text": "Such was the housewifery in George Square. It was better at Hermiston, where Kirstie Elliott, the sister of a neighbouring bonnet-laird, and an eighteenth cousin of the lady\u2019s, bore the charge of all, and kept a trim house and a good country table. Kirstie was a woman in a thousand, clean, capable, notable; once a moorland Helen, and still comely as a blood horse and healthy as the hill wind. High in flesh and voice and colour, she ran the house with her whole intemperate soul, in a bustle, not without buffets. Scarce more pious than decency in those days required, she was the cause of many an anxious thought and many a tearful prayer to Mrs."}, {"size": 667, "text": "Weir. Housekeeper and mistress renewed the parts of Martha and Mary; and though with a pricking conscience, Mary reposed on Martha\u2019s strength as on a rock. Even Lord Hermiston held Kirstie in a particular regard. There were few with whom he unbent so gladly, few whom he favoured with so many pleasantries. \u201cKirstie and me maun have our joke,\u201d he would declare in high good-humour, as he buttered Kirstie\u2019s scones, and she waited at table. A man who had no need either of love or of popularity, a keen reader of men and of events, there was perhaps only one truth for which he was quite unprepared: he would have been quite unprepared to learn that Kirstie hated him."}, {"size": 660, "text": "He thought maid and master were well matched; hard, bandy, healthy, broad Scots folk, without a hair of nonsense to the pair of them. And the fact was that she made a goddess and an only child of the effete and tearful lady; and even as she waited at table her hands would sometimes itch for my lord\u2019s ears. Thus, at least, when the family were at Hermiston, not only my lord, but Mrs. Weir too, enjoyed a holiday. Free from the dreadful looking-for of the miscarried dinner, she would mind her seam, read her piety books, and take her walk (which was my lord\u2019s orders), sometimes by herself, sometimes with Archie, the only child of that scarce natural union."}, {"size": 683, "text": "The child was her next bond to life. Her frosted sentiment bloomed again, she breathed deep of life, she let loose her heart, in that society. The miracle of her motherhood was ever new to her. The sight of the little man at her skirt intoxicated her with the sense of power, and froze her with the consciousness of her responsibility. She looked forward, and, seeing him in fancy grow up and play his diverse part on the world\u2019s theatre, caught in her breath and lifted up her courage with a lively effort. It was only with the child that she forgot herself and was at moments natural; yet it was only with the child that she had conceived and managed to pursue a scheme of conduct."}, {"size": 666, "text": "Archie was to be a great man and a good; a minister if possible, a saint for certain. She tried to engage his mind upon her favourite books, Rutherford\u2019s _Letters_, Scougalls _Grace Abounding_, and the like. It was a common practice of hers (and strange to remember now) that she would carry the child to the Deil\u2019s Hags, sit with him on the Praying Weaver\u2019s stone, and talk of the Covenanters till their tears ran down. Her view of history was wholly artless, a design in snow and ink; upon the one side, tender innocents with psalms upon their lips; upon the other, the persecutors, booted, bloody-minded, flushed with wine: a suffering Christ, a raging Beelzebub."}, {"size": 808, "text": "_Persecutor_ was a word that knocked upon the woman\u2019s heart; it was her highest thought of wickedness, and the mark of it was on her house. Her great-great-grandfather had drawn the sword against the Lord\u2019s anointed on the field of Rullion Green, and breathed his last (tradition said) in the arms of the detestable Dalyell. Nor could she blind herself to this, that had they lived in those old days, Hermiston himself would have been numbered alongside of Bloody MacKenzie and the politic Lauderdale and Rothes, in the band of God\u2019s immediate enemies. The sense of this moved her to the more fervour; she had a voice for that name of _persecutor_ that thrilled in the child\u2019s marrow; and when one day the mob hooted and hissed them all in my lord\u2019s travelling carriage, and cried, \u201cDown with the persecutor!"}, {"size": 645, "text": "down with Hanging Hermiston!\u201d and mamma covered her eyes and wept, and papa let down the glass and looked out upon the rabble with his droll formidable face, bitter and smiling, as they said he sometimes looked when he gave sentence, Archie was for the moment too much amazed to be alarmed, but he had scarce got his mother by herself before his shrill voice was raised demanding an explanation: why had they called papa a persecutor? \u201cKeep me, my precious!\u201d she exclaimed. \u201cKeep me, my dear! this is poleetical. Ye must never ask me anything poleetical, Erchie. Your faither is a great man, my dear, and it\u2019s no for me or you to be judging him."}, {"size": 638, "text": "It would be telling us all, if we behaved ourselves in our several stations the way your faither does in his high office; and let me hear no more of any such disrespectful and undutiful questions! No that you meant to be undutiful, my lamb; your mother kens that\u2014she kens it well, dearie!\u201d And so slid off to safer topics, and left on the mind of the child an obscure but ineradicable sense of something wrong. Mrs. Weir\u2019s philosophy of life was summed in one expression\u2014tenderness. In her view of the universe, which was all lighted up with a glow out of the doors of hell, good people must walk there in a kind of ecstasy of tenderness."}, {"size": 648, "text": "The beasts and plants had no souls; they were here but for a day, and let their day pass gently! And as for the immortal men, on what black, downward path were many of them wending, and to what a horror of an immortality! \u201cAre not two sparrows,\u201d \u201cWhosoever shall smite thee,\u201d \u201cGod sendeth His rain,\u201d \u201cJudge not, that ye be not judged\u201d\u2014these texts made her body of divinity; she put them on in the morning with her clothes and lay down to sleep with them at night; they haunted her like a favourite air, they clung about her like a favourite perfume. Their minister was a marrowy expounder of the law, and my lord sat under him with relish; but Mrs."}, {"size": 791, "text": "Weir respected him from far off; heard him (like the cannon of a beleaguered city) usefully booming outside on the dogmatic ramparts; and meanwhile, within and out of shot, dwelt in her private garden which she watered with grateful tears. It seems strange to say of this colourless and ineffectual woman, but she was a true enthusiast, and might have made the sunshine and the glory of a cloister. Perhaps none but Archie knew she could be eloquent; perhaps none but he had seen her\u2014her colour raised, her hands clasped or quivering\u2014glow with gentle ardour. There is a corner of the policy of Hermiston, where you come suddenly in view of the summit of Black Fell, sometimes like the mere grass top of a hill, sometimes (and this is her own expression) like a precious jewel in the heavens."}, {"size": 831, "text": "On such days, upon the sudden view of it, her hand would tighten on the child\u2019s fingers, her voice rise like a song. \u201c_I to the hills_!\u201d she would repeat. \u201cAnd O, Erchie, are nae these like the hills of Naphtali?\u201d and her tears would flow. Upon an impressionable child the effect of this continual and pretty accompaniment to life was deep. The woman\u2019s quietism and piety passed on to his different nature undiminished; but whereas in her it was a native sentiment, in him it was only an implanted dogma. Nature and the child\u2019s pugnacity at times revolted. A cad from the Potterrow once struck him in the mouth; he struck back, the pair fought it out in the back stable lane towards the Meadows, and Archie returned with a considerable decline in the number of his front teeth, and unregenerately boasting of the losses of the foe."}, {"size": 682, "text": "It was a sore day for Mrs. Weir; she wept and prayed over the infant backslider until my lord was due from Court, and she must resume that air of tremulous composure with which she always greeted him. The judge was that day in an observant mood, and remarked upon the absent teeth. \u201cI am afraid Erchie will have been fechting with some of they blagyard lads,\u201d said Mrs. Weir. My lord\u2019s voice rang out as it did seldom in the privacy of his own house. \u201cI\u2019ll have norm of that, sir!\u201d he cried. \u201cDo you hear me?\u2014nonn of that! No son of mine shall be speldering in the glaur with any dirty raibble.\u201d The anxious mother was grateful for so much support; she had even feared the contrary."}, {"size": 851, "text": "And that night when she put the child to bed\u2014\u201cNow, my dear, ye see!\u201d she said, \u201cI told you what your faither would think of it, if he heard ye had fallen into this dreidful sin; and let you and me pray to God that ye may be keepit from the like temptation or strengthened to resist it!\u201d The womanly falsity of this was thrown away. Ice and iron cannot be welded; and the points of view of the Justice-Clerk and Mrs. Weir were not less unassimilable. The character and position of his father had long been a stumbling-block to Archie, and with every year of his age the difficulty grew more instant. The man was mostly silent; when he spoke at all, it was to speak of the things of the world, always in a worldly spirit, often in language that the child had been schooled to think coarse, and sometimes with words that he knew to be sins in themselves."}, {"size": 783, "text": "Tenderness was the first duty, and my lord was invariably harsh. God was love; the name of my lord (to all who knew him) was fear. In the world, as schematised for Archie by his mother, the place was marked for such a creature. There were some whom it was good to pity and well (though very likely useless) to pray for; they were named reprobates, goats, God\u2019s enemies, brands for the burning; and Archie tallied every mark of identification, and drew the inevitable private inference that the Lord Justice-Clerk was the chief of sinners. The mother\u2019s honesty was scarce complete. There was one influence she feared for the child and still secretly combated; that was my lord\u2019s; and half unconsciously, half in a wilful blindness, she continued to undermine her husband with his son."}, {"size": 816, "text": "As long as Archie remained silent, she did so ruthlessly, with a single eye to heaven and the child\u2019s salvation; but the day came when Archie spoke. It was 1801, and Archie was seven, and beyond his years for curiosity and logic, when he brought the case up openly. If judging were sinful and forbidden, how came papa to be a judge? to have that sin for a trade? to bear the name of it for a distinction? \u201cI can\u2019t see it,\u201d said the little Rabbi, and wagged his head. Mrs. Weir abounded in commonplace replies. \u201cNo, I cannae see it,\u201d reiterated Archie. \u201cAnd I\u2019ll tell you what, mamma, I don\u2019t think you and me\u2019s justifeed in staying with him.\u201d The woman awoke to remorse, she saw herself disloyal to her man, her sovereign and bread-winner, in whom (with what she had of worldliness) she took a certain subdued pride."}, {"size": 659, "text": "She expatiated in reply on my lord\u2019s honour and greatness; his useful services in this world of sorrow and wrong, and the place in which he stood, far above where babes and innocents could hope to see or criticise. But she had builded too well\u2014Archie had his answers pat: Were not babes and innocents the type of the kingdom of heaven? Were not honour and greatness the badges of the world? And at any rate, how about the mob that had once seethed about the carriage? \u201cIt\u2019s all very fine,\u201d he concluded, \u201cbut in my opinion papa has no right to be it. And it seems that\u2019s not the worst yet of it.

It would break my heart to think that of you. And O, Erchie, here are\u2019na _you_ setting up to _judge_?

And no doubt it is easy thus to circumvent a child with catchwords, but it may be questioned how far it is effectual. An instinct in his breast detects the quibble, and a voice condemns it. He will instantly submit, privately hold the same opinion. For even in this simple and antique relation of the mother and the child, hypocrisies are multiplied. When the Court rose that year and the family returned to Hermiston, it was a common remark in all the country that the lady was sore failed."}, {"size": 625, "text": "She seemed to loose and seize again her touch with life, now sitting inert in a sort of durable bewilderment, anon waking to feverish and weak activity. She dawdled about the lasses at their work, looking stupidly on; she fell to rummaging in old cabinets and presses, and desisted when half through; she would begin remarks with an air of animation and drop them without a struggle. Her common appearance was of one who has forgotten something and is trying to remember; and when she overhauled, one after another, the worthless and touching mementoes of her youth, she might have been seeking the clue to that lost thought."}, {"size": 761, "text": "During this period, she gave many gifts to the neighbours and house lasses, giving them with a manner of regret that embarrassed the recipients. The last night of all she was busy on some female work, and toiled upon it with so manifest and painful a devotion that my lord (who was not often curious) inquired as to its nature. She blushed to the eyes. \u201cO, Edom, it\u2019s for you!\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s slippers.

Kirstie took this decay of her mistress very hard; bore her a grudge, quarrelled with and railed upon her, the anxiety of a genuine love wearing the disguise of temper."}, {"size": 703, "text": "This day of all days she insisted disrespectfully, with rustic fury, that Mrs. Weir should stay at home. But, \u201cNo, no,\u201d she said, \u201cit\u2019s my lord\u2019s orders,\u201d and set forth as usual. Archie was visible in the acre bog, engaged upon some childish enterprise, the instrument of which was mire; and she stood and looked at him a while like one about to call; then thought otherwise, sighed, and shook her head, and proceeded on her rounds alone. The house lasses were at the burnside washing, and saw her pass with her loose, weary, dowdy gait. \u201cShe\u2019s a terrible feckless wife, the mistress!\u201d said the one. \u201cTut,\u201d said the other, \u201cthe wumman\u2019s seeck.\u201d \u201cWeel, I canna see nae differ in her,\u201d returned the first."}, {"size": 658, "text": "\u201cA fushionless quean, a feckless carline.\u201d The poor creature thus discussed rambled a while in the grounds without a purpose.

He was an admired lawyer, a highly unpopular judge; and he looked down upon those who were his inferiors in either distinction, who were lawyers of less grasp or judges not so much detested.

Once, a court holiday falling opportunely, my lord had his carriage, and drove the child himself to Hermiston, the customary place of convalescence.

Hermiston pew was a little square box, dwarfish in proportion with the kirk itself, and enclosing a table not much bigger than a footstool.

The Cauldstaneslap party was scarcely an exception; Dandie perhaps, as he amused himself making verses through the interminable burden of the service, stood out a little by the glow in his eye and a certain superior animation of face and alertness of body; but even Dandie slouched like a rustic."}, {"size": 802, "text": "The rest of the congregation, like so many sheep, oppressed him with a sense of hob-nailed routine, day following day\u2014of physical labour in the open air, oatmeal porridge, peas bannock the somnolent fireside in the evening, and the night-long nasal slumbers in a box-bed. Yet he knew many of them to be shrewd and humorous, men of character, notable women, making a bustle in the world and radiating an influence from their low-browed doors. He knew besides they were like other men; below the crust of custom, rapture found a way; he had heard them beat the timbrel before Bacchus\u2014had heard them shout and carouse over their whisky-toddy; and not the most Dutch-bottomed and severe faces among them all, not even the solemn elders themselves, but were capable of singular gambols at the voice of love."}, {"size": 801, "text": "Men drawing near to an end of life\u2019s adventurous journey\u2014maids thrilling with fear and curiosity on the threshold of entrance\u2014women who had borne and perhaps buried children, who could remember the clinging of the small dead hands and the patter of the little feet now silent\u2014he marvelled that among all those faces there should be no face of expectation, none that was mobile, none into which the rhythm and poetry of life had entered. \u201cO for a live face,\u201d he thought; and at times he had a memory of Lady Flora; and at times he would study the living gallery before him with despair, and would see himself go on to waste his days in that joyless pastoral place, and death come to him, and his grave be dug under the rowans, and the Spirit of the Earth laugh out in a thunder-peal at the huge fiasco."}, {"size": 606, "text": "On this particular Sunday, there was no doubt but that the spring had come at last.

His heart perhaps beat in time to some vast indwelling rhythm of the universe. By the time he came to a corner of the valley and could see the kirk, he had so lingered by the way that the first psalm was finishing. The nasal psalmody, full of turns and trills and graceless graces, seemed the essential voice of the kirk itself upraised in thanksgiving, \u201cEverything\u2019s alive,\u201d he said; and again cries it aloud, \u201cthank God, everything\u2019s alive!\u201d He lingered yet a while in the kirk-yard."}, {"size": 844, "text": "A tuft of primroses was blooming hard by the leg of an old black table tombstone, and he stopped to contemplate the random apologue.

He could not follow the prayer, not even the heads of it. Brightnesses of azure, clouds of fragrance, a tinkle of falling water and singing birds, rose like exhalations from some deeper, aboriginal memory, that was not his, but belonged to the flesh on his bones. His body remembered; and it seemed to him that his body was in no way gross, but ethereal and perishable like a strain of music; and he felt for it an exquisite tenderness as for a child, an innocent, full of beautiful instincts and destined to an early death."}, {"size": 664, "text": "And he felt for old Torrance\u2014of the many supplications, of the few days\u2014a pity that was near to tears.

She settled on the plainest of them,\u2014a pink short young man with a dish face and no figure, at whose admiration she could afford to smile; but for all that, the consciousness of his gaze (which was really fixed on Torrance and his mittens) kept her in something of a flutter till the word Amen."}, {"size": 741, "text": "Even then, she was far too well-bred to gratify her curiosity with any impatience.

At this signal of distress Archie awoke to a sense of his ill-behaviour. What had he been doing? He had been exquisitely rude in church to the niece of his housekeeper; he had stared like a lackey and a libertine at a beautiful and modest girl.

And at the memory of the blush, she blushed again, and became one general blush burning from head to foot. Was ever anything so indelicate, so forward, done by a girl before?

Thence she passed rapidly through the morass, and came to the farther end of it, where a sluggish burn discharges, and the path for Hermiston accompanies it on the beginning of its downward path. From this corner a wide view was opened to her of the whole stretch of braes upon the other side, still sallow and in places rusty with the winter, with the path marked boldly, here and there by the burn-side a tuft of birches, and\u2014two miles off as the crow flies\u2014from its enclosures and young plantations, the windows of Hermiston glittering in the western sun."}, {"size": 608, "text": "Here she sat down and waited, and looked for a long time at these far-away bright panes of glass.

He _was_ coming; his hesitations had quite ceased, his step grew firm and swift; no doubt remained; and the question loomed up before her instant: what was she to do? It was all very well to say that her brother was a laird himself: it was all very well to speak of casual intermarriages and to count cousinship, like Auntie Kirstie.

He had no hope to find her; he took the off chance without expectation of result and to relieve his uneasiness. The greater was his surprise, as he surmounted the slope and came into the hollow of the Deil\u2019s Hags, to see there, like an answer to his wishes, the little womanly figure in the grey dress and the pink kerchief sitting little, and low, and lost, and acutely solitary, in these desolate surroundings and on the weather-beaten stone of the dead weaver."}, {"size": 688, "text": "Those things that still smacked of winter were all rusty about her, and those things that already relished of the spring had put forth the tender and lively colours of the season.

Any port in a storm! He was manfully turning his back on the Parliament House and its gay babble, on porter and oysters, the race-course and the ring; and manfully prepared, until these clouds should have blown by, to share a living grave with Archie Weir at Hermiston.

Frank was thus conscious that he had one ally and sympathiser in the midst of that general union of disfavour that surrounded, watched, and waited on him in the house of Hermiston; but he had little comfort or society from that alliance, and the demure little maid (twelve on her last birthday) preserved her own counsel, and tripped on his service, brisk, dumbly responsive, but inexorably unconversational."}, {"size": 606, "text": "For the others, they were beyond hope and beyond endurance. Never had a young Apollo been cast among such rustic barbarians. But perhaps the cause of his ill-success lay in one trait which was habitual and unconscious with him, yet diagnostic of the man. It was his practice to approach any one person at the expense of some one else. He offered you an alliance against the some one else; he flattered you by slighting him; you were drawn into a small intrigue against him before you knew how. Wonderful are the virtues of this process generally; but Frank\u2019s mistake was in the choice of the some one else."}, {"size": 662, "text": "He was not politic in that; he listened to the voice of irritation. Archie had offended him at first by what he had felt to be rather a dry reception, had offended him since by his frequent absences.

Clem, who saw him but for a day or two before he went to Glasgow, wanted to know what the fule\u2019s business was, and whether he meant to stay here all session time! \u201cYon\u2019s a drone,\u201d he pronounced.

Dand, on the other hand, he did not value sixpence, and he showed it even while he tried to flatter. Condescension is an excellent thing, but it is strange how one-sided the pleasure of it is!

Young Hay and young Pringle appeared again.

All this while, however, there was a more poisonous ferment at work between the two lads, which came late indeed to the surface, but had modified and magnified their dissensions from the first. To an idle, shallow, easy-going customer like Frank, the smell of a mystery was attractive.

Innes went off down-hill in a passion of resentment, easy to be understood, but which yielded progressively to the needs of his situation.

Frank\u2019s resemblance to Talleyrand strikes me as imaginary; but at least not Talleyrand himself could have more obediently taken his lesson from the facts. He met Archie at dinner without resentment, almost with cordiality. You must take your friends as you find them, he would have said. Archie couldn\u2019t help being his father\u2019s son, or his grandfather\u2019s, the hypothetical weaver\u2019s, grandson.

The intended argument, then, so far as it was known at the time of the writer\u2019s death to his step-daughter and devoted amanuensis, Mrs. Strong, was nearly as follows:\u2014 Archie persists in his good resolution of avoiding further conduct compromising to young Kirstie\u2019s good name."}, {"size": 616, "text": "Taking advantage of the situation thus created, and of the girl\u2019s unhappiness and wounded vanity, Frank Innes pursues his purpose of seduction; and Kirstie, though still caring for Archie in her heart, allows herself to become Frank\u2019s victim.

They are about to close in upon him with this purpose when he is arrested by the officers of the law for the murder of Frank. He is tried before his own father, the Lord Justice-Clerk, found guilty, and condemned to death. Meanwhile the elder Kirstie, having discovered from the girl how matters really stand, informs her nephews of the truth; and they, in a great revulsion of feeling in Archie\u2019s favour, determine on an action after the ancient manner of their house."}, {"size": 734, "text": "They gather a following, and after a great fight break the prison where Archie lies confined, and rescue him.

The vengeance to be taken on the seducer beside the Weaver\u2019s Stone is prepared for in the first words of the Introduction; while the situation and fate of the judge, confronting like a Brutus, but unable to survive, the duty of sending his own son to the gallows, seem clearly to have been destined to furnish the climax and essential tragedy of the tale."}, {"size": 745, "text": "How this last circumstance was to have been brought about, within the limits of legal usage and possibility, seems hard to conjecture; but it was a point to which the author had evidently given careful consideration.

The Lord Justice-Clerk was head of the criminal justiciary of the country; he might have insisted on his right of being present on the bench when his son was tried: but he would never have been allowed to preside or to pass sentence."}, {"size": 648, "text": "Now in a letter of Stevenson\u2019s to Mr. Baxter, of October 1892, I find him asking for materials in terms which seem to indicate that he knew this quite well:\u2014\u201cI wish Pitcairn\u2019s \u2018Criminal Trials,\u2019 _quam primum_.

But they do not show how he meant to get over the main difficulty, which at the same time he fully recognises. Can it have been that Lord Hermiston\u2019s part was to have been limited to presiding at the _first_ trial, where the evidence incriminating Archie was unexpectedly brought forward, and to directing that the law should take its course?"}, {"size": 601, "text": "Whether the final escape and union of Archie and Christina would have proved equally essential to the plot may perhaps to some readers seem questionable.

If you had told the truth, I for one could never have forgiven you. As you had conceived and written the earlier parts, the truth about the end, though indisputably true to fact, would have been a lie, or what is worse, a discord, in art.

But in this case, there is worse behind, for the ill ending does not inherently issue from the plot\u2014the story had, in fact, ended well after the great last interview between Richard and Lucy\u2014and the blind, illogical bullet which smashes all has no more to do between the boards than a fly has to do with a room into whose open window it comes buzzing."}, {"size": 724, "text": "It might have so happened; it needed not; and unless needs must, we have no right to pain our readers.

This famous judge has been for generations the subject of a hundred Edinburgh tales and anecdotes. Readers of Stevenson\u2019s essay on the Raeburn exhibition, in _Virginibus Puerisque_, will remember how he is fascinated by Raeburn\u2019s portrait of Braxfield, even as Lockhart had been fascinated by a different portrait of the same worthy sixty years before (see _Peter\u2019s Letters to his Kinsfolk_); nor did his interest in the character diminish in later life."}, {"size": 627, "text": "Again, the case of a judge involved by the exigencies of his office in a strong conflict between public duty and private interest or affection, was one which had always attracted and exercised Stevenson\u2019s imagination.

Some time later Stevenson and his wife together wrote a play called _The Hanging Judge_."}, {"size": 750, "text": "In this, the title character is tempted for the first time in his life to tamper with the course of justice, in order to shield his wife from persecution by a former husband who reappears after being supposed dead.

These three elements, then, the interest of the historical personality of Lord Braxfield, the problems and emotions arising from a violent conflict between duty and nature in a judge, and the difficulties due to incompatibility and misunderstanding between father and son, lie at the foundations of the present story."}, {"size": 661, "text": "To touch on minor matters, it is perhaps worth notice, as Mr. Henley reminds me, that the name of Weir had from of old a special significance for Stevenson\u2019s imagination, from the traditional fame in Edinburgh of Major Weir, burned as a warlock, together with his sister, under circumstances of peculiar atrocity.

The little that he says about her himself is in a letter written a few days before his death to Mr. Gosse.

Yet this was not from cruelty, for which he was too strong and too jovial, but from cherished coarseness.\u201d Readers, nevertheless, who are at all acquainted with the social history of Scotland will hardly have failed to make the observation that Braxfield\u2019s is an extreme case of eighteenth-century manners, as he himself was an eighteenth-century personage (he died in 1799, in his seventy-eighth year); and that for the date in which the story is cast (1814) such manners are somewhat of an anachronism."}, {"size": 708, "text": "During the generation contemporary with the French Revolution and the Napoleonic wars\u2014or to put it another way, the generation that elapsed between the days when Scott roamed the country as a High School and University student and those when he settled in the fulness of fame and prosperity at Abbotsford,\u2014or again (the allusions will appeal to readers of the admirable Galt) during the interval between the first and the last provostry of Bailie Pawkie in the borough of Gudetown, or between the earlier and the final ministrations of Mr. Balwhidder in the parish of Dalmailing,\u2014during this period a great softening had taken place in Scottish manners generally, and in those of the Bar and Bench not least."}, {"size": 640, "text": "\u201cSince the death of Lord Justice-Clerk Macqueen of Braxfield,\u201d says Lockhart, writing about 1817, \u201cthe whole exterior of judicial deportment has been quite altered.\u201d A similar criticism may probably hold good on the picture of border life contained in the chapter concerning the Four Black Brothers of Cauldstaneslap, namely, that it rather suggests the ways of an earlier generation; nor have I any clue to the reasons which led Stevenson to choose this particular date, in the year preceding Waterloo, for a story which, in regard to some of its features at least, might seem more naturally placed some twenty-five or thirty years before."}, {"size": 635, "text": "If the reader seeks, further, to know whether the scenery of Hermiston can be identified with any one special place familiar to the writer\u2019s early experience, the answer, I think, must be in the negative. Rather it is distilled from a number of different haunts and associations among the moorlands of southern Scotland. In the dedication and in a letter to me he indicates the Lammermuirs as the scene of his tragedy. And Mrs. Stevenson (his mother) tells me that she thinks he was inspired by recollections of a visit paid in boyhood to an uncle living at a remote farmhouse in that district called Overshiels, in the parish of Stow."}, {"size": 684, "text": "But though he may have thought of the Lammermuirs in the first instance, we have already found him drawing his description of the kirk and manse from another haunt of his youth, namely, Glencorse in the Pentlands; while passages in chapters v. and viii. point explicitly to a third district, that is, Upper Tweeddale, with the country stretching thence towards the wells of Clyde. With this country also holiday rides and excursions from Peebles had made him familiar as a boy: and this seems certainly the most natural scene of the story, if only from its proximity to the proper home of the Elliotts, which of course is in the heart of the Border, especially Teviotdale and Ettrick."}, {"size": 894, "text": "Some of the geographical names mentioned are clearly not meant to furnish literal indications. The Spango, for instance, is a water running, I believe, not into the Tweed but into the Nith, and Crossmichael as the name of a town is borrowed from Galloway. But it is with the general and essential that the artist deals, and questions of strict historical perspective or local definition are beside the mark in considering his work. Nor will any reader expect, or be grateful for, comment in this place on matters which are more properly to the point\u2014on the seizing and penetrating power of the author\u2019s ripened art as exhibited in the foregoing pages, the wide range of character and emotion over which he sweeps with so assured a hand, his vital poetry of vision and magic of presentment.
