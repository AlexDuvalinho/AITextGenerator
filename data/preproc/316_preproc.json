TO THE MEMORY OF Aunt Mary Lawson WHO TOLD ME MANY OF THE TALES REPEATED BY THE STORY GIRL Once upon a time we all walked on the golden road. It was a fair highway, through the Land of Lost Delight; shadow and sunshine were blessedly mingled, and every turn and dip revealed a fresh charm and a new loveliness to eager hearts and unspoiled eyes. On that road we heard the song of morning stars; we drank in fragrances aerial and sweet as a May mist; we were rich in gossamer fancies and iris hopes; our hearts sought and found the boon of dreams; the years waited beyond and they were very fair; life was a rose-lipped comrade with purple flowers dripping from her fingers."}, {"size": 249, "text": "We may long have left the golden road behind, but its memories are the dearest of our eternal possessions; and those who cherish them as such may haply find a pleasure in the pages of this book, whose people are pilgrims on the golden road of youth."}, {"size": 677, "text": "CHAPTER I. A NEW DEPARTURE \u201cI\u2019ve thought of something amusing for the winter,\u201d I said as we drew into a half-circle around the glorious wood-fire in Uncle Alec\u2019s kitchen. It had been a day of wild November wind, closing down into a wet, eerie twilight. Outside, the wind was shrilling at the windows and around the eaves, and the rain was playing on the roof. The old willow at the gate was writhing in the storm and the orchard was a place of weird music, born of all the tears and fears that haunt the halls of night. But little we cared for the gloom and the loneliness of the outside world; we kept them at bay with the light of the fire and the laughter of our young lips."}, {"size": 871, "text": "We had been having a splendid game of Blind-Man\u2019s Buff.

Old Hugh had really nothing against Kenneth himself; but years before either Kenneth or Ursula was born, Kenneth\u2019s father had beaten Hugh Townley in a hotly contested election. Political feeling ran high in those days, and old Hugh had never forgiven the MacNair his victory. The feud between the families dated from that tempest in the provincial teapot, and the surplus of votes on the wrong side was the reason why, thirty years after, Ursula had to meet her lover by stealth if she met him at all.\u201d \u201cWas the MacNair a Conservative or a Grit?\u201d asked Felicity."}, {"size": 737, "text": "\u201cIt doesn\u2019t make any difference what he was,\u201d said the Story Girl impatiently. \u201cEven a Tory would be romantic a hundred years ago.

On this particular day it was nearly three months since they had met. \u201cThe Sunday before, young Sandy MacNair had been in Carlyle church. He had risen at dawn that morning, walked bare-footed for eight miles along the shore, carrying his shoes, hired a harbour fisherman to row him over the channel, and then walked eight miles more to the church at Carlyle, less, it is to be feared, from a zeal for holy things than that he might do an errand for his adored brother, Kenneth."}, {"size": 649, "text": "He carried a letter which he contrived to pass into Ursula\u2019s hand in the crowd as the people came out.

We did not look forward to our visit with any particular delight, for there was nobody at Cousin Mattie\u2019s except grown-ups who had been grown up so long that it was rather hard for them to remember they had ever been children.

We enjoyed our walk--even Felix enjoyed it, although he had been appointed to write up the visit for Our Magazine and was rather weighed down by the responsibility of it. What mattered it though the world were gray and wintry?

We went over fields, crossed by spidery trails of gray fences, where the withered grasses stuck forlornly up through the snow; we lingered for a time in a group of hill pines, great, majestic tree-creatures, friends of evening stars; and finally struck into the belt of fir and maple which intervened between Carlisle and Baywater. It was in this locality that Peg Bowen lived, and our way lay near her house though not directly in sight of it. We hoped we would not meet her, for since the affair of the bewitchment of Paddy we did not know quite what to think of Peg; the boldest of us held his breath as we passed her haunts, and drew it again with a sigh of relief when they were safely left behind."}, {"size": 604, "text": "The woods were full of the brooding stillness that often precedes a storm, and the wind crept along their white, cone-sprinkled floors with a low, wailing cry.

Remember your second resolution,\u201d I whispered to the Story Girl, who was stalking along with an outraged expression. The Story Girl swallowed something and went on. \u201cCousin Ebenezer had a horror of borrowing. He thought it was simply a dreadful disgrace to borrow ANYTHING.

Cousin Ebenezer shut the door, looked all around him and then said imploringly, \u2018MORE PRIVATE STILL.\u2019 So grandfather took him into the spare room and shut that door. He was getting frightened. He thought something terrible must have happened Cousin Ebenezer. Cousin Ebenezer came right up to grandfather, took hold of the lapel of his coat, and said in a whisper, \u2018Uncle Abraham, CAN--YOU--LEND--ME--AN--AXE?\u2019\u201d \u201cHe needn\u2019t have made such a mystery about it,\u201d said Cecily, who had missed the point entirely, and couldn\u2019t see why the rest of us were laughing."}, {"size": 607, "text": "But Cecily was such a darling that we did not mind her lack of a sense of humour. \u201cIt\u2019s kind of mean to tell stories like that about people who are dead,\u201d said Felicity. \u201cSometimes it\u2019s safer than when they\u2019re alive though, sweetheart,\u201d commented Dan. We had our expected good dinner at Cousin Mattie\u2019s--may it be counted unto her for righteousness. She and her sisters-in-law, Miss Louisa Jane and Miss Caroline, were very kind to us.

WE VISIT PEG BOWENWe left Cousin Mattie\u2019s early, for it still looked like a storm, though no more so than it had in the morning. We intended to go home by a different path--one leading through cleared land overgrown with scrub maple, which had the advantage of being farther away from Peg Bowen\u2019s house. We hoped to be home before it began to storm, but we had hardly reached the hill above the village when a fine, driving snow began to fall.

We could hardly face the stinging snow, and we could not see ten feet ahead of us. It had turned bitterly cold and the tempest howled all around us in white desolation under the fast-darkening night.

In my heart I did not believe we would ever get through alive. It was almost pitch dark now, and the snow grew deeper every moment. We were chilled to the heart.

Cecily declared that she hated to go to sleep because she was sure to dream that she was at Aunt Olivia\u2019s wedding in her old faded gingham dress and a ragged apron. \u201cAnd no shoes or stockings,\u201d she added, \u201cand I can\u2019t move, and everyone walks past and looks at my feet.\u201d \u201cThat\u2019s only in a dream,\u201d mourned Sara Ray, \u201cbut I may have to wear my last summer\u2019s white dress to the wedding."}, {"size": 651, "text": "It\u2019s too short, but ma says it\u2019s plenty good for this summer.

I wouldn\u2019t miss it for the world.\u201d \u201cMy Aunt Jane always said that if you were neat and tidy it didn\u2019t matter whether you were dressed fine or not,\u201d said Peter. \u201cI\u2019m sick and tired of hearing about your Aunt Jane,\u201d said Felicity crossly. Peter looked grieved but held his peace. Felicity was very hard on him that spring, but his loyalty never wavered."}, {"size": 759, "text": "Everything she said or did was right in Peter\u2019s eyes. \u201cIt\u2019s all very well to be neat and tidy,\u201d said Sara Ray, \u201cbut I like a little style too.\u201d \u201cI think you\u2019ll find your mother will get you a new dress after all,\u201d comforted Cecily. \u201cAnyway, nobody will notice you because everyone will be looking at the bride. Aunt Olivia will make a lovely bride. Just think how sweet she\u2019ll look in a white silk dress and a floating veil.\u201d \u201cShe says she is going to have the ceremony performed out here in the orchard under her own tree,\u201d said the Story Girl. \u201cWon\u2019t that be romantic? It almost makes me feel like getting married myself.\u201d \u201cWhat a way to talk,\u201d rebuked Felicity, \u201cand you only fifteen.\u201d \u201cLots of people have been married at fifteen,\u201d laughed the Story Girl."}, {"size": 624, "text": "\u201cLady Jane Gray was.\u201d \u201cBut you are always saying that Valeria H. Montague\u2019s stories are silly and not true to life, so that is no argument,\u201d retorted Felicity, who knew more about cooking than about history, and evidently imagined that the Lady Jane Gray was one of Valeria\u2019s titled heroines. The wedding was a perennial source of conversation among us in those days; but presently its interest palled for a time in the light of another quite tremendous happening. One Saturday night Peter\u2019s mother called to take him home with her for Sunday. She had been working at Mr. James Frewen\u2019s, and Mr. Frewen was driving her home."}, {"size": 635, "text": "We had never seen Peter\u2019s mother before, and we looked at her with discreet curiosity. She was a plump, black-eyed little woman, neat as a pin, but with a rather tired and care-worn face that looked as if it should have been rosy and jolly. Life had been a hard battle for her, and I rather think that her curly-headed little lad was all that had kept heart and spirit in her. Peter went home with her and returned Sunday evening. We were in the orchard sitting around the Pulpit Stone, where we had, according to the custom of the households of King, been learning our golden texts and memory verses for the next Sunday School lesson."}, {"size": 356, "text": "Paddy, grown sleek and handsome again, was sitting on the stone itself, washing his jowls.

The announcement produced all the sensation he could have wished. We crowded around him in excitement. \u201cPeter! When did he come back?\u201d \u201cSaturday night. He was there when ma and I got home. It give her an awful turn. I didn\u2019t know him at first, of course.\u201d \u201cPeter Craig, I believe you are glad your father has come back,\u201d cried the Story Girl. \u201c\u2018Course I\u2019m glad,\u201d retorted Peter. \u201cAnd after you saying you didn\u2019t want ever to see him again,\u201d said Felicity.\u201cYou just wait.

Ma isn\u2019t to do any more washing for nobody but him and me, and I\u2019m not to be a hired boy any longer. He says I can stay with your Uncle Roger till the fall \u2018cause I promised I would, but after that I\u2019m to stay home and go to school right along and learn to be whatever I\u2019d like to be. I tell you it made me feel queer. Everything seemed to be upset.

Don\u2019t you tell me she isn\u2019t a witch after that.\u201d \u201cAnd she knew about your Aunt Olivia\u2019s wedding, too,\u201d added Sara Ray. \u201cOh, well, she likely heard that from some one. Grown up folks talk things over long before they tell them to children,\u201d said Cecily. \u201cWell, she couldn\u2019t have heard father was coming home from any one,\u201d answered Peter. \u201cHe was converted up in Maine, where nobody knew him, and he never told a soul he was coming till he got here."}, {"size": 411, "text": "No, you can believe what you like, but I\u2019m satisfied at last that Peg is a witch and that skull of hers does tell her things.

The earl had been imprisoned for years in a loathsome dungeon.\u201d Perhaps Peter\u2019s father had too, if we but realized it--imprisoned in the dungeon of his own evil appetites and habits, than which none could be more loathsome. But a Power, mightier than the forces of evil, had struck off his fetters and led him back to his long-forfeited liberty and light. And no countess or lady of high degree could have welcomed a long-lost earl home more joyfully than the tired little washerwoman had welcomed the erring husband of her youth. But in Peter\u2019s ointment of joy there was a fly or two."}, {"size": 637, "text": "So very, very few things are flawless in this world, even on the golden road. \u201cOf course I\u2019m awful glad that father has come back and that ma won\u2019t have to wash any more,\u201d he said with a sigh, \u201cbut there are two things that kind of worry me. My Aunt Jane always said that it didn\u2019t do any good to worry, and I s\u2019pose it don\u2019t, but it\u2019s kind of a relief.\u201d \u201cWhat\u2019s worrying you?\u201d asked Felix. \u201cWell, for one thing I\u2019ll feel awful bad to go away from you all. I\u2019ll miss you just dreadful, and I won\u2019t even be able to go to the same school. I\u2019ll have to go to Markdale school.\u201d \u201cBut you must come and see us often,\u201d said Felicity graciously."}, {"size": 636, "text": "\u201cMarkdale isn\u2019t so far away, and you could spend every other Saturday afternoon with us anyway.\u201d Peter\u2019s black eyes filled with adoring gratitude. \u201cThat\u2019s so kind of you, Felicity. I\u2019ll come as often as I can, of course; but it won\u2019t be the same as being around with you all the time. The other thing is even worse. You see, it was a Methodist revival father got converted in, and so of course he joined the Methodist church. He wasn\u2019t anything before. He used to say he was a Nothingarian and lived up to it--kind of bragging like. But he\u2019s a strong Methodist now, and is going to go to Markdale Methodist church and pay to the salary."}, {"size": 691, "text": "Now what\u2019ll he say when I tell him I\u2019m a Presbyterian?\u201d \u201cYou haven\u2019t told him, yet?\u201d asked the Story Girl. \u201cNo, I didn\u2019t dare. I was scared he\u2019d say I\u2019d have to be a Methodist.\u201d \u201cWell, Methodists are pretty near as good as Presbyterians,\u201d said Felicity, with the air of one making a great concession. \u201cI guess they\u2019re every bit as good,\u201d retorted Peter. \u201cBut that ain\u2019t the point. I\u2019ve got to be a Presbyterian, \u2018cause I stick to a thing when I once decide it. But I expect father will be mad when he finds out.\u201d \u201cIf he\u2019s converted he oughtn\u2019t to get mad,\u201d said Dan. \u201cWell, lots o\u2019 people do.

So I\u2019ll tell father right out, but I\u2019ll wait a few weeks so as not to spoil things for ma too soon if he acts up.\u201d Peter was not the only one who had secret cares.

But I\u2019m getting worse. Aunt Mary says I\u2019m going to be the very image of Aunt Matilda. And Aunt Matilda is as homely as she can be. It isn\u2019t\u201d--and poor Sara sighed--\u201ca very cheerful prospect. If I am ugly nobody will ever want to marry me, and,\u201d concluded Sara candidly, \u201cI don\u2019t want to be an old maid.\u201d \u201cBut plenty of girls get married who aren\u2019t a bit pretty,\u201d comforted Cecily."}, {"size": 657, "text": "\u201cBesides, you are real nice looking at times, Sara. I think you are going to have a nice figure.\u201d \u201cBut just look at my hands,\u201d moaned Sara. \u201cThey\u2019re simply covered with warts.\u201d \u201cOh, the warts will all disappear before you grow up,\u201d said Cecily. \u201cBut they won\u2019t disappear before the school concert. How am I to get up there and recite? You know there is one line in my recitation, \u2018She waved her lily-white hand,\u2019 and I have to wave mine when I say it. Fancy waving a lily-white hand all covered with warts. I\u2019ve tried every remedy I ever heard of, but nothing does any good.

But do you know, I believe if you didn\u2019t cry so much over every little thing, you\u2019d be ever so much better looking. Crying spoils your eyes and makes the end of your nose red.\u201d \u201cI can\u2019t help crying,\u201d protested Sara. \u201cMy feelings are so very sensitive. I\u2019ve given up trying to keep THAT resolution.\u201d \u201cWell, men don\u2019t like cry-babies,\u201d said Cecily sagely. Cecily had a good deal of Mother Eve\u2019s wisdom tucked away in that smooth, brown head of hers. \u201cCecily, do you ever intend to be married?\u201d asked Sara in a confidential tone."}, {"size": 627, "text": "\u201cGoodness!\u201d cried Cecily, quite shocked. \u201cIt will be time enough when I grow up to think of that, Sara.\u201d \u201cI should think you\u2019d have to think of it now, with Cyrus Brisk as crazy after you as he is.\u201d \u201cI wish Cyrus Brisk was at the bottom of the Red Sea,\u201d exclaimed Cecily, goaded into a spurt of temper by mention of the detested name. \u201cWhat has Cyrus been doing now?\u201d asked Felicity, coming around the corner of the hedge. \u201cDoing NOW! It\u2019s ALL the time. He just worries me to death,\u201d returned Cecily angrily. \u201cHe keeps writing me letters and putting them in my desk or in my reader. I never answer one of them, but he keeps on."}, {"size": 753, "text": "And in the last one, mind you, he said he\u2019d do something desperate right off if I wouldn\u2019t promise to marry him when we grew up.\u201d \u201cJust think, Cecily, you\u2019ve had a proposal already,\u201d said Sara Ray in an awe-struck tone. \u201cBut he hasn\u2019t done anything desperate yet, and that was last week,\u201d commented Felicity, with a toss of her head. \u201cHe sent me a lock of his hair and wanted one of mine in exchange,\u201d continued Cecily indignantly. \u201cI tell you I sent his back to him pretty quick.\u201d \u201cDid you never answer any of his letters?\u201d asked Sara Ray. \u201cNo, indeed! I guess not!\u201d \u201cDo you know,\u201d said Felicity, \u201cI believe if you wrote him just once and told him your exact opinion of him in good plain English it would cure him of his nonsense.\u201d \u201cI couldn\u2019t do that."}, {"size": 682, "text": "I haven\u2019t enough spunk,\u201d confessed Cecily with a blush. \u201cBut I\u2019ll tell you what I did do once.

He even spelled baking soda, \u2018bacon soda!\u2019\u201d \u201cWhat on earth had he to say about baking soda in a love-letter?\u201d asked Felicity. \u201cOh, he said his mother sent him to the store for some and he forgot it because he was thinking about me. Well, I just took his letter and wrote in all the words, spelled right, above the wrong ones, in red ink, just as Mr. Perkins makes us do with our dictation exercises, and sent it back to him.

Miss Marwood says it is wrong to hate anyone, but I don\u2019t care, I hate Cyrus Brisk.\u201d \u201cMrs. Cyrus Brisk WOULD be an awful name,\u201d giggled Felicity. \u201cFlossie Brisk says Cyrus is ruining all the trees on his father\u2019s place cutting your name on them,\u201d said Sara Ray. \u201cHis father told him he would whip him if he didn\u2019t stop, but Cyrus keeps right on."}, {"size": 716, "text": "He told Flossie it relieved his feelings.

And what I mind most of all is, he sits and looks at me in school with such melancholy, reproachful eyes when he ought to be working sums. I won\u2019t look at him, but I FEEL him staring at me, and it makes me so nervous.\u201d \u201cThey say his mother was out of her mind at one time,\u201d said Felicity.

His young affections were sadly misplaced. But after all, though Cecily never relented towards him, he did not condemn himself to darkness alone till life was flown. Quite early in life he wedded a stout, rosy, buxom lass, the very antithesis of his first love; he prospered in his undertakings, raised a large and respectable family, and was eventually appointed a Justice of the Peace. Which was all very sensible of Cyrus."}, {"size": 715, "text": "CHAPTER XV. THE RAPE OF THE LOCKJune was crowded full of interest that year. We gathered in with its sheaf of fragrant days the choicest harvest of childhood. Things happened right along. Cecily declared she hated to go to sleep for fear she might miss something. There were so many dear delights along the golden road to give us pleasure--the earth dappled with new blossom, the dance of shadows in the fields, the rustling, rain-wet ways of the woods, the faint fragrance in meadow lanes, liltings of birds and croon of bees in the old orchard, windy pipings on the hills, sunset behind the pines, limpid dews filling primrose cups, crescent moons through darklings boughs, soft nights alight with blinking stars."}, {"size": 637, "text": "We enjoyed all these boons, unthinkingly and light-heartedly, as children do. And besides these, there was the absorbing little drama of human life which was being enacted all around us, and in which each of us played a satisfying part--the gay preparations for Aunt Olivia\u2019s mid-June wedding, the excitement of practising for the concert with which our school-teacher, Mr. Perkins, had elected to close the school year, and Cecily\u2019s troubles with Cyrus Brisk, which furnished unholy mirth for the rest of us, though Cecily could not see the funny side of it at all. Matters went from bad to worse in the case of the irrepressible Cyrus."}, {"size": 869, "text": "He continued to shower Cecily with notes, the spelling of which showed no improvement; he worried the life out of her by constantly threatening to fight Willy Fraser--although, as Felicity sarcastically pointed out, he never did it. \u201cBut I\u2019m always afraid he will,\u201d said Cecily, \u201cand it would be such a DISGRACE to have two boys fighting over me in school.\u201d \u201cYou must have encouraged Cyrus a little in the beginning or he\u2019d never have been so persevering,\u201d said Felicity unjustly. \u201cI never did!\u201d cried outraged Cecily. \u201cYou know very well, Felicity King, that I hated Cyrus Brisk ever since the very first time I saw his big, fat, red face.

One sunny afternoon in school, Cecily and Kitty Marr asked and received permission to sit out on the side bench before the open window, where the cool breeze swept in from the green fields beyond. To sit on this bench was always considered a treat, and was only allowed as a reward of merit; but Cecily and Kitty had another reason for wishing to sit there. Kitty had read in a magazine that sun-baths were good for the hair; so both she and Cecily tossed their long braids over the window-sill and let them hang there in the broiling sun-shine."}, {"size": 614, "text": "And while Cecily sat thus, diligently working a fraction sum on her slate, that base Cyrus asked permission to go out, having previously borrowed a pair of scissors from one of the big girls who did fancy work at the noon recess.

This rape of the lock did not produce quite such terrible consequences as the more famous one in Pope\u2019s poem, but Cecily\u2019s soul was no less agitated than Belinda\u2019s.

And the folks at home might find out all about it, and Uncle Roger would never give me any peace, and mother would be cross, for she\u2019d never believe it wasn\u2019t my fault. It wouldn\u2019t be so bad if he\u2019d only taken a little, but he cut a great big chunk right off the end of one of the braids. Just look at it.

You may take your seat, Emmeline, and you will remain at the foot of your spelling class for a week as punishment for passing the note.

Finally her hair softened sufficiently to be disentangled from the curl papers; and then Aunt Janet subjected it to a merciless shampoo. Eventually they got all the mucilage washed out of it and Cecily spent the remainder of the forenoon sitting before the open oven door in the hot kitchen drying her ill-used tresses.

I heard a Carlisle woman behind me whisper that Cecily King looked consumptive, just like her Aunt Felicity; and I hated her fiercely for it.

She swept along through the poem royally, playing on the emotions of her audience as she had so often played on ours in the old orchard. Pity, terror, indignation, suspense, possessed her hearers in turn. In the court scene she surpassed herself. She was, in very truth, the Florentine judge, stern, stately, impassive.

She dealt the luckless Sara a glance that would have slain her on the spot could glances kill, stumbled lamely and impotently through the few remaining lines of her recitation, and fled with crimson cheeks to hide her mortification in the little corner that had been curtained off for a dressing-room.

THE YANKEE STORMIn an August orchard six children and a grown-up were sitting around the pulpit stone. The grown-up was Miss Reade, who had been up to give the girls their music lesson and had consented to stay to tea, much to the rapture of the said girls, who continued to worship her with unabated and romantic ardour. To us, over the golden grasses, came the Story Girl, carrying in her hand a single large poppy, like a blood-red chalice filled with the wine of August wizardry. She proffered it to Miss Reade and, as the latter took it into her singularly slender, beautiful hand, I saw a ring on her third finger."}, {"size": 643, "text": "I noticed it, because I had heard the girls say that Miss Reade never wore rings, not liking them.

She nodded, but seemed disinclined to say more about it. \u201cLook here, Sara,\u201d I said, \u201cthere\u2019s something about that ring--something you know.\u201d \u201cI told you once there was a story growing but you would have to wait until it was fully grown,\u201d she answered. \u201cIs Miss Reade going to marry anybody--anybody we know?\u201d I persisted."}, {"size": 674, "text": "\u201cCuriosity killed a cat,\u201d observed the Story Girl coolly. \u201cMiss Reade hasn\u2019t told me that she was going to marry anybody.

She had been away for a week, visiting cousins in Markdale, and she had come home with a new treasure-trove of stories, most of which she had heard from the old sailors of Markdale Harbour.

Old Mr. Coles at the Harbour told me all about it. He was a young man then and he says he can never forget that dreadful time. You know in those days hundreds of American fishing schooners used to come down to the Gulf every summer to fish mackerel. On one beautiful Saturday night in this October of 1851, more than one hundred of these vessels could be counted from Markdale Capes."}, {"size": 664, "text": "By Monday night more than seventy of them had been destroyed.

But he admits that even some of them got into harbour later on and escaped, so it\u2019s hard to know what to think. But it is certain that on Sunday night there came up a sudden and terrible storm--the worst, Mr. Coles says, that has ever been known on the north shore. It lasted for two days and scores of vessels were driven ashore and completely wrecked."}, {"size": 477, "text": "The crews of most of the vessels that went ashore on the sand beaches were saved, but those that struck on the rocks went to pieces and all hands were lost. For weeks after the storm the north shore was strewn with the bodies of drowned men. Think of it! Many of them were unknown and unrecognizable, and they were buried in Markdale graveyard.

But the saddest of all the stories of the Yankee Storm was the one about the Franklin Dexter. The Franklin Dexter went ashore on the Markdale Capes and all on board perished, the Captain and three of his brothers among them. These four young men were the sons of an old man who lived in Portland, Maine, and when he heard what had happened he came right down to the Island to see if he could find their bodies."}, {"size": 724, "text": "They had all come ashore and had been buried in Markdale graveyard; but he was determined to take them up and carry them home for burial. He said he had promised their mother to take her boys home to her and he must do it. So they were taken up and put on board a sailing vessel at Markdale Harbour to be taken back to Maine, while the father himself went home on a passenger steamer. The name of the sailing vessel was the Seth Hall, and the captain\u2019s name was Seth Hall, too. Captain Hall was a dreadfully profane man and used to swear blood-curdling oaths. On the night he sailed out of Markdale Harbour the old sailors warned him that a storm was brewing and that it would catch him if he did not wait until it was over."}, {"size": 661, "text": "The captain had become very impatient because of several delays he had already met with, and he was in a furious temper.

So the poor old mother up in Maine never had her boys brought back to her after all.

Carlisle, in all its ripely tinted length and breadth, lay below us, basking in the August sunshine, that spilled over the brim of the valley to the far-off Markdale Harbour, cupped in its harvest-golden hills.

Beyond this the path wound through a forest of fir, where a wood wind wove its murmurous spell and a wood brook dimpled pellucidly among the shadows--the dear, companionable, elfin shadows--that lurked under the low growing boughs.

THE LOVE STORY OF THE AWKWARD MAN (Written by the Story Girl) Jasper Dale lived alone in the old homestead which he had named Golden Milestone. In Carlisle this giving one\u2019s farm a name was looked upon as a piece of affectation; but if a place must be named why not give it a sensible name with some meaning to it? Why Golden Milestone, when Pinewood or Hillslope or, if you wanted to be very fanciful, Ivy Lodge, might be had for the taking?He had lived alone at Golden Milestone since his mother\u2019s death; he had been twenty then and he was close upon forty now, though he did not look it."}, {"size": 801, "text": "But neither could it be said that he looked young; he had never at any time looked young with common youth; there had always been something in his appearance that stamped him as different from the ordinary run of men, and, apart from his shyness, built up an intangible, invisible barrier between him and his kind. He had lived all his life in Carlisle; and all the Carlisle people knew of or about him--although they thought they knew everything--was that he was painfully, abnormally shy. He never went anywhere except to church; he never took part in Carlisle\u2019s simple social life; even with most men he was distant and reserved; as for women, he never spoke to or looked at them; if one spoke to him, even if she were a matronly old mother in Israel, he was at once in an agony of painful blushes."}, {"size": 844, "text": "He had no friends in the sense of companions; to all outward appearance his life was solitary and devoid of any human interest. He had no housekeeper; but his old house, furnished as it had been in his mother\u2019s lifetime, was cleanly and daintily kept. The quaint rooms were as free from dust and disorder as a woman could have had them. This was known, because Jasper Dale occasionally had his hired man\u2019s wife, Mrs. Griggs, in to scrub for him. On the morning she was expected he betook himself to woods and fields, returning only at night-fall. During his absence Mrs. Griggs was frankly wont to explore the house from cellar to attic, and her report of its condition was always the same--\u201cneat as wax.\u201d To be sure, there was one room that was always locked against her, the west gable, looking out on the garden and the hill of pines beyond."}, {"size": 655, "text": "But Mrs. Griggs knew that in the lifetime of Jasper Dale\u2019s mother it had been unfurnished. She supposed it still remained so, and felt no especial curiosity concerning it, though she always tried the door. Jasper Dale had a good farm, well cultivated; he had a large garden where he worked most of his spare time in summer; it was supposed that he read a great deal, since the postmistress declared that he was always getting books and magazines by mail. He seemed well contented with his existence and people let him alone, since that was the greatest kindness they could do him. It was unsupposable that he would ever marry; nobody ever had supposed it."}, {"size": 650, "text": "\u201cJasper Dale never so much as THOUGHT about a woman,\u201d Carlisle oracles declared. Oracles, however, are not always to be trusted. One day Mrs. Griggs went away from the Dale place with a very curious story, which she diligently spread far and wide. It made a good deal of talk, but people, although they listened eagerly, and wondered and questioned, were rather incredulous about it. They thought Mrs. Griggs must be drawing considerably upon her imagination; there were not lacking those who declared that she had invented the whole account, since her reputation for strict veracity was not wholly unquestioned. Mrs. Griggs\u2019s story was as follows:--"}, {"size": 634, "text": "One day she found the door of the west gable unlocked. She went in, expecting to see bare walls and a collection of odds and ends. Instead she found herself in a finely furnished room. Delicate lace curtains hung before the small, square, broad-silled windows. The walls were adorned with pictures in much finer taste than Mrs. Griggs could appreciate. There was a bookcase between the windows filled with choicely bound books. Beside it stood a little table with a very dainty work-basket on it. By the basket Mrs. Griggs saw a pair of tiny scissors and a silver thimble. A wicker rocker, comfortable with silk cushions, was near it."}, {"size": 603, "text": "Above the bookcase a woman\u2019s picture hung--a water-colour, if Mrs. Griggs had but known it--representing a pale, very sweet face, with large, dark eyes and a wistful expression under loose masses of black, lustrous hair.

But what puzzled Mrs. Griggs completely was the fact that a woman\u2019s dress was hanging over a chair before the mirror--a pale blue, silken affair. And on the floor beside it were two little blue satin slippers!"}, {"size": 659, "text": "Good Mrs. Griggs did not leave the room until she had thoroughly explored it, even to shaking out the blue dress and discovering it to be a tea-gown--wrapper, she called it. But she found nothing to throw any light on the mystery. The fact that the simple name \u201cAlice\u201d was written on the fly-leaves of all the books only deepened it, for it was a name unknown in the Dale family. In this puzzled state she was obliged to depart, nor did she ever find the door unlocked again; and, discovering that people thought she was romancing when she talked about the mysterious west gable at Golden Milestone, she indignantly held her peace concerning the whole affair."}, {"size": 700, "text": "But Mrs. Griggs had told no more than the simple truth. Jasper Dale, under all his shyness and aloofness, possessed a nature full of delicate romance and poesy, which, denied expression in the common ways of life, bloomed out in the realm of fancy and imagination. Left alone, just when the boy\u2019s nature was deepening into the man\u2019s, he turned to this ideal kingdom for all he believed the real world could never give him. Love--a strange, almost mystical love--played its part here for him. He shadowed forth to himself the vision of a woman, loving and beloved; he cherished it until it became almost as real to him as his own personality and he gave this dream woman the name he liked best--Alice."}, {"size": 602, "text": "In fancy he walked and talked with her, spoke words of love to her, and heard words of love in return. When he came from work at the close of day she met him at his threshold in the twilight--a strange, fair, starry shape, as elusive and spiritual as a blossom reflected in a pool by moonlight--with welcome on her lips and in her eyes. One day, when he was in Charlottetown on business, he had been struck by a picture in the window of a store. It was strangely like the woman of his dream love. He went in, awkward and embarrassed, and bought it. When he took it home he did not know where to put it."}, {"size": 602, "text": "It was out of place among the dim old engravings of bewigged portraits and conventional landscapes on the walls of Golden Milestone. As he pondered the matter in his garden that evening he had an inspiration. The sunset, flaming on the windows of the west gable, kindled them into burning rose. Amid the splendour he fancied Alice\u2019s fair face peeping archly down at him from the room. The inspiration came then. It should be her room; he would fit it up for her; and her picture should hang there. He was all summer carrying out his plan. Nobody must know or suspect, so he must go slowly and secretly."}, {"size": 648, "text": "One by one the furnishings were purchased and brought home under cover of darkness. He arranged them with his own hands. He bought the books he thought she would like best and wrote her name in them; he got the little feminine knick-knacks of basket and thimble. Finally he saw in a store a pale blue tea-gown and the satin slippers. He had always fancied her as dressed in blue. He bought them and took them home to her room. Thereafter it was sacred to her; he always knocked on its door before he entered; he kept it sweet with fresh flowers; he sat there in the purple summer evenings and talked aloud to her or read his favourite books to her."}, {"size": 618, "text": "In his fancy she sat opposite to him in her rocker, clad in the trailing blue gown, with her head leaning on one slender hand, as white as a twilight star. But Carlisle people knew nothing of this--would have thought him tinged with mild lunacy if they had known. To them, he was just the shy, simple farmer he appeared. They never knew or guessed at the real Jasper Dale. One spring Alice Reade came to teach music in Carlisle. Her pupils worshipped her, but the grown people thought she was rather too distant and reserved. They had been used to merry, jolly girls who joined eagerly in the social life of the place."}, {"size": 747, "text": "Alice Reade held herself aloof from it--not disdainfully, but as one to whom these things were of small importance. She was very fond of books and solitary rambles; she was not at all shy but she was as sensitive as a flower; and after a time Carlisle people were content to let her live her own life and no longer resented her unlikeness to themselves. She boarded with the Armstrongs, who lived beyond Golden Milestone around the hill of pines. Until the snow disappeared she went out to the main road by the long Armstrong lane; but when spring came she was wont to take a shorter way, down the pine hill, across the brook, past Jasper Dale\u2019s garden, and out through his lane. And one day, as she went by, Jasper Dale was working in his garden."}, {"size": 738, "text": "He was on his knees in a corner, setting out a bunch of roots--an unsightly little tangle of rainbow possibilities. It was a still spring morning; the world was green with young leaves; a little wind blew down from the pines and lost itself willingly among the budding delights of the garden. The grass opened eyes of blue violets. The sky was high and cloudless, turquoise-blue, shading off into milkiness on the far horizons. Birds were singing along the brook valley. Rollicking robins were whistling joyously in the pines. Jasper Dale\u2019s heart was filled to over-flowing with a realization of all the virgin loveliness around him; the feeling in his soul had the sacredness of a prayer. At this moment he looked up and saw Alice Reade."}, {"size": 681, "text": "She was standing outside the garden fence, in the shadow of a great pine tree, looking not at him, for she was unaware of his presence, but at the virginal bloom of the plum trees in a far corner, with all her delight in it outblossoming freely in her face. For a moment Jasper Dale believed that his dream love had taken visible form before him. She was like--so like; not in feature, perhaps, but in grace and colouring--the grace of a slender, lissome form and the colouring of cloudy hair and wistful, dark gray eyes, and curving red mouth; and more than all, she was like her in expression--in the subtle revelation of personality exhaling from her like perfume from a flower."}, {"size": 623, "text": "It was as if his own had come to him at last and his whole soul suddenly leaped out to meet and welcome her. Then her eyes fell upon him and the spell was broken. Jasper remained kneeling mutely there, shy man once more, crimson with blushes, a strange, almost pitiful creature in his abject confusion. A little smile flickered about the delicate corners of her mouth, but she turned and walked swiftly away down the lane. Jasper looked after her with a new, painful sense of loss and loveliness. It had been agony to feel her conscious eyes upon him, but he realized now that there had been a strange sweetness in it, too."}, {"size": 636, "text": "It was still greater pain to watch her going from him. He thought she must be the new music teacher but he did not even know her name. She had been dressed in blue, too--a pale, dainty blue; but that was of course; he had known she must wear it; and he was sure her name must be Alice. When, later on, he discovered that it was, he felt no surprise. He carried some mayflowers up to the west gable and put them under the picture. But the charm had gone out of the tribute; and looking at the picture, he thought how scant was the justice it did her. Her face was so much sweeter, her eyes so much softer, her hair so much more lustrous."}, {"size": 602, "text": "The soul of his love had gone from the room and from the picture and from his dreams. When he tried to think of the Alice he loved he saw, not the shadowy spirit occupant of the west gable, but the young girl who had stood under the pine, beautiful with the beauty of moonlight, of starshine on still water, of white, wind-swayed flowers growing in silent, shadowy places. He did not then realize what this meant: had he realized it he would have suffered bitterly; as it was he felt only a vague discomfort--a curious sense of loss and gain commingled. He saw her again that afternoon on her way home."}, {"size": 727, "text": "She did not pause by the garden but walked swiftly past. Thereafter, every day for a week he watched unseen to see her pass his home. Once a little child was with her, clinging to her hand. No child had ever before had any part in the shy man\u2019s dream life. But that night in the twilight the vision of the rocking-chair was a girl in a blue print dress, with a little, golden-haired shape at her knee--a shape that lisped and prattled and called her \u201cmother;\u201d and both of them were his. It was the next day that he failed for the first time to put flowers in the west gable.

When Alice Reade saw the flowers she knew at once who had put them there, and divined that they were for her. She lifted them tenderly in much surprise and pleasure.

When she heard the story of the west gable, which most people disbelieved, she believed it, although she did not understand it. It invested the shy man with interest and romance. She felt that she would have liked, out of no impertinent curiosity, to solve the mystery; she believed that it contained the key to his character. Thereafter, every day she found flowers under the pine tree; she wished to see Jasper to thank him, unaware that he watched her daily from the screen of shrubbery in his garden; but it was some time before she found the opportunity."}, {"size": 749, "text": "One evening she passed when he, not expecting her, was leaning against his garden fence with a book in his hand.

His anguish of embarrassment made her smile a little. He could not speak, so she went on gently. \u201cIt has been so good of you. They have given me so much pleasure--I wish you could know how much.\u201d \u201cIt was nothing--nothing,\u201d stammered Jasper.

She liked him very much; she thought his nature beautiful in its simplicity and purity; in spite of his shyness she felt more delightfully at home in his society than in that of any other person she had ever met.

Alice Reade, coming through the trees, with the wind blowing her little dark love-locks tricksily about under her wide blue hat, found a fragrant heap of mignonette under the pine.

A light wind of dawn was weaving an orient spell. \u201cIt\u2019s lovely to be up as early as this, isn\u2019t it?\u201d said the Story Girl. \u201cThe world seems so different just at sunrise, doesn\u2019t it?

Beautiful Alice deserves everything good. Why, Bev--why, Bev! Who is that in the hammock?\u201d I looked. The hammock was swung under the two end trees of the Walk. In it a man was lying, asleep, his head pillowed on his overcoat. He was sleeping easily, lightly, and wholesomely. He had a pointed brown beard and thick wavy brown hair.
