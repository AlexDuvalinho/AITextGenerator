The situation involved is gathered up betimes, that is in the second chapter of Book Fifth, for the reader\u2019s benefit, into as few words as possible\u2014planted or \u201csunk,\u201d stiffly and saliently, in the centre of the current, almost perhaps to the obstruction of traffic."}, {"size": 676, "text": "Never can a composition of this sort have sprung straighter from a dropped grain of suggestion, and never can that grain, developed, overgrown and smothered, have yet lurked more in the mass as an independent particle. The whole case, in fine, is in Lambert Strether\u2019s irrepressible outbreak to little Bilham on the Sunday afternoon in Gloriani\u2019s garden, the candour with which he yields, for his young friend\u2019s enlightenment, to the charming admonition of that crisis. The idea of the tale resides indeed in the very fact that an hour of such unprecedented ease should have been felt by him _as_ a crisis, and he is at pains to express it for us as neatly as we could desire."}, {"size": 621, "text": "The remarks to which he thus gives utterance contain the essence of \u201cThe Ambassadors,\u201d his fingers close, before he has done, round the stem of the full-blown flower; which, after that fashion, he continues officiously to present to us. \u201cLive all you can; it\u2019s a mistake not to. It doesn\u2019t so much matter what you do in particular so long as you have your life. If you haven\u2019t had that what _have_ you had? I\u2019m too old\u2014too old at any rate for what I see. What one loses one loses; make no mistake about that. Still, we have the illusion of freedom; therefore don\u2019t, like me to-day, be without the memory of that illusion."}, {"size": 672, "text": "I was either, at the right time, too stupid or too intelligent to have it, and now I\u2019m a case of reaction against the mistake. Do what you like so long as you don\u2019t make it. For it _was_ a mistake. Live, live!\u201d Such is the gist of Strether\u2019s appeal to the impressed youth, whom he likes and whom he desires to befriend; the word \u201cmistake\u201d occurs several times, it will be seen, in the course of his remarks\u2014which gives the measure of the signal warning he feels attached to his case. He has accordingly missed too much, though perhaps after all constitutionally qualified for a better part, and he wakes up to it in conditions that press the spring of a terrible question."}, {"size": 653, "text": "_Would_ there yet perhaps be time for reparation?\u2014reparation, that is, for the injury done his character; for the affront, he is quite ready to say, so stupidly put upon it and in which he has even himself had so clumsy a hand? The answer to which is that he now at all events _sees_; so that the business of my tale and the march of my action, not to say the precious moral of everything, is just my demonstration of this process of vision. Nothing can exceed the closeness with which the whole fits again into its germ. That had been given me bodily, as usual, by the spoken word, for I was to take the image over exactly as I happened to have met it."}, {"size": 766, "text": "A friend had repeated to me, with great appreciation, a thing or two said to him by a man of distinction, much his senior, and to which a sense akin to that of Strether\u2019s melancholy eloquence might be imputed\u2014said as chance would have, and so easily might, in Paris, and in a charming old garden attached to a house of art, and on a Sunday afternoon of summer, many persons of great interest being present. The observation there listened to and gathered up had contained part of the \u201cnote\u201d that I was to recognise on the spot as to my purpose\u2014had contained in fact the greater part; the rest was in the place and the time and the scene they sketched: these constituents clustered and combined to give me further support, to give me what I may call the note absolute."}, {"size": 706, "text": "There it stands, accordingly, full in the tideway; driven in, with hard taps, like some strong stake for the noose of a cable, the swirl of the current roundabout it. What amplified the hint to more than the bulk of hints in general was the gift with it of the old Paris garden, for in that token were sealed up values infinitely precious. There was of course the seal to break and each item of the packet to count over and handle and estimate; but somehow, in the light of the hint, all the elements of a situation of the sort most to my taste were there. I could even remember no occasion on which, so confronted, I had found it of a livelier interest to take stock, in this fashion, of suggested wealth."}, {"size": 876, "text": "For I think, verily, that there are degrees of merit in subjects\u2014in spite of the fact that to treat even one of the most ambiguous with due decency we must for the time, for the feverish and prejudiced hour, at least figure its merit and its dignity as _possibly_ absolute. What it comes to, doubtless, is that even among the supremely good\u2014since with such alone is it one\u2019s theory of one\u2019s honour to be concerned\u2014there is an ideal _beauty_ of goodness the invoked action of which is to raise the artistic faith to its maximum. Then truly, I hold, one\u2019s theme may be said to shine, and that of \u201cThe Ambassadors,\u201d I confess, wore this glow for me from beginning to end. Fortunately thus I am able to estimate this as, frankly, quite the best, \u201call round,\u201d of all my productions; any failure of that justification would have made such an extreme of complacency publicly fatuous."}, {"size": 652, "text": "I recall then in this connexion no moment of subjective intermittence, never one of those alarms as for a suspected hollow beneath one\u2019s feet, a felt ingratitude in the scheme adopted, under which confidence fails and opportunity seems but to mock. If the motive of \u201cThe Wings of the Dove,\u201d as I have noted, was to worry me at moments by a sealing-up of its face\u2014though without prejudice to its again, of a sudden, fairly grimacing with expression\u2014so in this other business I had absolute conviction and constant clearness to deal with; it had been a frank proposition, the whole bunch of data, installed on my premises like a monotony of fine weather."}, {"size": 805, "text": "(The order of composition, in these things, I may mention, was reversed by the order of publication; the earlier written of the two books having appeared as the later.) Even under the weight of my hero\u2019s years I could feel my postulate firm; even under the strain of the difference between those of Madame de Vionnet and those of Chad Newsome, a difference liable to be denounced as shocking, I could still feel it serene. Nothing resisted, nothing betrayed, I seem to make out, in this full and sound sense of the matter; it shed from any side I could turn it to the same golden glow. I rejoiced in the promise of a hero so mature, who would give me thereby the more to bite into\u2014since it\u2019s only into thickened motive and accumulated character, I think, that the painter of life bites more than a little."}, {"size": 600, "text": "My poor friend should have accumulated character, certainly; or rather would be quite naturally and handsomely possessed of it, in the sense that he would have, and would always have felt he had, imagination galore, and that this yet wouldn\u2019t have wrecked him. It was immeasurable, the opportunity to \u201cdo\u201d a man of imagination, for if _there_ mightn\u2019t be a chance to \u201cbite,\u201d where in the world might it be? This personage of course, so enriched, wouldn\u2019t give me, for his type, imagination in _predominance_ or as his prime faculty, nor should I, in view of other matters, have found that convenient."}, {"size": 856, "text": "So particular a luxury\u2014some occasion, that is, for study of the high gift in _supreme_ command of a case or of a career\u2014would still doubtless come on the day I should be ready to pay for it; and till then might, as from far back, remain hung up well in view and just out of reach. The comparative case meanwhile would serve\u2014it was only on the minor scale that I had treated myself even to comparative cases. I was to hasten to add however that, happy stopgaps as the minor scale had thus yielded, the instance in hand should enjoy the advantage of the full range of the major; since most immediately to the point was the question of that _supplement_ of situation logically involved in our gentleman\u2019s impulse to deliver himself in the Paris garden on the Sunday afternoon\u2014or if not involved by strict logic then all ideally and enchantingly implied in it."}, {"size": 751, "text": "(I say \u201cideally,\u201d because I need scarce mention that for development, for expression of its maximum, my glimmering story was, at the earliest stage, to have nipped the thread of connexion with the possibilities of the actual reported speaker. _He_ remains but the happiest of accidents; his actualities, all too definite, precluded any range of possibilities; it had only been his charming office to project upon that wide field of the artist\u2019s vision\u2014which hangs there ever in place like the white sheet suspended for the figures of a child\u2019s magic-lantern\u2014a more fantastic and more moveable shadow.) No privilege of the teller of tales and the handler of puppets is more delightful, or has more of the suspense and the thrill of a game of difficulty"}, {"size": 663, "text": "breathlessly played, than just this business of looking for the unseen and the occult, in a scheme half-grasped, by the light or, so to speak, by the clinging scent, of the gage already in hand. No dreadful old pursuit of the hidden slave with bloodhounds and the rag of association can ever, for \u201cexcitement,\u201d I judge, have bettered it at its best. For the dramatist always, by the very law of his genius, believes not only in a possible right issue from the rightly-conceived tight place; he does much more than this\u2014he believes, irresistibly, in the necessary, the precious \u201ctightness\u201d of the place (whatever the issue) on the strength of any respectable hint."}, {"size": 658, "text": "It being thus the respectable hint that I had with such avidity picked up, what would be the story to which it would most inevitably form the centre? It is part of the charm attendant on such questions that the \u201cstory,\u201d with the omens true, as I say, puts on from this stage the authenticity of concrete existence. It then is, essentially\u2014it begins to be, though it may more or less obscurely lurk, so that the point is not in the least what to make of it, but only, very delightfully and very damnably, where to put one\u2019s hand on it. In which truth resides surely much of the interest of that admirable mixture for salutary application which we know as art."}, {"size": 646, "text": "Art deals with what we see, it must first contribute full-handed that ingredient; it plucks its material, otherwise expressed, in the garden of life\u2014which material elsewhere grown is stale and uneatable. But it has no sooner done this than it has to take account of a _process_\u2014from which only when it\u2019s the basest of the servants of man, incurring ignominious dismissal with no \u201ccharacter,\u201d does it, and whether under some muddled pretext of morality or on any other, pusillanimously edge away. The process, that of the expression, the literal squeezing-out, of value is another affair\u2014with which the happy luck of mere finding has little to do."}, {"size": 671, "text": "The joys of finding, at this stage, are pretty well over; that quest of the subject as a whole by \u201cmatching,\u201d as the ladies say at the shops, the big piece with the snippet, having ended, we assume, with a capture. The subject is found, and if the problem is then transferred to the ground of what to do with it the field opens out for any amount of doing. This is precisely the infusion that, as I submit, completes the strong mixture. It is on the other hand the part of the business that can least be likened to the chase with horn and hound. It\u2019s all a sedentary part\u2014involves as much ciphering, of sorts, as would merit the highest salary paid to a chief accountant."}, {"size": 683, "text": "Not, however, that the chief accountant hasn\u2019t _his_ gleams of bliss; for the felicity, or at least the equilibrium of the artist\u2019s state dwells less, surely, in the further delightful complications he can smuggle in than in those he succeeds in keeping out. He sows his seed at the risk of too thick a crop; wherefore yet again, like the gentlemen who audit ledgers, he must keep his head at any price. In consequence of all which, for the interest of the matter, I might seem here to have my choice of narrating my \u201chunt\u201d for Lambert Strether, of describing the capture of the shadow projected by my friend\u2019s anecdote, or of reporting on the occurrences subsequent to that triumph."}, {"size": 604, "text": "But I had probably best attempt a little to glance in each direction; since it comes to me again and again, over this licentious record, that one\u2019s bag of adventures, conceived or conceivable, has been only half-emptied by the mere telling of one\u2019s story. It depends so on what one means by that equivocal quantity. There is the story of one\u2019s hero, and then, thanks to the intimate connexion of things, the story of one\u2019s story itself. I blush to confess it, but if one\u2019s a dramatist one\u2019s a dramatist, and the latter imbroglio is liable on occasion to strike me as really the more objective of the two."}, {"size": 800, "text": "The philosophy imputed to him in that beautiful outbreak, the hour there, amid such happy provision, striking for him, would have been then, on behalf of my man of imagination, to be logically and, as the artless craft of comedy has it, \u201cled up\u201d to; the probable course to such a goal, the goal of so conscious a predicament, would have in short to be finely calculated. Where has he come from and why has he come, what is he doing (as we Anglo-Saxons, and we only, say, in our foredoomed clutch of exotic aids to expression) in that _gal\u00e8re?_ To answer these questions plausibly, to answer them as under cross-examination in the witness-box by counsel for the prosecution, in other words satisfactorily to account for Strether and for his \u201cpeculiar tone,\u201d was to possess myself of the entire fabric."}, {"size": 683, "text": "At the same time the clue to its whereabouts would lie in a certain principle of probability: he wouldn\u2019t have indulged in his peculiar tone without a reason; it would take a felt predicament or a false position to give him so ironic an accent. One hadn\u2019t been noting \u201ctones\u201d all one\u2019s life without recognising when one heard it the voice of the false position. The dear man in the Paris garden was then admirably and unmistakeably _in_ one\u2014which was no small point gained; what next accordingly concerned us was the determination of _this_ identity. One could only go by probabilities, but there was the advantage that the most general of the probabilities were virtual certainties."}, {"size": 738, "text": "Possessed of our friend\u2019s nationality, to start with, there was a general probability in his narrower localism; which, for that matter, one had really but to keep under the lens for an hour to see it give up its secrets. He would have issued, our rueful worthy, from the very heart of New England\u2014at the heels of which matter of course a perfect train of secrets tumbled for me into the light. They had to be sifted and sorted, and I shall not reproduce the detail of that process; but unmistakeably they were all there, and it was but a question, auspiciously, of picking among them. What the \u201cposition\u201d would infallibly be, and why, on his hands, it had turned \u201cfalse\u201d\u2014these inductive steps could only be as rapid as they were distinct."}, {"size": 617, "text": "I accounted for everything\u2014and \u201ceverything\u201d had by this time become the most promising quantity\u2014by the view that he had come to Paris in some state of mind which was literally undergoing, as a result of new and unexpected assaults and infusions, a change almost from hour to hour. He had come with a view that might have been figured by a clear green liquid, say, in a neat glass phial; and the liquid, once poured into the open cup of _application_, once exposed to the action of another air, had begun to turn from green to red, or whatever, and might, for all he knew, be on its way to purple, to black, to yellow."}, {"size": 829, "text": "At the still wilder extremes represented perhaps, for all he could say to the contrary, by a variability so violent, he would at first, naturally, but have gazed in surprise and alarm; whereby the _situation_ clearly would spring from the play of wildness and the development of extremes. I saw in a moment that, should this development proceed both with force and logic, my \u201cstory\u201d would leave nothing to be desired. There is always, of course, for the story-teller, the irresistible determinant and the incalculable advantage of his interest in the story _as such_; it is ever, obviously, overwhelmingly, the prime and precious thing (as other than this I have never been able to see it); as to which what makes for it, with whatever headlong energy, may be said to pale before the energy with which it simply makes for itself."}, {"size": 691, "text": "It rejoices, none the less, at its best, to seem to offer itself in a light, to seem to know, and with the very last knowledge, what it\u2019s about\u2014liable as it yet is at moments to be caught by us with its tongue in its cheek and absolutely no warrant but its splendid impudence. Let us grant then that the impudence is always there\u2014there, so to speak, for grace and effect and _allure_; there, above all, because the Story is just the spoiled child of art, and because, as we are always disappointed when the pampered don\u2019t \u201cplay up,\u201d we like it, to that extent, to look all its character. It probably does so, in truth, even when we most flatter ourselves that we negotiate with it by treaty."}, {"size": 629, "text": "All of which, again, is but to say that the _steps_, for my fable, placed themselves with a prompt and, as it were, functional assurance\u2014an air quite as of readiness to have dispensed with logic had I been in fact too stupid for my clue. Never, positively, none the less, as the links multiplied, had I felt less stupid than for the determination of poor Strether\u2019s errand and for the apprehension of his issue. These things continued to fall together, as by the neat action of their own weight and form, even while their commentator scratched his head about them; he easily sees now that they were always well in advance of him."}, {"size": 804, "text": "As the case completed itself he had in fact, from a good way behind, to catch up with them, breathless and a little flurried, as he best could. _The_ false position, for our belated man of the world\u2014belated because he had endeavoured so long to escape being one, and now at last had really to face his doom\u2014the false position for him, I say, was obviously to have presented himself at the gate of that boundless menagerie primed with a moral scheme of the most approved pattern which was yet framed to break down on any approach to vivid facts; that is to any at all liberal appreciation of them. There would have been of course the case of the Strether prepared, wherever presenting himself, only to judge and to feel meanly; but _he_ would have moved for me, I confess, enveloped in no legend whatever."}, {"size": 753, "text": "The actual man\u2019s note, from the first of our seeing it struck, is the note of discrimination, just as his drama is to become, under stress, the drama of discrimination. It would have been his blest imagination, we have seen, that had already helped him to discriminate; the element that was for so much of the pleasure of my cutting thick, as I have intimated, into his intellectual, into his moral substance. Yet here it was, at the same time, just here, that a shade for a moment fell across the scene. There was the dreadful little old tradition, one of the platitudes of the human comedy, that people\u2019s moral scheme _does_ break down in Paris; that nothing is more frequently observed; that hundreds of thousands of more or less hypocritical or more"}, {"size": 887, "text": "or less cynical persons annually visit the place for the sake of the probable catastrophe, and that I came late in the day to work myself up about it. There was in fine the _trivial_ association, one of the vulgarest in the world; but which give me pause no longer, I think, simply because its vulgarity is so advertised. The revolution performed by Strether under the influence of the most interesting of great cities was to have nothing to do with any _b\u00eatise_ of the imputably \u201ctempted\u201d state; he was to be thrown forward, rather, thrown quite with violence, upon his lifelong trick of intense reflexion: which friendly test indeed was to bring him out, through winding passages, through alternations of darkness and light, very much _in_ Paris, but with the surrounding scene itself a minor matter, a mere symbol for more things than had been dreamt of in the philosophy of Woollett."}, {"size": 851, "text": "Another surrounding scene would have done as well for our show could it have represented a place in which Strether\u2019s errand was likely to lie and his crisis to await him. The _likely_ place had the great merit of sparing me preparations; there would have been too many involved\u2014not at all impossibilities, only rather worrying and delaying difficulties\u2014in positing elsewhere Chad Newsome\u2019s interesting relation, his so interesting complexity of relations. Strether\u2019s appointed stage, in fine, could be but Chad\u2019s most luckily selected one. The young man had gone in, as they say, for circumjacent charm; and where he would have found it, by the turn of his mind, most \u201cauthentic,\u201d was where his earnest friend\u2019s analysis would most find _him_; as well as where, for that matter, the former\u2019s whole analytic faculty would be led such a wonderful dance."}, {"size": 721, "text": "\u201cThe Ambassadors\u201d had been, all conveniently, \u201carranged for\u201d; its first appearance was from month to month, in the _North American Review_ during 1903, and I had been open from far back to any pleasant provocation for ingenuity that might reside in one\u2019s actively adopting\u2014so as to make it, in its way, a small compositional law\u2014recurrent breaks and resumptions. I had made up my mind here regularly to exploit and enjoy these often rather rude jolts\u2014having found, as I believed an admirable way to it; yet every question of form and pressure, I easily remember, paled in the light of the major propriety, recognised as soon as really weighed; that of employing but one centre and keeping it all within my hero\u2019s compass."}, {"size": 648, "text": "The thing was to be so much this worthy\u2019s intimate adventure that even the projection of his consciousness upon it from beginning to end without intermission or deviation would probably still leave a part of its value for him, and _a fortiori_ for ourselves, unexpressed. I might, however, express every grain of it that there would be room for\u2014on condition of contriving a splendid particular economy. Other persons in no small number were to people the scene, and each with his or her axe to grind, his or her situation to treat, his or her coherency not to fail of, his or her relation to my leading motive, in a word, to establish and carry on."}, {"size": 774, "text": "But Strether\u2019s sense of these things, and Strether\u2019s only, should avail me for showing them; I should know them but through his more or less groping knowledge of them, since his very gropings would figure among his most interesting motions, and a full observance of the rich rigour I speak of would give me more of the effect I should be most \u201cafter\u201d than all other possible observances together. It would give me a large unity, and that in turn would crown me with the grace to which the enlightened story-teller will at any time, for his interest, sacrifice if need be all other graces whatever. I refer of course to the grace of intensity, which there are ways of signally achieving and ways of signally missing\u2014as we see it, all round us, helplessly and woefully missed."}, {"size": 875, "text": "Not that it isn\u2019t, on the other hand, a virtue eminently subject to appreciation\u2014there being no strict, no absolute measure of it; so that one may hear it acclaimed where it has quite escaped one\u2019s perception, and see it unnoticed where one has gratefully hailed it. After all of which I am not sure, either, that the immense amusement of the whole cluster of difficulties so arrayed may not operate, for the fond fabulist, when judicious not less than fond, as his best of determinants. That charming principle is always there, at all events, to keep interest fresh: it is a principle, we remember, essentially ravenous, without scruple and without mercy, appeased with no cheap nor easy nourishment.

This is the charm, as I say, of adventure _transposed_\u2014the thrilling ups and downs, the intricate ins and outs of the compositional problem, made after such a fashion admirably objective, becoming the question at issue and keeping the author\u2019s heart in his mouth.

Strether had left him there yesterday; he wanted to see the papers, and he had spent, by what his friend could make out, a succession of hours with the papers."}, {"size": 739, "text": "He spoke of the establishment, with emphasis, as a post of superior observation; just as he spoke generally of his actual damnable doom as a device for hiding from him what was going on. Europe was best described, to his mind, as an elaborate engine for dissociating the confined American from that indispensable knowledge, and was accordingly only rendered bearable by these occasional stations of relief, traps for the arrest of wandering western airs. Strether, on his side, set himself to walk again\u2014he had his relief in his pocket; and indeed, much as he had desired his budget, the growth of restlessness might have been marked in him from the moment he had assured himself of the superscription of most of the missives it contained."}, {"size": 619, "text": "This restlessness became therefore his temporary law; he knew he should recognise as soon as see it the best place of all for settling down with his chief correspondent. He had for the next hour an accidental air of looking for it in the windows of shops; he came down the Rue de la Paix in the sun and, passing across the Tuileries and the river, indulged more than once\u2014as if on finding himself determined\u2014in a sudden pause before the book-stalls of the opposite quay. In the garden of the Tuileries he had lingered, on two or three spots, to look; it was as if the wonderful Paris spring had stayed him as he roamed."}, {"size": 726, "text": "The prompt Paris morning struck its cheerful notes\u2014in a soft breeze and a sprinkled smell, in the light flit, over the garden-floor, of bareheaded girls with the buckled strap of oblong boxes, in the type of ancient thrifty persons basking betimes where terrace-walls were warm, in the blue-frocked brass-labelled officialism of humble rakers and scrapers, in the deep references of a straight-pacing priest or the sharp ones of a white-gaitered red-legged soldier. He watched little brisk figures, figures whose movement was as the tick of the great Paris clock, take their smooth diagonal from point to point; the air had a taste as of something mixed with art, something that presented nature as a white-capped master-chef."}, {"size": 892, "text": "The palace was gone, Strether remembered the palace; and when he gazed into the irremediable void of its site the historic sense in him might have been freely at play\u2014the play under which in Paris indeed it so often winces like a touched nerve. He filled out spaces with dim symbols of scenes; he caught the gleam of white statues at the base of which, with his letters out, he could tilt back a straw-bottomed chair. But his drift was, for reasons, to the other side, and it floated him unspent up the Rue de Seine and as far as the Luxembourg. In the Luxembourg Gardens he pulled up; here at last he found his nook, and here, on a penny chair from which terraces, alleys, vistas, fountains, little trees in green tubs, little women in white caps and shrill little girls at play all sunnily \u201ccomposed\u201d together, he passed an hour in which the cup of his impressions seemed truly to overflow."}, {"size": 719, "text": "But a week had elapsed since he quitted the ship, and there were more things in his mind than so few days could account for. More than once, during the time, he had regarded himself as admonished; but the admonition this morning was formidably sharp. It took as it hadn\u2019t done yet the form of a question\u2014the question of what he was doing with such an extraordinary sense of escape. This sense was sharpest after he had read his letters, but that was also precisely why the question pressed. Four of the letters were from Mrs. Newsome and none of them short; she had lost no time, had followed on his heels while he moved, so expressing herself that he now could measure the probable frequency with which he should hear."}, {"size": 603, "text": "They would arrive, it would seem, her communications, at the rate of several a week; he should be able to count, it might even prove, on more than one by each mail. If he had begun yesterday with a small grievance he had therefore an opportunity to begin to-day with its opposite. He read the letters successively and slowly, putting others back into his pocket but keeping these for a long time afterwards gathered in his lap. He held them there, lost in thought, as if to prolong the presence of what they gave him; or as if at the least to assure them their part in the constitution of some lucidity."}, {"size": 758, "text": "His friend wrote admirably, and her tone was even more in her style than in her voice\u2014he might almost, for the hour, have had to come this distance to get its full carrying quality; yet the plentitude of his consciousness of difference consorted perfectly with the deepened intensity of the connexion. It was the difference, the difference of being just where he was and _as_ he was, that formed the escape\u2014this difference was so much greater than he had dreamed it would be; and what he finally sat there turning over was the strange logic of his finding himself so free. He felt it in a manner his duty to think out his state, to approve the process, and when he came in fact to trace the steps and add up the items they sufficiently accounted for the sum."}, {"size": 865, "text": "He had never expected\u2014that was the truth of it\u2014again to find himself young, and all the years and other things it had taken to make him so were exactly his present arithmetic. He had to make sure of them to put his scruple to rest. It all sprang at bottom from the beauty of Mrs. Newsome\u2019s desire that he should be worried with nothing that was not of the essence of his task; by insisting that he should thoroughly intermit and break she had so provided for his freedom that she would, as it were, have only herself to thank. Strether could not at this point indeed have completed his thought by the image of what she might have to thank herself _for_: the image, at best, of his own likeness\u2014poor Lambert Strether washed up on the sunny strand by the waves of a single day, poor Lambert Strether thankful for breathing-time and stiffening himself while he gasped."}, {"size": 678, "text": "There he was, and with nothing in his aspect or his posture to scandalise: it was only true that if he had seen Mrs. Newsome coming he would instinctively have jumped up to walk away a little. He would have come round and back to her bravely, but he would have had first to pull himself together. She abounded in news of the situation at home, proved to him how perfectly she was arranging for his absence, told him who would take up this and who take up that exactly where he had left it, gave him in fact chapter and verse for the moral that nothing would suffer. It filled for him, this tone of hers, all the air; yet it struck him at the same time as the hum of vain things."}, {"size": 632, "text": "This latter effect was what he tried to justify\u2014and with the success that, grave though the appearance, he at last lighted on a form that was happy. He arrived at it by the inevitable recognition of his having been a fortnight before one of the weariest of men. If ever a man had come off tired Lambert Strether was that man; and hadn\u2019t it been distinctly on the ground of his fatigue that his wonderful friend at home had so felt for him and so contrived? It seemed to him somehow at these instants that, could he only maintain with sufficient firmness his grasp of that truth, it might become in a manner his compass and his helm."}, {"size": 781, "text": "What he wanted most was some idea that would simplify, and nothing would do this so much as the fact that he was done for and finished. If it had been in such a light that he had just detected in his cup the dregs of youth, that was a mere flaw of the surface of his scheme. He was so distinctly fagged-out that it must serve precisely as his convenience, and if he could but consistently be good for little enough he might do everything he wanted. Everything he wanted was comprised moreover in a single boon\u2014the common unattainable art of taking things as they came. He appeared to himself to have given his best years to an active appreciation of the way they didn\u2019t come; but perhaps\u2014as they would seemingly here be things quite other\u2014this long ache might at last drop to rest."}, {"size": 655, "text": "He could easily see that from the moment he should accept the notion of his foredoomed collapse the last thing he would lack would be reasons and memories. Oh if he _should_ do the sum no slate would hold the figures! The fact that he had failed, as he considered, in everything, in each relation and in half a dozen trades, as he liked luxuriously to put it, might have made, might still make, for an empty present; but it stood solidly for a crowded past. It had not been, so much achievement missed, a light yoke nor a short load. It was at present as if the backward picture had hung there, the long crooked course, grey in the shadow of his solitude."}, {"size": 809, "text": "It had been a dreadful cheerful sociable solitude, a solitude of life or choice, of community; but though there had been people enough all round it there had been but three or four persons _in_ it. Waymarsh was one of these, and the fact struck him just now as marking the record. Mrs. Newsome was another, and Miss Gostrey had of a sudden shown signs of becoming a third. Beyond, behind them was the pale figure of his real youth, which held against its breast the two presences paler than itself\u2014the young wife he had early lost and the young son he had stupidly sacrificed. He had again and again made out for himself that he might have kept his little boy, his little dull boy who had died at school of rapid diphtheria, if he had not in those years so insanely given himself to merely missing the mother."}, {"size": 704, "text": "It was the soreness of his remorse that the child had in all likelihood not really been dull\u2014had been dull, as he had been banished and neglected, mainly because the father had been unwittingly selfish. This was doubtless but the secret habit of sorrow, which had slowly given way to time; yet there remained an ache sharp enough to make the spirit, at the sight now and again of some fair young man just growing up, wince with the thought of an opportunity lost. Had ever a man, he had finally fallen into the way of asking himself, lost so much and even done so much for so little? There had been particular reasons why all yesterday, beyond other days, he should have had in one ear this cold enquiry."}, {"size": 666, "text": "His name on the green cover, where he had put it for Mrs. Newsome, expressed him doubtless just enough to make the world\u2014the world as distinguished, both for more and for less, from Woollett\u2014ask who he was. He had incurred the ridicule of having to have his explanation explained. He was Lambert Strether because he was on the cover, whereas it should have been, for anything like glory, that he was on the cover because he was Lambert Strether. He would have done anything for Mrs. Newsome, have been still more ridiculous\u2014as he might, for that matter, have occasion to be yet; which came to saying that this acceptance of fate was all he had to show at fifty-five."}, {"size": 670, "text": "He judged the quantity as small because it _was_ small, and all the more egregiously since it couldn\u2019t, as he saw the case, so much as thinkably have been larger. He hadn\u2019t had the gift of making the most of what he tried, and if he had tried and tried again\u2014no one but himself knew how often\u2014it appeared to have been that he might demonstrate what else, in default of that, _could_ be made. Old ghosts of experiments came back to him, old drudgeries and delusions, and disgusts, old recoveries with their relapses, old fevers with their chills, broken moments of good faith, others of still better doubt; adventures, for the most part, of the sort qualified as lessons."}, {"size": 781, "text": "The special spring that had constantly played for him the day before was the recognition\u2014frequent enough to surprise him\u2014of the promises to himself that he had after his other visit never kept. The reminiscence to-day most quickened for him was that of the vow taken in the course of the pilgrimage that, newly-married, with the War just over, and helplessly young in spite of it, he had recklessly made with the creature who was so much younger still. It had been a bold dash, for which they had taken money set apart for necessities, but kept sacred at the moment in a hundred ways, and in none more so than by this private pledge of his own to treat the occasion as a relation formed with the higher culture and see that, as they said at Woollett, it should bear a good harvest."}, {"size": 683, "text": "He had believed, sailing home again, that he had gained something great, and his theory\u2014with an elaborate innocent plan of reading, digesting, coming back even, every few years\u2014had then been to preserve, cherish and extend it. As such plans as these had come to nothing, however, in respect to acquisitions still more precious, it was doubtless little enough of a marvel that he should have lost account of that handful of seed. Buried for long years in dark corners at any rate these few germs had sprouted again under forty-eight hours of Paris. The process of yesterday had really been the process of feeling the general stirred life of connexions long since individually dropped."}, {"size": 714, "text": "Strether had become acquainted even on this ground with short gusts of speculation\u2014sudden flights of fancy in Louvre galleries, hungry gazes through clear plates behind which lemon-coloured volumes were as fresh as fruit on the tree. There were instants at which he could ask whether, since there had been fundamentally so little question of his keeping anything, the fate after all decreed for him hadn\u2019t been only to _be_ kept. Kept for something, in that event, that he didn\u2019t pretend, didn\u2019t possibly dare as yet to divine; something that made him hover and wonder and laugh and sigh, made him advance and retreat, feeling half ashamed of his impulse to plunge and more than half afraid of his impulse to wait."}, {"size": 825, "text": "He remembered for instance how he had gone back in the sixties with lemon-coloured volumes in general on the brain as well as with a dozen\u2014selected for his wife too\u2014in his trunk; and nothing had at the moment shown more confidence than this invocation of the finer taste. They were still somewhere at home, the dozen\u2014stale and soiled and never sent to the binder; but what had become of the sharp initiation they represented? They represented now the mere sallow paint on the door of the temple of taste that he had dreamed of raising up\u2014a structure he had practically never carried further. Strether\u2019s present highest flights were perhaps those in which this particular lapse figured to him as a symbol, a symbol of his long grind and his want of odd moments, his want moreover of money, of opportunity, of positive dignity."}, {"size": 767, "text": "That the memory of the vow of his youth should, in order to throb again, have had to wait for this last, as he felt it, of all his accidents\u2014that was surely proof enough of how his conscience had been encumbered. If any further proof were needed it would have been to be found in the fact that, as he perfectly now saw, he had ceased even to measure his meagreness, a meagreness that sprawled, in this retrospect, vague and comprehensive, stretching back like some unmapped Hinterland from a rough coast-settlement. His conscience had been amusing itself for the forty-eight hours by forbidding him the purchase of a book; he held off from that, held off from everything; from the moment he didn\u2019t yet call on Chad he wouldn\u2019t for the world have taken any other step."}, {"size": 763, "text": "On this evidence, however, of the way they actually affected him he glared at the lemon-coloured covers in confession of the subconsciousness that, all the same, in the great desert of the years, he must have had of them. The green covers at home comprised, by the law of their purpose, no tribute to letters; it was of a mere rich kernel of economics, politics, ethics that, glazed and, as Mrs. Newsome maintained rather against _his_ view, pre-eminently pleasant to touch, they formed the specious shell. Without therefore any needed instinctive knowledge of what was coming out, in Paris, on the bright highway, he struck himself at present as having more than once flushed with a suspicion: he couldn\u2019t otherwise at present be feeling so many fears confirmed."}, {"size": 630, "text": "There were \u201cmovements\u201d he was too late for: weren\u2019t they, with the fun of them, already spent? There were sequences he had missed and great gaps in the procession: he might have been watching it all recede in a golden cloud of dust. If the playhouse wasn\u2019t closed his seat had at least fallen to somebody else. He had had an uneasy feeling the night before that if he was at the theatre at all\u2014though he indeed justified the theatre, in the specific sense, and with a grotesqueness to which his imagination did all honour, as something he owed poor Waymarsh\u2014he should have been there with, and as might have been said, _for_ Chad."}, {"size": 782, "text": "This suggested the question of whether he could properly have taken him to such a play, and what effect\u2014it was a point that suddenly rose\u2014his peculiar responsibility might be held in general to have on his choice of entertainment. It had literally been present to him at the Gymnase\u2014where one was held moreover comparatively safe\u2014that having his young friend at his side would have been an odd feature of the work of redemption; and this quite in spite of the fact that the picture presented might well, confronted with Chad\u2019s own private stage, have seemed the pattern of propriety. He clearly hadn\u2019t come out in the name of propriety but to visit unattended equivocal performances; yet still less had he done so to undermine his authority by sharing them with the graceless youth."}, {"size": 730, "text": "Was he to renounce all amusement for the sweet sake of that authority? and _would_ such renouncement give him for Chad a moral glamour? The little problem bristled the more by reason of poor Strether\u2019s fairly open sense of the irony of things. Were there then sides on which his predicament threatened to look rather droll to him? Should he have to pretend to believe\u2014either to himself or the wretched boy\u2014that there was anything that could make the latter worse? Wasn\u2019t some such pretence on the other hand involved in the assumption of possible processes that would make him better? His greatest uneasiness seemed to peep at him out of the imminent impression that almost any acceptance of Paris might give one\u2019s authority away."}, {"size": 722, "text": "It hung before him this morning, the vast bright Babylon, like some huge iridescent object, a jewel brilliant and hard, in which parts were not to be discriminated nor differences comfortably marked. It twinkled and trembled and melted together, and what seemed all surface one moment seemed all depth the next. It was a place of which, unmistakeably, Chad was fond; wherefore if he, Strether, should like it too much, what on earth, with such a bond, would become of either of them? It all depended of course\u2014which was a gleam of light\u2014on how the \u201ctoo much\u201d was measured; though indeed our friend fairly felt, while he prolonged the meditation I describe, that for himself even already a certain measure had been reached."}, {"size": 603, "text": "It will have been sufficiently seen that he was not a man to neglect any good chance for reflexion. Was it at all possible for instance to like Paris enough without liking it too much? He luckily however hadn\u2019t promised Mrs. Newsome not to like it at all. He was ready to recognise at this stage that such an engagement _would_ have tied his hands. The Luxembourg Gardens were incontestably just so adorable at this hour by reason\u2014in addition to their intrinsic charm\u2014of his not having taken it. The only engagement he had taken, when he looked the thing in the face, was to do what he reasonably could."}, {"size": 691, "text": "It upset him a little none the less and after a while to find himself at last remembering on what current of association he had been floated so far. Old imaginations of the Latin Quarter had played their part for him, and he had duly recalled its having been with this scene of rather ominous legend that, like so many young men in fiction as well as in fact, Chad had begun. He was now quite out of it, with his \u201chome,\u201d as Strether figured the place, in the Boulevard Malesherbes, now; which was perhaps why, repairing, not to fail of justice either, to the elder neighbourhood, our friend had felt he could allow for the element of the usual, the immemorial, without courting perturbation."}, {"size": 753, "text": "He was not at least in danger of seeing the youth and the particular Person flaunt by together; and yet he was in the very air of which\u2014just to feel what the early natural note must have been\u2014he wished most to take counsel. It became at once vivid to him that he had originally had, for a few days, an almost envious vision of the boy\u2019s romantic privilege. Melancholy M\u00fcrger, with Francine and Musette and Rodolphe, at home, was, in the company of the tattered, one\u2014if he not in his single self two or three\u2014of the unbound, the paper-covered dozen on the shelf; and when Chad had written, five years ago, after a sojourn then already prolonged to six months, that he had decided to go in for economy and the real thing, Strether\u2019s fancy had quite fondly"}, {"size": 780, "text": "accompanied him in this migration, which was to convey him, as they somewhat confusedly learned at Woollett, across the bridges and up the Montagne Sainte-Genevi\u00e8ve. This was the region\u2014Chad had been quite distinct about it\u2014in which the best French, and many other things, were to be learned at least cost, and in which all sorts of clever fellows, compatriots there for a purpose, formed an awfully pleasant set. The clever fellows, the friendly countrymen were mainly young painters, sculptors, architects, medical students; but they were, Chad sagely opined, a much more profitable lot to be with\u2014even on the footing of not being quite one of them\u2014than the \u201cterrible toughs\u201d (Strether remembered the edifying discrimination) of the American bars and banks roundabout the Op\u00e9ra."}, {"size": 625, "text": "Chad had thrown out, in the communications following this one\u2014for at that time he did once in a while communicate\u2014that several members of a band of earnest workers under one of the great artists had taken him right in, making him dine every night, almost for nothing, at their place, and even pressing him not to neglect the hypothesis of there being as much \u201cin him\u201d as in any of them. There had been literally a moment at which it appeared there might be something in him; there had been at any rate a moment at which he had written that he didn\u2019t know but what a month or two more might see him enrolled in some _atelier_."}, {"size": 793, "text": "The season had been one at which Mrs. Newsome was moved to gratitude for small mercies; it had broken on them all as a blessing that their absentee _had_ perhaps a conscience\u2014that he was sated in fine with idleness, was ambitious of variety. The exhibition was doubtless as yet not brilliant, but Strether himself, even by that time much enlisted and immersed, had determined, on the part of the two ladies, a temperate approval and in fact, as he now recollected, a certain austere enthusiasm. But the very next thing that happened had been a dark drop of the curtain. The son and brother had not browsed long on the Montagne Sainte-Genevi\u00e8ve\u2014his effective little use of the name of which, like his allusion to the best French, appeared to have been but one of the notes of his rough cunning."}, {"size": 660, "text": "The light refreshment of these vain appearances had not accordingly carried any of them very far. On the other hand it had gained Chad time; it had given him a chance, unchecked, to strike his roots, had paved the way for initiations more direct and more deep. It was Strether\u2019s belief that he had been comparatively innocent before this first migration, and even that the first effects of the migration would not have been, without some particular bad accident, to have been deplored. There had been three months\u2014he had sufficiently figured it out\u2014in which Chad had wanted to try. He _had_ tried, though not very hard\u2014he had had his little hour of good faith."}, {"size": 747, "text": "The weakness of this principle in him was that almost any accident attestedly bad enough was stronger. Such had at any rate markedly been the case for the precipitation of a special series of impressions. They had proved, successively, these impressions\u2014all of Musette and Francine, but Musette and Francine vulgarised by the larger evolution of the type\u2014irresistibly sharp: he had \u201ctaken up,\u201d by what was at the time to be shrinkingly gathered, as it was scantly mentioned, with one ferociously \u201cinterested\u201d little person after another. Strether had read somewhere of a Latin motto, a description of the hours, observed on a clock by a traveller in Spain; and he had been led to apply it in thought to Chad\u2019s number one, number two, number three."}, {"size": 759, "text": "_Omnes vulnerant, ultima necat_\u2014they had all morally wounded, the last had morally killed. The last had been longest in possession\u2014in possession, that is, of whatever was left of the poor boy\u2019s finer mortality. And it hadn\u2019t been she, it had been one of her early predecessors, who had determined the second migration, the expensive return and relapse, the exchange again, as was fairly to be presumed, of the vaunted best French for some special variety of the worst. He pulled himself then at last together for his own progress back; not with the feeling that he had taken his walk in vain. He prolonged it a little, in the immediate neighbourhood, after he had quitted his chair; and the upshot of the whole morning for him was that his campaign had begun."}, {"size": 609, "text": "He had wanted to put himself in relation, and he would be hanged if he were _not_ in relation. He was that at no moment so much as while, under the old arches of the Od\u00e9on, he lingered before the charming open-air array of literature classic and casual. He found the effect of tone and tint, in the long charged tables and shelves, delicate and appetising; the impression\u2014substituting one kind of low-priced _consommation_ for another\u2014might have been that of one of the pleasant caf\u00e9s that overlapped, under an awning, to the pavement; but he edged along, grazing the tables, with his hands firmly behind him."}, {"size": 772, "text": "He wasn\u2019t there to dip, to consume\u2014he was there to reconstruct. He wasn\u2019t there for his own profit\u2014not, that is, the direct; he was there on some chance of feeling the brush of the wing of the stray spirit of youth. He felt it in fact, he had it beside him; the old arcade indeed, as his inner sense listened, gave out the faint sound, as from far off, of the wild waving of wings. They were folded now over the breasts of buried generations; but a flutter or two lived again in the turned page of shock-headed slouch-hatted loiterers whose young intensity of type, in the direction of pale acuteness, deepened his vision, and even his appreciation, of racial differences, and whose manipulation of the uncut volume was too often, however, but a listening at closed doors."}, {"size": 676, "text": "He reconstructed a possible groping Chad of three or four years before, a Chad who had, after all, simply\u2014for that was the only way to see it\u2014been too vulgar for his privilege. Surely it _was_ a privilege to have been young and happy just there. Well, the best thing Strether knew of him was that he had had such a dream. But his own actual business, half an hour later, was with a third floor on the Boulevard Malesherbes\u2014so much as that was definite; and the fact of the enjoyment by the third-floor windows of a continuous balcony, to which he was helped by this knowledge, had perhaps something to do with his lingering for five minutes on the opposite side of the street."}, {"size": 708, "text": "There were points as to which he had quite made up his mind, and one of these bore precisely on the wisdom of the abruptness to which events had finally committed him, a policy that he was pleased to find not at all shaken as he now looked at his watch and wondered. He _had_ announced himself\u2014six months before; had written out at least that Chad wasn\u2019t to be surprised should he see him some day turn up. Chad had thereupon, in a few words of rather carefully colourless answer, offered him a general welcome; and Strether, ruefully reflecting that he might have understood the warning as a hint to hospitality, a bid for an invitation, had fallen back upon silence as the corrective most to his own taste."}, {"size": 662, "text": "He had asked Mrs. Newsome moreover not to announce him again; he had so distinct an opinion on his attacking his job, should he attack it at all, in his own way. Not the least of this lady\u2019s high merits for him was that he could absolutely rest on her word. She was the only woman he had known, even at Woollett, as to whom his conviction was positive that to lie was beyond her art. Sarah Pocock, for instance, her own daughter, though with social ideals, as they said, in some respects different\u2014Sarah who _was_, in her way, \u00e6sthetic, had never refused to human commerce that mitigation of rigour; there were occasions when he had distinctly seen her apply it."}, {"size": 688, "text": "Since, accordingly, at all events, he had had it from Mrs. Newsome that she had, at whatever cost to her more strenuous view, conformed, in the matter of preparing Chad, wholly to his restrictions, he now looked up at the fine continuous balcony with a safe sense that if the case had been bungled the mistake was at least his property. Was there perhaps just a suspicion of that in his present pause on the edge of the Boulevard and well in the pleasant light? Many things came over him here, and one of them was that he should doubtless presently know whether he had been shallow or sharp. Another was that the balcony in question didn\u2019t somehow show as a convenience easy to surrender."}, {"size": 754, "text": "Poor Strether had at this very moment to recognise the truth that wherever one paused in Paris the imagination reacted before one could stop it. This perpetual reaction put a price, if one would, on pauses; but it piled up consequences till there was scarce room to pick one\u2019s steps among them.

The young man looked at him still, he looked at the young man; and the issue, by a rapid process, was that this knowledge of a perched privacy appeared to him the last of luxuries.

It was by little Bilham\u2019s amazing serenity that he had at first been affected, but he had inevitably, in his circumspection, felt it as the trail of the serpent, the corruption, as he might conveniently have said, of Europe; whereas the promptness with which it came up for Miss Gostrey but as a special little form of the oldest thing they knew justified it at once to his own vision as well."}, {"size": 724, "text": "He wanted to be able to like his specimen with a clear good conscience, and this fully permitted it.

He lived at the end of an alley that went out of an old short cobbled street, a street that went in turn out of a new long smooth avenue\u2014street and avenue and alley having, however, in common a sort of social shabbiness; and he introduced them to the rather cold and blank little studio which he had lent to a comrade for the term of his elegant absence."}, {"size": 818, "text": "The comrade was another ingenuous compatriot, to whom he had wired that tea was to await them \u201cregardless,\u201d and this reckless repast, and the second ingenuous compatriot, and the faraway makeshift life, with its jokes and its gaps, its delicate daubs and its three or four chairs, its overflow of taste and conviction and its lack of nearly all else\u2014these things wove round the occasion a spell to which our hero unreservedly surrendered. He liked the ingenuous compatriots\u2014for two or three others soon gathered; he liked the delicate daubs and the free discriminations\u2014involving references indeed, involving enthusiasms and execrations that made him, as they said, sit up; he liked above all the legend of good-humoured poverty, of mutual accommodation fairly raised to the romantic, that he soon read into the scene."}, {"size": 804, "text": "The ingenuous compatriots showed a candour, he thought, surpassing even the candour of Woollett; they were red-haired and long-legged, they were quaint and queer and dear and droll; they made the place resound with the vernacular, which he had never known so marked as when figuring for the chosen language, he must suppose, of contemporary art. They twanged with a vengeance the \u00e6sthetic lyre\u2014they drew from it wonderful airs. This aspect of their life had an admirable innocence; and he looked on occasion at Maria Gostrey to see to what extent that element reached her.

The new evidence was to come, as it proved, in a day or two.

She hated, he knew, at the French play, anything but a box\u2014just as she hated at the English anything but a stall; and a box was what he was already in this phase girding himself to press upon her.

He had stuck there like a schoolboy wishing not to miss a minute of the show; though for that portion of the show then presented he hadn\u2019t had an instant\u2019s real attention.

But it was in spite of this definite to him that Chad had had a way that was wonderful: a fact carrying with it an implication that, as one might imagine it, he knew, he had learned, how. Here already then were abounding results; he had on the spot and without the least trouble of intention taught Strether that even in so small a thing as that there were different ways.

Strether felt, however, he would have had to confess, that it wouldn\u2019t have been easy just now, on this and other counts, in the presence of what had been supplied, to be quite clear as to what had been missed.

That of course was no more than had been on the cards; but it produced in Strether none the less one of those frequent phenomena of mental reference with which all judgement in him was actually beset. Again and again as the days passed he had had a sense of the pertinence of communicating quickly with Woollett\u2014communicating with a quickness with which telegraphy alone would rhyme; the fruit really of a fine fancy in him for keeping things straight, for the happy forestalment of error."}, {"size": 602, "text": "No one could explain better when needful, nor put more conscience into an account or a report; which burden of conscience is perhaps exactly the reason why his heart always sank when the clouds of explanation gathered.

It easily grew too fast, and the Atlantic cable now alone could race with it. That agency would each day have testified for him to something that was not what Woollett had argued. He was not at this moment absolutely sure that the effect of the morrow\u2019s\u2014or rather of the night\u2019s\u2014appreciation of the crisis wouldn\u2019t be to determine some brief missive. \u201cHave at last seen him, but oh dear!\u201d\u2014some temporary relief of that sort seemed to hover before him."}, {"size": 626, "text": "It hovered somehow as preparing them all\u2014yet preparing them for what?

The most he could have said would have been: \u201cIf he\u2019s going to make me feel young\u2014!\u201d which indeed, however, carried with it quite enough.

Miss Gostrey had in due course been perfect for such a step; she had known exactly what they wanted\u2014to go straight somewhere and talk; and Strether had even felt she had known what he wished to say and that he was arranging immediately to begin.

For what had above all been determined in him as a necessity of the first order was not to lose another hour, nor a fraction of one; was to advance, to overwhelm, with a rush.

The importance of this he had indeed begun to feel before they left the theatre; it had become a wild unrest, urging him to seize his chance. He could scarcely wait for it as they went; he was on the verge of the indecency of bringing up the question in the street; he fairly caught himself going on\u2014so he afterwards invidiously named it\u2014as if there would be for him no second chance should the present be lost."}, {"size": 164, "text": "Not till, on the purple divan before the perfunctory _bock_, he had brought out the words themselves, was he sure, for that matter, that the present would be saved."}, {"size": 655, "text": "\u201cI\u2019ve come, you know, to make you break with everything, neither more nor less, and take you straight home; so you\u2019ll be so good as immediately and favourably to consider it!\u201d\u2014Strether, face to face with Chad after the play, had sounded these words almost breathlessly, and with an effect at first positively disconcerting to himself alone.

Strether didn\u2019t, as he talked, absolutely follow himself; he only knew he was clutching his thread and that he held it from moment to moment a little tighter; his mere uninterruptedness during the few minutes helped him to do that.

In gleams, in glances, the past did perhaps peep out of it; but such lights were faint and instantly merged. Chad was brown and thick and strong, and of old Chad had been rough. Was all the difference therefore that he was actually smooth? Possibly; for that he _was_ smooth was as marked as in the taste of a sauce or in the rub of a hand.

He had formerly, with a great deal of action, expressed very little; and he now expressed whatever was necessary with almost none at all. It was as if in short he had really, copious perhaps but shapeless, been put into a firm mould and turned successfully out.

It was a touch that gave the note of the familiar\u2014the intimate and the belated\u2014to their quiet colloquy; and it was indeed by some such trivial aid that Strether became aware at the same moment of something else.

There was an experience on his interlocutor\u2019s part that looked out at him from under the displaced hat, and that looked out moreover by a force of its own, the deep fact of its quantity and quality, and not through Chad\u2019s intending bravado or swagger."}, {"size": 689, "text": "That was then the way men marked out by women _were_\u2014and also the men by whom the women were doubtless in turn sufficiently distinguished.

The devil of the case was that Strether felt it, by the same stroke, as falling straight upon himself. He had been wondering a minute ago if the boy weren\u2019t a Pagan, and he found himself wondering now if he weren\u2019t by chance a gentleman.

It was accordingly to forestall such an accident that he frankly put before the young man the several facts, just as they had occurred, of his funny alliance.

He made the point at the same time that his social relations, such as they could be called, were perhaps not to the extent Strether supposed with the rising flood of their compatriots. He hinted at his having more and more given way to a different principle of selection; the moral of which seemed to be that he went about little in the \u201ccolony.\u201d For the moment certainly he had quite another interest."}, {"size": 640, "text": "It was deep, what he understood, and Strether, for himself, could only so observe it.

He liked, to begin with, his prospective stepfather; which was distinctly what had not been on the cards. His hating him was the untowardness for which Strether had been best prepared; he hadn\u2019t expected the boy\u2019s actual form to give him more to do than his imputed. It gave him more through suggesting that he must somehow make up to himself for not being sure he was sufficiently disagreeable."}, {"size": 671, "text": "That had really been present to him as his only way to be sure he was sufficiently thorough.

That seemed at the end of ten days the upshot of the abundant, the recurrent talk through which Strether poured into him all it concerned him to know, put him in full possession of facts and figures.

He walked up and down in front of this production, sociably took Strether\u2019s arm at the points at which he stopped, surveyed it repeatedly from the right and from the left, inclined a critical head to either quarter, and, while he puffed a still more critical cigarette, animadverted to his companion on this passage and that."}, {"size": 680, "text": "Strether sought relief\u2014there were hours when he required it\u2014in repeating himself; it was in truth not to be blinked that Chad had a way.

He himself did what he hadn\u2019t done before; he took two or three times whole days off\u2014irrespective of others, of two or three taken with Miss Gostrey, two or three taken with little Bilham: he went to Chartres and cultivated, before the front of the cathedral, a general easy beatitude; he went to Fontainebleau and imagined himself on the way to Italy; he went to Rouen with a little handbag and inordinately spent the night."}, {"size": 722, "text": "One afternoon he did something quite different; finding himself in the neighbourhood of a fine old house across the river, he passed under the great arch of its doorway and asked at the porter\u2019s lodge for Madame de Vionnet. He had already hovered more than once about that possibility, been aware of it, in the course of ostensible strolls, as lurking but round the corner. Only it had perversely happened, after his morning at Notre Dame, that his consistency, as he considered and intended it, had come back to him; whereby he had reflected that the encounter in question had been none of his making; clinging again intensely to the strength of his position, which was precisely that there was nothing in it for himself."}, {"size": 802, "text": "From the moment he actively pursued the charming associate of his adventure, from that moment his position weakened, for he was then acting in an interested way. It was only within a few days that he had fixed himself a limit: he promised himself his consistency should end with Sarah\u2019s arrival. It was arguing correctly to feel the title to a free hand conferred on him by this event. If he wasn\u2019t to be let alone he should be merely a dupe to act with delicacy. If he wasn\u2019t to be trusted he could at least take his ease. If he was to be placed under control he gained leave to try what his position _might_ agreeably give him. An ideal rigour would perhaps postpone the trial till after the Pococks had shown their spirit; and it was to an ideal rigour that he had quite promised himself to conform."}, {"size": 758, "text": "Suddenly, however, on this particular day, he felt a particular fear under which everything collapsed. He knew abruptly that he was afraid of himself\u2014and yet not in relation to the effect on his sensibilities of another hour of Madame de Vionnet. What he dreaded was the effect of a single hour of Sarah Pocock, as to whom he was visited, in troubled nights, with fantastic waking dreams. She loomed at him larger than life; she increased in volume as she drew nearer; she so met his eyes that, his imagination taking, after the first step, all, and more than all, the strides, he already felt her come down on him, already burned, under her reprobation, with the blush of guilt, already consented, by way of penance, to the instant forfeiture of everything."}, {"size": 635, "text": "He saw himself, under her direction, recommitted to Woollett as juvenile offenders are committed to reformatories. It wasn\u2019t of course that Woollett was really a place of discipline; but he knew in advance that Sarah\u2019s salon at the hotel would be. His danger, at any rate, in such moods of alarm, was some concession, on this ground, that would involve a sharp rupture with the actual; therefore if he waited to take leave of that actual he might wholly miss his chance. It was represented with supreme vividness by Madame de Vionnet, and that is why, in a word, he waited no longer. He had seen in a flash that he must anticipate Mrs."}, {"size": 655, "text": "Pocock.

It was suddenly as if he should never see her again, and as if moreover he had brought it on himself by not having been quite kind to her. It was the advantage of his having let his fancy lose itself for a little in the gloom that, as by reaction, the prospect began really to brighten from the moment the deputation from Woollett alighted on the platform of the station."}, {"size": 707, "text": "They had come straight from Havre, having sailed from New York to that port, and having also, thanks to a happy voyage, made land with a promptitude that left Chad Newsome, who had meant to meet them at the dock, belated.

He hastily picked up Strether, at the hotel, for this purpose, and he even, with easy pleasantry, suggested the attendance of Waymarsh as well\u2014Waymarsh, at the moment his cab rattled up, being engaged, under Strether\u2019s contemplative range, in a grave perambulation of the familiar court."}, {"size": 626, "text": "Waymarsh had learned from his companion, who had already had a note, delivered by hand, from Chad, that the Pococks were due, and had ambiguously, though, as always, impressively, glowered at him over the circumstance; carrying himself in a manner in which Strether was now expert enough to recognise his uncertainty, in the premises, as to the best tone. The only tone he aimed at with confidence was a full tone\u2014which was necessarily difficult in the absence of a full knowledge.

He had insisted on the fact that Waymarsh would quite like Mrs. Pocock\u2014one could be certain he would: he would be with her about everything, and she would also be with _him_, and Miss Barrace\u2019s nose, in short, would find itself out of joint.

They talked of him, the two others, as they drove, and Strether put Chad in possession of much of his own strained sense of things. He had already, a few days before, named to him the wire he was convinced their friend had pulled\u2014a confidence that had made on the young man\u2019s part quite hugely for curiosity and diversion. The action of the matter, moreover, Strether could see, was to penetrate; he saw that is, how Chad judged a system of influence in which Waymarsh had served as a determinant\u2014an impression just now quickened again; with the whole bearing of such a fact on the youth\u2019s view of his relatives."}, {"size": 803, "text": "As it came up between them that they might now take their friend for a feature of the control of these latter now sought to be exerted from Woollett, Strether felt indeed how it would be stamped all over him, half an hour later for Sarah Pocock\u2019s eyes, that he was as much on Chad\u2019s \u201cside\u201d as Waymarsh had probably described him. He was letting himself at present, go; there was no denying it; it might be desperation, it might be confidence; he should offer himself to the arriving travellers bristling with all the lucidity he had cultivated.

He had recently rather failed of apprehension of the young man\u2019s attitude and temper\u2014remaining principally conscious of how little worry, at the worst, he wasted, and he studied him at this critical hour with renewed interest.

Strether felt him more than ever a justification of the extraordinary process of which his own absurd spirit had been the arena; he knew as their cab rolled along, knew as he hadn\u2019t even yet known, that nothing else than what Chad had done and had been would have led to his present showing."}, {"size": 636, "text": "They had made him, these things, what he was, and the business hadn\u2019t been easy; it had taken time and trouble, it had cost, above all, a price.

Fierce in him almost was the resolve to lose no more of them, and he whimsically reflected, while at Chad\u2019s side he drew nearer to his destination, that it was after all Sarah who would have quickened his chance.

It was brave to Strether to hear him talk as if the line of wisdom they had struck out was to make things ravishing to the Pococks. No, if Madame de Vionnet compassed _that_, compassed the ravishment of the Pococks, Madame de Vionnet would be prodigious. It would be a beautiful plan if it succeeded, and it all came to the question of Sarah\u2019s being really bribeable.

The only difficulty was that he couldn\u2019t quite have said with what. It was as if he had sold himself, but hadn\u2019t somehow got the cash. That, however, was what, characteristically, _would_ happen to him. It would naturally be his kind of traffic.

A strange new feeling had come over Strether, in consequence of which his spirits had risen; it was as if what had occurred on the alighting of his critics had been something other than his fear, though his fear had yet not been of an instant scene of violence.

It had come moreover in the flash of an eye, it had come in the smile with which Sarah, whom, at the window of her compartment, they had effusively greeted from the platform, rustled down to them a moment later, fresh and handsome from her cool June progress through the charming land. It was only a sign, but enough: she was going to be gracious and unallusive, she was going to play the larger game\u2014which was still more apparent, after she had emerged from Chad\u2019s arms, in her direct greeting to the valued friend of her family."}, {"size": 838, "text": "Strether _was_ then as much as ever the valued friend of her family, it was something he could at all events go on with; and the manner of his response to it expressed even for himself how little he had enjoyed the prospect of ceasing to figure in that likeness.

Strether had seen Mrs. Newsome reserved; he had literally heard her silent, though he had never known her unpleasant. It was the case with Mrs. Pocock that he had known _her_ unpleasant, even though he had never known her not affable.

There had been times enough for a month when it had seemed to him that he was strange, that he was altered, in every way; but that was a matter for himself; he knew at least whose business it was _not_; it was not at all events such a circumstance as Sarah\u2019s own unaided lights would help her to.

This was then the spirit in which he hovered, and with the easier throb in it much indebted furthermore to the impression of high and established adequacy as a pretty girl promptly produced in him by Mamie. He had wondered vaguely\u2014turning over many things in the fidget of his thoughts\u2014if Mamie _were_ as pretty as Woollett published her; as to which issue seeing her now again was to be so swept away by Woollett\u2019s opinion that this consequence really let loose for the imagination an avalanche of others."}, {"size": 686, "text": "There were positively five minutes in which the last word seemed of necessity to abide with a Woollett represented by a Mamie.

Well, it was right, Strether slipped smoothly enough into the cheerfulness of saying: granted that a community _might_ be best represented by a young lady of twenty-two, Mamie perfectly played the part, played it as if she were used to it, and looked and spoke and dressed the character."}, {"size": 755, "text": "He wondered if she mightn\u2019t, in the high light of Paris, a cool full studio-light, becoming yet treacherous, show as too conscious of these matters; but the next moment he felt satisfied that her consciousness was after all empty for its size, rather too simple than too mixed, and that the kind way with her would be not to take many things out of it, but to put as many as possible in. She was robust and conveniently tall; just a trifle too bloodlessly fair perhaps, but with a pleasant public familiar radiance that affirmed her vitality.

What Mamie was like was the happy bride, the bride after the church and just before going away. She wasn\u2019t the mere maiden, and yet was only as much married as that quantity came to. She was in the brilliant acclaimed festal stage. Well, might it last her long!

All this then, for five minutes, was vivid to Strether, and it put before him that, poor child, she had now but her prudence to amuse her.

It made its sign, the suggestion\u2014weather, air, light, colour and his mood all favouring\u2014at the end of some eighty minutes; the train pulled up just at the right spot, and he found himself getting out as securely as if to keep an appointment."}, {"size": 704, "text": "It will be felt of him that he could amuse himself, at his age, with very small things if it be again noted that his appointment was only with a superseded Boston fashion. He hadn\u2019t gone far without the quick confidence that it would be quite sufficiently kept. The oblong gilt frame disposed its enclosing lines; the poplars and willows, the reeds and river\u2014a river of which he didn\u2019t know, and didn\u2019t want to know, the name\u2014fell into a composition, full of felicity, within them; the sky was silver and turquoise and varnish; the village on the left was white and the church on the right was grey; it was all there, in short\u2014it was what he wanted: it was Tremont Street, it was France, it was Lambinet."}, {"size": 757, "text": "Moreover he was freely walking about in it. He did this last, for an hour, to his heart\u2019s content, making for the shady woody horizon and boring so deep into his impression and his idleness that he might fairly have got through them again and reached the maroon-coloured wall. It was a wonder, no doubt, that the taste of idleness for him shouldn\u2019t need more time to sweeten; but it had in fact taken the few previous days; it had been sweetening in truth ever since the retreat of the Pococks. He walked and walked as if to show himself how little he had now to do; he had nothing to do but turn off to some hillside where he might stretch himself and hear the poplars rustle, and whence\u2014in the course of an afternoon so spent, an afternoon richly suffused"}, {"size": 841, "text": "too with the sense of a book in his pocket\u2014he should sufficiently command the scene to be able to pick out just the right little rustic inn for an experiment in respect to dinner. There was a train back to Paris at 9.20, and he saw himself partaking, at the close of the day, with the enhancements of a coarse white cloth and a sanded door, of something fried and felicitous, washed down with authentic wine; after which he might, as he liked, either stroll back to his station in the gloaming or propose for the local _carriole_ and converse with his driver, a driver who naturally wouldn\u2019t fail of a stiff clean blouse, of a knitted nightcap and of the genius of response\u2014who, in fine, would sit on the shafts, tell him what the French people were thinking, and remind him, as indeed the whole episode would incidentally do, of Maupassant."}, {"size": 780, "text": "Strether heard his lips, for the first time in French air, as this vision assumed consistency, emit sounds of expressive intention without fear of his company. He had been afraid of Chad and of Maria and of Madame de Vionnet; he had been most of all afraid of Waymarsh, in whose presence, so far as they had mixed together in the light of the town, he had never without somehow paying for it aired either his vocabulary or his accent. He usually paid for it by meeting immediately afterwards Waymarsh\u2019s eye. Such were the liberties with which his fancy played after he had turned off to the hillside that did really and truly, as well as most amiably, await him beneath the poplars, the hillside that made him feel, for a murmurous couple of hours, how happy had been his thought."}, {"size": 715, "text": "He had the sense of success, of a finer harmony in things; nothing but what had turned out as yet according to his plan. It most of all came home to him, as he lay on his back on the grass, that Sarah had really gone, that his tension was really relaxed; the peace diffused in these ideas might be delusive, but it hung about him none the less for the time. It fairly, for half an hour, sent him to sleep; he pulled his straw hat over his eyes\u2014he had bought it the day before with a reminiscence of Waymarsh\u2019s\u2014and lost himself anew in Lambinet. It was as if he had found out he was tired\u2014tired not from his walk, but from that inward exercise which had known, on the whole, for three months, so little intermission."}, {"size": 706, "text": "That was it\u2014when once they were off he had dropped; this moreover was what he had dropped to, and now he was touching bottom. He was kept luxuriously quiet, soothed and amused by the consciousness of what he had found at the end of his descent. It was very much what he had told Maria Gostrey he should like to stay on for, the hugely-distributed Paris of summer, alternately dazzling and dusky, with a weight lifted for him off its columns and cornices and with shade and air in the flutter of awnings as wide as avenues. It was present to him without attenuation that, reaching out, the day after making the remark, for some proof of his freedom, he had gone that very afternoon to see Madame de Vionnet."}, {"size": 696, "text": "He had gone again the next day but one, and the effect of the two visits, the after-sense of the couple of hours spent with her, was almost that of fulness and frequency. The brave intention of frequency, so great with him from the moment of his finding himself unjustly suspected at Woollett, had remained rather theoretic, and one of the things he could muse about under his poplars was the source of the special shyness that had still made him careful. He had surely got rid of it now, this special shyness; what had become of it if it hadn\u2019t precisely, within the week, rubbed off? It struck him now in fact as sufficiently plain that if he had still been careful he had been so for a reason."}, {"size": 626, "text": "He had really feared, in his behaviour, a lapse from good faith; if there was a danger of one\u2019s liking such a woman too much one\u2019s best safety was in waiting at least till one had the right to do so. In the light of the last few days the danger was fairly vivid; so that it was proportionately fortunate that the right was likewise established. It seemed to our friend that he had on each occasion profited to the utmost by the latter: how could he have done so more, he at all events asked himself, than in having immediately let her know that, if it was all the same to her, he preferred not to talk about anything tiresome?"}, {"size": 825, "text": "He had never in his life so sacrificed an armful of high interests as in that remark; he had never so prepared the way for the comparatively frivolous as in addressing it to Madame de Vionnet\u2019s intelligence. It hadn\u2019t been till later that he quite recalled how in conjuring away everything but the pleasant he had conjured away almost all they had hitherto talked about; it was not till later even that he remembered how, with their new tone, they hadn\u2019t so much as mentioned the name of Chad himself. One of the things that most lingered with him on his hillside was this delightful facility, with such a woman, of arriving at a new tone; he thought, as he lay on his back, of all the tones she might make possible if one were to try her, and at any rate of the probability that one could trust her to fit them to occasions."}, {"size": 634, "text": "He had wanted her to feel that, as he was disinterested now, so she herself should be, and she had showed she felt it, and he had showed he was grateful, and it had been for all the world as if he were calling for the first time. They had had other, but irrelevant, meetings; it was quite as if, had they sooner known how much they _really_ had in common, there were quantities of comparatively dull matters they might have skipped. Well, they were skipping them now, even to graceful gratitude, even to handsome \u201cDon\u2019t mention it!\u201d\u2014and it was amazing what could still come up without reference to what had been going on between them."}, {"size": 870, "text": "It might have been, on analysis, nothing more than Shakespeare and the musical glasses; but it had served all the purpose of his appearing to have said to her: \u201cDon\u2019t like me, if it\u2019s a question of liking me, for anything obvious and clumsy that I\u2019ve, as they call it, \u2018done\u2019 for you: like me\u2014well, like me, hang it, for anything else you choose. So, by the same propriety, don\u2019t be for me simply the person I\u2019ve come to know through my awkward connexion with Chad\u2014was ever anything, by the way, _more_ awkward? Be for me, please, with all your admirable tact and trust, just whatever I may show you it\u2019s a present pleasure to me to think you.\u201d It had been a large indication to meet; but if she hadn\u2019t met it what _had_ she done, and how had their time together slipped along so smoothly, mild but not slow, and melting, liquefying, into his happy illusion of idleness?"}, {"size": 732, "text": "He could recognise on the other hand that he had probably not been without reason, in his prior, his restricted state, for keeping an eye on his liability to lapse from good faith. He really continued in the picture\u2014that being for himself his situation\u2014all the rest of this rambling day; so that the charm was still, was indeed more than ever upon him when, toward six o\u2019clock he found himself amicably engaged with a stout white-capped deep-voiced woman at the door of the _auberge_ of the biggest village, a village that affected him as a thing of whiteness, blueness and crookedness, set in coppery green, and that had the river flowing behind or before it\u2014one couldn\u2019t say which; at the bottom, in particular, of the inn-garden."}, {"size": 642, "text": "He had had other adventures before this; had kept along the height, after shaking off slumber; had admired, had almost coveted, another small old church, all steep roof and dim slate-colour without and all whitewash and paper flowers within; had lost his way and had found it again; had conversed with rustics who struck him perhaps a little more as men of the world than he had expected; had acquired at a bound a fearless facility in French; had had, as the afternoon waned, a watery _bock_, all pale and Parisian, in the caf\u00e9 of the furthest village, which was not the biggest; and had meanwhile not once overstepped the oblong gilt frame."}, {"size": 720, "text": "The frame had drawn itself out for him, as much as you please; but that was just his luck. He had finally come down again to the valley, to keep within touch of stations and trains, turning his face to the quarter from which he had started; and thus it was that he had at last pulled up before the hostess of the Cheval Blanc, who met him, with a rough readiness that was like the clatter of sabots over stones, on their common ground of a _c\u00f4telette de veau \u00e0 l\u2019oseille_ and a subsequent lift. He had walked many miles and didn\u2019t know he was tired; but he still knew he was amused, and even that, though he had been alone all day, he had never yet so struck himself as engaged with others and in midstream of his drama."}, {"size": 708, "text": "It might have passed for finished his drama, with its catastrophe all but reached: it had, however, none the less been vivid again for him as he thus gave it its fuller chance. He had only had to be at last well out of it to feel it, oddly enough, still going on. For this had been all day at bottom the spell of the picture\u2014that it was essentially more than anything else a scene and a stage, that the very air of the play was in the rustle of the willows and the tone of the sky. The play and the characters had, without his knowing it till now, peopled all his space for him, and it seemed somehow quite happy that they should offer themselves, in the conditions so supplied, with a kind of inevitability."}, {"size": 768, "text": "It was as if the conditions made them not only inevitable, but so much more nearly natural and right as that they were at least easier, pleasanter, to put up with. The conditions had nowhere so asserted their difference from those of Woollett as they appeared to him to assert it in the little court of the Cheval Blanc while he arranged with his hostess for a comfortable climax. They were few and simple, scant and humble, but they were _the thing_, as he would have called it, even to a greater degree than Madame de Vionnet\u2019s old high salon where the ghost of the Empire walked. \u201cThe\u201d thing was the thing that implied the greatest number of other things of the sort he had had to tackle; and it was queer of course, but so it was\u2014the implication here was complete."}, {"size": 624, "text": "Not a single one of his observations but somehow fell into a place in it; not a breath of the cooler evening that wasn\u2019t somehow a syllable of the text. The text was simply, when condensed, that in _these_ places such things were, and that if it was in them one elected to move about one had to make one\u2019s account with what one lighted on. Meanwhile at all events it was enough that they did affect one\u2014so far as the village aspect was concerned\u2014as whiteness, crookedness and blueness set in coppery green; there being positively, for that matter, an outer wall of the White Horse that was painted the most improbable shade."}, {"size": 691, "text": "That was part of the amusement\u2014as if to show that the fun was harmless; just as it was enough, further, that the picture and the play seemed supremely to melt together in the good woman\u2019s broad sketch of what she could do for her visitor\u2019s appetite. He felt in short a confidence, and it was general, and it was all he wanted to feel. It suffered no shock even on her mentioning that she had in fact just laid the cloth for two persons who, unlike Monsieur, had arrived by the river\u2014in a boat of their own; who had asked her, half an hour before, what she could do for them, and had then paddled away to look at something a little further up\u2014from which promenade they would presently return."}, {"size": 635, "text": "Monsieur might meanwhile, if he liked, pass into the garden, such as it was, where she would serve him, should he wish it\u2014for there were tables and benches in plenty\u2014a \u201cbitter\u201d before his repast. Here she would also report to him on the possibility of a conveyance to his station, and here at any rate he would have the _agr\u00e9ment_ of the river. It may be mentioned without delay that Monsieur had the _agr\u00e9ment_ of everything, and in particular, for the next twenty minutes, of a small and primitive pavilion that, at the garden\u2019s edge, almost overhung the water, testifying, in its somewhat battered state, to much fond frequentation."}, {"size": 671, "text": "It consisted of little more than a platform, slightly raised, with a couple of benches and a table, a protecting rail and a projecting roof; but it raked the full grey-blue stream, which, taking a turn a short distance above, passed out of sight to reappear much higher up; and it was clearly in esteemed requisition for Sundays and other feasts. Strether sat there and, though hungry, felt at peace; the confidence that had so gathered for him deepened with the lap of the water, the ripple of the surface, the rustle of the reeds on the opposite bank, the faint diffused coolness and the slight rock of a couple of small boats attached to a rough landing-place hard by."}, {"size": 679, "text": "The valley on the further side was all copper-green level and glazed pearly sky, a sky hatched across with screens of trimmed trees, which looked flat, like espaliers; and though the rest of the village straggled away in the near quarter the view had an emptiness that made one of the boats suggestive. Such a river set one afloat almost before one could take up the oars\u2014the idle play of which would be moreover the aid to the full impression. This perception went so far as to bring him to his feet; but that movement, in turn, made him feel afresh that he was tired, and while he leaned against a post and continued to look out he saw something that gave him a sharper arrest."}, {"size": 876, "text": "What he saw was exactly the right thing\u2014a boat advancing round the bend and containing a man who held the paddles and a lady, at the stern, with a pink parasol. It was suddenly as if these figures, or something like them, had been wanted in the picture, had been wanted more or less all day, and had now drifted into sight, with the slow current, on purpose to fill up the measure. They came slowly, floating down, evidently directed to the landing-place near their spectator and presenting themselves to him not less clearly as the two persons for whom his hostess was already preparing a meal. For two very happy persons he found himself straightway taking them\u2014a young man in shirt-sleeves, a young woman easy and fair, who had pulled pleasantly up from some other place and, being acquainted with the neighbourhood, had known what this particular retreat could offer them."}, {"size": 707, "text": "The air quite thickened, at their approach, with further intimations; the intimation that they were expert, familiar, frequent\u2014that this wouldn\u2019t at all events be the first time. They knew how to do it, he vaguely felt\u2014and it made them but the more idyllic, though at the very moment of the impression, as happened, their boat seemed to have begun to drift wide, the oarsman letting it go. It had by this time none the less come much nearer\u2014near enough for Strether to dream the lady in the stern had for some reason taken account of his being there to watch them. She had remarked on it sharply, yet her companion hadn\u2019t turned round; it was in fact almost as if our friend had felt her bid him keep still."}, {"size": 701, "text": "She had taken in something as a result of which their course had wavered, and it continued to waver while they just stood off. This little effect was sudden and rapid, so rapid that Strether\u2019s sense of it was separate only for an instant from a sharp start of his own. He too had within the minute taken in something, taken in that he knew the lady whose parasol, shifting as if to hide her face, made so fine a pink point in the shining scene. It was too prodigious, a chance in a million, but, if he knew the lady, the gentleman, who still presented his back and kept off, the gentleman, the coatless hero of the idyll, who had responded to her start, was, to match the marvel, none other than Chad."}, {"size": 728, "text": "Chad and Madame de Vionnet were then like himself taking a day in the country\u2014though it was as queer as fiction, as farce, that their country could happen to be exactly his; and she had been the first at recognition, the first to feel, across the water, the shock\u2014for it appeared to come to that\u2014of their wonderful accident. Strether became aware, with this, of what was taking place\u2014that her recognition had been even stranger for the pair in the boat, that her immediate impulse had been to control it, and that she was quickly and intensely debating with Chad the risk of betrayal. He saw they would show nothing if they could feel sure he hadn\u2019t made them out; so that he had before him for a few seconds his own hesitation."}, {"size": 606, "text": "It was a sharp fantastic crisis that had popped up as if in a dream, and it had had only to last the few seconds to make him feel it as quite horrible. They were thus, on either side, _trying_ the other side, and all for some reason that broke the stillness like some unprovoked harsh note. It seemed to him again, within the limit, that he had but one thing to do\u2014to settle their common question by some sign of surprise and joy. He hereupon gave large play to these things, agitating his hat and his stick and loudly calling out\u2014a demonstration that brought him relief as soon as he had seen it answered."}, {"size": 840, "text": "The boat, in mid-stream, still went a little wild\u2014which seemed natural, however, while Chad turned round, half springing up; and his good friend, after blankness and wonder, began gaily to wave her parasol. Chad dropped afresh to his paddles and the boat headed round, amazement and pleasantry filling the air meanwhile, and relief, as Strether continued to fancy, superseding mere violence. Our friend went down to the water under this odd impression as of violence averted\u2014the violence of their having \u201ccut\u201d him, out there in the eye of nature, on the assumption that he wouldn\u2019t know it. He awaited them with a face from which he was conscious of not being able quite to banish this idea that they would have gone on, not seeing and not knowing, missing their dinner and disappointing their hostess, had he himself taken a line to match."}, {"size": 646, "text": "That at least was what darkened his vision for the moment. Afterwards, after they had bumped at the landing-place and he had assisted their getting ashore, everything found itself sponged over by the mere miracle of the encounter. They could so much better at last, on either side, treat it as a wild extravagance of hazard, that the situation was made elastic by the amount of explanation called into play. Why indeed\u2014apart from oddity\u2014the situation should have been really stiff was a question naturally not practical at the moment, and in fact, so far as we are concerned, a question tackled, later on and in private, only by Strether himself."}, {"size": 622, "text": "He was to reflect later on and in private that it was mainly _he_ who had explained\u2014as he had had moreover comparatively little difficulty in doing. He was to have at all events meanwhile the worrying thought of their perhaps secretly suspecting him of having plotted this coincidence, taking such pains as might be to give it the semblance of an accident. That possibility\u2014as their imputation\u2014didn\u2019t of course bear looking into for an instant; yet the whole incident was so manifestly, arrange it as they would, an awkward one, that he could scarce keep disclaimers in respect to his own presence from rising to his lips."}, {"size": 704, "text": "Disclaimers of intention would have been as tactless as his presence was practically gross; and the narrowest escape they either of them had was his lucky escape, in the event, from making any. Nothing of the sort, so far as surface and sound were involved, was even in question; surface and sound all made for their common ridiculous good fortune, for the general _invraisemblance_ of the occasion, for the charming chance that they had, the others, in passing, ordered some food to be ready, the charming chance that he had himself not eaten, the charming chance, even more, that their little plans, their hours, their train, in short, from _l\u00e0-bas_, would all match for their return together to Paris."}, {"size": 756, "text": "The chance that was most charming of all, the chance that drew from Madame de Vionnet her clearest, gayest \u201c_Comme cela se trouve!_\u201d was the announcement made to Strether after they were seated at table, the word given him by their hostess in respect to his carriage for the station, on which he might now count. It settled the matter for his friends as well; the conveyance\u2014it _was_ all too lucky!\u2014would serve for them; and nothing was more delightful than his being in a position to make the train so definite. It might have been, for themselves\u2014to hear Madame de Vionnet\u2014almost unnaturally vague, a detail left to be fixed; though Strether indeed was afterwards to remember that Chad had promptly enough intervened to forestall this appearance, laughing"}, {"size": 739, "text": "at his companion\u2019s flightiness and making the point that he had after all, in spite of the bedazzlement of a day out with her, known what he was about. Strether was to remember afterwards further that this had had for him the effect of forming Chad\u2019s almost sole intervention; and indeed he was to remember further still, in subsequent meditation, many things that, as it were, fitted together. Another of them was for instance that the wonderful woman\u2019s overflow of surprise and amusement was wholly into French, which she struck him as speaking with an unprecedented command of idiomatic turns, but in which she got, as he might have said, somewhat away from him, taking all at once little brilliant jumps that he could but lamely match."}, {"size": 676, "text": "The question of his own French had never come up for them; it was the one thing she wouldn\u2019t have permitted\u2014it belonged, for a person who had been through much, to mere boredom; but the present result was odd, fairly veiling her identity, shifting her back into a mere voluble class or race to the intense audibility of which he was by this time inured. When she spoke the charming slightly strange English he best knew her by he seemed to feel her as a creature, among all the millions, with a language quite to herself, the real monopoly of a special shade of speech, beautifully easy for her, yet of a colour and a cadence that were both inimitable and matters of accident."}, {"size": 698, "text": "She came back to these things after they had shaken down in the inn-parlour and knew, as it were, what was to become of them; it was inevitable that loud ejaculation over the prodigy of their convergence should at last wear itself out. Then it was that his impression took fuller form\u2014the impression, destined only to deepen, to complete itself, that they had something to put a face upon, to carry off and make the best of, and that it was she who, admirably on the whole, was doing this. It was familiar to him of course that they had something to put a face upon; their friendship, their connexion, took any amount of explaining\u2014that would have been made familiar by his twenty minutes with Mrs."}, {"size": 701, "text": "Pocock if it hadn\u2019t already been so. Yet his theory, as we know, had bountifully been that the facts were specifically none of his business, and were, over and above, so far as one had to do with them, intrinsically beautiful; and this might have prepared him for anything, as well as rendered him proof against mystification. When he reached home that night, however, he knew he had been, at bottom, neither prepared nor proof; and since we have spoken of what he was, after his return, to recall and interpret, it may as well immediately be said that his real experience of these few hours put on, in that belated vision\u2014for he scarce went to bed till morning\u2014the aspect that is most to our purpose."}, {"size": 896, "text": "He then knew more or less how he had been affected\u2014he but half knew at the time. There had been plenty to affect him even after, as has been said, they had shaken down; for his consciousness, though muffled, had its sharpest moments during this passage, a marked drop into innocent friendly Bohemia. They then had put their elbows on the table, deploring the premature end of their two or three dishes; which they had tried to make up with another bottle while Chad joked a little spasmodically, perhaps even a little irrelevantly, with the hostess. What it all came to had been that fiction and fable _were_, inevitably, in the air, and not as a simple term of comparison, but as a result of things said; also that they were blinking it, all round, and that they yet needn\u2019t, so much as that, have blinked it\u2014though indeed if they hadn\u2019t Strether didn\u2019t quite see what else they could have done."}, {"size": 733, "text": "Strether didn\u2019t quite see _that_ even at an hour or two past midnight, even when he had, at his hotel, for a long time, without a light and without undressing, sat back on his bedroom sofa and stared straight before him. He was, at that point of vantage, in full possession, to make of it all what he could. He kept making of it that there had been simply a _lie_ in the charming affair\u2014a lie on which one could now, detached and deliberate, perfectly put one\u2019s finger. It was with the lie that they had eaten and drunk and talked and laughed, that they had waited for their _carriole_ rather impatiently, and had then got into the vehicle and, sensibly subsiding, driven their three or four miles through the darkening summer night."}, {"size": 808, "text": "The eating and drinking, which had been a resource, had had the effect of having served its turn; the talk and laughter had done as much; and it was during their somewhat tedious progress to the station, during the waits there, the further delays, their submission to fatigue, their silences in the dim compartment of the much-stopping train, that he prepared himself for reflexions to come. It had been a performance, Madame de Vionnet\u2019s manner, and though it had to that degree faltered toward the end, as through her ceasing to believe in it, as if she had asked herself, or Chad had found a moment surreptitiously to ask her, what after all was the use, a performance it had none the less quite handsomely remained, with the final fact about it that it was on the whole easier to keep up than to abandon."}, {"size": 649, "text": "From the point of view of presence of mind it had been very wonderful indeed, wonderful for readiness, for beautiful assurance, for the way her decision was taken on the spot, without time to confer with Chad, without time for anything. Their only conference could have been the brief instants in the boat before they confessed to recognising the spectator on the bank, for they hadn\u2019t been alone together a moment since and must have communicated all in silence. It was a part of the deep impression for Strether, and not the least of the deep interest, that they _could_ so communicate\u2014that Chad in particular could let her know he left it to her."}, {"size": 829, "text": "He habitually left things to others, as Strether was so well aware, and it in fact came over our friend in these meditations that there had been as yet no such vivid illustration of his famous knowing how to live. It was as if he had humoured her to the extent of letting her lie without correction\u2014almost as if, really, he would be coming round in the morning to set the matter, as between Strether and himself, right. Of course he couldn\u2019t quite come; it was a case in which a man was obliged to accept the woman\u2019s version, even when fantastic; if she had, with more flurry than she cared to show, elected, as the phrase was, to represent that they had left Paris that morning, and with no design but of getting back within the day\u2014if she had so sized-up, in the Woollett phrase, their necessity, she knew best her own measure."}, {"size": 677, "text": "There were things, all the same, it was impossible to blink and which made this measure an odd one\u2014the too evident fact for instance that she hadn\u2019t started out for the day dressed and hatted and shod, and even, for that matter, pink parasol\u2019d, as she had been in the boat. From what did the drop in her assurance proceed as the tension increased\u2014from what did this slightly baffled ingenuity spring but from her consciousness of not presenting, as night closed in, with not so much as a shawl to wrap her round, an appearance that matched her story?

Strether saw how she had perceived in a flash that they couldn\u2019t quite look to going back there under his nose; though, honestly, as he gouged deeper into the matter, he was somewhat surprised, as Chad likewise had perhaps been, at the uprising of this scruple."}, {"size": 614, "text": "He seemed even to divine that she had entertained it rather for Chad than for herself, and that, as the young man had lacked the chance to enlighten her, she had had to go on with it, he meanwhile mistaking her motive.

It was the quantity of make-believe involved and so vividly exemplified that most disagreed with his spiritual stomach. He moved, however, from the consideration of that quantity\u2014to say nothing of the consciousness of that organ\u2014back to the other feature of the show, the deep, deep truth of the intimacy revealed. That was what, in his vain vigil, he oftenest reverted to: intimacy, at such a point, was _like_ that\u2014and what in the world else would one have wished it to be like?"}, {"size": 652, "text": "It was all very well for him to feel the pity of its being so much like lying; he almost blushed, in the dark, for the way he had dressed the possibility in vagueness, as a little girl might have dressed her doll.

He then knew he had been thinking of some early sign from Chad as more likely, after all, than not; and this would be precisely the early sign. He took it so for granted that he opened the _petit bleu_ just where he had stopped, in the pleasant cool draught of the _porte-coch\u00e8re_\u2014only curious to see where the young man would, at such a juncture, break out."}, {"size": 684, "text": "His curiosity, however, was more than gratified; the small missive, whose gummed edge he had detached without attention to the address, not being from the young man at all, but from the person whom the case gave him on the spot as still more worth while. Worth while or not, he went round to the nearest telegraph-office, the big one on the Boulevard, with a directness that almost confessed to a fear of the danger of delay. He might have been thinking that if he didn\u2019t go before he could think he wouldn\u2019t perhaps go at all.

She had asked him if he could do her the very great kindness of coming to see her that evening at half-past nine, and he answered, as if nothing were easier, that he would present himself at the hour she named. She had added a line of postscript, to the effect that she would come to him elsewhere and at his own hour if he preferred; but he took no notice of this, feeling that if he saw her at all half the value of it would be in seeing her where he had already seen her best."}, {"size": 753, "text": "He mightn\u2019t see her at all; that was one of the reflexions he made after writing and before he dropped his closed card into the box; he mightn\u2019t see any one at all any more at all; he might make an end as well now as ever, leaving things as they were, since he was doubtless not to leave them better, and taking his way home so far as should appear that a home remained to him. This alternative was for a few minutes so sharp that if he at last did deposit his missive it was perhaps because the pressure of the place had an effect.

After he had put in his paper he had ranged himself, he was really amused to think, on the side of the fierce, the sinister, the acute. He was carrying on a correspondence, across the great city, quite in the key of the _Postes et T\u00e9l\u00e9graphes_ in general; and it was fairly as if the acceptance of that fact had come from something in his state that sorted with the occupation of his neighbours."}, {"size": 701, "text": "He was mixed up with the typical tale of Paris, and so were they, poor things\u2014how could they all together help being? They were no worse than he, in short, and he no worse than they\u2014if, queerly enough, no better; and at all events he had settled his hash, so that he went out to begin, from that moment, his day of waiting. The great settlement was, as he felt, in his preference for seeing his correspondent in her own best conditions. _That_ was part of the typical tale, the part most significant in respect to himself. He liked the place she lived in, the picture that each time squared itself, large and high and clear, around her: every occasion of seeing it was a pleasure of a different shade."}, {"size": 600, "text": "Yet what precisely was he doing with shades of pleasure now, and why hadn\u2019t he properly and logically compelled her to commit herself to whatever of disadvantage and penalty the situation might throw up? He might have proposed, as for Sarah Pocock, the cold hospitality of his own _salon de lecture_, in which the chill of Sarah\u2019s visit seemed still to abide and shades of pleasure were dim; he might have suggested a stone bench in the dusty Tuileries or a penny chair at the back part of the Champs Elys\u00e9es. These things would have been a trifle stern, and sternness alone now wouldn\u2019t be sinister."}, {"size": 631, "text": "An instinct in him cast about for some form of discipline in which they might meet\u2014some awkwardness they would suffer from, some danger, or at least some grave inconvenience, they would incur.

He reverted in thought to his old tradition, the one he had been brought up on and which even so many years of life had but little worn away; the notion that the state of the wrongdoer, or at least this person\u2019s happiness, presented some special difficulty. What struck him now rather was the ease of it\u2014for nothing in truth appeared easier."}, {"size": 637, "text": "It was an ease he himself fairly tasted of for the rest of the day; giving himself quite up; not so much as trying to dress it out, in any particular whatever, as a difficulty; not after all going to see Maria\u2014which would have been in a manner a result of such dressing; only idling, lounging, smoking, sitting in the shade, drinking lemonade and consuming ices. The day had turned to heat and eventual thunder, and he now and again went back to his hotel to find that Chad hadn\u2019t been there. He hadn\u2019t yet struck himself, since leaving Woollett, so much as a loafer, though there had been times when he believed himself touching bottom."}, {"size": 740, "text": "This was a deeper depth than any, and with no foresight, scarcely with a care, as to what he should bring up. He almost wondered if he didn\u2019t _look_ demoralised and disreputable; he had the fanciful vision, as he sat and smoked, of some accidental, some motived, return of the Pococks, who would be passing along the Boulevard and would catch this view of him. They would have distinctly, on his appearance, every ground for scandal. But fate failed to administer even that sternness; the Pococks never passed and Chad made no sign. Strether meanwhile continued to hold off from Miss Gostrey, keeping her till to-morrow; so that by evening his irresponsibility, his impunity, his luxury, had become\u2014there was no other word for them\u2014immense."}, {"size": 790, "text": "Between nine and ten, at last, in the high clear picture\u2014he was moving in these days, as in a gallery, from clever canvas to clever canvas\u2014he drew a long breath: it was so presented to him from the first that the spell of his luxury wouldn\u2019t be broken. He wouldn\u2019t have, that is, to become responsible\u2014this was admirably in the air: she had sent for him precisely to let him feel it, so that he might go on with the comfort (comfort already established, hadn\u2019t it been?) of regarding his ordeal, the ordeal of the weeks of Sarah\u2019s stay and of their climax, as safely traversed and left behind him. Didn\u2019t she just wish to assure him that _she_ now took it all and so kept it; that he was absolutely not to worry any more, was only to rest on his laurels and continue generously to help her?"}, {"size": 769, "text": "The light in her beautiful formal room was dim, though it would do, as everything would always do; the hot night had kept out lamps, but there was a pair of clusters of candles that glimmered over the chimney-piece like the tall tapers of an altar. The windows were all open, their redundant hangings swaying a little, and he heard once more, from the empty court, the small plash of the fountain. From beyond this, and as from a great distance\u2014beyond the court, beyond the _corps de logis_ forming the front\u2014came, as if excited and exciting, the vague voice of Paris. Strether had all along been subject to sudden gusts of fancy in connexion with such matters as these\u2014odd starts of the historic sense, suppositions and divinations with no warrant but their intensity."}, {"size": 786, "text": "Thus and so, on the eve of the great recorded dates, the days and nights of revolution, the sounds had come in, the omens, the beginnings broken out. They were the smell of revolution, the smell of the public temper\u2014or perhaps simply the smell of blood. It was at present queer beyond words, \u201csubtle,\u201d he would have risked saying, that such suggestions should keep crossing the scene; but it was doubtless the effect of the thunder in the air, which had hung about all day without release. His hostess was dressed as for thunderous times, and it fell in with the kind of imagination we have just attributed to him that she should be in simplest coolest white, of a character so old-fashioned, if he were not mistaken, that Madame Roland must on the scaffold have worn something like it."}, {"size": 873, "text": "This effect was enhanced by a small black fichu or scarf, of crape or gauze, disposed quaintly round her bosom and now completing as by a mystic touch the pathetic, the noble analogy. Poor Strether in fact scarce knew what analogy was evoked for him as the charming woman, receiving him and making him, as she could do such things, at once familiarly and gravely welcome, moved over her great room with her image almost repeated in its polished floor, which had been fully bared for summer. The associations of the place, all felt again; the gleam here and there, in the subdued light, of glass and gilt and parquet, with the quietness of her own note as the centre\u2014these things were at first as delicate as if they had been ghostly, and he was sure in a moment that, whatever he should find he had come for, it wouldn\u2019t be for an impression that had previously failed him."}, {"size": 781, "text": "That conviction held him from the outset, and, seeming singularly to simplify, certified to him that the objects about would help him, would really help them both. No, he might never see them again\u2014this was only too probably the last time; and he should certainly see nothing in the least degree like them. He should soon be going to where such things were not, and it would be a small mercy for memory, for fancy, to have, in that stress, a loaf on the shelf. He knew in advance he should look back on the perception actually sharpest with him as on the view of something old, old, old, the oldest thing he had ever personally touched; and he also knew, even while he took his companion in as the feature among features, that memory and fancy couldn\u2019t help being enlisted for her."}, {"size": 603, "text": "She might intend what she would, but this was beyond anything she could intend, with things from far back\u2014tyrannies of history, facts of type, values, as the painters said, of expression\u2014all working for her and giving her the supreme chance, the chance of the happy, the really luxurious few, the chance, on a great occasion, to be natural and simple. She had never, with him, been more so; or if it was the perfection of art it would never\u2014and that came to the same thing\u2014be proved against her. What was truly wonderful was her way of differing so from time to time without detriment to her simplicity."}, {"size": 753, "text": "Caprices, he was sure she felt, were before anything else bad manners, and that judgement in her was by itself a thing making more for safety of intercourse than anything that in his various own past intercourses he had had to reckon on.

It gave him a mild deep person, whereas he had had on the occasion to which their interview was a direct reference a person committed to movement and surface and abounding in them; but she was in either character more remarkable for nothing than for her bridging of intervals, and this now fell in with what he understood he was to leave to her."}, {"size": 742, "text": "The only thing was that, if he was to leave it _all_ to her, why exactly had she sent for him?

Would she attempt to carry it further or would she blot it out? Would she throw over it some more or less happy colour; or would she do nothing about it at all? He perceived soon enough at least that, however reasonable she might be, she wasn\u2019t vulgarly confused, and it herewith pressed upon him that their eminent \u201clie,\u201d Chad\u2019s and hers, was simply after all such an inevitable tribute to good taste as he couldn\u2019t have wished them not to render."}, {"size": 742, "text": "Away from them, during his vigil, he had seemed to wince at the amount of comedy involved; whereas in his present posture he could only ask himself how he should enjoy any attempt from her to take the comedy back.

As she presented things the ugliness\u2014goodness knew why\u2014went out of them; none the less too that she could present them, with an art of her own, by not so much as touching them. She let the matter, at all events, lie where it was\u2014where the previous twenty-four hours had placed it; appearing merely to circle about it respectfully, tenderly, almost piously, while she took up another question."}, {"size": 615, "text": "She knew she hadn\u2019t really thrown dust in his eyes; this, the previous night, before they separated, had practically passed between them; and, as she had sent for him to see what the difference thus made for him might amount to, so he was conscious at the end of five minutes that he had been tried and tested. She had settled with Chad after he left them that she would, for her satisfaction, assure herself of this quantity, and Chad had, as usual, let her have her way. Chad was always letting people have their way when he felt that it would somehow turn his wheel for him; it somehow always did turn his wheel."}, {"size": 624, "text": "Strether felt, oddly enough, before these facts, freshly and consentingly passive; they again so rubbed it into him that the couple thus fixing his attention were intimate, that his intervention had absolutely aided and intensified their intimacy, and that in fine he must accept the consequence of that.

The effort was confessedly vain; not for such talk had she invited him; and her impatient reminder was of their having done for it all the needful on his coming to her after Sarah\u2019s flight.

She was ready with everything, but so, sufficiently, was he; that is he was at one point the more prepared of the two, inasmuch as, for all her cleverness, she couldn\u2019t produce on the spot\u2014and it was surprising\u2014an account of the motive of her note.

This retreat was at the back of the house, with a view of a scrap of old garden that had been saved from modern ravage; and though he had on more than one other occasion had his legs under its small and peculiarly polished table of hospitality, the place had never before struck him as so sacred to pleasant knowledge, to intimate charm, to antique order, to a neatness that was almost august."}, {"size": 646, "text": "To sit there was, as he had told his hostess before, to see life reflected for the time in ideally kept pewter; which was somehow becoming, improving to life, so that one\u2019s eyes were held and comforted.

Did he remember, did he remember\u2014this and that of their first days? He remembered everything, bringing up with humour even things of which she professed no recollection, things she vehemently denied; and falling back above all on the great interest of their early time, the curiosity felt by both of them as to where he would \u201ccome out.\u201d They had so assumed it was to be in some wonderful place\u2014they had thought of it as so very _much_ out."}, {"size": 630, "text": "Well, that was doubtless what it had been\u2014since he had come out just there.
