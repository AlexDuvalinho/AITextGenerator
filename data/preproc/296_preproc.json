Through some conspiracy, the hero of the story when a baby, was taken from his relatives and given into the care of a kind woman. Not knowing his name, she gave him her husband\u2019s name, Frank Fowler. She had one little daughter, Grace, and showing no partiality in the treatment of her children, Frank never suspected that she was not his sister. However, at the death of Mrs. Fowler, all this was related to Frank. The children were left alone in the world. It seemed as though they would have to go to the poorhouse but Frank could not become reconciled to that."}, {"size": 239, "text": "A kind neighbor agreed to care for Grace, so Frank decided to start out in the world to make his way.

On his return he proposed that the boys of Crawford should establish a club, to be known as the Excelsior Club of Crawford, to play among themselves, and on suitable occasions to challenge clubs belonging to other villages. This proposal was received with instant approval."}, {"size": 690, "text": "\u201cI move that Tom Pinkerton address the meeting,\u201d said one boy. \u201cSecond the motion,\u201d said another.

Tom Pinkerton, in his own estimation a personage of considerable importance, came forward in a consequential manner, and commenced as follows: \u201cMr. Chairman and boys. You all know what has brought us together. We want to start a club for playing baseball, like the big clubs they have in Brooklyn and New York.\u201d \u201cHow shall we do it?\u201d asked Henry Scott. \u201cWe must first appoint a captain of the club, who will have power to assign the members to their different positions."}, {"size": 615, "text": "Of course you will want one that understands about these matters.\u201d \u201cHe means himself,\u201d whispered Henry Scott, to his next neighbor; and here he was right. \u201cIs that all?\u201d asked Sam Pomeroy. \u201cNo; as there will be some expenses, there must be a treasurer to receive and take care of the funds, and we shall need a secretary to keep the records of the club, and write and answer challenges.\u201d \u201cBoys,\u201d said the chairman, \u201cyou have heard Tom Pinkerton\u2019s remarks.

He was of medium height for his age, strong and sturdy in build, and with a frank prepossessing countenance, and an open, cordial manner, which made him a general favorite.
