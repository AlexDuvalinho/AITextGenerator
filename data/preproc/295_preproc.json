And it would be rather worth while to own the most romantic house in Brittany. The present people are dead broke, and it\u2019s going for a song--you ought to buy it.\u201dIt was not with the least idea of living up to the character my friend Lanrivain ascribed to me (as a matter of fact, under my unsociable exterior I have always had secret yearnings for domesticity) that I took his hint one autumn afternoon and went to Kerfol."}, {"size": 605, "text": "My friend was motoring over to Quimper on business: he dropped me on the way, at a cross-road on a heath, and said: \u201cFirst turn to the right and second to the left. Then straight ahead till you see an avenue. If you meet any peasants, don\u2019t ask your way. They don\u2019t understand French, and they would pretend they did and mix you up. I\u2019ll be back for you here by sunset--and don\u2019t forget the tombs in the chapel.\u201d I followed Lanrivain\u2019s directions with the hesitation occasioned by the usual difficulty of remembering whether he had said the first turn to the right and second to the left, or the contrary."}, {"size": 764, "text": "If I had met a peasant I should certainly have asked, and probably been sent astray; but I had the desert landscape to myself, and so stumbled on the right turn and walked on across the heath till I came to an avenue. It was so unlike any other avenue I have ever seen that I instantly knew it must be THE avenue. The grey-trunked trees sprang up straight to a great height and then interwove their pale-grey branches in a long tunnel through which the autumn light fell faintly. I know most trees by name, but I haven\u2019t to this day been able to decide what those trees were. They had the tall curve of elms, the tenuity of poplars, the ashen colour of olives under a rainy sky; and they stretched ahead of me for half a mile or more without a break in their arch."}, {"size": 674, "text": "If ever I saw an avenue that unmistakably led to something, it was the avenue at Kerfol. My heart beat a little as I began to walk down it. Presently the trees ended and I came to a fortified gate in a long wall. Between me and the wall was an open space of grass, with other grey avenues radiating from it. Behind the wall were tall slate roofs mossed with silver, a chapel belfry, the top of a keep. A moat filled with wild shrubs and brambles surrounded the place; the drawbridge had been replaced by a stone arch, and the portcullis by an iron gate. I stood for a long time on the hither side of the moat, gazing about me, and letting the influence of the place sink in."}, {"size": 740, "text": "I said to myself: \u201cIf I wait long enough, the guardian will turn up and show me the tombs--\u201d and I rather hoped he wouldn\u2019t turn up too soon. I sat down on a stone and lit a cigarette. As soon as I had done it, it struck me as a puerile and portentous thing to do, with that great blind house looking down at me, and all the empty avenues converging on me. It may have been the depth of the silence that made me so conscious of my gesture. The squeak of my match sounded as loud as the scraping of a brake, and I almost fancied I heard it fall when I tossed it onto the grass. But there was more than that: a sense of irrelevance, of littleness, of childish bravado, in sitting there puffing my cigarette-smoke into the face of such a past."}, {"size": 643, "text": "I knew nothing of the history of Kerfol--I was new to Brittany, and Lanrivain had never mentioned the name to me till the day before--but one couldn\u2019t as much as glance at that pile without feeling in it a long accumulation of history. What kind of history I was not prepared to guess: perhaps only the sheer weight of many associated lives and deaths which gives a kind of majesty to all old houses. But the aspect of Kerfol suggested something more--a perspective of stern and cruel memories stretching away, like its own grey avenues, into a blur of darkness. Certainly no house had ever more completely and finally broken with the present."}, {"size": 650, "text": "As it stood there, lifting its proud roofs and gables to the sky, it might have been its own funeral monument. \u201cTombs in the chapel? The whole place is a tomb!\u201d I reflected. I hoped more and more that the guardian would not come. The details of the place, however striking, would seem trivial compared with its collective impressiveness; and I wanted only to sit there and be penetrated by the weight of its silence. \u201cIt\u2019s the very place for you!\u201d Lanrivain had said; and I was overcome by the almost blasphemous frivolity of suggesting to any living being that Kerfol was the place for him. \u201cIs it possible that any one could NOT see--?\u201d I wondered."}, {"size": 636, "text": "I did not finish the thought: what I meant was undefinable. I stood up and wandered toward the gate. I was beginning to want to know more; not to SEE more--I was by now so sure it was not a question of seeing--but to feel more: feel all the place had to communicate. \u201cBut to get in one will have to rout out the keeper,\u201d I thought reluctantly, and hesitated. Finally I crossed the bridge and tried the iron gate. It yielded, and I walked under the tunnel formed by the thickness of the chemin de ronde. At the farther end, a wooden barricade had been laid across the entrance, and beyond it I saw a court enclosed in noble architecture."}, {"size": 673, "text": "The main building faced me; and I now discovered that one half was a mere ruined front, with gaping windows through which the wild growths of the moat and the trees of the park were visible. The rest of the house was still in its robust beauty. One end abutted on the round tower, the other on the small traceried chapel, and in an angle of the building stood a graceful well-head adorned with mossy urns. A few roses grew against the walls, and on an upper window-sill I remember noticing a pot of fuchsias. My sense of the pressure of the invisible began to yield to my architectural interest. The building was so fine that I felt a desire to explore it for its own sake."}, {"size": 758, "text": "I looked about the court, wondering in which corner the guardian lodged. Then I pushed open the barrier and went in. As I did so, a little dog barred my way. He was such a remarkably beautiful little dog that for a moment he made me forget the splendid place he was defending. I was not sure of his breed at the time, but have since learned that it was Chinese, and that he was of a rare variety called the \u201cSleeve-dog.\u201d He was very small and golden brown, with large brown eyes and a ruffled throat: he looked rather like a large tawny chrysanthemum. I said to myself: \u201cThese little beasts always snap and scream, and somebody will be out in a minute.\u201d The little animal stood before me, forbidding, almost menacing: there was anger in his large brown eyes."}, {"size": 604, "text": "But he made no sound, he came no nearer. Instead, as I advanced, he gradually fell back, and I noticed that another dog, a vague rough brindled thing, had limped up. \u201cThere\u2019ll be a hubbub now,\u201d I thought; for at the same moment a third dog, a long-haired white mongrel, slipped out of a doorway and joined the others. All three stood looking at me with grave eyes; but not a sound came from them. As I advanced they continued to fall back on muffled paws, still watching me. \u201cAt a given point, they\u2019ll all charge at my ankles: it\u2019s one of the dodges that dogs who live together put up on one,\u201d I thought."}, {"size": 644, "text": "I was not much alarmed, for they were neither large nor formidable. But they let me wander about the court as I pleased, following me at a little distance--always the same distance--and always keeping their eyes on me. Presently I looked across at the ruined facade, and saw that in one of its window-frames another dog stood: a large white pointer with one brown ear. He was an old grave dog, much more experienced than the others; and he seemed to be observing me with a deeper intentness. \u201cI\u2019ll hear from HIM,\u201d I said to myself; but he stood in the empty window-frame, against the trees of the park, and continued to watch me without moving."}, {"size": 619, "text": "I looked back at him for a time, to see if the sense that he was being watched would not rouse him. Half the width of the court lay between us, and we stared at each other silently across it. But he did not stir, and at last I turned away. Behind me I found the rest of the pack, with a newcomer added: a small black greyhound with pale agate-coloured eyes. He was shivering a little, and his expression was more timid than that of the others. I noticed that he kept a little behind them. And still there was not a sound. I stood there for fully five minutes, the circle about me--waiting, as they seemed to be waiting."}, {"size": 685, "text": "At last I went up to the little golden-brown dog and stooped to pat him. As I did so, I heard myself laugh. The little dog did not start, or growl, or take his eyes from me--he simply slipped back about a yard, and then paused and continued to look at me. \u201cOh, hang it!\u201d I exclaimed aloud, and walked across the court toward the well. As I advanced, the dogs separated and slid away into different corners of the court. I examined the urns on the well, tried a locked door or two, and up and down the dumb facade; then I faced about toward the chapel. When I turned I perceived that all the dogs had disappeared except the old pointer, who still watched me from the empty window-frame."}, {"size": 686, "text": "It was rather a relief to be rid of that cloud of witnesses; and I began to look about me for a way to the back of the house. \u201cPerhaps there\u2019ll be somebody in the garden,\u201d I thought. I found a way across the moat, scrambled over a wall smothered in brambles, and got into the garden. A few lean hydrangeas and geraniums pined in the flower-beds, and the ancient house looked down on them indifferently. Its garden side was plainer and severer than the other: the long granite front, with its few windows and steep roof, looked like a fortress-prison. I walked around the farther wing, went up some disjointed steps, and entered the deep twilight of a narrow and incredibly old box-walk."}, {"size": 753, "text": "The walk was just wide enough for one person to slip through, and its branches met overhead. It was like the ghost of a box-walk, its lustrous green all turning to the shadowy greyness of the avenues. I walked on and on, the branches hitting me in the face and springing back with a dry rattle; and at length I came out on the grassy top of the chemin de ronde. I walked along it to the gate-tower, looking down into the court, which was just below me. Not a human being was in sight; and neither were the dogs. I found a flight of steps in the thickness of the wall and went down them; and when I emerged again into the court, there stood the circle of dogs, the golden-brown one a little ahead of the others, the black greyhound shivering in the rear."}, {"size": 660, "text": "\u201cOh, hang it--you uncomfortable beasts, you!\u201d I exclaimed, my voice startling me with a sudden echo. The dogs stood motionless, watching me. I knew by this time that they would not try to prevent my approaching the house, and the knowledge left me free to examine them. I had a feeling that they must be horribly cowed to be so silent and inert. Yet they did not look hungry or ill-treated. Their coats were smooth and they were not thin, except the shivering greyhound. It was more as if they had lived a long time with people who never spoke to them or looked at them: as though the silence of the place had gradually benumbed their busy inquisitive natures."}, {"size": 658, "text": "And this strange passivity, this almost human lassitude, seemed to me sadder than the misery of starved and beaten animals. I should have liked to rouse them for a minute, to coax them into a game or a scamper; but the longer I looked into their fixed and weary eyes the more preposterous the idea became. With the windows of that house looking down on us, how could I have imagined such a thing? The dogs knew better: THEY knew what the house would tolerate and what it would not. I even fancied that they knew what was passing through my mind, and pitied me for my frivolity. But even that feeling probably reached them through a thick fog of listlessness."}, {"size": 576, "text": "I had an idea that their distance from me was as nothing to my remoteness from them. In the last analysis, the impression they produced was that of having in common one memory so deep and dark that nothing that had happened since was worth either a growl or a wag. \u201cI say,\u201d I broke out abruptly, addressing myself to the dumb circle, \u201cdo you know what you look like, the whole lot of you? You look as if you\u2019d seen a ghost--that\u2019s how you look! I wonder if there IS a ghost here, and nobody but you left for it to appear to?\u201d The dogs continued to gaze at me without moving..."}, {"size": 658, "text": "It was dark when I saw Lanrivain\u2019s motor lamps at the cross-roads--and I wasn\u2019t exactly sorry to see them. I had the sense of having escaped from the loneliest place in the whole world, and of not liking loneliness--to that degree--as much as I had imagined I should. My friend had brought his solicitor back from Quimper for the night, and seated beside a fat and affable stranger I felt no inclination to talk of Kerfol... But that evening, when Lanrivain and the solicitor were closeted in the study, Madame de Lanrivain began to question me in the drawing-room. \u201cWell--are you going to buy Kerfol?\u201d she asked, tilting up her gay chin from her embroidery."}, {"size": 652, "text": "\u201cI haven\u2019t decided yet. The fact is, I couldn\u2019t get into the house,\u201d I said, as if I had simply postponed my decision, and meant to go back for another look. \u201cYou couldn\u2019t get in? Why, what happened? The family are mad to sell the place, and the old guardian has orders--\u201d \u201cVery likely. But the old guardian wasn\u2019t there.\u201d \u201cWhat a pity! He must have gone to market. But his daughter--?\u201d \u201cThere was nobody about. At least I saw no one.\u201d \u201cHow extraordinary! Literally nobody?\u201d \u201cNobody but a lot of dogs--a whole pack of them--who seemed to have the place to themselves.\u201d Madame de Lanrivain let the embroidery slip to her knee and folded her hands on it."}, {"size": 345, "text": "For several minutes she looked at me thoughtfully. \u201cA pack of dogs--you SAW them?\u201d \u201cSaw them? I saw nothing else!\u201d \u201cHow many?\u201d She dropped her voice a little. \u201cI\u2019ve always wondered--\u201d I looked at her with surprise: I had supposed the place to be familiar to her. \u201cHave you never been to Kerfol?\u201d I asked. \u201cOh, yes: often. But never on that day.\u201d"}, {"size": 604, "text": "\u201cI\u2019d quite forgotten--and so had Herve, I\u2019m sure. If we\u2019d remembered, we never should have sent you today--but then, after all, one doesn\u2019t half believe that sort of thing, does one?\u201d \u201cWhat sort of thing?\u201d I asked, involuntarily sinking my voice to the level of hers. Inwardly I was thinking: \u201cI KNEW there was something...\u201d Madame de Lanrivain cleared her throat and produced a reassuring smile. \u201cDidn\u2019t Herve tell you the story of Kerfol? An ancestor of his was mixed up in it. You know every Breton house has its ghost-story; and some of them are rather unpleasant.\u201d \u201cYes--but those dogs?\u201d I insisted."}, {"size": 404, "text": "\u201cWell, those dogs are the ghosts of Kerfol. At least, the peasants say there\u2019s one day in the year when a lot of dogs appear there; and that day the keeper and his daughter go off to Morlaix and get drunk. The women in Brittany drink dreadfully.\u201d She stooped to match a silk; then she lifted her charming inquisitive Parisian face: \u201cDid you REALLY see a lot of dogs? There isn\u2019t one at Kerfol,\u201d she said."}, {"size": 814, "text": "Lanrivain, the next day, hunted out a shabby calf volume from the back of an upper shelf of his library. \u201cYes--here it is. What does it call itself? A History of the Assizes of the Duchy of Brittany. Quimper, 1702. The book was written about a hundred years later than the Kerfol affair; but I believe the account is transcribed pretty literally from the judicial records. Anyhow, it\u2019s queer reading. And there\u2019s a Herve de Lanrivain mixed up in it--not exactly MY style, as you\u2019ll see. But then he\u2019s only a collateral. Here, take the book up to bed with you. I don\u2019t exactly remember the details; but after you\u2019ve read it I\u2019ll bet anything you\u2019ll leave your light burning all night!\u201d I left my light burning all night, as he had predicted; but it was chiefly because, till near dawn, I was absorbed in my reading."}, {"size": 727, "text": "The account of the trial of Anne de Cornault, wife of the lord of Kerfol, was long and closely printed. It was, as my friend had said, probably an almost literal transcription of what took place in the court-room; and the trial lasted nearly a month. Besides, the type of the book was detestable... At first I thought of translating the old record literally. But it is full of wearisome repetitions, and the main lines of the story are forever straying off into side issues. So I have tried to disentangle it, and give it here in a simpler form. At times, however, I have reverted to the text because no other words could have conveyed so exactly the sense of what I felt at Kerfol; and nowhere have I added anything of my own."}, {"size": 733, "text": "It was in the year 16-- that Yves de Cornault, lord of the domain of Kerfol, went to the pardon of Locronan to perform his religious duties. He was a rich and powerful noble, then in his sixty-second year, but hale and sturdy, a great horseman and hunter and a pious man. So all his neighbours attested. In appearance he seems to have been short and broad, with a swarthy face, legs slightly bowed from the saddle, a hanging nose and broad hands with black hairs on them. He had married young and lost his wife and son soon after, and since then had lived alone at Kerfol. Twice a year he went to Morlaix, where he had a handsome house by the river, and spent a week or ten days there; and occasionally he rode to Rennes on business."}, {"size": 793, "text": "Witnesses were found to declare that during these absences he led a life different from the one he was known to lead at Kerfol, where he busied himself with his estate, attended mass daily, and found his only amusement in hunting the wild boar and water-fowl. But these rumours are not particularly relevant, and it is certain that among people of his own class in the neighbourhood he passed for a stern and even austere man, observant of his religious obligations, and keeping strictly to himself. There was no talk of any familiarity with the women on his estate, though at that time the nobility were very free with their peasants. Some people said he had never looked at a woman since his wife\u2019s death; but such things are hard to prove, and the evidence on this point was not worth much."}, {"size": 718, "text": "Well, in his sixty-second year, Yves de Cornault went to the pardon at Locronan, and saw there a young lady of Douarnenez, who had ridden over pillion behind her father to do her duty to the saint. Her name was Anne de Barrigan, and she came of good old Breton stock, but much less great and powerful than that of Yves de Cornault; and her father had squandered his fortune at cards, and lived almost like a peasant in his little granite manor on the moors... I have said I would add nothing of my own to this bald statement of a strange case; but I must interrupt myself here to describe the young lady who rode up to the lych-gate of Locronan at the very moment when the Baron de Cornault was also dismounting there."}, {"size": 615, "text": "I take my description from a rather rare thing: a faded drawing in red crayon, sober and truthful enough to be by a late pupil of the Clouets, which hangs in Lanrivain\u2019s study, and is said to be a portrait of Anne de Barrigan. It is unsigned and has no mark of identity but the initials A. B., and the date 16--, the year after her marriage. It represents a young woman with a small oval face, almost pointed, yet wide enough for a full mouth with a tender depression at the corners. The nose is small, and the eyebrows are set rather high, far apart, and as lightly pencilled as the eyebrows in a Chinese painting."}, {"size": 848, "text": "The forehead is high and serious, and the hair, which one feels to be fine and thick and fair, drawn off it and lying close like a cap. The eyes are neither large nor small, hazel probably, with a look at once shy and steady. A pair of beautiful long hands are crossed below the lady\u2019s breast... The chaplain of Kerfol, and other witnesses, averred that when the Baron came back from Locronan he jumped from his horse, ordered another to be instantly saddled, called to a young page come with him, and rode away that same evening to the south. His steward followed the next morning with coffers laden on a pair of pack mules. The following week Yves de Cornault rode back to Kerfol, sent for his vassals and tenants, and told them he was to be married at All Saints to Anne de Barrigan of Douarnenez. And on All Saints\u2019 Day the marriage took place."}, {"size": 835, "text": "As to the next few years, the evidence on both sides seems to show that they passed happily for the couple. No one was found to say that Yves de Cornault had been unkind to his wife, and it was plain to all that he was content with his bargain. Indeed, it was admitted by the chaplain and other witnesses for the prosecution that the young lady had a softening influence on her husband, and that he became less exacting with his tenants, less harsh to peasants and dependents, and less subject to the fits of gloomy silence which had darkened his widow-hood. As to his wife, the only grievance her champions could call up in her behalf was that Kerfol was a lonely place, and that when her husband was away on business at Rennes or Morlaix--whither she was never taken--she was not allowed so much as to walk in the park unaccompanied."}, {"size": 711, "text": "But no one asserted that she was unhappy, though one servant-woman said she had surprised her crying, and had heard her say that she was a woman accursed to have no child, and nothing in life to call her own. But that was a natural enough feeling in a wife attached to her husband; and certainly it must have been a great grief to Yves de Cornault that she gave him no son. Yet he never made her feel her childlessness as a reproach--she herself admits this in her evidence--but seemed to try to make her forget it by showering gifts and favours on her. Rich though he was, he had never been open-handed; but nothing was too fine for his wife, in the way of silks or gems or linen, or whatever else she fancied."}, {"size": 752, "text": "Every wandering merchant was welcome at Kerfol, and when the master was called away he never came back without bringing his wife a handsome present--something curious and particular--from Morlaix or Rennes or Quimper. One of the waiting-women gave, in cross-examination, an interesting list of one year\u2019s gifts, which I copy. From Morlaix, a carved ivory junk, with Chinamen at the oars, that a strange sailor had brought back as a votive offering for Notre Dame de la Clarte, above Ploumanac\u2019h; from Quimper, an embroidered gown, worked by the nuns of the Assumption; from Rennes, a silver rose that opened and showed an amber Virgin with a crown of garnets; from Morlaix, again, a length of Damascus velvet shot with gold, bought of a Jew from Syria;"}, {"size": 827, "text": "and for Michaelmas that same year, from Rennes, a necklet or bracelet of round stones--emeralds and pearls and rubies--strung like beads on a gold wire. This was the present that pleased the lady best, the woman said. Later on, as it happened, it was produced at the trial, and appears to have struck the Judges and the public as a curious and valuable jewel. The very same winter, the Baron absented himself again, this time as far as Bordeaux, and on his return he brought his wife something even odder and prettier than the bracelet. It was a winter evening when he rode up to Kerfol and, walking into the hall, found her sitting listlessly by the fire, her chin on her hand, looking into the fire. He carried a velvet box in his hand and, setting it down on the hearth, lifted the lid and let out a little golden-brown dog."}, {"size": 782, "text": "Anne de Cornault exclaimed with pleasure as the little creature bounded toward her. \u201cOh, it looks like a bird or a butterfly!\u201d she cried as she picked it up; and the dog put its paws on her shoulders and looked at her with eyes \u201clike a Christian\u2019s.\u201d After that she would never have it out of her sight, and petted and talked to it as if it had been a child--as indeed it was the nearest thing to a child she was to know. Yves de Cornault was much pleased with his purchase. The dog had been brought to him by a sailor from an East India merchantman, and the sailor had bought it of a pilgrim in a bazaar at Jaffa, who had stolen it from a nobleman\u2019s wife in China: a perfectly permissible thing to do, since the pilgrim was a Christian and the nobleman a heathen doomed to hellfire."}, {"size": 308, "text": "Yves de Cornault had paid a long price for the dog, for they were beginning to be in demand at the French court, and the sailor knew he had got hold of a good thing; but Anne\u2019s pleasure was so great that, to see her laugh and play with the little animal, her husband would doubtless have given twice the sum."}, {"size": 698, "text": "So far, all the evidence is at one, and the narrative plain sailing; but now the steering becomes difficult. I will try to keep as nearly as possible to Anne\u2019s own statements; though toward the end, poor thing...Well, to go back. The very year after the little brown dog was brought to Kerfol, Yves de Cornault, one winter night, was found dead at the head of a narrow flight of stairs leading down from his wife\u2019s rooms to a door opening on the court. It was his wife who found him and gave the alarm, so distracted, poor wretch, with fear and horror--for his blood was all over her--that at first the roused household could not make out what she was saying, and thought she had gone suddenly mad."}, {"size": 898, "text": "But there, sure enough, at the top of the stairs lay her husband, stone dead, and head foremost, the blood from his wounds dripping down to the steps below him. He had been dreadfully scratched and gashed about the face and throat, as if with a dull weapon; and one of his legs had a deep tear in it which had cut an artery, and probably caused his death. But how did he come there, and who had murdered him? His wife declared that she had been asleep in her bed, and hearing his cry had rushed out to find him lying on the stairs; but this was immediately questioned. In the first place, it was proved that from her room she could not have heard the struggle on the stairs, owing to the thickness of the walls and the length of the intervening passage; then it was evident that she had not been in bed and asleep, since she was dressed when she roused the house, and her bed had not been slept in."}, {"size": 779, "text": "Moreover, the door at the bottom of the stairs was ajar, and the key in the lock; and it was noticed by the chaplain (an observant man) that the dress she wore was stained with blood about the knees, and that there were traces of small blood-stained hands low down on the staircase walls, so that it was conjectured that she had really been at the postern-door when her husband fell and, feeling her way up to him in the darkness on her hands and knees, had been stained by his blood dripping down on her. Of course it was argued on the other side that the blood-marks on her dress might have been caused by her kneeling down by her husband when she rushed out of her room; but there was the open door below, and the fact that the fingermarks in the staircase all pointed upward."}, {"size": 750, "text": "The accused held to her statement for the first two days, in spite of its improbability; but on the third day word was brought to her that Herve de Lanrivain, a young nobleman of the neighbourhood, had been arrested for complicity in the crime. Two or three witnesses thereupon came forward to say that it was known throughout the country that Lanrivain had formerly been on good terms with the lady of Cornault; but that he had been absent from Brittany for over a year, and people had ceased to associate their names. The witnesses who made this statement were not of a very reputable sort.

One way of patching out incomplete proofs in those days was to put some sort of pressure, moral or physical, on the accused person. It is not clear what pressure was put on Anne de Cornault; but on the third day, when she was brought into court, she \u201cappeared weak and wandering,\u201d and after being encouraged to collect herself and speak the truth, on her honour and the wounds of her Blessed Redeemer, she confessed that she had in fact gone down the stairs to speak with Herve de Lanrivain (who denied everything), and had been surprised there by the sound of her husband\u2019s fall."}, {"size": 762, "text": "That was better; and the prosecution rubbed its hands with satisfaction.

This seemed to show that things had not been going well at Kerfol; though no one could be found to say that there had been any signs of open disagreement between husband and wife. Anne de Cornault, when questioned as to her reason for going down at night to open the door to Herve de Lanrivain, made an answer which must have sent a smile around the court."}, {"size": 852, "text": "She said it was because she was lonely and wanted to talk with the young man.

Anne de Cornault, further questioned, said that her married life had been extremely lonely: \u201cdesolate\u201d was the word she used. It was true that her husband seldom spoke harshly to her; but there were days when he did not speak at all. It was true that he had never struck or threatened her; but he kept her like a prisoner at Kerfol, and when he rode away to Morlaix or Quimper or Rennes he set so close a watch on her that she could not pick a flower in the garden without having a waiting-woman at her heels."}, {"size": 494, "text": "\u201cI am no Queen, to need such honours,\u201d she once said to him; and he had answered that a man who has a treasure does not leave the key in the lock when he goes out. \u201cThen take me with you,\u201d she urged; but to this he said that towns were pernicious places, and young wives better off at their own firesides. \u201cBut what did you want to say to Herve de Lanrivain?\u201d the court asked; and she answered: \u201cTo ask him to take me away.\u201d \u201cAh--you confess that you went down to him with adulterous thoughts?\u201d"}, {"size": 615, "text": "\u201cThen why did you want him to take you away?\u201d \u201cBecause I was afraid for my life.\u201d \u201cOf whom were you afraid?\u201d \u201cWhy were you afraid of your husband?\u201d \u201cBecause he had strangled my little dog.\u201d Another smile must have passed around the court-room: in days when any nobleman had a right to hang his peasants--and most of them exercised it--pinching a pet animal\u2019s wind-pipe was nothing to make a fuss about.

He asked her for a remembrance, and she had none to give him but the collar about the little dog\u2019s neck. She was sorry afterward that she had given it, but he was so unhappy at going that she had not had the courage to refuse. Her husband was away at the time.

She said nothing to her husband, then or later, and he said nothing to her; but that day he had a peasant hanged for stealing a faggot in the park, and the next day he nearly beat to death a young horse he was breaking.

It seemed to have been ill-treated by the gypsies, and clung to her plaintively when she took it from them. That evening her husband came back, and when she went to bed she found the dog strangled on her pillow. After that she said to herself that she would never have another dog; but one bitter cold evening a poor lean greyhound was found whining at the castle-gate, and she took him in and forbade the maids to speak of him to her husband.

That Yves de Cornault disliked dogs, and that his wife, to gratify her own fancy, persistently ignored this dislike.

And then, she did not know how, but the pedlar coaxed her into buying for herself an odd pear-shaped pomander with a strong scent in it--she had once seen something of the kind on a gypsy woman.

At any rate, she tried to call up her old graces; but early in the evening he complained of pains and fever, and left the hall to go up to his room.

For many years she had cherished a desire to live in the country, to have a hen-house and a garden; but this longing had faded with age, leaving only in the breast of the uncommunicative old woman a vague tenderness for plants and animals.

Mrs. Manstey\u2019s real friends were the denizens of the yards, the hyacinths, the magnolia, the green parrot, the maid who fed the cats, the doctor who studied late behind his mustard-colored curtains; and the confidant of her tenderer musings was the church-spire floating in the sunset."}, {"size": 664, "text": "One April day, as she sat in her usual place, with knitting cast aside and eyes fixed on the blue sky mottled with round clouds, a knock at the door announced the entrance of her landlady.

To-day, however, it seemed harder than usual to turn from the blue sky and the blossoming magnolia to Mrs. Sampson\u2019s unsuggestive face, and Mrs. Manstey was conscious of a distinct effort as she did so. \u201cThe magnolia is out earlier than usual this year, Mrs. Sampson,\u201d she remarked, yielding to a rare impulse, for she seldom alluded to the absorbing interest of her life."}, {"size": 759, "text": "In the first place it was a topic not likely to appeal to her visitors and, besides, she lacked the power of expression and could not have given utterance to her feelings had she wished to. \u201cThe what, Mrs. Manstey?\u201d inquired the landlady, glancing about the room as if to find there the explanation of Mrs. Manstey\u2019s statement. \u201cThe magnolia in the next yard--in Mrs. Black\u2019s yard,\u201d Mrs. Manstey repeated. \u201cIs it, indeed?

How lovely the view was that day! The blue sky with its round clouds shed a brightness over everything; the ailanthus had put on a tinge of yellow-green, the hyacinths were budding, the magnolia flowers looked more than ever like rosettes carved in alabaster. Soon the wistaria would bloom, then the horse-chestnut; but not for her.

My daughter married years ago and went away--besides, she never cared for the same things. Then my husband died and I was left alone. That was seventeen years ago.

She always filled and lit it with her own hands, keeping a kettle of kerosene on a zinc-covered shelf in a closet. As the lamp-light filled the room it assumed its usual peaceful aspect. The books and pictures and plants seemed, like their mistress, to settle themselves down for another quiet evening, and Mrs. Manstey, as was her wont, drew up her armchair to the table and began to knit."}, {"size": 829, "text": "That night she could not sleep. The weather had changed and a wild wind was abroad, blotting the stars with close-driven clouds.

These lights at last went out, and Mrs. Manstey, who had watched for their extinction, began to dress herself. She was in evident haste, for she merely flung a thin dressing-gown over her night-dress and wrapped her head in a scarf; then she opened her closet and cautiously took out the kettle of kerosene. Having slipped a bundle of wooden matches into her pocket she proceeded, with increasing precautions, to unlock her door, and a few moments later she was feeling her way down the dark staircase, led by a glimmer of gas from the lower hall."}, {"size": 744, "text": "At length she reached the bottom of the stairs and began the more difficult descent into the utter darkness of the basement. Here, however, she could move more freely, as there was less danger of being overheard; and without much delay she contrived to unlock the iron door leading into the yard.

In fact, the chief sufferer by the fire was Mrs. Manstey, who was found in the morning gasping with pneumonia, a not unnatural result, as everyone remarked, of her having hung out of an open window at her age in a dressing-gown.

The nurse called Mrs. Sampson and as the two bent over the old woman they saw her lips move. \u201cLift me up--out of bed,\u201d she whispered.

The charred timbers of the balcony lay where they had fallen. It was evident that since the fire the builders had not returned to their work. The magnolia had unfolded a few more sculptural flowers; the view was undisturbed. It was hard for Mrs. Manstey to breathe; each moment it grew more difficult.

That day the building of the extension was resumed."}, {"size": 626, "text": "As first published in Scribner\u2019s Magazine, March 1909 Hubert Granice, pacing the length of his pleasant lamp-lit library, paused to compare his watch with the clock on the chimney-piece. Three minutes to eight. In exactly three minutes Mr. Peter Ascham, of the eminent legal firm of Ascham and Pettilow, would have his punctual hand on the door-bell of the flat. It was a comfort to reflect that Ascham was so punctual--the suspense was beginning to make his host nervous. And the sound of the door-bell would be the beginning of the end--after that there\u2019d be no going back, by God--no going back! Granice resumed his pacing."}, {"size": 677, "text": "Each time he reached the end of the room opposite the door he caught his reflection in the Florentine mirror above the fine old walnut credence he had picked up at Dijon--saw himself spare, quick-moving, carefully brushed and dressed, but furrowed, gray about the temples, with a stoop which he corrected by a spasmodic straightening of the shoulders whenever a glass confronted him: a tired middle-aged man, baffled, beaten, worn out. As he summed himself up thus for the third or fourth time the door opened and he turned with a thrill of relief to greet his guest. But it was only the man-servant who entered, advancing silently over the mossy surface of the old Turkey rug."}, {"size": 728, "text": "\u201cMr. Ascham telephones, sir, to say he\u2019s unexpectedly detained and can\u2019t be here till eight-thirty.\u201d Granice made a curt gesture of annoyance. It was becoming harder and harder for him to control these reflexes. He turned on his heel, tossing to the servant over his shoulder: \u201cVery good. Put off dinner.\u201d Down his spine he felt the man\u2019s injured stare. Mr. Granice had always been so mild-spoken to his people--no doubt the odd change in his manner had already been noticed and discussed below stairs. And very likely they suspected the cause. He stood drumming on the writing-table till he heard the servant go out; then he threw himself into a chair, propping his elbows on the table and resting his chin on his locked hands."}, {"size": 720, "text": "Another half hour alone with it!

Some professional matter, no doubt--the punctilious lawyer would have allowed nothing less to interfere with a dinner engagement, more especially since Granice, in his note, had said: \u201cI shall want a little business chat afterward.\u201d But what professional matter could have come up at that unprofessional hour? Perhaps some other soul in misery had called on the lawyer; and, after all, Granice\u2019s note had given no hint of his own need! No doubt Ascham thought he merely wanted to make another change in his will. Since he had come into his little property, ten years earlier, Granice had been perpetually tinkering with his will."}, {"size": 641, "text": "Suddenly another thought pulled him up, sending a flush to his sallow temples. He remembered a word he had tossed to the lawyer some six weeks earlier, at the Century Club. \u201cYes--my play\u2019s as good as taken. I shall be calling on you soon to go over the contract. Those theatrical chaps are so slippery--I won\u2019t trust anybody but you to tie the knot for me!\u201d That, of course, was what Ascham would think he was wanted for. Granice, at the idea, broke into an audible laugh--a queer stage-laugh, like the cackle of a baffled villain in a melodrama. The absurdity, the unnaturalness of the sound abashed him, and he compressed his lips angrily."}, {"size": 671, "text": "Would he take to soliloquy next? He lowered his arms and pulled open the upper drawer of the writing-table. In the right-hand corner lay a thick manuscript, bound in paper folders, and tied with a string beneath which a letter had been slipped. Next to the manuscript was a small revolver. Granice stared a moment at these oddly associated objects; then he took the letter from under the string and slowly began to open it. He had known he should do so from the moment his hand touched the drawer. Whenever his eye fell on that letter some relentless force compelled him to re-read it.

It isn\u2019t the poetry that scares her--or me either. We both want to do all we can to help along the poetic drama--we believe the public\u2019s ready for it, and we\u2019re willing to take a big financial risk in order to be the first to give them what they want.

Yes, he had offered them everything--and always with the same result. Ten years of it--ten years of dogged work and unrelieved failure. The ten years from forty to fifty--the best ten years of his life!

It was one of the worst symptoms of his case that, in proportion as he had grown to shrink from human company, he dreaded more and more to be alone.... But why the devil was he waiting for Ascham?

He knew just where to place the muzzle: he had once got a young surgeon to show him. And as he found the spot, and lifted the revolver to it, the inevitable phenomenon occurred. The hand that held the weapon began to shake, the tremor communicated itself to his arm, his heart gave a wild leap which sent up a wave of deadly nausea to his throat, he smelt the powder, he sickened at the crash of the bullet through his skull, and a sweat of fear broke out over his forehead and ran down his quivering face..."}, {"size": 653, "text": "He laid away the revolver with an oath and, pulling out a cologne-scented handkerchief, passed it tremulously over his brow and temples.

He couldn\u2019t make himself a real life, and he couldn\u2019t get rid of the life he had. And that was why he had sent for Ascham to help him... The lawyer, over the Camembert and Burgundy, began to excuse himself for his delay. \u201cI didn\u2019t like to say anything while your man was about--but the fact is, I was sent for on a rather unusual matter--\u201d \u201cOh, it\u2019s all right,\u201d said Granice cheerfully."}, {"size": 605, "text": "He was beginning to feel the usual reaction that food and company produced.

Ashgrove was a distant connection of my wife\u2019s. And, by Jove, it IS a queer case!\u201d The servant re-entered, and Ascham snapped his lips shut. Would the gentlemen have their coffee in the dining-room? \u201cNo--serve it in the library,\u201d said Granice, rising. He led the way back to the curtained confidential room.

It had all been so simple at the time--and he had been so clever in covering up his traces! As soon as he decided on poison he looked about for an acquaintance who manufactured chemicals; and there was Jim Dawes, a Harvard classmate, in the dyeing business--just the man.

Off this work-shop was the cupboard of supplies, with its row of deadly bottles.

His old father was dead, too, the house in Stuyvesant Square had been turned into a boarding-house, and the shifting life of New York had passed its rapid sponge over every trace of their obscure little history.

On the whole, he knew no one better fitted to deal with the unexpected than Mrs. Vervain.

The latter part of that episode had been like the long walk back from a picnic, when one has to carry all the crockery one has finished using: it was the last time Thursdale ever allowed himself to be encumbered with the debris of a feast. He thus incidentally learned that the privilege of loving her is one of the least favors that a charming woman can accord; and in seeking to avoid the pitfalls of sentiment he had developed a science of evasion in which the woman of the moment became a mere implement of the game."}, {"size": 655, "text": "He owed a great deal of delicate enjoyment to the cultivation of this art. The perils from which it had been his refuge became naively harmless: was it possible that he who now took his easy way along the levels had once preferred to gasp on the raw heights of emotion?

He had never seen a better piece of work: there was no over-eagerness, no suspicious warmth, above all (and this gave her art the grace of a natural quality) there were none of those damnable implications whereby a woman, in welcoming her friend\u2019s betrothed, may keep him on pins and needles while she laps the lady in complacency."}, {"size": 721, "text": "So masterly a performance, indeed, hardly needed the offset of Miss Gaynor\u2019s door-step words--\u201cTo be so kind to me, how she must have liked you!\u201d--though he caught himself wishing it lay within the bounds of fitness to transmit them, as a final tribute, to the one woman he knew who was unfailingly certain to enjoy a good thing. It was perhaps the one drawback to his new situation that it might develop good things which it would be impossible to hand on to Margaret Vervain. The fact that he had made the mistake of underrating his friend\u2019s powers, the consciousness that his writing must have betrayed his distrust of her efficiency, seemed an added reason for turning down her street instead of going on to the club."}, {"size": 627, "text": "He would show her that he knew how to value her; he would ask her to achieve with him a feat infinitely rarer and more delicate than the one he had appeared to avoid.

The sense that she might say something rash at any moment was positively exhilarating: if she had thrown her arms about him at the station he would not have given a thought to his crumpled dignity.
