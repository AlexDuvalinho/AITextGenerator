His pale grey eyes shone and twinkled, and his usually pale face was flushed and animated. The fire burnt brightly, and the soft radiance of the incandescent lights in the lilies of silver caught the bubbles that flashed and passed in our glasses."}, {"size": 703, "text": "Our chairs, being his patents, embraced and caressed us rather than submitted to be sat upon, and there was that luxurious after-dinner atmosphere, when thought runs gracefully free of the trammels of precision.

I shall have to controvert one or two ideas that are almost universally accepted. The geometry, for instance, they taught you at school is founded on a misconception.\u201d \u201cIs not that rather a large thing to expect us to begin upon?\u201d said Filby, an argumentative person with red hair."}, {"size": 712, "text": "\u201cI do not mean to ask you to accept anything without reasonable ground for it. You will soon admit as much as I need from you. You know of course that a mathematical line, a line of thickness _nil_, has no real existence. They taught you that? Neither has a mathematical plane. These things are mere abstractions.\u201d \u201cThat is all right,\u201d said the Psychologist. \u201cNor, having only length, breadth, and thickness, can a cube have a real existence.\u201d \u201cThere I object,\u201d said Filby. \u201cOf course a solid body may exist. All real things\u2014\u201d \u201cSo most people think. But wait a moment.

But through a natural infirmity of the flesh, which I will explain to you in a moment, we incline to overlook this fact. There are really four dimensions, three which we call the three planes of Space, and a fourth, Time. There is, however, a tendency to draw an unreal distinction between the former three dimensions and the latter, because it happens that our consciousness moves intermittently in one direction along the latter from the beginning to the end of our lives.\u201d \u201cThat,\u201d said a very young man, making spasmodic efforts to relight his cigar over the lamp; \u201cthat ."}, {"size": 651, "text": ". . very clear indeed.\u201d \u201cNow, it is very remarkable that this is so extensively overlooked,\u201d continued the Time Traveller, with a slight accession of cheerfulness. \u201cReally this is what is meant by the Fourth Dimension, though some people who talk about the Fourth Dimension do not know they mean it. It is only another way of looking at Time. _There is no difference between Time and any of the three dimensions of Space except that our consciousness moves along it_. But some foolish people have got hold of the wrong side of that idea. You have all heard what they have to say about this Fourth Dimension?\u201d \u201c_I_ have not,\u201d said the Provincial Mayor."}, {"size": 819, "text": "\u201cIt is simply this. That Space, as our mathematicians have it, is spoken of as having three dimensions, which one may call Length, Breadth, and Thickness, and is always definable by reference to three planes, each at right angles to the others. But some philosophical people have been asking why _three_ dimensions particularly\u2014why not another direction at right angles to the other three?\u2014and have even tried to construct a Four-Dimensional geometry. Professor Simon Newcomb was expounding this to the New York Mathematical Society only a month or so ago. You know how on a flat surface, which has only two dimensions, we can represent a figure of a three-dimensional solid, and similarly they think that by models of three dimensions they could represent one of four\u2014if they could master the perspective of the thing."}, {"size": 688, "text": "See?\u201d \u201cI think so,\u201d murmured the Provincial Mayor; and, knitting his brows, he lapsed into an introspective state, his lips moving as one who repeats mystic words. \u201cYes, I think I see it now,\u201d he said after some time, brightening in a quite transitory manner. \u201cWell, I do not mind telling you I have been at work upon this geometry of Four Dimensions for some time. Some of my results are curious. For instance, here is a portrait of a man at eight years old, another at fifteen, another at seventeen, another at twenty-three, and so on. All these are evidently sections, as it were, Three-Dimensional representations of his Four-Dimensioned being, which is a fixed and unalterable thing."}, {"size": 804, "text": "\u201cScientific people,\u201d proceeded the Time Traveller, after the pause required for the proper assimilation of this, \u201cknow very well that Time is only a kind of Space. Here is a popular scientific diagram, a weather record. This line I trace with my finger shows the movement of the barometer. Yesterday it was so high, yesterday night it fell, then this morning it rose again, and so gently upward to here. Surely the mercury did not trace this line in any of the dimensions of Space generally recognised? But certainly it traced such a line, and that line, therefore, we must conclude, was along the Time-Dimension.\u201d \u201cBut,\u201d said the Medical Man, staring hard at a coal in the fire, \u201cif Time is really only a fourth dimension of Space, why is it, and why has it always been, regarded as something different?"}, {"size": 604, "text": "And why cannot we move in Time as we move about in the other dimensions of Space?\u201d The Time Traveller smiled. \u201cAre you so sure we can move freely in Space? Right and left we can go, backward and forward freely enough, and men always have done so. I admit we move freely in two dimensions. But how about up and down? Gravitation limits us there.\u201d \u201cNot exactly,\u201d said the Medical Man. \u201cThere are balloons.\u201d \u201cBut before the balloons, save for spasmodic jumping and the inequalities of the surface, man had no freedom of vertical movement.\u201d \u201cStill they could move a little up and down,\u201d said the Medical Man."}, {"size": 718, "text": "\u201cEasier, far easier down than up.\u201d \u201cAnd you cannot move at all in Time, you cannot get away from the present moment.\u201d \u201cMy dear sir, that is just where you are wrong. That is just where the whole world has gone wrong. We are always getting away from the present moment. Our mental existences, which are immaterial and have no dimensions, are passing along the Time-Dimension with a uniform velocity from the cradle to the grave. Just as we should travel _down_ if we began our existence fifty miles above the earth\u2019s surface.\u201d \u201cBut the great difficulty is this,\u201d interrupted the Psychologist. \u2019You _can_ move about in all directions of Space, but you cannot move about in Time.\u201d \u201cThat is the germ of my great discovery."}, {"size": 716, "text": "But you are wrong to say that we cannot move about in Time. For instance, if I am recalling an incident very vividly I go back to the instant of its occurrence: I become absent-minded, as you say. I jump back for a moment. Of course we have no means of staying back for any length of Time, any more than a savage or an animal has of staying six feet above the ground. But a civilised man is better off than the savage in this respect. He can go up against gravitation in a balloon, and why should he not hope that ultimately he may be able to stop or accelerate his drift along the Time-Dimension, or even turn about and travel the other way?\u201d \u201cOh, _this_,\u201d began Filby, \u201cis all\u2014\u201d \u201cWhy not?\u201d said the Time Traveller."}, {"size": 602, "text": "\u201cIt\u2019s against reason,\u201d said Filby. \u201cWhat reason?\u201d said the Time Traveller. \u201cYou can show black is white by argument,\u201d said Filby, \u201cbut you will never convince me.\u201d \u201cPossibly not,\u201d said the Time Traveller. \u201cBut now you begin to see the object of my investigations into the geometry of Four Dimensions. Long ago I had a vague inkling of a machine\u2014\u201d \u201cTo travel through Time!\u201d exclaimed the Very Young Man. \u201cThat shall travel indifferently in any direction of Space and Time, as the driver determines.\u201d Filby contented himself with laughter. \u201cBut I have experimental verification,\u201d said the Time Traveller."}, {"size": 813, "text": "\u201cIt would be remarkably convenient for the historian,\u201d the Psychologist suggested. \u201cOne might travel back and verify the accepted account of the Battle of Hastings, for instance!\u201d \u201cDon\u2019t you think you would attract attention?\u201d said the Medical Man. \u201cOur ancestors had no great tolerance for anachronisms.\u201d \u201cOne might get one\u2019s Greek from the very lips of Homer and Plato,\u201d the Very Young Man thought. \u201cIn which case they would certainly plough you for the Little-go.

Then, still smiling faintly, and with his hands deep in his trousers pockets, he walked slowly out of the room, and we heard his slippers shuffling down the long passage to his laboratory. The Psychologist looked at us. \u201cI wonder what he\u2019s got?\u201d \u201cSome sleight-of-hand trick or other,\u201d said the Medical Man, and Filby tried to tell us about a conjuror he had seen at Burslem, but before he had finished his preface the Time Traveller came back, and Filby\u2019s anecdote collapsed."}, {"size": 668, "text": "The thing the Time Traveller held in his hand was a glittering metallic framework, scarcely larger than a small clock, and very delicately made. There was ivory in it, and some transparent crystalline substance. And now I must be explicit, for this that follows\u2014unless his explanation is to be accepted\u2014is an absolutely unaccountable thing. He took one of the small octagonal tables that were scattered about the room, and set it in front of the fire, with two legs on the hearthrug. On this table he placed the mechanism. Then he drew up a chair, and sat down. The only other object on the table was a small shaded lamp, the bright light of which fell upon the model."}, {"size": 686, "text": "There were also perhaps a dozen candles about, two in brass candlesticks upon the mantel and several in sconces, so that the room was brilliantly illuminated. I sat in a low arm-chair nearest the fire, and I drew this forward so as to be almost between the Time Traveller and the fireplace. Filby sat behind him, looking over his shoulder. The Medical Man and the Provincial Mayor watched him in profile from the right, the Psychologist from the left. The Very Young Man stood behind the Psychologist. We were all on the alert. It appears incredible to me that any kind of trick, however subtly conceived and however adroitly done, could have been played upon us under these conditions."}, {"size": 644, "text": "The Time Traveller looked at us, and then at the mechanism. \u201cWell?\u201d said the Psychologist. \u201cThis little affair,\u201d said the Time Traveller, resting his elbows upon the table and pressing his hands together above the apparatus, \u201cis only a model. It is my plan for a machine to travel through time. You will notice that it looks singularly askew, and that there is an odd twinkling appearance about this bar, as though it was in some way unreal.\u201d He pointed to the part with his finger. \u201cAlso, here is one little white lever, and here is another.\u201d The Medical Man got up out of his chair and peered into the thing. \u201cIt\u2019s beautifully made,\u201d he said."}, {"size": 623, "text": "\u201cIt took two years to make,\u201d retorted the Time Traveller. Then, when we had all imitated the action of the Medical Man, he said: \u201cNow I want you clearly to understand that this lever, being pressed over, sends the machine gliding into the future, and this other reverses the motion. This saddle represents the seat of a time traveller. Presently I am going to press the lever, and off the machine will go. It will vanish, pass into future Time, and disappear. Have a good look at the thing. Look at the table too, and satisfy yourselves there is no trickery. I don\u2019t want to waste this model, and then be told I\u2019m a quack.\u201d"}, {"size": 792, "text": "There was a minute\u2019s pause perhaps. The Psychologist seemed about to speak to me, but changed his mind. Then the Time Traveller put forth his finger towards the lever. \u201cNo,\u201d he said suddenly. \u201cLend me your hand.\u201d And turning to the Psychologist, he took that individual\u2019s hand in his own and told him to put out his forefinger. So that it was the Psychologist himself who sent forth the model Time Machine on its interminable voyage. We all saw the lever turn. I am absolutely certain there was no trickery. There was a breath of wind, and the lamp flame jumped. One of the candles on the mantel was blown out, and the little machine suddenly swung round, became indistinct, was seen as a ghost for a second perhaps, as an eddy of faintly glittering brass and ivory; and it was gone\u2014vanished!"}, {"size": 634, "text": "Save for the lamp the table was bare. Everyone was silent for a minute. Then Filby said he was damned. The Psychologist recovered from his stupor, and suddenly looked under the table. At that the Time Traveller laughed cheerfully. \u201cWell?\u201d he said, with a reminiscence of the Psychologist. Then, getting up, he went to the tobacco jar on the mantel, and with his back to us began to fill his pipe. We stared at each other. \u201cLook here,\u201d said the Medical Man, \u201care you in earnest about this? Do you seriously believe that that machine has travelled into time?\u201d \u201cCertainly,\u201d said the Time Traveller, stooping to light a spill at the fire."}, {"size": 611, "text": "Then he turned, lighting his pipe, to look at the Psychologist\u2019s face.

It\u2019s presentation below the threshold, you know, diluted presentation.\u201d"}, {"size": 686, "text": "\u201cOf course,\u201d said the Psychologist, and reassured us. \u201cThat\u2019s a simple point of psychology. I should have thought of it. It\u2019s plain enough, and helps the paradox delightfully. We cannot see it, nor can we appreciate this machine, any more than we can the spoke of a wheel spinning, or a bullet flying through the air. If it is travelling through time fifty times or a hundred times faster than we are, if it gets through a minute while we get through a second, the impression it creates will of course be only one-fiftieth or one-hundredth of what it would make if it were not travelling in time. That\u2019s plain enough.\u201d He passed his hand through the space in which the machine had been."}, {"size": 746, "text": "\u201cYou see?\u201d he said, laughing. We sat and stared at the vacant table for a minute or so. Then the Time Traveller asked us what we thought of it all. \u201cIt sounds plausible enough tonight,\u201d said the Medical Man; \u201cbut wait until tomorrow. Wait for the common sense of the morning.\u201d \u201cWould you like to see the Time Machine itself?\u201d asked the Time Traveller. And therewith, taking the lamp in his hand, he led the way down the long, draughty corridor to his laboratory. I remember vividly the flickering light, his queer, broad head in silhouette, the dance of the shadows, how we all followed him, puzzled but incredulous, and how there in the laboratory we beheld a larger edition of the little mechanism which we had seen vanish from before our eyes."}, {"size": 699, "text": "Parts were of nickel, parts of ivory, parts had certainly been filed or sawn out of rock crystal. The thing was generally complete, but the twisted crystalline bars lay unfinished upon the bench beside some sheets of drawings, and I took one up for a better look at it.

Or is this a trick\u2014like that ghost you showed us last Christmas?\u201d \u201cUpon that machine,\u201d said the Time Traveller, holding the lamp aloft, \u201cI intend to explore time. Is that plain? I was never more serious in my life.\u201d None of us quite knew how to take it. I caught Filby\u2019s eye over the shoulder of the Medical Man, and he winked at me solemnly."}, {"size": 632, "text": "The Time Traveller ReturnsI think that at that time none of us quite believed in the Time Machine. The fact is, the Time Traveller was one of those men who are too clever to be believed: you never felt that you saw all round him; you always suspected some subtle reserve, some ingenuity in ambush, behind his lucid frankness. Had Filby shown the model and explained the matter in the Time Traveller\u2019s words, we should have shown _him_ far less scepticism. For we should have perceived his motives: a pork-butcher could understand Filby. But the Time Traveller had more than a touch of whim among his elements, and we distrusted him."}, {"size": 656, "text": "Things that would have made the fame of a less clever man seemed tricks in his hands. It is a mistake to do things too easily. The serious people who took him seriously never felt quite sure of his deportment; they were somehow aware that trusting their reputations for judgment with him was like furnishing a nursery with eggshell china. So I don\u2019t think any of us said very much about time travelling in the interval between that Thursday and the next, though its odd potentialities ran, no doubt, in most of our minds: its plausibility, that is, its practical incredibleness, the curious possibilities of anachronism and of utter confusion it suggested."}, {"size": 620, "text": "For my own part, I was particularly preoccupied with the trick of the model. That I remember discussing with the Medical Man, whom I met on Friday at the Linn\u00e6an. He said he had seen a similar thing at T\u00fcbingen, and laid considerable stress on the blowing-out of the candle. But how the trick was done he could not explain. The next Thursday I went again to Richmond\u2014I suppose I was one of the Time Traveller\u2019s most constant guests\u2014and, arriving late, found four or five men already assembled in his drawing-room. The Medical Man was standing before the fire with a sheet of paper in one hand and his watch in the other."}, {"size": 790, "text": "I looked round for the Time Traveller, and\u2014\u201cIt\u2019s half-past seven now,\u201d said the Medical Man. \u201cI suppose we\u2019d better have dinner?\u201d \u201cWhere\u2019s\u2014\u2014?\u201d said I, naming our host. \u201cYou\u2019ve just come?

He was in the midst of his exposition when the door from the corridor opened slowly and without noise. I was facing the door, and saw it first. \u201cHallo!\u201d I said. \u201cAt last!\u201d And the door opened wider, and the Time Traveller stood before us.

His face was ghastly pale; his chin had a brown cut on it\u2014a cut half-healed; his expression was haggard and drawn, as by intense suffering.

The Time Traveller did not seem to hear. \u201cDon\u2019t let me disturb you,\u201d he said, with a certain faltering articulation. \u201cI\u2019m all right.\u201d He stopped, held out his glass for more, and took it off at a draught. \u201cThat\u2019s good,\u201d he said.

I\u2019m starving for a bit of meat.\u201d He looked across at the Editor, who was a rare visitor, and hoped he was all right. The Editor began a question. \u201cTell you presently,\u201d said the Time Traveller. \u201cI\u2019m\u2014funny! Be all right in a minute.\u201d He put down his glass, and walked towards the staircase door.

By contrast with the brilliancy outside, it seemed at first impenetrably dark to me. I entered it groping, for the change from light to blackness made spots of colour swim before me.

I put out my hand and touched something soft. At once the eyes darted sideways, and something white ran past me. I turned with my heart in my mouth, and saw a queer little ape-like figure, its head held down in a peculiar manner, running across the sunlit space behind me.

Then the light burned my fingers and fell out of my hand, going out as it dropped, and when I had lit another the little monster had disappeared. \u201cI do not know how long I sat peering down that well.

Then, those large eyes, with that capacity for reflecting light, are common features of nocturnal things\u2014witness the owl and the cat.

I have no doubt they could see me in that rayless obscurity, and they did not seem to have any fear of me apart from the light.

I thought of their unfathomable distance, and the slow inevitable drift of their movements out of the unknown past into the unknown future.

Then I thought of the Great Fear that was between the two species, and for the first time, with a sudden shiver, came the clear knowledge of what the meat I had seen might be.

Then, as my vigil wore on, came a faintness in the eastward sky, like the reflection of some colourless fire, and the old moon rose, thin and peaked and white. And close behind, and overtaking it, and overflowing it, the dawn came, pale at first, and then growing pink and warm. No Morlocks had approached us. Indeed, I had seen none upon the hill that night.

I felt that I was wasting my time in the academic examination of machinery. I called to mind that it was already far advanced in the afternoon, and that I had still no weapon, no refuge, and no means of making a fire.

I had judged the strength of the lever pretty correctly, for it snapped after a minute\u2019s strain, and I rejoined her with a mace in my hand more than sufficient, I judged, for any Morlock skull I might encounter.

At the time I will confess that I thought chiefly of the _Philosophical Transactions_ and my own seventeen papers upon physical optics. \u201cThen, going up a broad staircase, we came to what may once have been a gallery of technical chemistry.

I turned to Weena. \u2018Dance,\u2019 I cried to her in her own tongue. For now I had a weapon indeed against the horrible creatures we feared. And so, in that derelict museum, upon the thick soft carpeting of dust, to Weena\u2019s huge delight, I solemnly performed a kind of composite dance, whistling _The Land of the Leal_ as cheerfully as I could.

I fancied at first that it was paraffin wax, and smashed the glass accordingly. But the odour of camphor was unmistakable.

In another place was a vast array of idols\u2014Polynesian, Mexican, Grecian, Ph\u0153nician, every country on earth, I should think.

I felt sleep coming upon me, and the Morlocks with it. \u201cWhile we hesitated, among the black bushes behind us, and dim against their blackness, I saw three crouching figures.

Looking round me again, I saw that, quite near, what I had taken to be a reddish mass of rock was moving slowly towards me. Then I saw the thing was really a monstrous crab-like creature.

To the north-eastward, the glare of snow lay under the starlight of the sable sky, and I could see an undulating crest of hillocks pinkish white.

Either the moon or the planet Mercury was passing across the sun\u2019s disk.

I felt giddy and incapable of facing the return journey.

At the risk of disappointing Richardson I stayed on, waiting for the Time Traveller; waiting for the second, perhaps still stranger story, and the specimens and photographs he would bring with him.

He may even now\u2014if I may use the phrase\u2014be wandering on some plesiosaurus-haunted Oolitic coral reef, or beside the lonely saline seas of the Triassic Age.
