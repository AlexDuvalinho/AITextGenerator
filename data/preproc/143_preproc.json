They were plainly but not ill clad, though the thick hoar of dust which had accumulated on their shoes and garments from an obviously long journey lent a disadvantageous shabbiness to their appearance just now."}, {"size": 751, "text": "The man was of fine figure, swarthy, and stern in aspect; and he showed in profile a facial angle so slightly inclined as to be almost perpendicular. He wore a short jacket of brown corduroy, newer than the remainder of his suit, which was a fustian waistcoat with white horn buttons, breeches of the same, tanned leggings, and a straw hat overlaid with black glazed canvas. At his back he carried by a looped strap a rush basket, from which protruded at one end the crutch of a hay-knife, a wimble for hay-bonds being also visible in the aperture. His measured, springless walk was the walk of the skilled countryman as distinct from the desultory shamble of the general labourer; while in the turn and plant of each foot there was, further, a dogged"}, {"size": 712, "text": "and cynical indifference personal to himself, showing its presence even in the regularly interchanging fustian folds, now in the left leg, now in the right, as he paced along. What was really peculiar, however, in this couple\u2019s progress, and would have attracted the attention of any casual observer otherwise disposed to overlook them, was the perfect silence they preserved. They walked side by side in such a way as to suggest afar off the low, easy, confidential chat of people full of reciprocity; but on closer view it could be discerned that the man was reading, or pretending to read, a ballad sheet which he kept before his eyes with some difficulty by the hand that was passed through the basket strap."}, {"size": 880, "text": "Whether this apparent cause were the real cause, or whether it were an assumed one to escape an intercourse that would have been irksome to him, nobody but himself could have said precisely; but his taciturnity was unbroken, and the woman enjoyed no society whatever from his presence. Virtually she walked the highway alone, save for the child she bore. Sometimes the man\u2019s bent elbow almost touched her shoulder, for she kept as close to his side as was possible without actual contact, but she seemed to have no idea of taking his arm, nor he of offering it; and far from exhibiting surprise at his ignoring silence she appeared to receive it as a natural thing. If any word at all were uttered by the little group, it was an occasional whisper of the woman to the child\u2014a tiny girl in short clothes and blue boots of knitted yarn\u2014and the murmured babble of the child in reply."}, {"size": 623, "text": "The chief\u2014almost the only\u2014attraction of the young woman\u2019s face was its mobility. When she looked down sideways to the girl she became pretty, and even handsome, particularly that in the action her features caught slantwise the rays of the strongly coloured sun, which made transparencies of her eyelids and nostrils and set fire on her lips. When she plodded on in the shade of the hedge, silently thinking, she had the hard, half-apathetic expression of one who deems anything possible at the hands of Time and Chance except, perhaps, fair play. The first phase was the work of Nature, the second probably of civilization."}, {"size": 736, "text": "That the man and woman were husband and wife, and the parents of the girl in arms there could be little doubt. No other than such relationship would have accounted for the atmosphere of stale familiarity which the trio carried along with them like a nimbus as they moved down the road. The wife mostly kept her eyes fixed ahead, though with little interest\u2014the scene for that matter being one that might have been matched at almost any spot in any county in England at this time of the year; a road neither straight nor crooked, neither level nor hilly, bordered by hedges, trees, and other vegetation, which had entered the blackened-green stage of colour that the doomed leaves pass through on their way to dingy, and yellow, and red."}, {"size": 757, "text": "The grassy margin of the bank, and the nearest hedgerow boughs, were powdered by the dust that had been stirred over them by hasty vehicles, the same dust as it lay on the road deadening their footfalls like a carpet; and this, with the aforesaid total absence of conversation, allowed every extraneous sound to be heard. For a long time there was none, beyond the voice of a weak bird singing a trite old evening song that might doubtless have been heard on the hill at the same hour, and with the self-same trills, quavers, and breves, at any sunset of that season for centuries untold. But as they approached the village sundry distant shouts and rattles reached their ears from some elevated spot in that direction, as yet screened from view by foliage."}, {"size": 691, "text": "When the outlying houses of Weydon-Priors could just be described, the family group was met by a turnip-hoer with his hoe on his shoulder, and his dinner-bag suspended from it. The reader promptly glanced up. \u201cAny trade doing here?\u201d he asked phlegmatically, designating the village in his van by a wave of the broadsheet. And thinking the labourer did not understand him, he added, \u201cAnything in the hay-trussing line?\u201d The turnip-hoer had already begun shaking his head. \u201cWhy, save the man, what wisdom\u2019s in him that \u2019a should come to Weydon for a job of that sort this time o\u2019 year?\u201d \u201cThen is there any house to let\u2014a little small new cottage just a builded, or such like?\u201d asked the other."}, {"size": 709, "text": "The pessimist still maintained a negative. \u201cPulling down is more the nater of Weydon.

Looking towards the village, he continued, \u201cThere is something going on here, however, is there not?\u201d \u201cAy. \u2019Tis Fair Day. Though what you hear now is little more than the clatter and scurry of getting away the money o\u2019 children and fools, for the real business is done earlier than this. I\u2019ve been working within sound o\u2019t all day, but I didn\u2019t go up\u2014not I. \u2019Twas no business of mine.\u201d"}, {"size": 756, "text": "The trusser and his family proceeded on their way, and soon entered the Fair-field, which showed standing-places and pens where many hundreds of horses and sheep had been exhibited and sold in the forenoon, but were now in great part taken away. At present, as their informant had observed, but little real business remained on hand, the chief being the sale by auction of a few inferior animals, that could not otherwise be disposed of, and had been absolutely refused by the better class of traders, who came and went early. Yet the crowd was denser now than during the morning hours, the frivolous contingent of visitors, including journeymen out for a holiday, a stray soldier or two come on furlough, village shopkeepers, and the like, having latterly"}, {"size": 838, "text": "flocked in; persons whose activities found a congenial field among the peep-shows, toy-stands, waxworks, inspired monsters, disinterested medical men who travelled for the public good, thimble-riggers, nick-nack vendors, and readers of Fate. Neither of our pedestrians had much heart for these things, and they looked around for a refreshment tent among the many which dotted the down. Two, which stood nearest to them in the ochreous haze of expiring sunlight, seemed almost equally inviting. One was formed of new, milk-hued canvas, and bore red flags on its summit; it announced \u201cGood Home-brewed Beer, Ale, and Cyder.\u201d The other was less new; a little iron stove-pipe came out of it at the back and in front appeared the placard, \u201cGood Furmity Sold Hear.\u201d The man mentally weighed the two inscriptions and inclined to the former tent."}, {"size": 760, "text": "\u201cNo\u2014no\u2014the other one,\u201d said the woman. \u201cI always like furmity; and so does Elizabeth-Jane; and so will you. It is nourishing after a long hard day.\u201d \u201cI\u2019ve never tasted it,\u201d said the man. However, he gave way to her representations, and they entered the furmity booth forthwith. A rather numerous company appeared within, seated at the long narrow tables that ran down the tent on each side. At the upper end stood a stove, containing a charcoal fire, over which hung a large three-legged crock, sufficiently polished round the rim to show that it was made of bell-metal. A haggish creature of about fifty presided, in a white apron, which as it threw an air of respectability over her as far as it extended, was made so wide as to reach nearly round her waist."}, {"size": 797, "text": "She slowly stirred the contents of the pot. The dull scrape of her large spoon was audible throughout the tent as she thus kept from burning the mixture of corn in the grain, flour, milk, raisins, currants, and what not, that composed the antiquated slop in which she dealt. Vessels holding the separate ingredients stood on a white-clothed table of boards and trestles close by. The young man and woman ordered a basin each of the mixture, steaming hot, and sat down to consume it at leisure. This was very well so far, for furmity, as the woman had said, was nourishing, and as proper a food as could be obtained within the four seas; though, to those not accustomed to it, the grains of wheat swollen as large as lemon-pips, which floated on its surface, might have a deterrent effect at first."}, {"size": 651, "text": "But there was more in that tent than met the cursory glance; and the man, with the instinct of a perverse character, scented it quickly. After a mincing attack on his bowl, he watched the hag\u2019s proceedings from the corner of his eye, and saw the game she played. He winked to her, and passed up his basin in reply to her nod; when she took a bottle from under the table, slily measured out a quantity of its contents, and tipped the same into the man\u2019s furmity. The liquor poured in was rum. The man as slily sent back money in payment. He found the concoction, thus strongly laced, much more to his satisfaction than it had been in its natural state."}, {"size": 618, "text": "His wife had observed the proceeding with much uneasiness; but he persuaded her to have hers laced also, and she agreed to a milder allowance after some misgiving. The man finished his basin, and called for another, the rum being signalled for in yet stronger proportion. The effect of it was soon apparent in his manner, and his wife but too sadly perceived that in strenuously steering off the rocks of the licensed liquor-tent she had only got into maelstrom depths here amongst the smugglers. The child began to prattle impatiently, and the wife more than once said to her husband, \u201cMichael, how about our lodging?"}, {"size": 650, "text": "You know we may have trouble in getting it if we don\u2019t go soon.\u201d But he turned a deaf ear to those bird-like chirpings. He talked loud to the company. The child\u2019s black eyes, after slow, round, ruminating gazes at the candles when they were lighted, fell together; then they opened, then shut again, and she slept. At the end of the first basin the man had risen to serenity; at the second he was jovial; at the third, argumentative, at the fourth, the qualities signified by the shape of his face, the occasional clench of his mouth, and the fiery spark of his dark eye, began to tell in his conduct; he was overbearing\u2014even brilliantly quarrelsome."}, {"size": 899, "text": "The conversation took a high turn, as it often does on such occasions. The ruin of good men by bad wives, and, more particularly, the frustration of many a promising youth\u2019s high aims and hopes and the extinction of his energies by an early imprudent marriage, was the theme. \u201cI did for myself that way thoroughly,\u201d said the trusser with a contemplative bitterness that was well-nigh resentful. \u201cI married at eighteen, like the fool that I was; and this is the consequence o\u2019t.\u201d He pointed at himself and family with a wave of the hand intended to bring out the penuriousness of the exhibition. The young woman his wife, who seemed accustomed to such remarks, acted as if she did not hear them, and continued her intermittent private words of tender trifles to the sleeping and waking child, who was just big enough to be placed for a moment on the bench beside her when she wished to ease her arms."}, {"size": 754, "text": "The man continued\u2014 \u201cI haven\u2019t more than fifteen shillings in the world, and yet I am a good experienced hand in my line.

But a fellow never knows these little things till all chance of acting upon \u2019em is past.\u201d The auctioneer selling the old horses in the field outside could be heard saying, \u201cNow this is the last lot\u2014now who\u2019ll take the last lot for a song? Shall I say forty shillings? \u2019Tis a very promising broodmare, a trifle over five years old, and nothing the matter with the hoss at all, except that she\u2019s a little holler in the back and had her left eye knocked out by the kick of another, her own sister,"}, {"size": 721, "text": "coming along the road.\u201d \u201cFor my part I don\u2019t see why men who have got wives and don\u2019t want \u2019em, shouldn\u2019t get rid of \u2019em as these gipsy fellows do their old horses,\u201d said the man in the tent. \u201cWhy shouldn\u2019t they put \u2019em up and sell \u2019em by auction to men who are in need of such articles? Hey? Why, begad, I\u2019d sell mine this minute if anybody would buy her!\u201d \u201cThere\u2019s them that would do that,\u201d some of the guests replied, looking at the woman, who was by no means ill-favoured. \u201cTrue,\u201d said a smoking gentleman, whose coat had the fine polish about the collar, elbows, seams, and shoulder-blades that long-continued friction with grimy surfaces will produce, and which is usually more desired on furniture than on clothes."}, {"size": 641, "text": "From his appearance he had possibly been in former time groom or coachman to some neighbouring county family. \u201cI\u2019ve had my breedings in as good circles, I may say, as any man,\u201d he added, \u201cand I know true cultivation, or nobody do; and I can declare she\u2019s got it\u2014in the bone, mind ye, I say\u2014as much as any female in the fair\u2014though it may want a little bringing out.\u201d Then, crossing his legs, he resumed his pipe with a nicely-adjusted gaze at a point in the air. The fuddled young husband stared for a few seconds at this unexpected praise of his wife, half in doubt of the wisdom of his own attitude towards the possessor of such qualities."}, {"size": 615, "text": "But he speedily lapsed into his former conviction, and said harshly\u2014 \u201cWell, then, now is your chance; I am open to an offer for this gem o\u2019 creation.\u201d She turned to her husband and murmured, \u201cMichael, you have talked this nonsense in public places before. A joke is a joke, but you may make it once too often, mind!\u201d \u201cI know I\u2019ve said it before; I meant it. All I want is a buyer.\u201d At the moment a swallow, one among the last of the season, which had by chance found its way through an opening into the upper part of the tent, flew to and from quick curves above their heads, causing all eyes to follow it absently."}, {"size": 651, "text": "In watching the bird till it made its escape the assembled company neglected to respond to the workman\u2019s offer, and the subject dropped. But a quarter of an hour later the man, who had gone on lacing his furmity more and more heavily, though he was either so strong-minded or such an intrepid toper that he still appeared fairly sober, recurred to the old strain, as in a musical fantasy the instrument fetches up the original theme. \u201cHere\u2014I am waiting to know about this offer of mine. The woman is no good to me. Who\u2019ll have her?\u201d The company had by this time decidedly degenerated, and the renewed inquiry was received with a laugh of appreciation."}, {"size": 624, "text": "The woman whispered; she was imploring and anxious: \u201cCome, come, it is getting dark, and this nonsense won\u2019t do.

He and his family had been weary when they arrived the night before, and they had observed but little of the place; so that he now beheld it as a new thing. It exhibited itself as the top of an open down, bounded on one extreme by a plantation, and approached by a winding road. At the bottom stood the village which lent its name to the upland and the annual fair that was held thereon.

All the gipsies and showmen who had remained on the ground lay snug within their carts and tents or wrapped in horse-cloths under them, and were silent and still as death, with the exception of an occasional snore that revealed their presence.

But first he resolved to register an oath, a greater oath than he had ever sworn before: and to do it properly he required a fit place and imagery; for there was something fetichistic in this man\u2019s beliefs.

Though the two women did not know it these external features were but the ancient defences of the town, planted as a promenade.

There were houses of brick-nogging, which derived their chief support from those adjoining. There were slate roofs patched with tiles, and tile roofs patched with slate, with occasionally a roof of thatch.

A number of people had heroically gathered in the field but by three o\u2019clock Henchard discerned that his project was doomed to end in failure."}, {"size": 674, "text": "The hams at the top of the poles dripped watered smoke in the form of a brown liquor, the pig shivered in the wind, the grain of the deal tables showed through the sticking tablecloths, for the awning allowed the rain to drift under at its will, and to enclose the sides at this hour seemed a useless undertaking. The landscape over the river disappeared; the wind played on the tent-cords in \u00c6olian improvisations, and at length rose to such a pitch that the whole erection slanted to the ground those who had taken shelter within it having to crawl out on their hands and knees.

Why don\u2019t they come?\u201d \u201cThey are at Farfrae\u2019s affair in the West Walk,\u201d answered a Councilman who stood in the field with the Mayor. \u201cA few, I suppose.

In a short time nothing was left in the field but a few hurdles, the tents, and the poles. Henchard returned to his house, had tea with his wife and daughter, and then walked out. It was now dusk. He soon saw that the tendency of all promenaders was towards a particular spot in the Walks, and eventually proceeded thither himself."}, {"size": 649, "text": "The notes of a stringed band came from the enclosure that Farfrae had erected\u2014the pavilion as he called it\u2014and when the Mayor reached it he perceived that a gigantic tent had been ingeniously constructed without poles or ropes. The densest point of the avenue of sycamores had been selected, where the boughs made a closely interlaced vault overhead; to these boughs the canvas had been hung, and a barrel roof was the result. The end towards the wind was enclosed, the other end was open. Henchard went round and saw the interior. In form it was like the nave of a cathedral with one gable removed, but the scene within was anything but devotional."}, {"size": 636, "text": "A reel or fling of some sort was in progress; and the usually sedate Farfrae was in the midst of the other dancers in the costume of a wild Highlander, flinging himself about and spinning to the tune.

Among the rest of the onlookers were Elizabeth and her mother\u2014the former thoughtful yet much interested, her eyes beaming with a longing lingering light, as if Nature had been advised by Correggio in their creation. The dancing progressed with unabated spirit, and Henchard walked and waited till his wife should be disposed to go home. He did not care to keep in the light, and when he went into the dark it was worse, for there he heard remarks of a kind which were becoming too frequent: \u201cMr. Henchard\u2019s rejoicings couldn\u2019t say good morning to this,\u201d said one. \u201cA man must be a headstrong stunpoll to think folk would go up to that bleak place to-day.\u201d"}, {"size": 806, "text": "The other answered that people said it was not only in such things as those that the Mayor was wanting. \u201cWhere would his business be if it were not for this young fellow? \u2019Twas verily Fortune sent him to Henchard.

He used to reckon his sacks by chalk strokes all in a row like garden-palings, measure his ricks by stretching with his arms, weigh his trusses by a lift, judge his hay by a chaw, and settle the price with a curse.

Surely not; and it must have been a passing impulse only which had led him to address her so softly. To solve the problem whether her appearance on the evening of the dance were such as to inspire a fleeting love at first sight, she dressed herself up exactly as she had dressed then\u2014the muslin, the spencer, the sandals, the parasol\u2014and looked in the mirror.

Nance accepted this offering thankfully at first; afterwards as a matter of course. On a day when Henchard was on the premises he saw his stepdaughter enter the hay-barn on this errand; and, as there was no clear spot on which to deposit the provisions, she at once set to work arranging two trusses of hay as a table, Mockridge meanwhile standing with her hands on her hips, easefully looking at the preparations on her behalf."}, {"size": 627, "text": "\u201cElizabeth, come here!\u201d said Henchard; and she obeyed. \u201cWhy do you lower yourself so confoundedly?\u201d he said with suppressed passion. \u201cHaven\u2019t I told you o\u2019t fifty times?

Why was this? They could not have told. Lucetta as a young girl would hardly have looked at a tradesman.

Then tell him that as I have a headache I won\u2019t detain him to-day.\u201d The message was taken down, and she heard the door close.

Henchard shut up her argument with a sharp rebuff. The season\u2019s weather seemed to favour their scheme. The time was in the years immediately before foreign competition had revolutionized the trade in grain; when still, as from the earliest ages, the wheat quotations from month to month depended entirely upon the home harvest. A bad harvest, or the prospect of one, would double the price of corn in a few weeks; and the promise of a good yield would lower it as rapidly.

The people, too, who were not farmers, the rural multitude, saw in the god of the weather a more important personage than they do now. Indeed, the feeling of the peasantry in this matter was so intense as to be almost unrealizable in these equable days. Their impulse was well-nigh to prostrate themselves in lamentation before untimely rains and tempests, which came as the Alastor of those households whose crime it was to be poor."}, {"size": 725, "text": "After midsummer they watched the weather-cocks as men waiting in antechambers watch the lackey.

He was superstitious\u2014as such head-strong natures often are\u2014and he nourished in his mind an idea bearing on the matter; an idea he shrank from disclosing even to Jopp. In a lonely hamlet a few miles from the town\u2014so lonely that what are called lonely villages were teeming by comparison\u2014there lived a man of curious repute as a forecaster or weather-prophet."}, {"size": 758, "text": "The way to his house was crooked and miry\u2014even difficult in the present unpropitious season.

The turnpike-road became a lane, the lane a cart-track, the cart-track a bridle-path, the bridle-path a foot-way, the foot-way overgrown.

He was reminded of what he had well known before, that a man might gamble upon the square green areas of fields as readily as upon those of a card-room.

His dealings had been so extensive that settlement could not long be postponed, and to settle he was obliged to sell off corn that he had bought only a few weeks before at figures higher by many shillings a quarter.

It was indeed hard that the speaker should, of all others, have to follow the triumphal chariot of this man to the Capitol. The rivalry of the masters was taken up by the men.

Henchard did not turn his eyes toward either of the pair, keeping them fixed on the bond he twisted, as if that alone absorbed him.

The gulf between them was growing wider every day. Farfrae was always considerate to his fallen acquaintance; but it was impossible that he should not, by degrees, cease to regard the ex-corn-merchant as more than one of his other workmen.

This was very singular."}, {"size": 641, "text": "She could think of nothing but that some extraordinary crime had been committed, and that the visitor, whoever he might be, was reading an account of it from a special edition of the _Casterbridge Chronicle_. At last she left the room, and descended the stairs. The dining-room door was ajar, and in the silence of the resting household the voice and the words were recognizable before she reached the lower flight. She stood transfixed. Her own words greeted her in Henchard\u2019s voice, like spirits from the grave. Lucetta leant upon the banister with her cheek against the smooth hand-rail, as if she would make a friend of it in her misery."}, {"size": 664, "text": "Rigid in this position, more and more words fell successively upon her ear. But what amazed her most was the tone of her husband. He spoke merely in the accents of a man who made a present of his time. \u201cOne word,\u201d he was saying, as the crackling of paper denoted that Henchard was unfolding yet another sheet. \u201cIs it quite fair to this young woman\u2019s memory to read at such length to a stranger what was intended for your eye alone?\u201d \u201cWell, yes,\u201d said Henchard. \u201cBy not giving her name I make it an example of all womankind, and not a scandal to one.\u201d \u201cIf I were you I would destroy them,\u201d said Farfrae, giving more thought to the letters than he had hitherto done."}, {"size": 621, "text": "\u201cAs another man\u2019s wife it would injure the woman if it were known.\u201d \u201cNo, I shall not destroy them,\u201d murmured Henchard, putting the letters away. Then he arose, and Lucetta heard no more. She went back to her bedroom in a semi-paralyzed state. For very fear she could not undress, but sat on the edge of the bed, waiting. Would Henchard let out the secret in his parting words? Her suspense was terrible. Had she confessed all to Donald in their early acquaintance he might possibly have got over it, and married her just the same\u2014unlikely as it had once seemed; but for her or any one else to tell him now would be fatal."}, {"size": 632, "text": "The door slammed; she could hear her husband bolting it. After looking round in his customary way he came leisurely up the stairs. The spark in her eyes well-nigh went out when he appeared round the bedroom door.

She could hold out no longer, and sobbed hysterically. When he had restored her Farfrae naturally enough spoke of Henchard. \u201cOf all men he was the least desirable as a visitor,\u201d he said; \u201cbut it is my belief that he\u2019s just a bit crazed."}, {"size": 659, "text": "He has been reading to me a long lot of letters relating to his past life; and I could do no less than indulge him by listening.\u201d This was sufficient.

I may tell more about her some day.\u201d Finding this, she was much perplexed as to Henchard\u2019s motives in opening the matter at all; for in such cases we attribute to an enemy a power of consistent action which we never find in ourselves or in our friends; and forget that abortive efforts from want of heart are as possible to revenge as to generosity."}, {"size": 614, "text": "Next morning Lucetta remained in bed, meditating how to parry this incipient attack. The bold stroke of telling Donald the truth, dimly conceived, was yet too bold; for she dreaded lest in doing so he, like the rest of the world, should believe that the episode was rather her fault than her misfortune. She decided to employ persuasion\u2014not with Donald but with the enemy himself. It seemed the only practicable weapon left her as a woman.

Henchard came over the top, descended and Lucetta waited breathlessly. But having reached the arena she saw a change in his bearing: he stood still at a little distance from her; she could not think why. Nor could any one else have known.

When he approached her, and before she had spoken a word, her point was half gained.

Such a woman was very small deer to hunt; he felt ashamed, lost all zest and desire to humiliate Lucetta there and then, and no longer envied Farfrae his bargain.

His path was by the river-side at the foot of the town. Coming into the light at the bridge which stood at the end of High Street he beheld lounging thereon Mother Cuxsom and Nance Mockridge. \u201cWe be just going down Mixen Lane way, to look into Peter\u2019s Finger afore creeping to bed,\u201d said Mrs. Cuxsom."}, {"size": 683, "text": "\u201cThere\u2019s a fiddle and tambourine going on there.

The lane and its surrounding thicket of thatched cottages stretched out like a spit into the moist and misty lowland. Much that was sad, much that was low, some things that were baneful, could be seen in Mixen Lane.

A brook divided the moor from the tenements, and to outward view there was no way across it\u2014no way to the houses but round about by the road.

Another was the frequency of white aprons over dingy gowns among the women around the doorways.

By a whirl Henchard brought Donald dangerously near the precipice; seeing his position the Scotchman for the first time locked himself to his adversary, and all the efforts of that infuriated Prince of Darkness\u2014as he might have been called from his appearance just now\u2014were inadequate to lift or loosen Farfrae for a time."}, {"size": 712, "text": "By an extraordinary effort he succeeded at last, though not until they had got far back again from the fatal door. In doing so Henchard contrived to turn Farfrae a complete somersault. Had Henchard\u2019s other arm been free it would have been all over with Farfrae then. But again he regained his feet, wrenching Henchard\u2019s arm considerably, and causing him sharp pain, as could be seen from the twitching of his face. He instantly delivered the younger man an annihilating turn by the left fore-hip, as it used to be expressed, and following up his advantage thrust him towards the door, never loosening his hold till Farfrae\u2019s fair head was hanging over the window-sill, and his arm dangling down outside the wall."}, {"size": 852, "text": "\u201cNow,\u201d said Henchard between his gasps, \u201cthis is the end of what you began this morning.

So thoroughly subdued was he that he remained on the sacks in a crouching attitude, unusual for a man, and for such a man.

He must have come prepared for a journey when he first arrived in the yard, unsuspecting enmity; and he must have driven off (though in a changed direction) without saying a word to any one on what had occurred between themselves.

The next morning the fact turned out to be as Elizabeth-Jane had stated; the effigy was discovered by a cowherd, and that of Lucetta a little higher up in the same stream. But as little as possible was said of the matter, and the figures were privately destroyed. Despite this natural solution of the mystery Henchard no less regarded it as an intervention that the figure should have been floating there. Elizabeth-Jane heard him say, \u201cWho is such a reprobate as I! And yet it seems that even I be in Somebody\u2019s hand!\u201d"}, {"size": 822, "text": "But the emotional conviction that he was in Somebody\u2019s hand began to die out of Henchard\u2019s breast as time slowly removed into distance the event which had given that feeling birth. The apparition of Newson haunted him. He would surely return. Yet Newson did not arrive. Lucetta had been borne along the churchyard path; Casterbridge had for the last time turned its regard upon her, before proceeding to its work as if she had never lived. But Elizabeth remained undisturbed in the belief of her relationship to Henchard, and now shared his home. Perhaps, after all, Newson was gone for ever.In due time the bereaved Farfrae had learnt the, at least, proximate cause of Lucetta\u2019s illness and death, and his first impulse was naturally enough to wreak vengeance in the name of the law upon the perpetrators of the mischief."}, {"size": 735, "text": "He resolved to wait till the funeral was over ere he moved in the matter. The time having come he reflected. Disastrous as the result had been, it was obviously in no way foreseen or intended by the thoughtless crew who arranged the motley procession. The tempting prospect of putting to the blush people who stand at the head of affairs\u2014that supreme and piquant enjoyment of those who writhe under the heel of the same\u2014had alone animated them, so far as he could see; for he knew nothing of Jopp\u2019s incitements. Other considerations were also involved. Lucetta had confessed everything to him before her death, and it was not altogether desirable to make much ado about her history, alike for her sake, for Henchard\u2019s, and for his own."}, {"size": 690, "text": "To regard the event as an untoward accident seemed, to Farfrae, truest consideration for the dead one\u2019s memory, as well as best philosophy. Henchard and himself mutually forbore to meet. For Elizabeth\u2019s sake the former had fettered his pride sufficiently to accept the small seed and root business which some of the Town Council, headed by Farfrae, had purchased to afford him a new opening. Had he been only personally concerned Henchard, without doubt, would have declined assistance even remotely brought about by the man whom he had so fiercely assailed. But the sympathy of the girl seemed necessary to his very existence; and on her account pride itself wore the garments of humility."}, {"size": 675, "text": "Here they settled themselves; and on each day of their lives Henchard anticipated her every wish with a watchfulness in which paternal regard was heightened by a burning jealous dread of rivalry. Yet that Newson would ever now return to Casterbridge to claim her as a daughter there was little reason to suppose. He was a wanderer and a stranger, almost an alien; he had not seen his daughter for several years; his affection for her could not in the nature of things be keen; other interests would probably soon obscure his recollections of her, and prevent any such renewal of inquiry into the past as would lead to a discovery that she was still a creature of the present."}, {"size": 881, "text": "To satisfy his conscience somewhat Henchard repeated to himself that the lie which had retained for him the coveted treasure had not been deliberately told to that end, but had come from him as the last defiant word of a despair which took no thought of consequences. Furthermore he pleaded within himself that no Newson could love her as he loved her, or would tend her to his life\u2019s extremity as he was prepared to do cheerfully. Thus they lived on in the shop overlooking the churchyard, and nothing occurred to mark their days during the remainder of the year. Going out but seldom, and never on a marketday, they saw Donald Farfrae only at rarest intervals, and then mostly as a transitory object in the distance of the street. Yet he was pursuing his ordinary avocations, smiling mechanically to fellow-tradesmen, and arguing with bargainers\u2014as bereaved men do after a while."}, {"size": 665, "text": "Time, \u201cin his own grey style,\u201d taught Farfrae how to estimate his experience of Lucetta\u2014all that it was, and all that it was not. There are men whose hearts insist upon a dogged fidelity to some image or cause thrown by chance into their keeping, long after their judgment has pronounced it no rarity\u2014even the reverse, indeed, and without them the band of the worthy is incomplete. But Farfrae was not of those. It was inevitable that the insight, briskness, and rapidity of his nature should take him out of the dead blank which his loss threw about him. He could not but perceive that by the death of Lucetta he had exchanged a looming misery for a simple sorrow."}, {"size": 666, "text": "After that revelation of her history, which must have come sooner or later in any circumstances, it was hard to believe that life with her would have been productive of further happiness. But as a memory, nothwithstanding such conditions, Lucetta\u2019s image still lived on with him, her weaknesses provoking only the gentlest criticism, and her sufferings attenuating wrath at her concealments to a momentary spark now and then. By the end of a year Henchard\u2019s little retail seed and grain shop, not much larger than a cupboard, had developed its trade considerably, and the stepfather and daughter enjoyed much serenity in the pleasant, sunny corner in which it stood."}, {"size": 635, "text": "The quiet bearing of one who brimmed with an inner activity characterized Elizabeth-Jane at this period. She took long walks into the country two or three times a week, mostly in the direction of Budmouth. Sometimes it occurred to him that when she sat with him in the evening after those invigorating walks she was civil rather than affectionate; and he was troubled; one more bitter regret being added to those he had already experienced at having, by his severe censorship, frozen up her precious affection when originally offered. She had her own way in everything now. In going and coming, in buying and selling, her word was law."}, {"size": 628, "text": "\u201cYou have got a new muff, Elizabeth,\u201d he said to her one day quite humbly. \u201cYes; I bought it,\u201d she said.

The fur was of a glossy brown, and, though he was no judge of such articles, he thought it seemed an unusually good one for her to possess. \u201cRather costly, I suppose, my dear, was it not?\u201d he hazarded. \u201cIt was rather above my figure,\u201d she said quietly. \u201cBut it is not showy.\u201d \u201cO no,\u201d said the netted lion, anxious not to pique her in the least. Some little time after, when the year had advanced into another spring, he paused opposite her empty bedroom in passing it."}, {"size": 877, "text": "He thought of the time when she had cleared out of his then large and handsome house in Corn Street, in consequence of his dislike and harshness, and he had looked into her chamber in just the same way. The present room was much humbler, but what struck him about it was the abundance of books lying everywhere. Their number and quality made the meagre furniture that supported them seem absurdly disproportionate. Some, indeed many, must have been recently purchased; and though he encouraged her to buy in reason, he had no notion that she indulged her innate passion so extensively in proportion to the narrowness of their income. For the first time he felt a little hurt by what he thought her extravagance, and resolved to say a word to her about it. But, before he had found the courage to speak an event happened which set his thoughts flying in quite another direction."}, {"size": 722, "text": "The busy time of the seed trade was over, and the quiet weeks that preceded the hay-season had come\u2014setting their special stamp upon Casterbridge by thronging the market with wood rakes, new waggons in yellow, green, and red, formidable scythes, and pitchforks of prong sufficient to skewer up a small family. Henchard, contrary to his wont, went out one Saturday afternoon towards the market-place from a curious feeling that he would like to pass a few minutes on the spot of his former triumphs. Farfrae, to whom he was still a comparative stranger, stood a few steps below the Corn Exchange door\u2014a usual position with him at this hour\u2014and he appeared lost in thought about something he was looking at a little way off."}, {"size": 641, "text": "Henchard\u2019s eyes followed Farfrae\u2019s, and he saw that the object of his gaze was no sample-showing farmer, but his own stepdaughter, who had just come out of a shop over the way. She, on her part, was quite unconscious of his attention, and in this was less fortunate than those young women whose very plumes, like those of Juno\u2019s bird, are set with Argus eyes whenever possible admirers are within ken. Henchard went away, thinking that perhaps there was nothing significant after all in Farfrae\u2019s look at Elizabeth-Jane at that juncture. Yet he could not forget that the Scotchman had once shown a tender interest in her, of a fleeting kind."}, {"size": 786, "text": "Thereupon promptly came to the surface that idiosyncrasy of Henchard\u2019s which had ruled his courses from the beginning and had mainly made him what he was. Instead of thinking that a union between his cherished stepdaughter and the energetic thriving Donald was a thing to be desired for her good and his own, he hated the very possibility. Time had been when such instinctive opposition would have taken shape in action. But he was not now the Henchard of former days. He schooled himself to accept her will, in this as in other matters, as absolute and unquestionable. He dreaded lest an antagonistic word should lose for him such regard as he had regained from her by his devotion, feeling that to retain this under separation was better than to incur her dislike by keeping her near."}, {"size": 756, "text": "But the mere thought of such separation fevered his spirit much, and in the evening he said, with the stillness of suspense: \u201cHave you seen Mr. Farfrae to-day, Elizabeth?\u201d Elizabeth-Jane started at the question; and it was with some confusion that she replied \u201cNo.\u201d \u201cOh\u2014that\u2019s right\u2014that\u2019s right.... It was only that I saw him in the street when we both were there.\u201d He was wondering if her embarrassment justified him in a new suspicion\u2014that the long walks which she had latterly been taking, that the new books which had so surprised him, had anything to do with the young man. She did not enlighten him, and lest silence should allow her to shape thoughts unfavourable to their present friendly relations, he diverted the discourse into another channel."}, {"size": 615, "text": "Henchard was, by original make, the last man to act stealthily, for good or for evil. But the _solicitus timor_ of his love\u2014the dependence upon Elizabeth\u2019s regard into which he had declined (or, in another sense, to which he had advanced)\u2014denaturalized him. He would often weigh and consider for hours together the meaning of such and such a deed or phrase of hers, when a blunt settling question would formerly have been his first instinct. And now, uneasy at the thought of a passion for Farfrae which should entirely displace her mild filial sympathy with himself, he observed her going and coming more narrowly."}, {"size": 647, "text": "There was nothing secret in Elizabeth-Jane\u2019s movements beyond what habitual reserve induced, and it may at once be owned on her account that she was guilty of occasional conversations with Donald when they chanced to meet.

Henchard became aware of this by going to the Ring, and, screened by its enclosure, keeping his eye upon the road till he saw them meet."}, {"size": 602, "text": "His face assumed an expression of extreme anguish. \u201cOf her, too, he means to rob me!\u201d he whispered. \u201cBut he has the right.

In the situation which their marriage would create he could see no _locus standi_ for himself at all. Farfrae would never recognize him more than superciliously; his poverty ensured that, no less than his past conduct. And so Elizabeth would grow to be a stranger to him, and the end of his life would be friendless solitude."}, {"size": 618, "text": "With such a possibility impending he could not help watchfulness. Indeed, within certain lines, he had the right to keep an eye upon her as his charge. The meetings seemed to become matters of course with them on special days of the week.

He heard the young man address her as \u201cDearest Elizabeth-Jane,\u201d and then kiss her, the girl looking quickly round to assure herself that nobody was near. When they were gone their way Henchard came out from the wall, and mournfully followed them to Casterbridge."}, {"size": 771, "text": "The chief looming trouble in this engagement had not decreased.

Thus would the girl, who was his only friend, be withdrawn from him by degrees through her husband\u2019s influence, and learn to despise him. Had she lost her heart to any other man in the world than the one he had rivalled, cursed, wrestled with for life in days before his spirit was broken, Henchard would have said, \u201cI am content.\u201d But content with the prospect as now depicted was hard to acquire."}, {"size": 704, "text": "There is an outer chamber of the brain in which thoughts unowned, unsolicited, and of noxious kind, are sometimes allowed to wander for a moment prior to being sent off whence they came.

He might possibly forsake Elizabeth-Jane, and then she would be her step-sire\u2019s own again. Henchard shuddered, and exclaimed, \u201cGod forbid such a thing! Why should I still be subject to these visitations of the devil, when I try so hard to keep him away?\u201d"}, {"size": 655, "text": "What Henchard saw thus early was, naturally enough, seen at a little later date by other people. That Mr. Farfrae \u201cwalked with that bankrupt Henchard\u2019s stepdaughter, of all women,\u201d became a common topic in the town, the simple perambulating term being used hereabout to signify a wooing; and the nineteen superior young ladies of Casterbridge, who had each looked upon herself as the only woman capable of making the merchant Councilman happy, indignantly left off going to the church Farfrae attended, left off conscious mannerisms, left off putting him in their prayers at night amongst their blood relations; in short, reverted to their normal courses."}, {"size": 830, "text": "Perhaps the only inhabitants of the town to whom this looming choice of the Scotchman\u2019s gave unmixed satisfaction were the members of the philosophic party, which included Longways, Christopher Coney, Billy Wills, Mr. Buzzford, and the like.

Mrs. Stannidge, having rolled into the large parlour one evening and said that it was a wonder such a man as Mr. Farfrae, \u201ca pillow of the town,\u201d who might have chosen one of the daughters of the professional men or private residents, should stoop so low, Coney ventured to disagree with her."}, {"size": 623, "text": "\u201cNo, ma\u2019am, no wonder at all. \u2019Tis she that\u2019s a stooping to he\u2014that\u2019s my opinion.

When all has been said about busy rumourers, a superficial and temporary thing is the interest of anybody in affairs which do not directly touch them. It would be a truer representation to say that Casterbridge (ever excepting the nineteen young ladies) looked up for a moment at the news, and withdrawing its attention, went on labouring and victualling, bringing up its children, and burying its dead, without caring a tittle for Farfrae\u2019s domestic plans."}, {"size": 628, "text": "Not a hint of the matter was thrown out to her stepfather by Elizabeth herself or by Farfrae either.

Embittered as he was against society, this moody view of himself took deeper and deeper hold of Henchard, till the daily necessity of facing mankind, and of them particularly Elizabeth-Jane, became well-nigh more than he could endure. His health declined; he became morbidly sensitive."}, {"size": 693, "text": "He wished he could escape those who did not want him, and hide his head for ever.

Whether this were a dim possibility or the reverse, the courtship\u2014which it evidently now was\u2014had an absorbing interest for him.

One day Henchard was at this spot when a masculine figure came along the road from Budmouth, and lingered. Applying his telescope to his eye Henchard expected that Farfrae\u2019s features would be disclosed as usual. But the lenses revealed that today the man was not Elizabeth-Jane\u2019s lover.

Something or other had caused her to neglect her customary walk that day. Perhaps Farfrae and she had chosen another road for variety\u2019s sake. But what did that amount to?

He need have made no inquiries beforehand, for on drawing near Farfrae\u2019s residence it was plain to the least observant that festivity prevailed within, and that Donald himself shared it, his voice being distinctly audible in the street, giving strong expression to a song of his dear native country that he loved so well as never to have revisited it."}, {"size": 682, "text": "Idlers were standing on the pavement in front; and wishing to escape the notice of these Henchard passed quickly on to the door.

That the quiet Elizabeth, who had long ago appraised life at a moderate value, and who knew in spite of her maidenhood that marriage was as a rule no dancing matter, should have had zest for this revelry surprised him still more.
