In the hope of relieving myself I regret to say that I was tempted to use your money.

These are intact. I shall send you the casket by express, knowing that you will wish to keep them out of regard for your mother\u2019s memory. In case you are reduced to the necessity of pawning or selling them, I am sure that your mother, could she be consulted, would advise you to do so.

Misfortune had come upon him, and so far as he knew he had not a friend.

If there was anything Dr. Sampson bowed down to and respected it was wealth, and Mr. Bundy, senior, was reputed to be worth a considerable fortune.

In five minutes Mr. Redwood entered the office of his employer. \u201cYou sent for me, sir?\u201d \u201cYes, Mr. Redwood; cast your eye over this letter.\u201d James Redwood read the letter, and his face showed the agitation he felt. \u201cI don\u2019t know anything about this, Mr. Goodnow,\u201d he said at last. \u201cIt ought to be inquired into.\u201d \u201cI agree with you. If my nephew is guilty I want to know it.\u201d \u201cWe will wait till the writer of this letter calls. Do you remember him?\u201d \u201cYes, sir; he was discharged for intemperance.\u201d At twelve o\u2019clock Philip Carton made his appearance, and asked to be conducted to Mr. Goodnow\u2019s private office. \u201cYou are the writer of this letter?\u201d asked the merchant."}, {"size": 768, "text": "\u201cAnd you stand by the statement it contains?\u201d \u201cWhy, at this late day, have you made a confession?\u201d \u201cBecause I wish to do justice to Rodney Ropes, who has been unjustly accused, and also because I have been meanly treated by Jasper Redwood, who has thrown me over now that he has no further use for me.\u201d \u201cAre you willing to repeat your statement before him?\u201d \u201cCall Jasper Redwood, Sherman,\u201d said the merchant, addressing himself to Sherman White, a boy recently taken into his employ. Jasper entered the office, rather surprised at the summons. When he saw his accomplice, he changed color, and looked confused. \u201cJasper,\u201d said the merchant, \u201cread this letter and tell me what you have to say in reply.\u201d Jasper ran his eye over the letter, while his color came and went."}, {"size": 611, "text": "\u201cIt\u2019s a lie,\u201d said Jasper hoarsely. \u201cDo you still insist that the articles taken from my stock were taken by Rodney Ropes?\u201d \u201cWhat do you say, Mr. Carton?\u201d \u201cNot one was taken by Rodney Ropes. Jasper and I are responsible for them all.\u201d \u201cWhat proof can you bring?\u201d \u201cMr. James Redwood will recall the purchase I made at the time of the thefts. He will recall that I always purchased of Jasper.\u201d \u201cThat is true,\u201d said Mr. Redwood in a troubled voice. \u201cDo you confess, Jasper Redwood?\u201d \u201cIf you will tell the truth, I will see that no harm comes to you. I want to clear this matter up.\u201d Jasper thought the matter over."}, {"size": 632, "text": "He saw that the game was up--and decided rapidly that confession was the best policy. \u201cVery well, sir, if I must I will do so, but that man put me up to it.\u201d \u201cYou did not need any putting up to it. I wish young Ropes were here, that I might clear him.\u201d As if in answer to the wish a bronzed and manly figure appeared at the office door. It was Rodney, but taller and more robust than when he left the store nearly a year before. \u201cRodney Ropes!\u201d ejaculated Jasper in great surprise. \u201cYes, Jasper, I came here to see you, and beg you to free me from the false charge which was brought against me when I was discharged from this store."}, {"size": 672, "text": "I didn\u2019t find you in your usual places, and was directed here.\u201d \u201cRopes,\u201d said Mr. Goodnow, \u201cyour innocence has been established. This man,\u201d indicating Philip Carton, \u201chas confessed that it was he and Jasper who stole the missing articles.\u201d \u201cI am thankful that my character has been cleared.\u201d \u201cI am ready to take you back into my employ.\u201d \u201cThank you, sir, but I have now no need of a position. I shall be glad if you will retain Jasper.\u201d \u201cYou are very generous to one who has done so much to injure you.\u201d \u201cIndirectly he put me in the way of making a fortune. If you will retain him, Mr. Goodnow, I will guarantee to make up any losses you may incur from him.\u201d \u201cHow is this?"}, {"size": 235, "text": "Are you able to make this guarantee?\u201d \u201cI am worth seventy five thousand dollars in money, besides being owner of a large mining property in Montana.\u201d \u201cThis is truly wonderful! And you have accumulated all this since you left my store?\u201d"}, {"size": 823, "text": "\u201cRodney,\u201d said Jasper, going up to his old rival, and offering his hand. \u201cI am sorry I tried to injure you. It was to save myself, but I see now how meanly I acted.\u201d \u201cThat speech has saved you,\u201d said the merchant. \u201cGo back to your work. I will give you another chance.\u201d \u201cWill you take me back also, Mr. Goodnow?\u201d asked Philip Carton. The merchant hesitated. \u201cNo, Mr. Carton,\u201d said Rodney. \u201cI will look out for you. I will send you to Montana with a letter to my partner. You can do better there than here.\u201d Tears came into the eyes of the ex-clerk. \u201cThank you,\u201d he said gratefully. \u201cI should prefer it. I will promise to turn over a new leaf; and justify your recommendation.\u201d \u201cCome to see me this evening at the Fifth Avenue Hotel, and I will arrange matters.\u201d \u201cShall you stay in the city long, Ropes?\u201d asked the merchant."}, {"size": 631, "text": "\u201cCome and dine with me on Tuesday evening.\u201d Later in the day Rodney sought out his old room mate Mike Flynn. He found Mike in a bad case. He had a bad cold, but did not dare to give up work, because he wouldn\u2019t be able to meet his bills. He was still in the employ of the District Telegraph Company. \u201cGive the company notice, Mike,\u201d said Rodney. \u201cHenceforth I will take care of you. You can look upon me as your rich uncle,\u201d he added with a smile. \u201cI will be your servant, Rodney.\u201d \u201cNot a bit of it. You will be my friend. But you must obey me implicitly. I am going to send you to school, and give you a chance to learn something."}, {"size": 633, "text": "Next week I shall return to Dr. Sampson\u2019s boarding school and you will go with me as my friend and room mate.\u201d \u201cBut, Rodney, you will be ashamed of me. I am awfully shabby.\u201d \u201cYou won\u2019t be long. You shall be as well dressed as I am.\u201d A week later the two boys reached the school. It would have been hard for any of Mike\u2019s old friends to recognize him in the handsomely dressed boy who accompanied Rodney. \u201cReally, Mike, you are quite good looking, now that you are well dressed,\u201d said Rodney. \u201cOh, go away with you, Rodney? It\u2019s fooling me you are!\u201d \u201cNot a bit of it. Now I want you to improve your time and learn as fast as you can.\u201d"}, {"size": 657, "text": "A year later Rodney left school, but he kept Mike there two years longer. There had been a great change in the telegraph boy, who was quick to learn. He expects, when he leaves school, to join Rodney in Montana. I will not attempt to estimate Rodney\u2019s present wealth, but he is already prominent in financial circles in his adopted State. Philip Carton is prospering, and is respected by his new friends, who know nothing of his earlier life. As I write, Rodney has received a letter from his old guardian, Benjamin Fielding. The letter came from Montreal. \u201cMy dear Rodney,\u201d he wrote. \u201cI have worked hard to redeem the past, and restore to you your fortune."}, {"size": 774, "text": "I have just succeeded, and send you the amount with interest. It leaves me little or nothing, but my mind is relieved. I hope you have not had to suffer severely from my criminal carelessness, and that you will live long to enjoy what rightfully belongs to you.\u201d In reply Rodney wrote: \u201cPlease draw on me for fifty thousand dollars. I do not need it, and you do. Five years from now, if you can spare the money you may send it to me. Till then use it without interest. I am worth much more than the sum my father intrusted to you for me.\u201d This offer was gratefully accepted, and Mr. Fielding is now in New York, where he is likely to experience a return of his former prosperity. As for Rodney, his trials are over. They made a man of him, and proved a blessing in disguise."}]}
