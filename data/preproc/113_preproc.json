She had a little thin face and a little thin body, thin light hair and a sour expression. Her hair was yellow, and her face was yellow because she had been born in India and had always been ill in one way or another. Her father had held a position under the English Government and had always been busy and ill himself, and her mother had been a great beauty who cared only to go to parties and amuse herself with gay people. She had not wanted a little girl at all, and when Mary was born she handed her over to the care of an Ayah, who was made to understand that if she wished to please the Mem Sahib she must keep the child out of sight as much as possible."}, {"size": 760, "text": "So when she was a sickly, fretful, ugly little baby she was kept out of the way, and when she became a sickly, fretful, toddling thing she was kept out of the way also. She never remembered seeing familiarly anything but the dark faces of her Ayah and the other native servants, and as they always obeyed her and gave her her own way in everything, because the Mem Sahib would be angry if she was disturbed by her crying, by the time she was six years old she was as tyrannical and selfish a little pig as ever lived. The young English governess who came to teach her to read and write disliked her so much that she gave up her place in three months, and when other governesses came to try to fill it they always went away in a shorter time than the first one."}, {"size": 669, "text": "So if Mary had not chosen to really want to know how to read books she would never have learned her letters at all. One frightfully hot morning, when she was about nine years old, she awakened feeling very cross, and she became crosser still when she saw that the servant who stood by her bedside was not her Ayah. \u201cWhy did you come?\u201d she said to the strange woman. \u201cI will not let you stay. Send my Ayah to me.\u201d The woman looked frightened, but she only stammered that the Ayah could not come and when Mary threw herself into a passion and beat and kicked her, she looked only more frightened and repeated that it was not possible for the Ayah to come to Missie Sahib."}, {"size": 805, "text": "There was something mysterious in the air that morning. Nothing was done in its regular order and several of the native servants seemed missing, while those whom Mary saw slunk or hurried about with ashy and scared faces. But no one would tell her anything and her Ayah did not come. She was actually left alone as the morning went on, and at last she wandered out into the garden and began to play by herself under a tree near the veranda. She pretended that she was making a flower-bed, and she stuck big scarlet hibiscus blossoms into little heaps of earth, all the time growing more and more angry and muttering to herself the things she would say and the names she would call Saidie when she returned. \u201cPig! Pig! Daughter of Pigs!\u201d she said, because to call a native a pig is the worst insult of all."}, {"size": 734, "text": "She was grinding her teeth and saying this over and over again when she heard her mother come out on the veranda with someone. She was with a fair young man and they stood talking together in low strange voices. Mary knew the fair young man who looked like a boy. She had heard that he was a very young officer who had just come from England. The child stared at him, but she stared most at her mother. She always did this when she had a chance to see her, because the Mem Sahib\u2014Mary used to call her that oftener than anything else\u2014was such a tall, slim, pretty person and wore such lovely clothes. Her hair was like curly silk and she had a delicate little nose which seemed to be disdaining things, and she had large laughing eyes."}, {"size": 737, "text": "All her clothes were thin and floating, and Mary said they were \u201cfull of lace.\u201d They looked fuller of lace than ever this morning, but her eyes were not laughing at all.

Oh, is it?\u201d Mary heard her say. \u201cAwfully,\u201d the young man answered in a trembling voice. \u201cAwfully, Mrs. Lennox. You ought to have gone to the hills two weeks ago.\u201d The Mem Sahib wrung her hands. \u201cOh, I know I ought!\u201d she cried. \u201cI only stayed to go to that silly dinner party. What a fool I was!\u201d At that very moment such a loud sound of wailing broke out from the servants\u2019 quarters that she clutched the young man\u2019s arm, and Mary stood shivering from head to foot."}, {"size": 752, "text": "The wailing grew wilder and wilder. \u201cWhat is it? What is it?\u201d Mrs. Lennox gasped. \u201cSomeone has died,\u201d answered the boy officer. \u201cYou did not say it had broken out among your servants.\u201d \u201cI did not know!\u201d the Mem Sahib cried. \u201cCome with me! Come with me!\u201d and she turned and ran into the house. After that appalling things happened, and the mysteriousness of the morning was explained to Mary. The cholera had broken out in its most fatal form and people were dying like flies. The Ayah had been taken ill in the night, and it was because she had just died that the servants had wailed in the huts. Before the next day three other servants were dead and others had run away in terror. There was panic on every side, and dying people in all the bungalows."}, {"size": 685, "text": "During the confusion and bewilderment of the second day Mary hid herself in the nursery and was forgotten by everyone. Nobody thought of her, nobody wanted her, and strange things happened of which she knew nothing. Mary alternately cried and slept through the hours. She only knew that people were ill and that she heard mysterious and frightening sounds. Once she crept into the dining-room and found it empty, though a partly finished meal was on the table and chairs and plates looked as if they had been hastily pushed back when the diners rose suddenly for some reason. The child ate some fruit and biscuits, and being thirsty she drank a glass of wine which stood nearly filled."}, {"size": 623, "text": "It was sweet, and she did not know how strong it was. Very soon it made her intensely drowsy, and she went back to her nursery and shut herself in again, frightened by cries she heard in the huts and by the hurrying sound of feet. The wine made her so sleepy that she could scarcely keep her eyes open and she lay down on her bed and knew nothing more for a long time. Many things happened during the hours in which she slept so heavily, but she was not disturbed by the wails and the sound of things being carried in and out of the bungalow. When she awakened she lay and stared at the wall. The house was perfectly still."}, {"size": 624, "text": "She had never known it to be so silent before. She heard neither voices nor footsteps, and wondered if everybody had got well of the cholera and all the trouble was over. She wondered also who would take care of her now her Ayah was dead. There would be a new Ayah, and perhaps she would know some new stories. Mary had been rather tired of the old ones. She did not cry because her nurse had died. She was not an affectionate child and had never cared much for anyone. The noise and hurrying about and wailing over the cholera had frightened her, and she had been angry because no one seemed to remember that she was alive."}, {"size": 620, "text": "Everyone was too panic-stricken to think of a little girl no one was fond of. When people had the cholera it seemed that they remembered nothing but themselves. But if everyone had got well again, surely someone would remember and come to look for her. But no one came, and as she lay waiting the house seemed to grow more and more silent. She heard something rustling on the matting and when she looked down she saw a little snake gliding along and watching her with eyes like jewels. She was not frightened, because he was a harmless little thing who would not hurt her and he seemed in a hurry to get out of the room."}, {"size": 665, "text": "He slipped under the door as she watched him. \u201cHow queer and quiet it is,\u201d she said. \u201cIt sounds as if there were no one in the bungalow but me and the snake.\u201d Almost the next minute she heard footsteps in the compound, and then on the veranda. They were men\u2019s footsteps, and the men entered the bungalow and talked in low voices. No one went to meet or speak to them and they seemed to open doors and look into rooms. \u201cWhat desolation!\u201d she heard one voice say. \u201cThat pretty, pretty woman! I suppose the child, too. I heard there was a child, though no one ever saw her.\u201d Mary was standing in the middle of the nursery when they opened the door a few minutes later."}, {"size": 656, "text": "She looked an ugly, cross little thing and was frowning because she was beginning to be hungry and feel disgracefully neglected. The first man who came in was a large officer she had once seen talking to her father. He looked tired and troubled, but when he saw her he was so startled that he almost jumped back. \u201cBarney!\u201d he cried out. \u201cThere is a child here! A child alone! In a place like this! Mercy on us, who is she!\u201d \u201cI am Mary Lennox,\u201d the little girl said, drawing herself up stiffly.

Mary even thought she saw him wink his eyes as if to wink tears away. \u201cPoor little kid!\u201d he said. \u201cThere is nobody left to come.\u201d It was in that strange and sudden way that Mary found out that she had neither father nor mother left; that they had died and been carried away in the night, and that the few native servants who had not died also had left the house as quickly as they could get out of it, none of them even remembering that there was a Missie Sahib. That was why the place was so quiet. It was true that there was no one in the bungalow but herself and the little rustling snake."}, {"size": 769, "text": "MISTRESS MARY QUITE CONTRARYMary had liked to look at her mother from a distance and she had thought her very pretty, but as she knew very little of her she could scarcely have been expected to love her or to miss her very much when she was gone.

If she had been older she would no doubt have been very anxious at being left alone in the world, but she was very young, and as she had always been taken care of, she supposed she always would be.

Mary hated their untidy bungalow and was so disagreeable to them that after the first day or two nobody would play with her. By the second day they had given her a nickname which made her furious. It was Basil who thought of it first.

The woman was his housekeeper at Misselthwaite Manor, and her name was Mrs. Medlock. She was a stout woman, with very red cheeks and sharp black eyes.

Since she had been living in other people\u2019s houses and had had no Ayah, she had begun to feel lonely and to think queer thoughts which were new to her.

That seemed a good many people to like\u2014when you were not used to liking. She thought of the robin as one of the people.
