She and Diana Barry had been picking apples in the Green Gables orchard, but were now resting from their labors in a sunny corner, where airy fleets of thistledown drifted by on the wings of a wind that was still summer-sweet with the incense of ferns in the Haunted Wood. But everything in the landscape around them spoke of autumn. The sea was roaring hollowly in the distance, the fields were bare and sere, scarfed with golden rod, the brook valley below Green Gables overflowed with asters of ethereal purple, and the Lake of Shining Waters was blue--blue--blue; not the changeful blue of spring, nor the pale azure of summer,"}, {"size": 654, "text": "but a clear, steadfast, serene blue, as if the water were past all moods and tenses of emotion and had settled down to a tranquility unbroken by fickle dreams. \u201cIt has been a nice summer,\u201d said Diana, twisting the new ring on her left hand with a smile. \u201cAnd Miss Lavendar\u2019s wedding seemed to come as a sort of crown to it. I suppose Mr. and Mrs. Irving are on the Pacific coast now.\u201d \u201cIt seems to me they have been gone long enough to go around the world,\u201d sighed Anne. \u201cI can\u2019t believe it is only a week since they were married. Everything has changed. Miss Lavendar and Mr. and Mrs. Allan gone--how lonely the manse looks with the shutters all closed!"}, {"size": 620, "text": "I went past it last night, and it made me feel as if everybody in it had died.\u201d \u201cWe\u2019ll never get another minister as nice as Mr. Allan,\u201d said Diana, with gloomy conviction. \u201cI suppose we\u2019ll have all kinds of supplies this winter, and half the Sundays no preaching at all. And you and Gilbert gone--it will be awfully dull.\u201d \u201cFred will be here,\u201d insinuated Anne slyly. \u201cWhen is Mrs. Lynde going to move up?\u201d asked Diana, as if she had not heard Anne\u2019s remark. \u201cTomorrow. I\u2019m glad she\u2019s coming--but it will be another change. Marilla and I cleared everything out of the spare room yesterday. Do you know, I hated to do it?"}, {"size": 601, "text": "Of course, it was silly--but it did seem as if we were committing sacrilege. That old spare room has always seemed like a shrine to me. When I was a child I thought it the most wonderful apartment in the world. You remember what a consuming desire I had to sleep in a spare room bed--but not the Green Gables spare room. Oh, no, never there! It would have been too terrible--I couldn\u2019t have slept a wink from awe. I never WALKED through that room when Marilla sent me in on an errand--no, indeed, I tiptoed through it and held my breath, as if I were in church, and felt relieved when I got out of it."}, {"size": 651, "text": "The pictures of George Whitefield and the Duke of Wellington hung there, one on each side of the mirror, and frowned so sternly at me all the time I was in, especially if I dared peep in the mirror, which was the only one in the house that didn\u2019t twist my face a little. I always wondered how Marilla dared houseclean that room. And now it\u2019s not only cleaned but stripped bare. George Whitefield and the Duke have been relegated to the upstairs hall. \u2018So passes the glory of this world,\u2019\u201d concluded Anne, with a laugh in which there was a little note of regret. It is never pleasant to have our old shrines desecrated, even when we have outgrown them."}, {"size": 667, "text": "\u201cI\u2019ll be so lonesome when you go,\u201d moaned Diana for the hundredth time. \u201cAnd to think you go next week!\u201d \u201cBut we\u2019re together still,\u201d said Anne cheerily. \u201cWe mustn\u2019t let next week rob us of this week\u2019s joy. I hate the thought of going myself--home and I are such good friends. Talk of being lonesome! It\u2019s I who should groan. YOU\u2019LL be here with any number of your old friends--AND Fred! While I shall be alone among strangers, not knowing a soul!\u201d \u201cEXCEPT Gilbert--AND Charlie Sloane,\u201d said Diana, imitating Anne\u2019s italics and slyness. \u201cCharlie Sloane will be a great comfort, of course,\u201d agreed Anne sarcastically; whereupon both those irresponsible damsels laughed."}, {"size": 631, "text": "Diana knew exactly what Anne thought of Charlie Sloane; but, despite sundry confidential talks, she did not know just what Anne thought of Gilbert Blythe. To be sure, Anne herself did not know that. \u201cThe boys may be boarding at the other end of Kingsport, for all I know,\u201d Anne went on. \u201cI am glad I\u2019m going to Redmond, and I am sure I shall like it after a while. But for the first few weeks I know I won\u2019t. I shan\u2019t even have the comfort of looking forward to the weekend visit home, as I had when I went to Queen\u2019s.

Do you think, Diana, that being grown-up is really as nice as we used to imagine it would be when we were children?\u201d \u201cI don\u2019t know--there are SOME nice things about it,\u201d answered Diana, again caressing her ring with that little smile which always had the effect of making Anne feel suddenly left out and inexperienced. \u201cBut there are so many puzzling things, too. Sometimes I feel as if being grown-up just frightened me--and then I would give anything to be a little girl again.\u201d \u201cI suppose we\u2019ll get used to being grownup in time,\u201d said Anne cheerfully."}, {"size": 673, "text": "\u201cThere won\u2019t be so many unexpected things about it by and by--though, after all, I fancy it\u2019s the unexpected things that give spice to life.

In no time you\u2019ll be a staid, middle-aged matron, and I shall be nice, old maid Aunt Anne, coming to visit you on vacations. You\u2019ll always keep a corner for me, won\u2019t you, Di darling? Not the spare room, of course--old maids can\u2019t aspire to spare rooms, and I shall be as \u2018umble as Uriah Heep, and quite content with a little over-the-porch or off-the-parlor cubby hole.\u201d \u201cWhat nonsense you do talk, Anne,\u201d laughed Diana."}, {"size": 614, "text": "\u201cYou\u2019ll marry somebody splendid and handsome and rich--and no spare room in Avonlea will be half gorgeous enough for you--and you\u2019ll turn up your nose at all the friends of your youth.\u201d \u201cThat would be a pity; my nose is quite nice, but I fear turning it up would spoil it,\u201d said Anne, patting that shapely organ. \u201cI haven\u2019t so many good features that I could afford to spoil those I have; so, even if I should marry the King of the Cannibal Islands, I promise you I won\u2019t turn up my nose at you, Diana.\u201d With another gay laugh the girls separated, Diana to return to Orchard Slope, Anne to walk to the Post Office."}, {"size": 627, "text": "She found a letter awaiting her there, and when Gilbert Blythe overtook her on the bridge over the Lake of Shining Waters she was sparkling with the excitement of it. \u201cPriscilla Grant is going to Redmond, too,\u201d she exclaimed. \u201cIsn\u2019t that splendid? I hoped she would, but she didn\u2019t think her father would consent. He has, however, and we\u2019re to board together. I feel that I can face an army with banners--or all the professors of Redmond in one fell phalanx--with a chum like Priscilla by my side.\u201d \u201cI think we\u2019ll like Kingsport,\u201d said Gilbert. \u201cIt\u2019s a nice old burg, they tell me, and has the finest natural park in the world."}, {"size": 659, "text": "I\u2019ve heard that the scenery in it is magnificent.\u201d \u201cI wonder if it will be--can be--any more beautiful than this,\u201d murmured Anne, looking around her with the loving, enraptured eyes of those to whom \u201chome\u201d must always be the loveliest spot in the world, no matter what fairer lands may lie under alien stars. They were leaning on the bridge of the old pond, drinking deep of the enchantment of the dusk, just at the spot where Anne had climbed from her sinking Dory on the day Elaine floated down to Camelot. The fine, empurpling dye of sunset still stained the western skies, but the moon was rising and the water lay like a great, silver dream in her light."}, {"size": 627, "text": "Remembrance wove a sweet and subtle spell over the two young creatures. \u201cYou are very quiet, Anne,\u201d said Gilbert at last. \u201cI\u2019m afraid to speak or move for fear all this wonderful beauty will vanish just like a broken silence,\u201d breathed Anne. Gilbert suddenly laid his hand over the slender white one lying on the rail of the bridge. His hazel eyes deepened into darkness, his still boyish lips opened to say something of the dream and hope that thrilled his soul. But Anne snatched her hand away and turned quickly. The spell of the dusk was broken for her. \u201cI must go home,\u201d she exclaimed, with a rather overdone carelessness."}, {"size": 891, "text": "\u201cMarilla had a headache this afternoon, and I\u2019m sure the twins will be in some dreadful mischief by this time. I really shouldn\u2019t have stayed away so long.\u201d She chattered ceaselessly and inconsequently until they reached the Green Gables lane. Poor Gilbert hardly had a chance to get a word in edgewise. Anne felt rather relieved when they parted. There had been a new, secret self-consciousness in her heart with regard to Gilbert, ever since that fleeting moment of revelation in the garden of Echo Lodge. Something alien had intruded into the old, perfect, school-day comradeship--something that threatened to mar it. \u201cI never felt glad to see Gilbert go before,\u201d she thought, half-resentfully, half-sorrowfully, as she walked alone up the lane. \u201cOur friendship will be spoiled if he goes on with this nonsense. It mustn\u2019t be spoiled--I won\u2019t let it. Oh, WHY can\u2019t boys be just sensible!\u201d"}, {"size": 741, "text": "Anne had an uneasy doubt that it was not strictly \u201csensible\u201d that she should still feel on her hand the warm pressure of Gilbert\u2019s, as distinctly as she had felt it for the swift second his had rested there; and still less sensible that the sensation was far from being an unpleasant one--very different from that which had attended a similar demonstration on Charlie Sloane\u2019s part, when she had been sitting out a dance with him at a White Sands party three nights before. Anne shivered over the disagreeable recollection. But all problems connected with infatuated swains vanished from her mind when she entered the homely, unsentimental atmosphere of the Green Gables kitchen where an eight-year-old boy was crying grievously on the sofa."}, {"size": 625, "text": "\u201cWhat is the matter, Davy?\u201d asked Anne, taking him up in her arms. \u201cWhere are Marilla and Dora?\u201d \u201cMarilla\u2019s putting Dora to bed,\u201d sobbed Davy, \u201cand I\u2019m crying \u2018cause Dora fell down the outside cellar steps, heels over head, and scraped all the skin off her nose, and--\u201d \u201cOh, well, don\u2019t cry about it, dear. Of course, you are sorry for her, but crying won\u2019t help her any. She\u2019ll be all right tomorrow. Crying never helps any one, Davy-boy, and--\u201d \u201cI ain\u2019t crying \u2018cause Dora fell down cellar,\u201d said Davy, cutting short Anne\u2019s wellmeant preachment with increasing bitterness. \u201cI\u2019m crying, cause I wasn\u2019t there to see her fall."}, {"size": 880, "text": "I\u2019m always missing some fun or other, seems to me.\u201d \u201cOh, Davy!\u201d Anne choked back an unholy shriek of laughter. \u201cWould you call it fun to see poor little Dora fall down the steps and get hurt?\u201d \u201cShe wasn\u2019t MUCH hurt,\u201d said Davy, defiantly. \u201c\u2018Course, if she\u2019d been killed I\u2019d have been real sorry, Anne. But the Keiths ain\u2019t so easy killed. They\u2019re like the Blewetts, I guess. Herb Blewett fell off the hayloft last Wednesday, and rolled right down through the turnip chute into the box stall, where they had a fearful wild, cross horse, and rolled right under his heels. And still he got out alive, with only three bones broke. Mrs. Lynde says there are some folks you can\u2019t kill with a meat-axe. Is Mrs. Lynde coming here tomorrow, Anne?\u201d \u201cYes, Davy, and I hope you\u2019ll be always very nice and good to her.\u201d \u201cI\u2019ll be nice and good.

Won\u2019t that be all right, Anne?\u201d \u201cYes, if you are sure you won\u2019t forget to say them, Davy-boy.\u201d \u201cOh, I won\u2019t forget, you bet. I think saying my prayers is great fun. But it won\u2019t be as good fun saying them alone as saying them to you. I wish you\u2019d stay home, Anne.

Say, Anne, Milty Boulter says his mother says you\u2019re going to college to see if you can catch a man. Are you, Anne? I want to know.\u201d For a second Anne burned with resentment. Then she laughed, reminding herself that Mrs. Boulter\u2019s crude vulgarity of thought and speech could not harm her. \u201cNo, Davy, I\u2019m not.

Many a dream had she spun over its sparkling water in days gone by. She forgot lovelorn youths, and the cayenne speeches of malicious neighbors, and all the problems of her girlish existence. In imagination she sailed over storied seas that wash the distant shining shores of \u201cfaery lands forlorn,\u201d where lost Atlantis and Elysium lie, with the evening star for pilot, to the land of Heart\u2019s Desire. And she was richer in those dreams than in realities; for things seen pass away, but the things that are unseen are eternal."}, {"size": 717, "text": "The following week sped swiftly, crowded with innumerable \u201clast things,\u201d as Anne called them. Good-bye calls had to be made and received, being pleasant or otherwise, according to whether callers and called-upon were heartily in sympathy with Anne\u2019s hopes, or thought she was too much puffed-up over going to college and that it was their duty to \u201ctake her down a peg or two.\u201d The A.V.I.S. gave a farewell party in honor of Anne and Gilbert one evening at the home of Josie Pye, choosing that place, partly because Mr. Pye\u2019s house was large and convenient, partly because it was strongly suspected that the Pye girls would have nothing to do with the affair if their offer of the house for the party was not accepted."}, {"size": 789, "text": "It was a very pleasant little time, for the Pye girls were gracious, and said and did nothing to mar the harmony of the occasion--which was not according to their wont.

Really, you look ALMOST PRETTY in it.\u201d \u201cHow kind of you to say so,\u201d responded Anne, with dancing eyes. Her sense of humor was developing, and the speeches that would have hurt her at fourteen were becoming merely food for amusement now. Josie suspected that Anne was laughing at her behind those wicked eyes; but she contented herself with whispering to Gertie, as they went downstairs, that Anne Shirley would put on more airs than ever now that she was going to college--you\u2019d see!"}, {"size": 818, "text": "All the \u201cold crowd\u201d was there, full of mirth and zest and youthful lightheartedness.

She was so taken by surprise and pleased by the nice things said in the address, read in Moody Spurgeon\u2019s most solemn and ministerial tones, that the tears quite drowned the sparkle of her big gray eyes. She had worked hard and faithfully for the A.V.I.S., and it warmed the cockles of her heart that the members appreciated her efforts so sincerely. And they were all so nice and friendly and jolly--even the Pye girls had their merits; at that moment Anne loved all the world."}, {"size": 742, "text": "She enjoyed the evening tremendously, but the end of it rather spoiled all. Gilbert again made the mistake of saying something sentimental to her as they ate their supper on the moonlit verandah; and Anne, to punish him, was gracious to Charlie Sloane and allowed the latter to walk home with her. She found, however, that revenge hurts nobody quite so much as the one who tries to inflict it. Gilbert walked airily off with Ruby Gillis, and Anne could hear them laughing and talking gaily as they loitered along in the still, crisp autumn air. They were evidently having the best of good times, while she was horribly bored by Charlie Sloane, who talked unbrokenly on, and never, even by accident, said one thing that was worth listening to."}, {"size": 694, "text": "Anne gave an occasional absent \u201cyes\u201d or \u201cno,\u201d and thought how beautiful Ruby had looked that night, how very goggly Charlie\u2019s eyes were in the moonlight--worse even than by daylight--and that the world, somehow, wasn\u2019t quite such a nice place as she had believed it to be earlier in the evening. \u201cI\u2019m just tired out--that is what is the matter with me,\u201d she said, when she thankfully found herself alone in her own room. And she honestly believed it was.

I\u2019m tired because I\u2019ve been packing my trunk and sewing all day. But I\u2019m disgruntled because six women have been here to say good-bye to me, and every one of the six managed to say something that seemed to take the color right out of life and leave it as gray and dismal and cheerless as a November morning.\u201d \u201cSpiteful old cats!\u201d was Gilbert\u2019s elegant comment. \u201cOh, no, they weren\u2019t,\u201d said Anne seriously. \u201cThat is just the trouble.

The first batch contained six letters, from Jane Andrews, Ruby Gillis, Diana Barry, Marilla, Mrs. Lynde and Davy.

Ruby Gillis wrote a gushing epistle deploring Anne\u2019s absence, assuring her she was horribly missed in everything, asking what the Redmond \u201cfellows\u201d were like, and filling the rest with accounts of her own harrowing experiences with her numerous admirers. It was a silly, harmless letter, and Anne would have laughed over it had it not been for the postscript. \u201cGilbert seems to be enjoying Redmond, judging from his letters,\u201d wrote Ruby. \u201cI don\u2019t think Charlie is so stuck on it.\u201d"}, {"size": 611, "text": "So Gilbert was writing to Ruby!

Diana\u2019s letter contained a little too much Fred, but was otherwise crowded and crossed with items of interest, and Anne almost felt herself back in Avonlea while reading it.

No sooner were the roads broken than they filled in again. It was almost impossible to stir out. The A.V.I.S. tried, on three evenings, to have a party in honor of the college students, and on each evening the storm was so wild that nobody could go, so they gave up the attempt in despair. Anne, despite her love of and loyalty to Green Gables, could not help thinking longingly of Patty\u2019s Place, its cosy open fire, Aunt Jamesina\u2019s mirthful eyes, the three cats, the merry chatter of the girls, the pleasantness of Friday evenings when college friends dropped in to talk of grave and gay."}, {"size": 600, "text": "Anne was lonely; Diana, during the whole of the holidays, was imprisoned at home with a bad attack of bronchitis.

Anne wished herself back at Patty\u2019s Place, where there was always somebody else about to take the edge off a delicate situation.

I knew they would begin on Cousin Emily and me as soon as the door shut behind us. When we came home Mrs. Lilly informed us that the aforesaid neighbor\u2019s hired boy was supposed to be down with scarlet fever.

So I went back to bed, and knowing the worst, slept like a top the rest of the night. Though why a top should sleep sounder than anything else I never could understand. But this morning I was quite well, so it couldn\u2019t have been the fever. I suppose if I did catch it last night it couldn\u2019t have developed so soon.

So a fortnight ago I came as usual. And as usual old \u2018Uncle Mark Miller\u2019 brought me from the station with his ancient buggy and what he calls his \u2018generous purpose\u2019 horse.

I\u2019m going to Alice Penhallow\u2019s wedding this evening, you know. I\u2019ve got to do something to this dress, and by the time it\u2019s finished I\u2019ll have to get ready. I\u2019m so sorry.

So Alice Penhallow is to be married tonight. Three weddings for you in one summer, Anne--Phil\u2019s, Alice\u2019s, and Jane\u2019s. I\u2019ll never forgive Jane for not inviting me to her wedding.\u201d \u201cYou really can\u2019t blame her when you think of the tremendous Andrews connection who had to be invited. The house could hardly hold them all. I was only bidden by grace of being Jane\u2019s old chum--at least on Jane\u2019s part. I think Mrs. Harmon\u2019s motive for inviting me was to let me see Jane\u2019s surpassing gorgeousness.\u201d \u201cIs it true that she wore so many diamonds that you couldn\u2019t tell where the diamonds left off and Jane began?\u201d"}, {"size": 782, "text": "\u201cShe certainly wore a good many. What with all the diamonds and white satin and tulle and lace and roses and orange blossoms, prim little Jane was almost lost to sight. But she was VERY happy, and so was Mr. Inglis--and so was Mrs. Harmon.\u201d \u201cIs that the dress you\u2019re going to wear tonight?\u201d asked Gilbert, looking down at the fluffs and frills. \u201cYes. Isn\u2019t it pretty? And I shall wear starflowers in my hair. The Haunted Wood is full of them this summer.\u201d Gilbert had a sudden vision of Anne, arrayed in a frilly green gown, with the virginal curves of arms and throat slipping out of it, and white stars shining against the coils of her ruddy hair. The vision made him catch his breath. But he turned lightly away. \u201cWell, I\u2019ll be up tomorrow. Hope you\u2019ll have a nice time tonight.\u201d"}, {"size": 666, "text": "Anne looked after him as he strode away, and sighed. Gilbert was friendly--very friendly--far too friendly. He had come quite often to Green Gables after his recovery, and something of their old comradeship had returned. But Anne no longer found it satisfying. The rose of love made the blossom of friendship pale and scentless by contrast. And Anne had again begun to doubt if Gilbert now felt anything for her but friendship. In the common light of common day her radiant certainty of that rapt morning had faded. She was haunted by a miserable fear that her mistake could never be rectified. It was quite likely that it was Christine whom Gilbert loved after all."}, {"size": 732, "text": "Perhaps he was even engaged to her. Anne tried to put all unsettling hopes out of her heart, and reconcile herself to a future where work and ambition must take the place of love. She could do good, if not noble, work as a teacher; and the success her little sketches were beginning to meet with in certain editorial sanctums augured well for her budding literary dreams. But--but--Anne picked up her green dress and sighed again. When Gilbert came the next afternoon he found Anne waiting for him, fresh as the dawn and fair as a star, after all the gaiety of the preceding night. She wore a green dress--not the one she had worn to the wedding, but an old one which Gilbert had told her at a Redmond reception he liked especially."}, {"size": 716, "text": "It was just the shade of green that brought out the rich tints of her hair, and the starry gray of her eyes and the iris-like delicacy of her skin. Gilbert, glancing at her sideways as they walked along a shadowy woodpath, thought she had never looked so lovely. Anne, glancing sideways at Gilbert, now and then, thought how much older he looked since his illness. It was as if he had put boyhood behind him forever. The day was beautiful and the way was beautiful. Anne was almost sorry when they reached Hester Gray\u2019s garden, and sat down on the old bench. But it was beautiful there, too--as beautiful as it had been on the faraway day of the Golden Picnic, when Diana and Jane and Priscilla and she had found it."}, {"size": 673, "text": "Then it had been lovely with narcissus and violets; now golden rod had kindled its fairy torches in the corners and asters dotted it bluely. The call of the brook came up through the woods from the valley of birches with all its old allurement; the mellow air was full of the purr of the sea; beyond were fields rimmed by fences bleached silvery gray in the suns of many summers, and long hills scarfed with the shadows of autumnal clouds; with the blowing of the west wind old dreams returned. \u201cI think,\u201d said Anne softly, \u201cthat \u2018the land where dreams come true\u2019 is in the blue haze yonder, over that little valley.\u201d \u201cHave you any unfulfilled dreams, Anne?\u201d asked Gilbert."}, {"size": 669, "text": "Something in his tone--something she had not heard since that miserable evening in the orchard at Patty\u2019s Place--made Anne\u2019s heart beat wildly. But she made answer lightly. \u201cOf course. Everybody has. It wouldn\u2019t do for us to have all our dreams fulfilled. We would be as good as dead if we had nothing left to dream about. What a delicious aroma that low-descending sun is extracting from the asters and ferns. I wish we could see perfumes as well as smell them. I\u2019m sure they would be very beautiful.\u201d Gilbert was not to be thus sidetracked. \u201cI have a dream,\u201d he said slowly. \u201cI persist in dreaming it, although it has often seemed to me that it could never come true."}, {"size": 894, "text": "I dream of a home with a hearth-fire in it, a cat and dog, the footsteps of friends--and YOU!\u201d Anne wanted to speak but she could find no words.

If I ask it again today will you give me a different answer?\u201d Still Anne could not speak. But she lifted her eyes, shining with all the love-rapture of countless generations, and looked into his for a moment. He wanted no other answer. They lingered in the old garden until twilight, sweet as dusk in Eden must have been, crept over it. There was so much to talk over and recall--things said and done and heard and thought and felt and misunderstood. \u201cI thought you loved Christine Stuart,\u201d Anne told him, as reproachfully as if she had not given him every reason to suppose that she loved Roy Gardner. Gilbert laughed boyishly."}, {"size": 806, "text": "\u201cChristine was engaged to somebody in her home town. I knew it and she knew I knew it. When her brother graduated he told me his sister was coming to Kingsport the next winter to take music, and asked me if I would look after her a bit, as she knew no one and would be very lonely. So I did. And then I liked Christine for her own sake. She is one of the nicest girls I\u2019ve ever known. I knew college gossip credited us with being in love with each other. I didn\u2019t care. Nothing mattered much to me for a time there, after you told me you could never love me, Anne. There was nobody else--there never could be anybody else for me but you. I\u2019ve loved you ever since that day you broke your slate over my head in school.\u201d \u201cI don\u2019t see how you could keep on loving me when I was such a little fool,\u201d said Anne."}, {"size": 720, "text": "\u201cWell, I tried to stop,\u201d said Gilbert frankly, \u201cnot because I thought you what you call yourself, but because I felt sure there was no chance for me after Gardner came on the scene.

I believed it until one blessed day when I was sitting up after the fever. I got a letter from Phil Gordon--Phil Blake, rather--in which she told me there was really nothing between you and Roy, and advised me to \u2018try again.\u2019 Well, the doctor was amazed at my rapid recovery after that.\u201d Anne laughed--then shivered."}, {"size": 653, "text": "\u201cI can never forget the night I thought you were dying, Gilbert. Oh, I knew--I KNEW then--and I thought it was too late.\u201d \u201cBut it wasn\u2019t, sweetheart. Oh, Anne, this makes up for everything, doesn\u2019t it? Let\u2019s resolve to keep this day sacred to perfect beauty all our lives for the gift it has given us.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s the birthday of our happiness,\u201d said Anne softly. \u201cI\u2019ve always loved this old garden of Hester Gray\u2019s, and now it will be dearer than ever.\u201d \u201cBut I\u2019ll have to ask you to wait a long time, Anne,\u201d said Gilbert sadly. \u201cIt will be three years before I\u2019ll finish my medical course. And even then there will be no diamond sunbursts and marble halls.\u201d"}, {"size": 641, "text": "\u201cI don\u2019t want sunbursts and marble halls. I just want YOU. You see I\u2019m quite as shameless as Phil about it. Sunbursts and marble halls may be all very well, but there is more \u2018scope for imagination\u2019 without them. And as for the waiting, that doesn\u2019t matter. We\u2019ll just be happy, waiting and working for each other--and dreaming. Oh, dreams will be very sweet now.\u201d Gilbert drew her close to him and kissed her. Then they walked home together in the dusk, crowned king and queen in the bridal realm of love, along winding paths fringed with the sweetest flowers that ever bloomed, and over haunted meadows where winds of hope and memory blew."}]}
