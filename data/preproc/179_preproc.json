If, while the air is thickened by this frosty drizzle, the calendar should happen to indicate that the blessed vernal season is already six weeks old, it will be admitted that no depressing influence is absent from the scene. This fact was keenly felt on a certain 12th of May, upwards of thirty years since, by a lady who stood looking out of one of the windows of the best hotel in the ancient city of Boston."}, {"size": 644, "text": "She had stood there for half an hour--stood there, that is, at intervals; for from time to time she turned back into the room and measured its length with a restless step. In the chimney-place was a red-hot fire which emitted a small blue flame; and in front of the fire, at a table, sat a young man who was busily plying a pencil. He had a number of sheets of paper cut into small equal squares, and he was apparently covering them with pictorial designs--strange-looking figures. He worked rapidly and attentively, sometimes threw back his head and held out his drawing at arm\u2019s-length, and kept up a soft, gay-sounding humming and whistling."}, {"size": 695, "text": "The lady brushed past him in her walk; her much-trimmed skirts were voluminous. She never dropped her eyes upon his work; she only turned them, occasionally, as she passed, to a mirror suspended above the toilet-table on the other side of the room. Here she paused a moment, gave a pinch to her waist with her two hands, or raised these members--they were very plump and pretty--to the multifold braids of her hair, with a movement half caressing, half corrective. An attentive observer might have fancied that during these periods of desultory self-inspection her face forgot its melancholy; but as soon as she neared the window again it began to proclaim that she was a very ill-pleased woman."}, {"size": 753, "text": "And indeed, in what met her eyes there was little to be pleased with. The window-panes were battered by the sleet; the head-stones in the grave-yard beneath seemed to be holding themselves askance to keep it out of their faces. A tall iron railing protected them from the street, and on the other side of the railing an assemblage of Bostonians were trampling about in the liquid snow. Many of them were looking up and down; they appeared to be waiting for something. From time to time a strange vehicle drew near to the place where they stood,--such a vehicle as the lady at the window, in spite of a considerable acquaintance with human inventions, had never seen before: a huge, low omnibus, painted in brilliant colors, and decorated apparently with"}, {"size": 740, "text": "jangling bells, attached to a species of groove in the pavement, through which it was dragged, with a great deal of rumbling, bouncing and scratching, by a couple of remarkably small horses. When it reached a certain point the people in front of the grave-yard, of whom much the greater number were women, carrying satchels and parcels, projected themselves upon it in a compact body--a movement suggesting the scramble for places in a life-boat at sea--and were engulfed in its large interior. Then the life-boat--or the life-car, as the lady at the window of the hotel vaguely designated it--went bumping and jingling away upon its invisible wheels, with the helmsman (the man at the wheel) guiding its course incongruously from the prow."}, {"size": 739, "text": "This phenomenon was repeated every three minutes, and the supply of eagerly-moving women in cloaks, bearing reticules and bundles, renewed itself in the most liberal manner. On the other side of the grave-yard was a row of small red brick houses, showing a series of homely, domestic-looking backs; at the end opposite the hotel a tall wooden church-spire, painted white, rose high into the vagueness of the snow-flakes. The lady at the window looked at it for some time; for reasons of her own she thought it the ugliest thing she had ever seen. She hated it, she despised it; it threw her into a state of irritation that was quite out of proportion to any sensible motive. She had never known herself to care so much about church-spires."}, {"size": 650, "text": "She was not pretty; but even when it expressed perplexed irritation her face was most interesting and agreeable. Neither was she in her first youth; yet, though slender, with a great deal of extremely well-fashioned roundness of contour--a suggestion both of maturity and flexibility--she carried her three and thirty years as a light-wristed Hebe might have carried a brimming wine-cup. Her complexion was fatigued, as the French say; her mouth was large, her lips too full, her teeth uneven, her chin rather commonly modeled; she had a thick nose, and when she smiled--she was constantly smiling--the lines beside it rose too high, toward her eyes."}, {"size": 611, "text": "But these eyes were charming: gray in color, brilliant, quickly glancing, gently resting, full of intelligence. Her forehead was very low--it was her only handsome feature; and she had a great abundance of crisp dark hair, finely frizzled, which was always braided in a manner that suggested some Southern or Eastern, some remotely foreign, woman. She had a large collection of ear-rings, and wore them in alternation; and they seemed to give a point to her Oriental or exotic aspect. A compliment had once been paid her, which, being repeated to her, gave her greater pleasure than anything she had ever heard."}, {"size": 662, "text": "\u201cA pretty woman?\u201d someone had said. \u201cWhy, her features are very bad.\u201d \u201cI don\u2019t know about her features,\u201d a very discerning observer had answered; \u201cbut she carries her head like a pretty woman.\u201d You may imagine whether, after this, she carried her head less becomingly. She turned away from the window at last, pressing her hands to her eyes. \u201cIt\u2019s too horrible!\u201d she exclaimed. \u201cI shall go back--I shall go back!\u201d And she flung herself into a chair before the fire. \u201cWait a little, dear child,\u201d said the young man softly, sketching away at his little scraps of paper. The lady put out her foot; it was very small, and there was an immense rosette on her slipper."}, {"size": 693, "text": "She fixed her eyes for a while on this ornament, and then she looked at the glowing bed of anthracite coal in the grate. \u201cDid you ever see anything so hideous as that fire?\u201d she demanded. \u201cDid you ever see anything so--so _affreux_ as--as everything?\u201d She spoke English with perfect purity; but she brought out this French epithet in a manner that indicated that she was accustomed to using French epithets. \u201cI think the fire is very pretty,\u201d said the young man, glancing at it a moment. \u201cThose little blue tongues, dancing on top of the crimson embers, are extremely picturesque. They are like a fire in an alchemist\u2019s laboratory.\u201d \u201cYou are too good-natured, my dear,\u201d his companion declared."}, {"size": 687, "text": "The young man held out one of his drawings, with his head on one side. His tongue was gently moving along his under-lip. \u201cGood-natured--yes. Too good-natured--no.\u201d \u201cYou are irritating,\u201d said the lady, looking at her slipper. He began to retouch his sketch. \u201cI think you mean simply that you are irritated.\u201d \u201cAh, for that, yes!\u201d said his companion, with a little bitter laugh. \u201cIt\u2019s the darkest day of my life--and you know what that means.\u201d \u201cWait till tomorrow,\u201d rejoined the young man. \u201cYes, we have made a great mistake. If there is any doubt about it today, there certainly will be none tomorrow. _Ce sera clair, au moins!_\u201d The young man was silent a few moments, driving his pencil."}, {"size": 663, "text": "Then at last, \u201cThere are no such things as mistakes,\u201d he affirmed. \u201cVery true--for those who are not clever enough to perceive them. Not to recognize one\u2019s mistakes--that would be happiness in life,\u201d the lady went on, still looking at her pretty foot. \u201cMy dearest sister,\u201d said the young man, always intent upon his drawing, \u201cit\u2019s the first time you have told me I am not clever.\u201d \u201cWell, by your own theory I can\u2019t call it a mistake,\u201d answered his sister, pertinently enough. The young man gave a clear, fresh laugh. \u201cYou, at least, are clever enough, dearest sister,\u201d he said. \u201cI was not so when I proposed this.\u201d \u201cWas it you who proposed it?\u201d asked her brother."}, {"size": 634, "text": "She turned her head and gave him a little stare. \u201cDo you desire the credit of it?\u201d \u201cIf you like, I will take the blame,\u201d he said, looking up with a smile. \u201cYes,\u201d she rejoined in a moment, \u201cyou make no difference in these things. You have no sense of property.\u201d The young man gave his joyous laugh again. \u201cIf that means I have no property, you are right!\u201d \u201cDon\u2019t joke about your poverty,\u201d said his sister. \u201cThat is quite as vulgar as to boast about it.\u201d \u201cMy poverty! I have just finished a drawing that will bring me fifty francs!\u201d _\u201cVoyons,\u201d_ said the lady, putting out her hand. He added a touch or two, and then gave her his sketch."}, {"size": 777, "text": "She looked at it, but she went on with her idea of a moment before. \u201cIf a woman were to ask you to marry her you would say, \u2018Certainly, my dear, with pleasure!\u2019 And you would marry her and be ridiculously happy. Then at the end of three months you would say to her, \u2018You know that blissful day when I begged you to be mine!\u2019\u201d The young man had risen from the table, stretching his arms a little; he walked to the window. \u201cThat is a description of a charming nature,\u201d he said. \u201cOh, yes, you have a charming nature; I regard that as our capital. If I had not been convinced of that I should never have taken the risk of bringing you to this dreadful country.\u201d \u201cThis comical country, this delightful country!\u201d exclaimed the young man, and he broke into the most animated laughter."}, {"size": 621, "text": "\u201cIs it those women scrambling into the omnibus?\u201d asked his companion. \u201cWhat do you suppose is the attraction?\u201d \u201cI suppose there is a very good-looking man inside,\u201d said the young man. \u201cIn each of them? They come along in hundreds, and the men in this country don\u2019t seem at all handsome. As for the women--I have never seen so many at once since I left the convent.\u201d \u201cThe women are very pretty,\u201d her brother declared, \u201cand the whole affair is very amusing. I must make a sketch of it.\u201d And he came back to the table quickly, and picked up his utensils--a small sketching-board, a sheet of paper, and three or four crayons."}, {"size": 833, "text": "He took his place at the window with these things, and stood there glancing out, plying his pencil with an air of easy skill. While he worked he wore a brilliant smile. Brilliant is indeed the word at this moment for his strongly-lighted face. He was eight and twenty years old; he had a short, slight, well-made figure. Though he bore a noticeable resemblance to his sister, he was a better favored person: fair-haired, clear-faced, witty-looking, with a delicate finish of feature and an expression at once urbane and not at all serious, a warm blue eye, an eyebrow finely drawn and excessively arched--an eyebrow which, if ladies wrote sonnets to those of their lovers, might have been made the subject of such a piece of verse--and a light moustache that flourished upwards as if blown that way by the breath of a constant smile."}, {"size": 658, "text": "There was something in his physiognomy at once benevolent and picturesque. But, as I have hinted, it was not at all serious. The young man\u2019s face was, in this respect, singular; it was not at all serious, and yet it inspired the liveliest confidence. \u201cBe sure you put in plenty of snow,\u201d said his sister. \u201c_Bont\u00e9 divine_, what a climate!\u201d \u201cI shall leave the sketch all white, and I shall put in the little figures in black,\u201d the young man answered, laughing. \u201cAnd I shall call it--what is that line in Keats?--Mid-May\u2019s Eldest Child!\u201d \u201cI don\u2019t remember,\u201d said the lady, \u201cthat mamma ever told me it was like this.\u201d \u201cMamma never told you anything disagreeable."}, {"size": 683, "text": "And it\u2019s not like this--every day.

Back to Silberstadt. I shall write to the Reigning Prince.\u201d The young man turned a little and looked at her, with his crayon poised. \u201cMy dear Eugenia,\u201d he murmured, \u201cwere you so happy at sea?\u201d Eugenia got up; she still held in her hand the drawing her brother had given her. It was a bold, expressive sketch of a group of miserable people on the deck of a steamer, clinging together and clutching at each other, while the vessel lurched downward, at a terrific angle, into the hollow of a wave."}, {"size": 614, "text": "It was extremely clever, and full of a sort of tragi-comical power. Eugenia dropped her eyes upon it and made a sad grimace. \u201cHow can you draw such odious scenes?\u201d she asked. \u201cI should like to throw it into the fire!\u201d And she tossed the paper away. Her brother watched, quietly, to see where it went. It fluttered down to the floor, where he let it lie. She came toward the window, pinching in her waist. \u201cWhy don\u2019t you reproach me--abuse me?\u201d she asked. \u201cI think I should feel better then. Why don\u2019t you tell me that you hate me for bringing you here?\u201d \u201cBecause you would not believe it. I adore you, dear sister!"}, {"size": 617, "text": "I am delighted to be here, and I am charmed with the prospect.\u201d \u201cI don\u2019t know what had taken possession of me. I had lost my head,\u201d Eugenia went on. The young man, on his side, went on plying his pencil. \u201cIt is evidently a most curious and interesting country. Here we are, and I mean to enjoy it.\u201d His companion turned away with an impatient step, but presently came back. \u201cHigh spirits are doubtless an excellent thing,\u201d she said; \u201cbut you give one too much of them, and I can\u2019t see that they have done you any good.\u201d The young man stared, with lifted eyebrows, smiling; he tapped his handsome nose with his pencil."}, {"size": 734, "text": "\u201cThey have made me happy!\u201d \u201cThat was the least they could do; they have made you nothing else. You have gone through life thanking fortune for such very small favors that she has never put herself to any trouble for you.\u201d \u201cShe must have put herself to a little, I think, to present me with so admirable a sister.\u201d \u201cBe serious, Felix. You forget that I am your elder.\u201d \u201cWith a sister, then, so elderly!\u201d rejoined Felix, laughing. \u201cI hoped we had left seriousness in Europe.\u201d \u201cI fancy you will find it here. Remember that you are nearly thirty years old, and that you are nothing but an obscure Bohemian--a penniless correspondent of an illustrated newspaper.\u201d \u201cObscure as much as you please, but not so much of a Bohemian as you think."}, {"size": 654, "text": "And not at all penniless! I have a hundred pounds in my pocket. I have an engagement to make fifty sketches, and I mean to paint the portraits of all our cousins, and of all _their_ cousins, at a hundred dollars a head.\u201d \u201cYou are not ambitious,\u201d said Eugenia. \u201cYou are, dear Baroness,\u201d the young man replied. The Baroness was silent a moment, looking out at the sleet-darkened grave-yard and the bumping horse-cars. \u201cYes, I am ambitious,\u201d she said at last. \u201cAnd my ambition has brought me to this dreadful place!\u201d She glanced about her--the room had a certain vulgar nudity; the bed and the window were curtainless--and she gave a little passionate sigh."}, {"size": 563, "text": "\u201cPoor old ambition!\u201d she exclaimed. Then she flung herself down upon a sofa which stood near against the wall, and covered her face with her hands. Her brother went on with his drawing, rapidly and skillfully; after some moments he sat down beside her and showed her his sketch. \u201cNow, don\u2019t you think that\u2019s pretty good for an obscure Bohemian?\u201d he asked. \u201cI have knocked off another fifty francs.\u201d Eugenia glanced at the little picture as he laid it on her lap. \u201cYes, it is very clever,\u201d she said. And in a moment she added, \u201cDo you suppose our cousins do that?\u201d"}, {"size": 651, "text": "\u201cGet into those things, and look like that.\u201d Felix meditated awhile. \u201cI really can\u2019t say. It will be interesting to discover.\u201d \u201cOh, the rich people can\u2019t!\u201d said the Baroness. \u201cAre you very sure they are rich?\u201d asked Felix, lightly. His sister slowly turned in her place, looking at him. \u201cHeavenly powers!\u201d she murmured. \u201cYou have a way of bringing out things!\u201d \u201cIt will certainly be much pleasanter if they are rich,\u201d Felix declared. \u201cDo you suppose if I had not known they were rich I would ever have come?\u201d The young man met his sister\u2019s somewhat peremptory eye with his bright, contented glance. \u201cYes, it certainly will be pleasanter,\u201d he repeated."}, {"size": 600, "text": "\u201cThat is all I expect of them,\u201d said the Baroness. \u201cI don\u2019t count upon their being clever or friendly--at first--or elegant or interesting. But I assure you I insist upon their being rich.\u201d Felix leaned his head upon the back of the sofa and looked awhile at the oblong patch of sky to which the window served as frame. The snow was ceasing; it seemed to him that the sky had begun to brighten. \u201cI count upon their being rich,\u201d he said at last, \u201cand powerful, and clever, and friendly, and elegant, and interesting, and generally delightful! _Tu vas voir_.\u201d And he bent forward and kissed his sister."}, {"size": 795, "text": "\u201cLook there!\u201d he went on. \u201cAs a portent, even while I speak, the sky is turning the color of gold; the day is going to be splendid.\u201d And indeed, within five minutes the weather had changed. The sun broke out through the snow-clouds and jumped into the Baroness\u2019s room. \u201c_Bont\u00e9 divine_,\u201d exclaimed this lady, \u201cwhat a climate!\u201d \u201cWe will go out and see the world,\u201d said Felix. And after a while they went out. The air had grown warm as well as brilliant; the sunshine had dried the pavements. They walked about the streets at hazard, looking at the people and the houses, the shops and the vehicles, the blazing blue sky and the muddy crossings, the hurrying men and the slow-strolling maidens, the fresh red bricks and the bright green trees, the extraordinary mixture of smartness and shabbiness."}, {"size": 655, "text": "From one hour to another the day had grown vernal; even in the bustling streets there was an odor of earth and blossom. Felix was immensely entertained. He had called it a comical country, and he went about laughing at everything he saw. You would have said that American civilization expressed itself to his sense in a tissue of capital jokes. The jokes were certainly excellent, and the young man\u2019s merriment was joyous and genial. He possessed what is called the pictorial sense; and this first glimpse of democratic manners stirred the same sort of attention that he would have given to the movements of a lively young person with a bright complexion."}, {"size": 613, "text": "Such attention would have been demonstrative and complimentary; and in the present case Felix might have passed for an undispirited young exile revisiting the haunts of his childhood. He kept looking at the violent blue of the sky, at the scintillating air, at the scattered and multiplied patches of color. \u201c_Comme c\u2019est bariol\u00e9_, eh?\u201d he said to his sister in that foreign tongue which they both appeared to feel a mysterious prompting occasionally to use. \u201cYes, it is _bariol\u00e9_ indeed,\u201d the Baroness answered. \u201cI don\u2019t like the coloring; it hurts my eyes.\u201d \u201cIt shows how extremes meet,\u201d the young man rejoined."}, {"size": 634, "text": "\u201cInstead of coming to the West we seem to have gone to the East. The way the sky touches the house-tops is just like Cairo; and the red and blue sign-boards patched over the face of everything remind one of Mahometan decorations.\u201d \u201cThe young women are not Mahometan,\u201d said his companion. \u201cThey can\u2019t be said to hide their faces. I never saw anything so bold.\u201d \u201cThank Heaven they don\u2019t hide their faces!\u201d cried Felix. \u201cTheir faces are uncommonly pretty.\u201d \u201cYes, their faces are often very pretty,\u201d said the Baroness, who was a very clever woman. She was too clever a woman not to be capable of a great deal of just and fine observation."}, {"size": 658, "text": "She clung more closely than usual to her brother\u2019s arm; she was not exhilarated, as he was; she said very little, but she noted a great many things and made her reflections. She was a little excited; she felt that she had indeed come to a strange country, to make her fortune. Superficially, she was conscious of a good deal of irritation and displeasure; the Baroness was a very delicate and fastidious person. Of old, more than once, she had gone, for entertainment\u2019s sake and in brilliant company, to a fair in a provincial town. It seemed to her now that she was at an enormous fair--that the entertainment and the _d\u00e9sagr\u00e9ments_ were very much the same."}, {"size": 659, "text": "She found herself alternately smiling and shrinking; the show was very curious, but it was probable, from moment to moment, that one would be jostled. The Baroness had never seen so many people walking about before; she had never been so mixed up with people she did not know. But little by little she felt that this fair was a more serious undertaking. She went with her brother into a large public garden, which seemed very pretty, but where she was surprised at seeing no carriages. The afternoon was drawing to a close; the coarse, vivid grass and the slender tree-boles were gilded by the level sunbeams--gilded as with gold that was fresh from the mine."}, {"size": 635, "text": "It was the hour at which ladies should come out for an airing and roll past a hedge of pedestrians, holding their parasols askance. Here, however, Eugenia observed no indications of this custom, the absence of which was more anomalous as there was a charming avenue of remarkably graceful, arching elms in the most convenient contiguity to a large, cheerful street, in which, evidently, among the more prosperous members of the _bourgeoisie_, a great deal of pedestrianism went forward. Our friends passed out into this well lighted promenade, and Felix noticed a great many more pretty girls and called his sister\u2019s attention to them."}, {"size": 740, "text": "This latter measure, however, was superfluous; for the Baroness had inspected, narrowly, these charming young ladies. \u201cI feel an intimate conviction that our cousins are like that,\u201d said Felix. The Baroness hoped so, but this is not what she said. \u201cThey are very pretty,\u201d she said, \u201cbut they are mere little girls. Where are the women--the women of thirty?\u201d \u201cOf thirty-three, do you mean?\u201d her brother was going to ask; for he understood often both what she said and what she did not say. But he only exclaimed upon the beauty of the sunset, while the Baroness, who had come to seek her fortune, reflected that it would certainly be well for her if the persons against whom she might need to measure herself should all be mere little girls."}, {"size": 637, "text": "The sunset was superb; they stopped to look at it; Felix declared that he had never seen such a gorgeous mixture of colors. The Baroness also thought it splendid; and she was perhaps the more easily pleased from the fact that while she stood there she was conscious of much admiring observation on the part of various nice-looking people who passed that way, and to whom a distinguished, strikingly-dressed woman with a foreign air, exclaiming upon the beauties of nature on a Boston street corner in the French tongue, could not be an object of indifference. Eugenia\u2019s spirits rose. She surrendered herself to a certain tranquil gaiety."}, {"size": 608, "text": "If she had come to seek her fortune, it seemed to her that her fortune would be easy to find. There was a promise of it in the gorgeous purity of the western sky; there was an intimation in the mild, unimpertinent gaze of the passers of a certain natural facility in things. \u201cYou will not go back to Silberstadt, eh?\u201d asked Felix. \u201cNot tomorrow,\u201d said the Baroness. \u201cNor write to the Reigning Prince?\u201d \u201cI shall write to him that they evidently know nothing about him over here.\u201d \u201cHe will not believe you,\u201d said the young man. \u201cI advise you to let him alone.\u201d Felix himself continued to be in high good humor."}, {"size": 663, "text": "Brought up among ancient customs and in picturesque cities, he yet found plenty of local color in the little Puritan metropolis. That evening, after dinner, he told his sister that he should go forth early on the morrow to look up their cousins. \u201cYou are very impatient,\u201d said Eugenia. \u201cWhat can be more natural,\u201d he asked, \u201cafter seeing all those pretty girls today? If one\u2019s cousins are of that pattern, the sooner one knows them the better.\u201d \u201cPerhaps they are not,\u201d said Eugenia. \u201cWe ought to have brought some letters--to some other people.\u201d \u201cThe other people would not be our kinsfolk.\u201d \u201cPossibly they would be none the worse for that,\u201d the Baroness replied."}, {"size": 635, "text": "Her brother looked at her with his eyebrows lifted. \u201cThat was not what you said when you first proposed to me that we should come out here and fraternize with our relatives. You said that it was the prompting of natural affection; and when I suggested some reasons against it you declared that the _voix du sang_ should go before everything.\u201d \u201cYou remember all that?\u201d asked the Baroness. \u201cVividly! I was greatly moved by it.\u201d She was walking up and down the room, as she had done in the morning; she stopped in her walk and looked at her brother. She apparently was going to say something, but she checked herself and resumed her walk."}, {"size": 628, "text": "Then, in a few moments, she said something different, which had the effect of an explanation of the suppression of her earlier thought. \u201cYou will never be anything but a child, dear brother.\u201d \u201cOne would suppose that you, madam,\u201d answered Felix, laughing, \u201cwere a thousand years old.\u201d \u201cI am--sometimes,\u201d said the Baroness. \u201cI will go, then, and announce to our cousins the arrival of a personage so extraordinary.

Charlotte Wentworth\u2019s sweetly severe features were as agreeable as Lizzie Acton\u2019s wonderfully expressive blue eyes; and Gertrude\u2019s air of being always ready to walk about and listen was as charming as anything else, especially as she walked very gracefully.

What the Baroness expected just now it would take some ingenuity to set forth; it is enough that while she looked about her she found something to occupy her imagination.

The sense, indeed, that the good people about her had, as regards her remarkable self, no standard of comparison at all gave her a feeling of almost illimitable power.

Over these young people--a vague report of their existence had come to his ears--Mr. Wentworth had not, in the course of years, allowed his imagination to hover.

Clifford\u2019s vision of the coming years was very simple; its most definite features were this element of familiar matrimony and the duplication of his resources for trotting.

In his younger years he had been--or he had tried to be--of the opinion that it would be a good deal \u201cjollier\u201d not to marry, and he had flattered himself that his single condition was something of a citadel.

He had an idea that she would become--in time at least, and on learning the conveniences of the place for making a lady comfortable--a tolerably patient captive. But the draw-bridge was never raised, and Acton\u2019s brilliant visitor was as free to depart as she had been to come. It was part of his curiosity to know why the deuce so susceptible a man was _not_ in love with so charming a woman.

Such a vision, certainly, seemed a refined implication of matrimony, after the Baroness should have formally got rid of her informal husband.

Her irritation came, at bottom, from the sense, which, always present, had suddenly grown acute, that the social soil on this big, vague continent was somehow not adapted for growing those plants whose fragrance she especially inclined to inhale and by which she liked to see herself surrounded--a species of vegetation for which she carried a collection of seedlings, as we may say, in her pocket."}, {"size": 622, "text": "She found her chief happiness in the sense of exerting a certain power and making a certain impression; and now she felt the annoyance of a rather wearied swimmer who, on nearing shore, to land, finds a smooth straight wall of rock when he had counted upon a clean firm beach.

I say frequent and not constant, for there were long periods during which she gave her attention to other problems. Sometimes she had said to herself that his happy temper, his eternal gaiety, was an affectation, a _pose_; but she was vaguely conscious that during the present summer he had been a highly successful comedian.

Here he walked up and down for some time, looking at the splendid blaze of the western sky and saying, as he had often said before, that this was certainly the country of sunsets.

Presently, as the sunset expanded and deepened, the fancy took him of making a note of so magnificent a piece of coloring.

Mr. Brand stopped and started; then he appeared to decide to accept Felix\u2019s invitation. He came out of Mr. Wentworth\u2019s gate and passed along the road; after which he entered the little garden of the cottage."}, {"size": 631, "text": "Felix had gone back to his sunset; but he made his visitor welcome while he rapidly brushed it in. \u201cI wanted so much to speak to you that I thought I would call you,\u201d he said, in the friendliest tone. \u201cAll the more that you have been to see me so little. You have come to see my sister; I know that. But you haven\u2019t come to see me--the celebrated artist.

You would ask me why you should learn; and I should have no answer to that. I suppose a minister has no need for Art, eh?\u201d \u201cHe has need for good temper, sir,\u201d said Mr. Brand, with decision.

If that were really the case I suppose it would be the business of you theologians to put out the fire. Fancy me--an ungodly artist--quietly sitting down to paint it!\u201d Mr. Brand had always credited Felix Young with a certain impudence, but it appeared to him that on this occasion his impudence was so great as to make a special explanation--or even an apology--necessary."}, {"size": 600, "text": "And the impression, it must be added, was sufficiently natural.

Did you bring me over here for the purpose of making that inquiry?\u201d Felix saw that he was irritated, and he regretted it immensely; but he had no fear of not being, in the end, agreeable to Mr. Brand.

In the shadow, on the darker parts of the wall, he saw the gleam of three or four pictures that looked fantastic and surprising. They seemed to represent naked figures.

There was something I desired--something I asked of you; I desire something still--I ask it of you.\u201d And he paused a moment; Mr. Wentworth looked bewildered. \u201cI should like, in my ministerial capacity, to unite this young couple.\u201d Gertrude, watching her sister, saw Charlotte flushing intensely, and Mr. Wentworth felt her pressing upon his arm. \u201cHeavenly Powers!\u201d murmured Mr. Wentworth."}, {"size": 622, "text": "And it was the nearest approach to profanity he had ever made. \u201cThat is very nice; that is very handsome!\u201d Felix exclaimed. \u201cI don\u2019t understand,\u201d said Mr. Wentworth; though it was plain that everyone else did. \u201cThat is very beautiful, Mr. Brand,\u201d said Gertrude, emulating Felix. \u201cI should like to marry you. It will give me great pleasure.\u201d \u201cAs Gertrude says, it\u2019s a beautiful idea,\u201d said Felix. Felix was smiling, but Mr. Brand was not even trying to.

Mr. Wentworth, evidently, had no imagination at all. \u201cI have always thought,\u201d he began, slowly, \u201cthat Gertrude\u2019s character required a special line of development.\u201d \u201cFather,\u201d repeated Charlotte, _\u201cconsent.\u201d_ Then, at last, Mr. Brand looked at her. Her father felt her leaning more heavily upon his folded arm than she had ever done before; and this, with a certain sweet faintness in her voice, made him wonder what was the matter."}, {"size": 705, "text": "He looked down at her and saw the encounter of her gaze with the young theologian\u2019s; but even this told him nothing, and he continued to be bewildered. Nevertheless, \u201cI consent,\u201d he said at last, \u201csince Mr. Brand recommends it.\u201d \u201cI should like to perform the ceremony very soon,\u201d observed Mr. Brand, with a sort of solemn simplicity. \u201cCome, come, that\u2019s charming!\u201d cried Felix, profanely. Mr. Wentworth sank into his chair. \u201cDoubtless, when you understand it,\u201d he said, with a certain judicial asperity. Gertrude went to her sister and led her away, and Felix having passed his arm into Mr. Brand\u2019s and stepped out of the long window with him, the old man was left sitting there in unillumined perplexity."}, {"size": 633, "text": "Felix did no work that day. In the afternoon, with Gertrude, he got into one of the boats and floated about with idly-dipping oars. They talked a good deal of Mr. Brand--though not exclusively. \u201cThat was a fine stroke,\u201d said Felix. \u201cIt was really heroic.\u201d Gertrude sat musing, with her eyes upon the ripples. \u201cThat was what he wanted to be; he wanted to do something fine.\u201d \u201cHe won\u2019t be comfortable till he has married us,\u201d said Felix. \u201cSo much the better.\u201d \u201cHe wanted to be magnanimous; he wanted to have a fine moral pleasure.

It is better for him than if I had listened to him.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s better for me,\u201d smiled Felix. \u201cBut do you know, as regards the sacrifice, that I don\u2019t believe he admired you when this decision was taken quite so much as he had done a fortnight before?\u201d \u201cHe never admired me. He admires Charlotte; he pitied me.

I cannot say exactly to which member of Gertrude\u2019s phrase he alluded; but he dipped his oars again, and they kept floating about. Neither Felix nor his sister, on that day, was present at Mr. Wentworth\u2019s at the evening repast. The two occupants of the chalet dined together, and the young man informed his companion that his marriage was now an assured fact. Eugenia congratulated him, and replied that if he were as reasonable a husband as he had been, on the whole, a brother, his wife would have nothing to complain of."}, {"size": 790, "text": "Felix looked at her a moment, smiling. \u201cI hope,\u201d he said, \u201cnot to be thrown back on my reason.\u201d \u201cIt is very true,\u201d Eugenia rejoined, \u201cthat one\u2019s reason is dismally flat. It\u2019s a bed with the mattress removed.\u201d But the brother and sister, later in the evening, crossed over to the larger house, the Baroness desiring to compliment her prospective sister-in-law. They found the usual circle upon the piazza, with the exception of Clifford Wentworth and Lizzie Acton; and as everyone stood up as usual to welcome the Baroness, Eugenia had an admiring audience for her compliment to Gertrude. Robert Acton stood on the edge of the piazza, leaning against one of the white columns, so that he found himself next to Eugenia while she acquitted herself of a neat little discourse of congratulation."}, {"size": 685, "text": "\u201cI shall be so glad to know you better,\u201d she said; \u201cI have seen so much less of you than I should have liked.

I think I may say I gain on being known.\u201d And terminating these observations with the softest cadence of her voice, the Baroness imprinted a sort of grand official kiss upon Gertrude\u2019s forehead. Increased familiarity had not, to Gertrude\u2019s imagination, diminished the mysterious impressiveness of Eugenia\u2019s personality, and she felt flattered and transported by this little ceremony. Robert Acton also seemed to admire it, as he admired so many of the gracious manifestations of Madame M\u00fcnster\u2019s wit."}, {"size": 732, "text": "They had the privilege of making him restless, and on this occasion he walked away, suddenly, with his hands in his pockets, and then came back and leaned against his column. Eugenia was now complimenting her uncle upon his daughter\u2019s engagement, and Mr. Wentworth was listening with his usual plain yet refined politeness. It is to be supposed that by this time his perception of the mutual relations of the young people who surrounded him had become more acute; but he still took the matter very seriously, and he was not at all exhilarated. \u201cFelix will make her a good husband,\u201d said Eugenia. \u201cHe will be a charming companion; he has a great quality--indestructible gaiety.\u201d \u201cYou think that\u2019s a great quality?\u201d asked the old man."}, {"size": 670, "text": "Eugenia meditated, with her eyes upon his. \u201cYou think one gets tired of it, eh?\u201d \u201cI don\u2019t know that I am prepared to say that,\u201d said Mr. Wentworth. \u201cWell, we will say, then, that it is tiresome for others but delightful for one\u2019s self. A woman\u2019s husband, you know, is supposed to be her second self; so that, for Felix and Gertrude, gaiety will be a common property.\u201d \u201cGertrude was always very gay,\u201d said Mr. Wentworth. He was trying to follow this argument. Robert Acton took his hands out of his pockets and came a little nearer to the Baroness. \u201cYou say you gain by being known,\u201d he said. \u201cOne certainly gains by knowing you.\u201d \u201cWhat have _you_ gained?\u201d asked Eugenia."}, {"size": 620, "text": "\u201cAn immense amount of wisdom.\u201d \u201cThat\u2019s a questionable advantage for a man who was already so wise!\u201d Acton shook his head. \u201cNo, I was a great fool before I knew you!\u201d \u201cAnd being a fool you made my acquaintance? You are very complimentary.\u201d \u201cLet me keep it up,\u201d said Acton, laughing. \u201cI hope, for our pleasure, that your brother\u2019s marriage will detain you.\u201d \u201cWhy should I stop for my brother\u2019s marriage when I would not stop for my own?\u201d asked the Baroness. \u201cWhy shouldn\u2019t you stop in either case, now that, as you say, you have dissolved that mechanical tie that bound you to Europe?\u201d The Baroness looked at him a moment."}, {"size": 724, "text": "\u201cAs I say? You look as if you doubted it.\u201d \u201cAh,\u201d said Acton, returning her glance, \u201cthat is a remnant of my old folly!

Then she appeared to understand. \u201cAnother marriage?\u201d And she looked at the others. Felix was chattering to Gertrude; Charlotte, at a distance, was watching them; and Mr. Brand, in quite another quarter, was turning his back to them, and, with his hands under his coat-tails and his large head on one side, was looking at the small, tender crescent of a young moon."}, {"size": 661, "text": "\u201cIt ought to be Mr. Brand and Charlotte,\u201d said Eugenia, \u201cbut it doesn\u2019t look like it.\u201d \u201cThere,\u201d Acton answered, \u201cyou must judge just now by contraries.

There had been a tacit understanding; but within a day or two Clifford appears to have received some mysterious impulse to precipitate the affair.\u201d \u201cThe impulse,\u201d said the Baroness, \u201cwas the charms of your very pretty sister.\u201d \u201cBut my sister\u2019s charms were an old story; he had always known her.\u201d Acton had begun to experiment again."}, {"size": 610, "text": "Here, however, it was evident the Baroness would not help him. \u201cAh, one can\u2019t say!

It had a distinct effect upon Robert Acton, who, for the two days preceding her departure, was a very restless and irritated mortal.

Gertrude was for a good while a distant figure, but she came back when Charlotte married Mr. Brand. She was present at the wedding feast, where Felix\u2019s gaiety confessed to no change.
