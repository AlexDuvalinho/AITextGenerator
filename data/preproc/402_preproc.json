Except in solitude, that face was almost always cryptic and emotionless; for Penrod had come into his twelfth year wearing an expression carefully trained to be inscrutable. Since the world was sure to misunderstand everything, mere defensive instinct prompted him to give it as little as possible to lay hold upon. Nothing is more impenetrable than the face of a boy who has learned this, and Penrod's was habitually as fathomless as the depth of his hatred this morning for the literary activities of Mrs."}, {"size": 786, "text": "Lora Rewbush--an almost universally respected fellow citizen, a lady of charitable and poetic inclinations, and one of his own mother's most intimate friends. Mrs. Lora Rewbush had written something which she called \u201cThe Children's Pageant of the Table Round,\u201d and it was to be performed in public that very afternoon at the Women's Arts and Guild Hall for the benefit of the Coloured Infants' Betterment Society. And if any flavour of sweetness remained in the nature of Penrod Schofield after the dismal trials of the school-week just past, that problematic, infinitesimal remnant was made pungent acid by the imminence of his destiny to form a prominent feature of the spectacle, and to declaim the loathsome sentiments of a character named upon the programme the Child Sir Lancelot."}, {"size": 658, "text": "After each rehearsal he had plotted escape, and only ten days earlier there had been a glimmer of light: Mrs. Lora Rewbush caught a very bad cold, and it was hoped it might develop into pneumonia; but she recovered so quickly that not even a rehearsal of the Children's Pageant was postponed. Darkness closed in. Penrod had rather vaguely debated plans for a self-mutilation such as would make his appearance as the Child Sir Lancelot inexpedient on public grounds; it was a heroic and attractive thought, but the results of some extremely sketchy preliminary experiments caused him to abandon it. There was no escape; and at last his hour was hard upon him."}, {"size": 746, "text": "Therefore he brooded on the fence and gazed with envy at his wistful Duke. The dog's name was undescriptive of his person, which was obviously the result of a singular series of mesalliances. He wore a grizzled moustache and indefinite whiskers; he was small and shabby, and looked like an old postman. Penrod envied Duke because he was sure Duke would never be compelled to be a Child Sir Lancelot. He thought a dog free and unshackled to go or come as the wind listeth. Penrod forgot the life he led Duke. There was a long soliloquy upon the fence, a plaintive monologue without words: the boy's thoughts were adjectives, but they were expressed by a running film of pictures in his mind's eye, morbidly prophetic of the hideosities before him."}, {"size": 752, "text": "Finally he spoke aloud, with such spleen that Duke rose from his haunches and lifted one ear in keen anxiety. \u201c'I hight Sir Lancelot du Lake, the Child, Gentul-hearted, meek, and mild. What though I'm BUT a littul child, Gentul-hearted, meek, and----' OOF!\u201d All of this except \u201coof\u201d was a quotation from the Child Sir Lancelot, as conceived by Mrs. Lora Rewbush. Choking upon it, Penrod slid down from the fence, and with slow and thoughtful steps entered a one-storied wing of the stable, consisting of a single apartment, floored with cement and used as a storeroom for broken bric-a-brac, old paint-buckets, decayed garden-hose, worn-out carpets, dead furniture, and other condemned odds and ends not yet considered hopeless enough to be given away."}, {"size": 615, "text": "In one corner stood a large box, a part of the building itself: it was eight feet high and open at the top, and it had been constructed as a sawdust magazine from which was drawn material for the horse's bed in a stall on the other side of the partition. The big box, so high and towerlike, so commodious, so suggestive, had ceased to fulfil its legitimate function; though, providentially, it had been at least half full of sawdust when the horse died. Two years had gone by since that passing; an interregnum in transportation during which Penrod's father was \u201cthinking\u201d (he explained sometimes) of an automobile."}, {"size": 783, "text": "Meanwhile, the gifted and generous sawdust-box had served brilliantly in war and peace: it was Penrod's stronghold. There was a partially defaced sign upon the front wall of the box; the donjon-keep had known mercantile impulses: The O. K. RaBiT Co. PENROD ScHoFiELD AND CO. iNQuiRE FOR PRicEs This was a venture of the preceding vacation, and had netted, at one time, an accrued and owed profit of $1.38. Prospects had been brightest on the very eve of cataclysm. The storeroom was locked and guarded, but twenty-seven rabbits and Belgian hares, old and young, had perished here on a single night--through no human agency, but in a foray of cats, the besiegers treacherously tunnelling up through the sawdust from the small aperture which opened into the stall beyond the partition."}, {"size": 875, "text": "Commerce has its martyrs. Penrod climbed upon a barrel, stood on tiptoe, grasped the rim of the box; then, using a knot-hole as a stirrup, threw one leg over the top, drew himself up, and dropped within. Standing upon the packed sawdust, he was just tall enough to see over the top. Duke had not followed him into the storeroom, but remained near the open doorway in a concave and pessimistic attitude. Penrod felt in a dark corner of the box and laid hands upon a simple apparatus consisting of an old bushel-basket with a few yards of clothes-line tied to each of its handles. He passed the ends of the lines over a big spool, which revolved upon an axle of wire suspended from a beam overhead, and, with the aid of this improvised pulley, lowered the empty basket until it came to rest in an upright position upon the floor of the storeroom at the foot of the sawdust-box."}, {"size": 627, "text": "\u201cEleva-ter!\u201d shouted Penrod. \u201cTing-ting!\u201d Duke, old and intelligently apprehensive, approached slowly, in a semicircular manner, deprecatingly, but with courtesy. He pawed the basket delicately; then, as if that were all his master had expected of him, uttered one bright bark, sat down, and looked up triumphantly. His hypocrisy was shallow: many a horrible quarter of an hour had taught him his duty in this matter. \u201cEl-e-VAY-ter!\u201d shouted Penrod sternly. \u201cYou want me to come down there to you?\u201d Duke looked suddenly haggard. He pawed the basket feebly again and, upon another outburst from on high, prostrated himself flat."}, {"size": 843, "text": "Again threatened, he gave a superb impersonation of a worm. \u201cYou get in that el-e-VAY-ter!\u201d Reckless with despair, Duke jumped into the basket, landing in a dishevelled posture, which he did not alter until he had been drawn up and poured out upon the floor of sawdust with the box. There, shuddering, he lay in doughnut shape and presently slumbered. It was dark in the box, a condition that might have been remedied by sliding back a small wooden panel on runners, which would have let in ample light from the alley; but Penrod Schofield had more interesting means of illumination. He knelt, and from a former soap-box, in a corner, took a lantern, without a chimney, and a large oil-can, the leak in the latter being so nearly imperceptible that its banishment from household use had seemed to Penrod as inexplicable as it was providential."}, {"size": 620, "text": "He shook the lantern near his ear: nothing splashed; there was no sound but a dry clinking. But there was plenty of kerosene in the can; and he filled the lantern, striking a match to illumine the operation. Then he lit the lantern and hung it upon a nail against the wall. The sawdust floor was slightly impregnated with oil, and the open flame quivered in suggestive proximity to the side of the box; however, some rather deep charrings of the plank against which the lantern hung offered evidence that the arrangement was by no means a new one, and indicated at least a possibility of no fatality occurring this time."}, {"size": 753, "text": "Next, Penrod turned up the surface of the sawdust in another corner of the floor, and drew forth a cigar-box in which were half a dozen cigarettes, made of hayseed and thick brown wrapping paper, a lead-pencil, an eraser, and a small note-book, the cover of which was labelled in his own handwriting: \u201cEnglish Grammar. Penrod Schofield. Room 6, Ward School Nomber Seventh.\u201d The first page of this book was purely academic; but the study of English undefiled terminated with a slight jar at the top of the second: \u201cNor must an adverb be used to modif----\u201d Immediately followed: \u201cHARoLD RAMoREZ THE RoADAGENT OR WiLD LiFE AMoNG THE ROCKY MTS.\u201d And the subsequent entries in the book appeared to have little concern with Room 6, Ward School Nomber Seventh."}, {"size": 833, "text": "The author of \u201cHarold Ramorez,\u201d etc., lit one of the hayseed cigarettes, seated himself comfortably, with his back against the wall and his right shoulder just under the lantern, elevated his knees to support the note-book, turned to a blank page, and wrote, slowly and earnestly: He took a knife from his pocket, and, broodingly, his eyes upon the inward embryos of vision, sharpened his pencil. After that, he extended a foot and meditatively rubbed Duke's back with the side of his shoe. Creation, with Penrod, did not leap, full-armed, from the brain; but finally he began to produce. He wrote very slowly at first, and then with increasing rapidity; faster and faster, gathering momentum and growing more and more fevered as he sped, till at last the true fire came, without which no lamp of real literature may be made to burn."}, {"size": 828, "text": "Mr. Wilson reched for his gun but our hero had him covred and soon said Well I guess you don't come any of that on me my freind.

His eyes were shining: there was a rapt sweetness in his gaze. As he wrote, his burden had grown lighter; thoughts of Mrs. Lora Rewbush had almost left him; and in particular as he recounted (even by the chaste dash) the annoyed expressions of Mr. Wilson, the wounded detective, and the silken moustached mule-driver, he had felt mysteriously relieved concerning the Child Sir Lancelot. Altogether he looked a better and a brighter boy."}, {"size": 807, "text": "The rapt look faded slowly. He sighed, but moved not. \u201cPenrod! We're having lunch early just on your account, so you'll have plenty of time to be dressed for the pageant. Hurry!\u201d There was silence in Penrod's aerie. Mrs. Schofields voice sounded nearer, indicating a threatened approach. Penrod bestirred himself: he blew out the lantern, and shouted plaintively: \u201cWell, ain't I coming fast's I can?\u201d \u201cDo hurry,\u201d returned the voice, withdrawing; and the kitchen door could be heard to close. Languidly, Penrod proceeded to set his house in order. Replacing his manuscript and pencil in the cigar-box, he carefully buried the box in the sawdust, put the lantern and oil-can back in the soap-box, adjusted the elevator for the reception of Duke, and, in no uncertain tone, invited the devoted animal to enter."}, {"size": 801, "text": "Duke stretched himself amiably, affecting not to hear; and when this pretence became so obvious that even a dog could keep it up no longer, sat down in a corner, facing it, his back to his master, and his head perpendicular, nose upward, supported by the convergence of the two walls. This, from a dog, is the last word, the comble of the immutable. Penrod commanded, stormed, tried gentleness; persuaded with honeyed words and pictured rewards. Duke's eyes looked backward; otherwise he moved not. Time elapsed. Penrod stooped to flattery, finally to insincere caresses; then, losing patience spouted sudden threats. Duke remained immovable, frozen fast to his great gesture of implacable despair. A footstep sounded on the threshold of the store-room. \u201cPenrod, come down from that box this instant!\u201d"}, {"size": 876, "text": "\u201cAre you up in that sawdust-box again?\u201d As Mrs. Schofield had just heard her son's voice issue from the box, and also, as she knew he was there anyhow, her question must have been put for oratorical purposes only. \u201cBecause if you are,\u201d she continued promptly, \u201cI'm going to ask your papa not to let you play there any----\u201d Penrod's forehead, his eyes, the tops of his ears, and most of his hair, became visible to her at the top of the box. \u201cI ain't 'playing!'\u201d he said indignantly. \u201cWell, what ARE you doing?\u201d \u201cJust coming down,\u201d he replied, in a grieved but patient tone. \u201cThen why don't you COME?\u201d \u201cI got Duke here.

Duke sprang out in tumultuous relief, and bestowed frantic affection upon his master as the latter slid down from the box."}, {"size": 512, "text": "Penrod dusted himself sketchily, experiencing a sense of satisfaction, dulled by the overhanging afternoon, perhaps, but perceptible: he had the feeling of one who has been true to a cause. The operation of the elevator was unsinful and, save for the shock to Duke's nervous system, it was harmless; but Penrod could not possibly have brought himself to exhibit it in the presence of his mother or any other grown person in the world. The reasons for secrecy were undefined; at least, Penrod did not define them."}, {"size": 739, "text": "CHAPTER III THE COSTUME After lunch his mother and his sister Margaret, a pretty girl of nineteen, dressed him for the sacrifice. They stood him near his mother's bedroom window and did what they would to him.During the earlier anguishes of the process he was mute, exceeding the pathos of the stricken calf in the shambles; but a student of eyes might have perceived in his soul the premonitory symptoms of a sinister uprising. At a rehearsal (in citizens' clothes) attended by mothers and grown-up sisters, Mrs. Lora Rewbush had announced that she wished the costuming to be \u201cas medieval and artistic as possible.\u201d Otherwise, and as to details, she said, she would leave the costumes entirely to the good taste of the children's parents."}, {"size": 649, "text": "Mrs. Schofield and Margaret were no archeologists, but they knew that their taste was as good as that of other mothers and sisters concerned; so with perfect confidence they had planned and executed a costume for Penrod; and the only misgiving they felt was connected with the tractability of the Child Sir Lancelot himself. Stripped to his underwear, he had been made to wash himself vehemently; then they began by shrouding his legs in a pair of silk stockings, once blue but now mostly whitish. Upon Penrod they visibly surpassed mere ampleness; but they were long, and it required only a rather loose imagination to assume that they were tights."}, {"size": 614, "text": "The upper part of his body was next concealed from view by a garment so peculiar that its description becomes difficult. In 1886, Mrs. Schofield, then unmarried, had worn at her \u201ccoming-out party\u201d a dress of vivid salmon silk which had been remodelled after her marriage to accord with various epochs of fashion until a final, unskilful campaign at a dye-house had left it in a condition certain to attract much attention to the wearer. Mrs. Schofield had considered giving it to Della, the cook; but had decided not to do so, because you never could tell how Della was going to take things, and cooks were scarce."}, {"size": 606, "text": "It may have been the word \u201cmedieval\u201d (in Mrs. Lora Rewbush's rich phrase) which had inspired the idea for a last conspicuous usefulness; at all events, the bodice of that once salmon dress, somewhat modified and moderated, now took a position, for its farewell appearance in society, upon the back, breast, and arms of the Child Sir Lancelot. The area thus costumed ceased at the waist, leaving a Jaeger-like and unmedieval gap thence to the tops of the stockings. The inventive genius of woman triumphantly bridged it, but in a manner which imposes upon history almost insuperable delicacies of narration."}, {"size": 670, "text": "Penrod's father was an old-fashioned man: the twentieth century had failed to shake his faith in red flannel for cold weather; and it was while Mrs. Schofield was putting away her husband's winter underwear that she perceived how hopelessly one of the elder specimens had dwindled; and simultaneously she received the inspiration which resulted in a pair of trunks for the Child Sir Lancelot, and added an earnest bit of colour, as well as a genuine touch of the Middle Ages, to his costume. Reversed, fore to aft, with the greater part of the legs cut off, and strips of silver braid covering the seams, this garment, she felt, was not traceable to its original source."}, {"size": 637, "text": "When it had been placed upon Penrod, the stockings were attached to it by a system of safety-pins, not very perceptible at a distance. Next, after being severely warned against stooping, Penrod got his feet into the slippers he wore to dancing-school--\u201cpatent-leather pumps\u201d now decorated with large pink rosettes. \u201cIf I can't stoop,\u201d he began, smolderingly, \u201cI'd like to know how'm I goin' to kneel in the pag----\u201d \u201cYou must MANAGE!\u201d This, uttered through pins, was evidently thought to be sufficient. They fastened some ruching about his slender neck, pinned ribbons at random all over him, and then Margaret thickly powdered his hair."}, {"size": 641, "text": "\u201cOh, yes, that's all right,\u201d she said, replying to a question put by her mother. \u201cThey always powdered their hair in Colonial times.\u201d \u201cIt doesn't seem right to me--exactly,\u201d objected Mrs. Schofield, gently. \u201cSir Lancelot must have been ever so long before Colonial times.\u201d \u201cThat doesn't matter,\u201d Margaret reassured her. \u201cNobody'll know the difference--Mrs. Lora Rewbush least of all. I don't think she knows a thing about it, though, of course, she does write splendidly and the words of the pageant are just beautiful. Stand still, Penrod!\u201d (The author of \u201cHarold Ramorez\u201d had moved convulsively.) \u201cBesides, powdered hair's always becoming."}, {"size": 702, "text": "Look at him. You'd hardly know it was Penrod!\u201d The pride and admiration with which she pronounced this undeniable truth might have been thought tactless, but Penrod, not analytical, found his spirits somewhat elevated. No mirror was in his range of vision and, though he had submitted to cursory measurements of his person a week earlier, he had no previous acquaintance with the costume. He began to form a not unpleasing mental picture of his appearance, something somewhere between the portraits of George Washington and a vivid memory of Miss Julia Marlowe at a matinee of \u201cTwelfth Night.\u201d He was additionally cheered by a sword which had been borrowed from a neighbor, who was a Knight of Pythias."}, {"size": 779, "text": "Finally there was a mantle, an old golf cape of Margaret's. Fluffy polka-dots of white cotton had been sewed to it generously; also it was ornamented with a large cross of red flannel, suggested by the picture of a Crusader in a newspaper advertisement. The mantle was fastened to Penrod's shoulder (that is, to the shoulder of Mrs. Schofield's ex-bodice) by means of large safety-pins, and arranged to hang down behind him, touching his heels, but obscuring nowise the glory of his facade. Then, at last, he was allowed to step before a mirror. It was a full-length glass, and the worst immediately happened. It might have been a little less violent, perhaps, if Penrod's expectations had not been so richly and poetically idealized; but as things were, the revolt was volcanic."}, {"size": 675, "text": "Victor Hugo's account of the fight with the devil-fish, in \u201cToilers of the Sea,\u201d encourages a belief that, had Hugo lived and increased in power, he might have been equal to a proper recital of the half hour which followed Penrod's first sight of himself as the Child Sir Lancelot. But Mr. Wilson himself, dastard but eloquent foe of Harold Ramorez, could not have expressed, with all the vile dashes at his command, the sentiments which animated Penrod's bosom when the instantaneous and unalterable conviction descended upon him that he was intended by his loved ones to make a public spectacle of himself in his sister's stockings and part of an old dress of his mother's."}, {"size": 764, "text": "To him these familiar things were not disguised at all; there seemed no possibility that the whole world would not know them at a glance. The stockings were worse than the bodice. He had been assured that these could not be recognized, but, seeing them in the mirror, he was sure that no human eye could fail at first glance to detect the difference between himself and the former purposes of these stockings. Fold, wrinkle, and void shrieked their history with a hundred tongues, invoking earthquake, eclipse, and blue ruin. The frantic youth's final submission was obtained only after a painful telephonic conversation between himself and his father, the latter having been called up and upon, by the exhausted Mrs. Schofield, to subjugate his offspring by wire."}, {"size": 860, "text": "The two ladies made all possible haste, after this, to deliver Penrod into the hands of Mrs. Lora Rewbush; nevertheless, they found opportunity to exchange earnest congratulations upon his not having recognized the humble but serviceable paternal garment now brilliant about the Lancelotish middle. Altogether, they felt that the costume was a success. Penrod looked like nothing ever remotely imagined by Sir Thomas Malory or Alfred Tennyson;--for that matter, he looked like nothing ever before seen on earth; but as Mrs. Schofield and Margaret took their places in the audience at the Women's Arts and Guild Hall, the anxiety they felt concerning Penrod's elocutionary and gesticular powers, so soon to be put to public test, was pleasantly tempered by their satisfaction that, owing to their efforts, his outward appearance would be a credit to the family."}, {"size": 837, "text": "CHAPTER IV DESPERATIONThe Child Sir Lancelot found himself in a large anteroom behind the stage--a room crowded with excited children, all about equally medieval and artistic. Penrod was less conspicuous than he thought himself, but he was so preoccupied with his own shame, steeling his nerves to meet the first inevitable taunting reference to his sister's stockings, that he failed to perceive there were others present in much of his own unmanned condition. Retiring to a corner, immediately upon his entrance, he managed to unfasten the mantle at the shoulders, and, drawing it round him, pinned it again at his throat so that it concealed the rest of his costume. This permitted a temporary relief, but increased his horror of the moment when, in pursuance of the action of the \u201cpageant,\u201d the sheltering garment must be cast aside."}, {"size": 655, "text": "Some of the other child knights were also keeping their mantles close about them. A few of the envied opulent swung brilliant fabrics from their shoulders, airily, showing off hired splendours from a professional costumer's stock, while one or two were insulting examples of parental indulgence, particularly little Maurice Levy, the Child Sir Galahad. This shrinking person went clamorously about, making it known everywhere that the best tailor in town had been dazzled by a great sum into constructing his costume. It consisted of blue velvet knickerbockers, a white satin waistcoat, and a beautifully cut little swallow-tailed coat with pearl buttons."}, {"size": 655, "text": "The medieval and artistic triumph was completed by a mantle of yellow velvet, and little white boots, sporting gold tassels. All this radiance paused in a brilliant career and addressed the Child Sir Lancelot, gathering an immediately formed semicircular audience of little girls. Woman was ever the trailer of magnificence. \u201cWhat YOU got on?\u201d inquired Mr. Levy, after dispensing information. \u201cWhat you got on under that ole golf cape?\u201d Penrod looked upon him coldly. At other times his questioner would have approached him with deference, even with apprehension. But to-day the Child Sir Galahad was somewhat intoxicated with the power of his own beauty."}, {"size": 641, "text": "\u201cWhat YOU got on?\u201d he repeated. \u201cOh, nothin',\u201d said Penrod, with an indifference assumed at great cost to his nervous system.

He's nakid.\u201d The indelicate little girls giggled delightedly, and a javelin pierced the inwards of Penrod when he saw that the Child Elaine, amber-curled and beautiful Marjorie Jones, lifted golden laughter to the horrid jest.

Little knights and ladies of the Table Round would not make so much noise. Now children, we must begin to take our places on the stage. Is everybody here?\u201d Penrod made his escape under cover of this diversion: he slid behind Mrs. Lora Rewbush, and being near a door, opened it unnoticed and went out quickly, closing it behind him. He found himself in a narrow and vacant hallway which led to a door marked \u201cJanitor's Room.\u201d Burning with outrage, heart-sick at the sweet, cold-blooded laughter of Marjorie Jones, Penrod rested his elbows upon a window-sill and speculated upon the effects of a leap from the second story."}, {"size": 639, "text": "One of the reasons he gave it up was his desire to live on Maurice Levy's account: already he was forming educational plans for the Child Sir Galahad.

Slowly recognition dawned in his eyes. The Schofields' house stood on a corner at the intersection of two main-travelled streets; the fence was low, and the publicity obtained by the washable portion of the family apparel, on Mondays, had often been painful to Penrod; for boys have a peculiar sensitiveness in these matters.

The whole town, he was convinced, knew these garments intimately and derisively. And now, as he sat in the janitor's chair, the horrible and paralyzing recognition came. He had not an instant's doubt that every fellow actor, as well as every soul in the audience, would recognize what his mother and sister had put upon him."}, {"size": 839, "text": "For as the awful truth became plain to himself it seemed blazoned to the world; and far, far louder than the stockings, the trunks did fairly bellow the grisly secret: WHOSE they were and WHAT they were! Most people have suffered in a dream the experience of finding themselves very inadequately clad in the midst of a crowd of well-dressed people, and such dreamers' sensations are comparable to Penrod's, though faintly, because Penrod was awake and in much too full possession of the most active capacities for anguish. A human male whose dress has been damaged, or reveals some vital lack, suffers from a hideous and shameful loneliness which makes every second absolutely unbearable until he is again as others of his sex and species; and there is no act or sin whatever too desperate for him in his struggle to attain that condition."}, {"size": 303, "text": "Also, there is absolutely no embarrassment possible to a woman which is comparable to that of a man under corresponding circumstances and in this a boy is a man.

He extracted it frenziedly, which brought to his ears a protracted and sonorous ripping, too easily located by a final gesture of horror. \u201cPenrod Schofield!\u201d Mrs. Lora Rewbush had come out into the hallway.

I have but kindest thoughts each day. I give my riches to the poor, And follow in the Master's way.\u201d This elicited tokens of approval from the Child King Arthur, and he bade Maurice \u201cstand forth\u201d and come near the throne, a command obeyed with the easy grace of conscious merit."}, {"size": 628, "text": "It was Penrod's turn.

His most repulsive speech (that in which he proclaimed himself a \u201ctot\u201d) was over and done with; and now at last the small, moist hand of the Child Sir Galahad lay within his own.

It was almost as unforgettable as the sight which caused it; the word \u201csight\u201d being here used in its vernacular sense, for Penrod, standing unmantled and revealed in all the medieval and artistic glory of the janitor's blue overalls, falls within its meaning."}, {"size": 840, "text": "The janitor was a heavy man, and his overalls, upon Penrod, were merely oceanic. The boy was at once swaddled and lost within their blue gulfs and vast saggings; and the left leg, too hastily rolled up, had descended with a distinctively elephantine effect, as Margaret had observed. Certainly, the Child Sir Lancelot was at least a sight. It is probable that a great many in that hall must have had, even then, a consciousness that they were looking on at History in the Making. A supreme act is recognizable at sight: it bears the birthmark of immortality. But Penrod, that marvellous boy, had begun to declaim, even with the gesture of flinging off his mantle for the accolade: \u201cI first, the Child Sir Lancelot du Lake, Will volunteer to knighthood take, And kneeling here before your throne I vow to----\u201d He finished his speech unheard."}, {"size": 734, "text": "The audience had recovered breath, but had lost self-control, and there ensued something later described by a participant as a sort of cultured riot.

A few precocious geniuses perceived that the overalls were the Child Lancelot's own comment on maternal intentions; and these were profoundly impressed: they regarded him with the grisly admiration of young and ambitious criminals for a jail-mate about to be distinguished by hanging.

The neighbourhood of Mrs. Schofield and Margaret became, tactfully, a desert.

He leaned against the fence, sighed profoundly, and gazed at Duke, his wistful dog. The sigh was reminiscent: episodes of simple pathos were passing before his inward eye. About the most painful was the vision of lovely Marjorie Jones, weeping with rage as the Child Sir Lancelot was dragged, insatiate, from the prostrate and howling Child Sir Galahad, after an onslaught delivered the precise instant the curtain began to fall upon the demoralized \u201cpageant.\u201d And then--oh, pangs!"}, {"size": 765, "text": "oh, woman!--she slapped at the ruffian's cheek, as he was led past her by a resentful janitor; and turning, flung her arms round the Child Sir Galahad's neck. \u201cPENROD SCHOFIELD, DON'T YOU DARE EVER SPEAK TO ME AGAIN AS LONG AS YOU LIVE!\u201d Maurice's little white boots and gold tassels had done their work. At home the late Child Sir Lancelot was consigned to a locked clothes-closet pending the arrival of his father. Mr. Schofield came and, shortly after, there was put into practice an old patriarchal custom. It is a custom of inconceivable antiquity: probably primordial, certainly prehistoric, but still in vogue in some remaining citadels of the ancient simplicities of the Republic.

Looking back to the sawdust-box, fancy pictures this comparable adult a serious and inventive writer engaged in congenial literary activities in a private retreat.

Finally, we must behold: imprisonment by the authorities; the third degree and flagellation. We conceive our man decided that his career had been perhaps too eventful. Yet Penrod had condensed all of it into eight hours. It appears that he had at least some shadowy perception of a recent fulness of life, for, as he leaned against the fence, gazing upon his wistful Duke, he sighed again and murmured aloud: \u201cWELL, HASN'T THIS BEEN"}, {"size": 289, "text": "A DAY!\u201d But in a little while a star came out, freshly lighted, from the highest part of the sky, and Penrod, looking up, noticed it casually and a little drowsily.

It was a sigh of pure ennui."}, {"size": 713, "text": "CHAPTER VII EVILS OF DRINK Next day, Penrod acquired a dime by a simple and antique process which was without doubt sometimes practised by the boys of Babylon. When the teacher of his class in Sunday-school requested the weekly contribution, Penrod, fumbling honestly (at first) in the wrong pockets, managed to look so embarrassed that the gentle lady told him not to mind, and said she was often forgetful herself. She was so sweet about it that, looking into the future, Penrod began to feel confident of a small but regular income. At the close of the afternoon services he did not go home, but proceeded to squander the funds just withheld from China upon an orgy of the most pungently forbidden description."}, {"size": 672, "text": "In a Drug Emporium, near the church, he purchased a five-cent sack of candy consisting for the most part of the heavily flavoured hoofs of horned cattle, but undeniably substantial, and so generously capable of resisting solution that the purchaser must needs be avaricious beyond reason who did not realize his money's worth. Equipped with this collation, Penrod contributed his remaining nickel to a picture show, countenanced upon the seventh day by the legal but not the moral authorities. Here, in cozy darkness, he placidly insulted his liver with jaw-breaker upon jaw-breaker from the paper sack, and in a surfeit of content watched the silent actors on the screen."}, {"size": 682, "text": "One film made a lasting impression upon him.

Their faces were noble and benevolent. But the lithographs offered the only rest for the eyes of children fatigued by the everlasting sameness of the schoolroom.

Never, while the children of that schoolroom lived, would they be able to forget one detail of the four lithographs: the hand of Longfellow was fixed, for them, forever, in his beard.

Victorine's back was as familiar to Penrod as the necktie of Oliver Wendell Holmes. So was her gayly coloured plaid waist. He hated the waist as he hated Victorine herself, without knowing why.

It was there now. Thoughtfully, he took the braid between thumb and forefinger, and, without disturbing Victorine, dipped the end of it and the green ribbon into the inkwell of his desk.

Several boys and girls were sent to the blackboard, and Penrod, spared for the moment, followed their operations a little while with his eyes, but not with his mind; then, sinking deeper in his seat, limply abandoned the effort. His eyes remained open, but saw nothing; the routine of the arithmetic lesson reached his ears in familiar, meaningless sounds, but he heard nothing; and yet, this time, he was profoundly occupied."}, {"size": 754, "text": "He had drifted away from the painful land of facts, and floated now in a new sea of fancy which he had just discovered.

That curtain is almost sound-proof, too, and causes more throat-trouble among parents than is suspected. The nervous monotony of the schoolroom inspires a sometimes unbearable longing for something astonishing to happen, and as every boy's fundamental desire is to do something astonishing himself, so as to be the centre of all human interest and awe, it was natural that Penrod should discover in fancy the delightful secret of self-levitation."}, {"size": 629, "text": "He found, in this curious series of imaginings, during the lesson in arithmetic, that the atmosphere may be navigated as by a swimmer under water, but with infinitely greater ease and with perfect comfort in breathing.

Miss Spence--in the flesh--had directed toward the physical body of the absent Penrod an inquiry as to the fractional consequences of dividing seventeen apples, fairly, among three boys, and she was surprised and displeased to receive no answer although to the best of her knowledge and belief, he was looking fixedly at her."}, {"size": 234, "text": "She repeated her question crisply, without visible effect; then summoned him by name with increasing asperity.

The school shivered in ecstatic horror, every fascinated eye upon him; yet there was not a soul in the room but was profoundly grateful to him for the sensation--including the offended teacher herself.

It was hard enough for Penrod to keep step with a girl of his size. The foreboding vision remained with him, increasing in vividness, throughout the forenoon. He found himself unable to fix his mind upon anything else, and, having bent his gloomy footsteps toward the sawdust-box, after breakfast, presently descended therefrom, abandoning Harold Ramorez where he had left him the preceding Saturday.

Penrod sprang to his feet, seized the licorice bottle, shook it with stoppering thumb, and took a long drink with histrionic unction. \u201cWhat you doin'?\u201d asked Maurice for the third time, Sam Williams not having decided upon a reply. It was Penrod who answered. \u201cDrinkin' lickrish water,\u201d he said simply, and wiped his mouth with such delicious enjoyment that Sam's jaded thirst was instantly stimulated. He took the bottle eagerly from Penrod. \u201cA-a-h!\u201d exclaimed Penrod, smacking his lips."}, {"size": 642, "text": "\u201cThat was a good un!\u201d The eyes above the fence glistened. \u201cAsk him if he don't want some,\u201d Penrod whispered urgently. \u201cQuit drinkin' it! It's no good any more. Ask him!\u201d \u201cWhat for?\u201d demanded the practical Sam. \u201cGo on and ask him!\u201d whispered Penrod fiercely. \u201cSay, M'rice!\u201d Sam called, waving the bottle. \u201cWant some?\u201d \u201cBring it here!\u201d Mr. Levy requested. \u201cCome on over and get some,\u201d returned Sam, being prompted. \u201cI can't. Penrod Schofield's after me.\u201d \u201cNo, I'm not,\u201d said Penrod reassuringly. \u201cI won't touch you, M'rice. I made up with you yesterday afternoon--don't you remember? You're all right with me, M'rice.\u201d Maurice looked undecided."}, {"size": 635, "text": "But Penrod had the delectable bottle again, and tilting it above his lips, affected to let the cool liquid purl enrichingly into him, while with his right hand he stroked his middle facade ineffably. Maurice's mouth watered. \u201cHere!\u201d cried Sam, stirred again by the superb manifestations of his friend. \u201cGimme that!\u201d Penrod brought the bottle down, surprisingly full after so much gusto, but withheld it from Sam; and the two scuffled for its possession. Nothing in the world could have so worked upon the desire of the yearning observer beyond the fence. \u201cHonest, Penrod--you ain't goin' to touch me if I come in your yard?\u201d he called."}, {"size": 833, "text": "\u201cHonest?\u201d \u201cCross my heart!\u201d answered Penrod, holding the bottle away from Sam. \u201cAnd we'll let you drink all you want.\u201d Maurice hastily climbed the fence, and while he was thus occupied Mr. Samuel Williams received a great enlightenment. With startling rapidity Penrod, standing just outside the storeroom door, extended his arm within the room, deposited the licorice water upon the counter of the drug store, seized in its stead the bottle of smallpox medicine, and extended it cordially toward the advancing Maurice. Genius is like that--great, simple, broad strokes! Dazzled, Mr. Samuel Williams leaned against the wall. He had the sensations of one who comes suddenly into the presence of a chef-d'oeuvre. Perhaps his first coherent thought was that almost universal one on such huge occasions: \u201cWhy couldn't _I_ have done that!\u201d"}, {"size": 685, "text": "Sam might have been even more dazzled had he guessed that he figured not altogether as a spectator in the sweeping and magnificent conception of the new Talleyrand. Sam had no partner for the cotillon. If Maurice was to be absent from that festivity--as it began to seem he might be--Penrod needed a male friend to take care of Miss Rennsdale and he believed he saw his way to compel Mr. Williams to be that male friend. For this he relied largely upon the prospective conduct of Miss Rennsdale when he should get the matter before her--he was inclined to believe she would favour the exchange. As for Talleyrand Penrod himself, he was going to dance that cotillon with Marjorie Jones!"}, {"size": 755, "text": "\u201cYou can have all you can drink at one pull, M'rice,\u201d said Penrod kindly. \u201cYou said I could have all I want!\u201d protested Maurice, reaching for the bottle. \u201cNo, I didn't,\u201d returned Penrod quickly, holding it away from the eager hand. \u201cHe did, too!

Penrod and Sam leaned forward in breathless excitement. They had feared Maurice might smell the contents of the bottle; but that danger was past--this was the crucial moment. Their fondest hope was that he would make his first swallow a voracious one--it was impossible to imagine a second. They expected one big, gulping swallow and then an explosion, with fountain effects. Little they knew the mettle of their man! Maurice swallowed once; he swallowed twice--and thrice--and he continued to swallow! No Adam's apple was sculptured on that juvenile throat, but the internal progress of the liquid was not a whit the less visible."}, {"size": 806, "text": "His eyes gleamed with cunning and malicious triumph, sidewise, at the stunned conspirators; he was fulfilling the conditions of the draught, not once breaking the thread of that marvelous swallering. His audience stood petrified. Already Maurice had swallowed more than they had given Duke and still the liquor receded in the uplifted bottle! And now the clear glass gleamed above the dark contents full half the vessel's length--and Maurice went on drinking! Slowly the clear glass increased in its dimensions--slowly the dark diminished. Sam Williams made a horrified movement to check him--but Maurice protested passionately with his disengaged arm, and made vehement vocal noises remindful of the contract; whereupon Sam desisted and watched the continuing performance in a state of grisly fascination."}, {"size": 633, "text": "Maurice drank it all! He drained the last drop and threw the bottle in the air, uttering loud ejaculations of triumph and satisfaction. \u201cHah!\u201d he cried, blowing out his cheeks, inflating his chest, squaring his shoulders, patting his stomach, and wiping his mouth contentedly. \u201cHah! Aha! Waha! Wafwah! But that was good!\u201d The two boys stood looking at him in stupor. \u201cWell, I gotta say this,\u201d said Maurice graciously: \u201cYou stuck to your bargain all right and treated me fair.\u201d Stricken with a sudden horrible suspicion, Penrod entered the storeroom in one stride and lifted the bottle of licorice water to his nose--then to his lips."}, {"size": 643, "text": "It was weak, but good; he had made no mistake. And Maurice had really drained--to the dregs--the bottle of old hair tonics, dead catsups, syrups of undesirable preserves, condemned extracts of vanilla and lemon, decayed chocolate, ex-essence of beef, mixed dental preparations, aromatic spirits of ammonia, spirits of nitre, alcohol, arnica, quinine, ipecac, sal volatile, nux vomica and licorice water-- with traces of arsenic, belladonna and strychnine.

Maurice lit his cigarette and puffed showily. \u201cWell, sir,\u201d he remarked, \u201cyou fellers are certainly square--I gotta say that much. Honest, Penrod, I thought you was after me! I did think so,\u201d he added sunnily; \u201cbut now I guess you like me, or else you wouldn't of stuck to it about lettin' me drink it all if I kept on swallering.\u201d He chatted on with complete geniality, smoking his cigarette in content.

You're the kind of fellers I like.\u201d Penrod's jaw fell; Sam's mouth had been open all the time. Neither spoke. \u201cI gotta go,\u201d observed Maurice, consulting a handsome watch. \u201cGotta get dressed for the cotillon right after lunch. Come on, Sam.

Maurice was talking volubly, with much gesticulation, as they went; but Sam walked mechanically and in silence, staring at his brisk companion and keeping at a little distance from him. They passed from sight, Maurice still conversing gayly--and Penrod slowly betook himself into the house, his head bowed upon his chest. Some three hours later, Mr. Samuel Williams, waxen clean and in sweet raiment, made his reappearance in Penrod's yard, yodelling a code-signal to summon forth his friend."}, {"size": 518, "text": "He yodelled loud, long, and frequently, finally securing a faint response from the upper air. \u201cWhere are you?\u201d shouted Mr. Williams, his roving glance searching ambient heights. Another low-spirited yodel reaching his ear, he perceived the head and shoulders of his friend projecting above the roofridge of the stable. The rest of Penrod's body was concealed from view, reposing upon the opposite slant of the gable and precariously secured by the crooking of his elbows over the ridge. \u201cYay!

Maurice, sitting shining and joyous beside her, saw both boys and waved them a hearty greeting as the car turned the corner. Penrod uttered some muffled words and then waved both arms--either in response or as an expression of his condition of mind; it may have been a gesture of despair."}, {"size": 837, "text": "How much intention there was in this act--obviously so rash, considering the position he occupied--it is impossible to say. Undeniably there must remain a suspicion of deliberate purpose. Della screamed and Sam shouted. Penrod had disappeared from view.

Mrs. Schofield hurriedly left the ballroom; while Miss Rennsdale, flushing with sudden happiness, curtsied profoundly to Professor Bartet and obtained his attention. \u201cI have telled you fifty times,\u201d he informed her passionately ere she spoke, \u201cI cannot make no such changes. If your partner comes you have to dance with him. You are going to drive me crazy, sure! What is it? What now?

He arrived about twenty minutes late, limping deeply, his brave young mouth drawn with pain, and the sensation he created must have been a solace to him; the only possible criticism of this entrance being that it was just a shade too heroic. Perhaps for that reason it failed to stagger Miss Spence, a woman so saturated with suspicion that she penalized Penrod for tardiness as promptly and as coldly as if he had been a mere, ordinary, unmutilated boy."}, {"size": 613, "text": "Nor would she entertain any discussion of the justice of her ruling. It seemed, almost, that she feared to argue with him. However, the distinction of cane and limp remained to him, consolations which he protracted far into the week--until Thursday evening, in fact, when Mr. Schofield, observing from a window his son's pursuit of Duke round and round the backyard, confiscated the cane, with the promise that it should not remain idle if he saw Penrod limping again. Thus, succeeding a depressing Friday, another Saturday brought the necessity for new inventions. It was a scented morning in apple-blossom time."}, {"size": 608, "text": "At about ten of the clock Penrod emerged hastily from the kitchen door. His pockets bulged abnormally; so did his checks, and he swallowed with difficulty. A threatening mop, wielded by a cooklike arm in a checkered sleeve, followed him through the doorway, and he was preceded by a small, hurried, wistful dog with a warm doughnut in his mouth. The kitchen door slammed petulantly, enclosing the sore voice of Della, whereupon Penrod and Duke seated themselves upon the pleasant sward and immediately consumed the spoils of their raid. From the cross-street which formed the side boundary of the Schofields'"}, {"size": 884, "text": "ample yard came a jingle of harness and the cadenced clatter of a pair of trotting horses, and Penrod, looking up, beheld the passing of a fat acquaintance, torpid amid the conservative splendours of a rather old-fashioned victoria. This was Roderick Magsworth Bitts, Junior, a fellow sufferer at the Friday Afternoon Dancing Class, but otherwise not often a companion: a home-sheltered lad, tutored privately and preserved against the coarsening influences of rude comradeship and miscellaneous information. Heavily overgrown in all physical dimensions, virtuous, and placid, this cloistered mutton was wholly uninteresting to Penrod Schofield. Nevertheless, Roderick Magsworth Bitts, Junior, was a personage on account of the importance of the Magsworth Bitts family; and it was Penrod's destiny to increase Roderick's celebrity far, far beyond its present aristocratic limitations."}, {"size": 726, "text": "The Magsworth Bittses were important because they were impressive; there was no other reason. And they were impressive because they believed themselves important. The adults of the family were impregnably formal; they dressed with reticent elegance, and wore the same nose and the same expression--an expression which indicated that they knew something exquisite and sacred which other people could never know. Other people, in their presence, were apt to feel mysteriously ignoble and to become secretly uneasy about ancestors, gloves, and pronunciation. The Magsworth Bitts manner was withholding and reserved, though sometimes gracious, granting small smiles as great favours and giving off a chilling kind of preciousness."}, {"size": 644, "text": "Naturally, when any citizen of the community did anything unconventional or improper, or made a mistake, or had a relative who went wrong, that citizen's first and worst fear was that the Magsworth Bittses would hear of it. In fact, this painful family had for years terrorized the community, though the community had never realized that it was terrorized, and invariably spoke of the family as the \u201cmost charming circle in town.\u201d By common consent, Mrs. Roderick Magsworth Bitts officiated as the supreme model as well as critic-in-chief of morals and deportment for all the unlucky people prosperous enough to be elevated to her acquaintance."}, {"size": 704, "text": "Magsworth was the important part of the name. Mrs. Roderick Magsworth Bitts was a Magsworth born, herself, and the Magsworth crest decorated not only Mrs. Magsworth Bitts' note-paper but was on the china, on the table linen, on the chimney-pieces, on the opaque glass of the front door, on the victoria, and on the harness, though omitted from the garden-hose and the lawn-mower. Naturally, no sensible person dreamed of connecting that illustrious crest with the unfortunate and notorious Rena Magsworth whose name had grown week by week into larger and larger type upon the front pages of newspapers, owing to the gradually increasing public and official belief that she had poisoned a family of eight."}, {"size": 709, "text": "However, the statement that no sensible person could have connected the Magsworth Bitts family with the arsenical Rena takes no account of Penrod Schofield. Penrod never missed a murder, a hanging or an electrocution in the newspapers; he knew almost as much about Rena Magsworth as her jurymen did, though they sat in a court-room two hundred miles away, and he had it in mind--so frank he was--to ask Roderick Magsworth Bitts, Junior, if the murderess happened to be a relative. The present encounter, being merely one of apathetic greeting, did not afford the opportunity. Penrod took off his cap, and Roderick, seated between his mother and one of his grown-up sisters, nodded sluggishly, but neither Mrs."}, {"size": 682, "text": "Magsworth Bitts nor her daughter acknowledged the salutation of the boy in the yard. They disapproved of him as a person of little consequence, and that little, bad. Snubbed, Penrod thoughtfully restored his cap to his head. A boy can be cut as effectually as a man, and this one was chilled to a low temperature. He wondered if they despised him because they had seen a last fragment of doughnut in his hand; then he thought that perhaps it was Duke who had disgraced him. Duke was certainly no fashionable looking dog.

Penrod's efforts--with the aid of a pin--to effect a transference of living organism were unsuccessful; but he convinced himself forever that a spider cannot walk with a beetle's legs. Della then enhanced zoological interest by depositing upon the back porch a large rat-trap from the cellar, the prison of four live rats awaiting execution. Penrod at once took possession, retiring to the empty stable, where he installed the rats in a small wooden box with a sheet of broken window-glass--held down by a brickbat--over the top."}, {"size": 753, "text": "Thus the symptoms of their agitation, when the box was shaken or hammered upon, could be studied at leisure. Altogether this Saturday was starting splendidly. After a time, the student's attention was withdrawn from his specimens by a peculiar smell, which, being followed up by a system of selective sniffing, proved to be an emanation leaking into the stable from the alley. He opened the back door. Across the alley was a cottage which a thrifty neighbour had built on the rear line of his lot and rented to negroes; and the fact that a negro family was now in process of \u201cmoving in\u201d was manifested by the presence of a thin mule and a ramshackle wagon, the latter laden with the semblance of a stove and a few other unpretentious household articles."}, {"size": 747, "text": "A very small darky boy stood near the mule. In his hand was a rusty chain, and at the end of the chain the delighted Penrod perceived the source of the special smell he was tracing--a large raccoon. Duke, who had shown not the slightest interest in the rats, set up a frantic barking and simulated a ravening assault upon the strange animal. It was only a bit of acting, however, for Duke was an old dog, had suffered much, and desired no unnecessary sorrow, wherefore he confined his demonstrations to alarums and excursions, and presently sat down at a distance and expressed himself by intermittent threatenings in a quavering falsetto. \u201cWhat's that 'coon's name?\u201d asked Penrod, intending no discourtesy. \u201cAim gommo mame,\u201d said the small darky."}, {"size": 657, "text": "The small darky looked annoyed. \u201cAim GOMMO mame, I hell you,\u201d he said impatiently.

He descended a little heavily to the outflowing crowd in the arena, and bought a caterwauling toy balloon, but showed no great enthusiasm in manipulating it.

He swallowed, coughed, scratched the back of his neck, and said, disjointedly: \u201cWell--I don't care if you want to. I just as soon.\u201d \u201cWe'll dance together,\u201d said Fanchon, \u201cat your party.\u201d \u201cI guess so. I just as soon.\u201d \u201cDon't you want to, Penrod?\u201d \u201cWell, I'm willing to.\u201d \u201cNo. Say you WANT to!\u201d"}, {"size": 712, "text": "He used his toe as a gimlet, boring into the ground, his wide open eyes staring with intense vacancy at a button on his sleeve. His mother appeared upon the porch in departure, calling farewells over her shoulder to Mrs. Gelbraith, who stood in the doorway. \u201cSay it!\u201d whispered Fanchon. \u201cWell, I just as SOON.\u201d She seemed satisfied. CHAPTER XXX THE BIRTHDAY PARTY A dancing floor had been laid upon a platform in the yard, when Mrs. Schofield and her son arrived at their own abode; and a white and scarlet striped canopy was in process of erection overhead, to shelter the dancers from the sun. Workmen were busy everywhere under the direction of Margaret, and the smitten heart of Penrod began to beat rapidly."}, {"size": 699, "text": "All this was for him; he was Twelve! After lunch, he underwent an elaborate toilette and murmured not. For the first time in his life he knew the wish to be sand-papered, waxed, and polished to the highest possible degree. And when the operation was over, he stood before the mirror in new bloom, feeling encouraged to hope that his resemblance to his father was not so strong as Aunt Sarah seemed to think. The white gloves upon his hands had a pleasant smell, he found; and, as he came down the stairs, he had great content in the twinkling of his new dancing slippers. He stepped twice on each step, the better to enjoy their effect and at the same time he deeply inhaled the odour of the gloves."}, {"size": 704, "text": "In spite of everything, Penrod had his social capacities. Already it is to be perceived that there were in him the makings of a cotillon leader. Then came from the yard a sound of tuning instruments, squeak of fiddle, croon of 'cello, a falling triangle ringing and tinkling to the floor; and he turned pale. Chosen guests began to arrive, while Penrod, suffering from stage-fright and perspiration, stood beside his mother, in the \u201cdrawing-room,\u201d to receive them. He greeted unfamiliar acquaintances and intimate fellow-criminals with the same frigidity, murmuring: \u201c'M glad to see y',\u201d to all alike, largely increasing the embarrassment which always prevails at the beginning of children's festivities."}, {"size": 657, "text": "His unnatural pomp and circumstance had so thoroughly upset him, in truth, that Marjorie Jones received a distinct shock, now to be related. Doctor Thrope, the kind old clergyman who had baptized Penrod, came in for a moment to congratulate the boy, and had just moved away when it was Marjorie's turn, in the line of children, to speak to Penrod. She gave him what she considered a forgiving look, and, because of the occasion, addressed him in a perfectly courteous manner. \u201cI wish you many happy returns of the day, Penrod.\u201d \u201cThank you, sir!\u201d he returned, following Dr. Thrope with a glassy stare in which there was absolutely no recognition of Marjorie."}, {"size": 884, "text": "Then he greeted Maurice Levy, who was next to Marjorie: \u201c'M glad to see y'!\u201d Dumfounded, Marjorie turned aside, and stood near, observing Penrod with gravity. It was the first great surprise of her life. Customarily, she had seemed to place his character somewhere between that of the professional rioter and that of the orang-outang; nevertheless, her manner at times just hinted a consciousness that this Caliban was her property. Wherefore, she stared at him incredulously as his head bobbed up and down, in the dancing-school bow, greeting his guests. Then she heard an adult voice, near her, exclaim: \u201cWhat an exquisite child!\u201d Mariorie galanced up--a little consciously, though she was used to it--naturally curious to ascertain who was speaking of her. It was Sam Williams' mother addressing Mrs. Bassett, both being present to help Mrs. Schofield make the festivities festive."}, {"size": 756, "text": "Here was a second heavy surprise for Marjorie: they were not looking at her. They were looking with beaming approval at a girl she had never seen; a dark and modish stranger of singularly composed and yet modest aspect. Her downcast eyes, becoming in one thus entering a crowded room, were all that produced the effect of modesty, counteracting something about her which might have seemed too assured. She was very slender, very dainty, and her apparel was disheartening to the other girls; it was of a knowing picturesqueness wholly unfamiliar to them. There was a delicate trace of powder upon the lobe of Fanchon's left ear, and the outlines of her eyelids, if very closely scrutinized, would have revealed successful experimentation with a burnt match."}, {"size": 413, "text": "Marjorie's lovely eyes dilated: she learned the meaning of hatred at first sight. Observing the stranger with instinctive suspicion, all at once she seemed, to herself, awkward. Poor Marjorie underwent that experience which hearty, healthy, little girls and big girls undergo at one time or another--from heels to head she felt herself, somehow, too THICK. Fanchon leaned close to Penrod and whispered in his ear:"}, {"size": 750, "text": "Marjorie saw the blush. Her lovely eyes opened even wider, and in them there began to grow a light. It was the light of indignation;--at least, people whose eyes glow with that light always call it indignation. Roderick Magsworth Bitts, Junior, approached Fanchon, when she had made her courtesy to Mrs. Schofield. Fanchon whispered in Roderick's ear also. \u201cYour hair is pretty, Roddy! Don't forget what you said yesterday!\u201d Roderick likewise blushed. Maurice Levy, captivated by the newcomer's appearance, pressed close to Roderick. \u201cGive us an intaduction, Roddy?\u201dRoddy being either reluctant or unable to perform the rite, Fanchon took matters into her own hands, and was presently favourably impressed with Maurice, receiving the information that"}, {"size": 600, "text": "his tie had been brought to him by his papa from Skoone's, whereupon she privately informed him that she liked wavy hair, and arranged to dance with him. Fanchon also thought sandy hair attractive, Sam Williams discovered, a few minutes later, and so catholic was her taste that a ring of boys quite encircled her before the musicians in the yard struck up their thrilling march, and Mrs. Schofield brought Penrod to escort the lady from out-of-town to the dancing pavilion. Headed by this pair, the children sought partners and paraded solemnly out of the front door and round a corner of the house."}, {"size": 606, "text": "There they found the gay marquee; the small orchestra seated on the lawn at one side of it, and a punch bowl of lemonade inviting attention, under a tree. Decorously the small couples stepped upon the platform, one after another, and began to dance. \u201cIt's not much like a children's party in our day,\u201d Mrs. Williams said to Penrod's mother. \u201cWe'd have been playing 'Quaker-meeting,' 'Clap-in, Clap-out,' or 'Going to Jerusalem,' I suppose.\u201d \u201cYes, or 'Post-office' and 'Drop-the-handkerchief,'\u201d said Mrs. Schofield. \u201cThings change so quickly. Imagine asking little Fanchon Gelbraith to play 'London Bridge'!"}, {"size": 751, "text": "Penrod seems to be having a difficult time with her, poor boy; he wasn't a shining light in the dancing class.\u201d However, Penrod's difficulty was not precisely of the kind his mother supposed. Fanchon was showing him a new step, which she taught her next partner in turn, continuing instructions during the dancing. The children crowded the floor, and in the kaleidoscopic jumble of bobbing heads and intermingling figures her extremely different style of motion was unobserved by the older people, who looked on, nodding time benevolently. Fanchon fascinated girls as well as boys. Many of the former eagerly sought her acquaintance and thronged about her between the dances, when, accepting the deference due a cosmopolitan and an oracle of the mode,"}, {"size": 701, "text": "she gave demonstrations of the new step to succeeding groups, professing astonishment to find it unknown: it had been \u201call the go,\u201d she explained, at the Long Shore Casino for fully two seasons. She pronounced \u201cslow\u201d a \u201cFancy Dance\u201d executed during an intermission by Baby Rennsdale and Georgie Bassett, giving it as her opinion that Miss Rennsdale and Mr. Bassett were \u201cdead ones\u201d; and she expressed surprise that the punch bowl contained lemonade and not champagne. The dancing continued, the new step gaining instantly in popularity, fresh couples adventuring with every number. The word \u201cstep\u201d is somewhat misleading, nothing done with the feet being vital to the evolutions introduced by Fanchon."}, {"size": 754, "text": "Fanchon's dance came from the Orient by a roundabout way; pausing in Spain, taking on a Gallic frankness in gallantry at the Bal Bullier in Paris, combining with a relative from the South Seas encountered in San Francisco, flavouring itself with a carefree negroid abandon in New Orleans, and, accumulating, too, something inexpressible from Mexico and South America, it kept, throughout its travels, to the underworld, or to circles where nature is extremely frank and rank, until at last it reached the dives of New York, when it immediately broke out in what is called civilized society. Thereafter it spread, in variously modified forms--some of them disinfected--to watering-places, and thence, carried by hundreds of older male and female Fanchons,"}, {"size": 713, "text": "over the country, being eagerly adopted everywhere and made wholly pure and respectable by the supreme moral axiom that anything is all right if enough people do it. Everybody was doing it. Not quite everybody. It was perhaps some test of this dance that earth could furnish no more grotesque sight than that of children doing it. Earth, assisted by Fanchon, was furnishing this sight at Penrod's party. By the time ice-cream and cake arrived, about half the guests had either been initiated into the mysteries by Fanchon or were learning by imitation, and the education of the other half was resumed with the dancing, when the attendant ladies, unconscious of what was happening, withdrew into the house for tea."}, {"size": 428, "text": "\u201cThat orchestra's a dead one,\u201d Fanchon remarked to Penrod. \u201cWe ought to liven them up a little!\u201d She approached the musicians. \u201cDon't you know,\u201d she asked the leader, \u201cthe Slingo Sligo Slide?\u201d The leader giggled, nodded, rapped with his bow upon his violin; and Penrod, following Fanchon back upon the dancing floor, blindly brushed with his elbow a solitary little figure standing aloof on the lawn at the edge of the platform."}, {"size": 708, "text": "In no mood to approve of anything introduced by Fanchon, she had scornfully refused, from the first, to dance the new \u201cstep,\u201d and, because of its bonfire popularity, found herself neglected in a society where she had reigned as beauty and belle. Faithless Penrod, dazed by the sweeping Fanchon, had utterly forgotten the amber curls; he had not once asked Marjorie to dance. All afternoon the light of indignation had been growing brighter in her eyes, though Maurice Levy's defection to the lady from New York had not fanned this flame. From the moment Fanchon had whispered familiarly in Penrod's ear, and Penrod had blushed, Marjorie had been occupied exclusively with resentment against that guilty pair."}, {"size": 758, "text": "It seemed to her that Penrod had no right to allow a strange girl to whisper in his ear; that his blushing, when the strange girl did it, was atrocious; and that the strange girl, herself, ought to be arrested. Forgotten by the merrymakers, Marjorie stood alone upon the lawn, clenching her small fists, watching the new dance at its high tide, and hating it with a hatred that made every inch of her tremble. And, perhaps because jealousy is a great awakener of the virtues, she had a perception of something in it worse than lack of dignity--something vaguely but outrageously reprehensible. Finally, when Penrod brushed by her, touched her with his elbow, and, did not even see her, Marjorie's state of mind (not unmingled with emotion!) became dangerous."}, {"size": 705, "text": "In fact, a trained nurse, chancing to observe her at this juncture, would probably have advised that she be taken home and put to bed. Marjorie was on the verge of hysterics. She saw Fanchon and Penrod assume the double embrace required by the dance; the \u201cSlingo Sligo Slide\u201d burst from the orchestra like the lunatic shriek of a gin-maddened nigger; and all the little couples began to bob and dip and sway. Marjorie made a scene. She sprang upon the platform and stamped her foot. \u201cPenrod Schofield!\u201d she shouted. \u201cYou BEHAVE yourself!\u201d The remarkable girl took Penrod by the ear. By his ear she swung him away from Fanchon and faced him toward the lawn. \u201cYou march straight out of here!\u201d she commanded."}, {"size": 656, "text": "He was stunned; obeyed automatically, without question, and had very little realization of what was happening to him. Altogether, and without reason, he was in precisely the condition of an elderly spouse detected in flagrant misbehaviour. Marjorie, similarly, was in precisely the condition of the party who detects such misbehaviour. It may be added that she had acted with a promptness, a decision and a disregard of social consequences all to be commended to the attention of ladies in like predicament. \u201cYou ought to be ashamed of yourself!\u201d she raged, when they reached the lawn. \u201cAren't you ashamed of yourself?\u201d \u201cWhat for?\u201d he inquired, helplessly."}, {"size": 683, "text": "\u201cBut what'd _I_ do, Marjorie? _I_ haven't done anything to you,\u201d he pleaded. \u201cI haven't even seen you, all aftern----\u201d \u201cYou be quiet!\u201d she cried, tears filling her eyes. \u201cKeep still! You ugly boy! Shut up!\u201d He should have understood from this how much she cared for him. But he rubbed his cheek and declared ruefully: \u201cI'll never speak to you again!\u201d \u201cYou will, too!\u201d she sobbed, passionately. He turned to leave her, but paused. His mother, his sister Margaret, and their grownup friends had finished their tea and were approaching from the house. Other parents and guardians were with them, coming for their children; and there were carriages and automobiles waiting in the street."}, {"size": 684, "text": "But the \u201cSlingo Slide\u201d went on, regardless. The group of grown-up people hesitated and came to a halt, gazing at the pavilion. \u201cWhat are they doing?\u201d gasped Mrs. Williams, blushing deeply. \u201cWhat is it? What IS it?\u201d \u201cWHAT IS IT?\u201d Mrs. Gelbraith echoed in a frightened whisper. \u201cWHAT----\u201d \u201cThey're Tangoing!\u201d cried Margaret Schofield. \u201cOr Bunny Hugging or Grizzly Bearing, or----\u201d \u201cThey're only Turkey Trotting,\u201d said Robert Williams. With fearful outcries the mothers, aunts, and sisters rushed upon the pavilion. \u201cOf course it was dreadful,\u201d said Mrs. Schofield, an hour later, rendering her lord an account of the day, \u201cbut it was every bit the fault of that one extraordinary child."}, {"size": 846, "text": "And of all the quiet, demur little things--that is, I mean, when she first came.

And Penrod was the only boy not doing it, the only one to refuse? ALL the others were----\u201d \u201cEvery one!\u201d she returned triumphantly. \u201cEven Georgie Bassett!\u201d \u201cWell,\u201d said Mr. Schofield, patting her on the shoulder. \u201cI guess we can hold up our heads at last.\u201d"}, {"size": 739, "text": "CHAPTER XXXI OVER THE FENCE Penrod was out in the yard, staring at the empty marquee. The sun was on the horizon line, so far behind the back fence, and a western window of the house blazed in gold unbearable to the eye: his day was nearly over. He sighed, and took from the inside pocket of his new jacket the \u201csling-shot\u201d aunt Sarah Crim had given him that morning. He snapped the rubbers absently. They held fast; and his next impulse was entirely irresistible. He found a shapely stone, fitted it to the leather, and drew back the ancient catapult for a shot. A sparrow hopped upon a branch between him and the house, and he aimed at the sparrow, but the reflection from the dazzling window struck in his eyes as he loosed the leather."}, {"size": 605, "text": "He missed the sparrow, but not the window. There was a loud crash, and to his horror he caught a glimpse of his father, stricken in mid-shaving, ducking a shower of broken glass, glittering razor flourishing wildly.

He could hear his parent's booming descent of the back stairs, instant and furious; and then, red-hot above white lather, Mr. Schofield burst out of the kitchen door and hurtled forth upon his son. \u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d he demanded, shaking Penrod by the shoulder."}, {"size": 308, "text": "\u201cTen minutes ago, for the very first time in our lives, your mother and I were saying we were proud of you, and here you go and throw a rock at me through the window when I'm shaving for dinner!\u201d \u201cI didn't!\u201d Penrod quavered. \u201cI was shooting at a sparrow, and the sun got in his eyes, and the sling broke----\u201d"}, {"size": 604, "text": "\u201cWhere'd you get that devilish thing?

She said she took it away from you thirty-five years ago. You killed her hen, she said. She told me some more to tell you, but I've forgotten.\u201d \u201cOh!\u201d said Mr. Schofield. He took the broken sling in his hand, looked at it long and thoughtfully--and he looked longer, and quite as thoughtfully, at Penrod.

A slight figure appeared, likewise upon a fence, beyond two neighbouring yards. \u201cYay, Penrod!\u201d called comrade Sam Williams. \u201cYay!\u201d returned Penrod, mechanically. \u201cI caught Billy Blue Hill!\u201d shouted Sam, describing retribution in a manner perfectly clear to his friend. \u201cYou were mighty lucky to get out of it.\u201d"}, {"size": 797, "text": "\u201cYou wouldn't of, if it hadn't been for Marjorie.\u201d \u201cWell, don't I know that?\u201d Penrod shouted, with heat. \u201cWell, so long!\u201d called Sam, dropping from his fence; and the friendly voice came then, more faintly, \u201cMany happy returns of the day, Penrod!\u201d And now, a plaintive little whine sounded from below Penrod's feet, and, looking down, he saw that Duke, his wistful, old, scraggly dog sat in the grass, gazing seekingly up at him.The last shaft of sunshine of that day fell graciously and like a blessing upon the boy sitting on the fence.
