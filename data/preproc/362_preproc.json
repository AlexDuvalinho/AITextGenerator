Arkwright in London through a common friend; since then they had tramped half over Europe together in a comradeship that was as delightful as it was unusual. As Calderwell put it in a letter to his sister, Belle: \u201cWe smoke the same cigar and drink the same tea (he's just as much of an old woman on that subject as I am!), and we agree beautifully on all necessary points of living, from tipping to late sleeping in the morning; while as for politics and religion--we disagree in those just enough to lend spice to an otherwise tame existence.\u201d Farther along in this same letter Calderwell touched upon his new friend again."}, {"size": 627, "text": "\u201cI admit, however, I would like to know his name. To find out what that mysterious 'M. J.' stands for has got to be pretty nearly an obsession with me. I am about ready to pick his pocket or rifle his trunk in search of some lurking 'Martin' or 'John' that will set me at peace. As it is, I confess that I have ogled his incoming mail and his outgoing baggage shamelessly, only to be slapped in the face always and everlastingly by that bland 'M. J.' I've got my revenge, now, though. To myself I call him 'Mary Jane'--and his broad-shouldered, brown-bearded six feet of muscular manhood would so like to be called 'Mary Jane'!"}, {"size": 777, "text": "By the way, Belle, if you ever hear of murder and sudden death in my direction, better set the sleuths on the trail of Arkwright. Six to one you'll find I called him 'Mary Jane' to his face!\u201d Calderwell was thinking of that letter now, as he sat at a small table in a Paris caf\u00e9. Opposite him was the six feet of muscular manhood, broad shoulders, pointed brown beard, and all--and he had just addressed it, inadvertently, as \u201cMary Jane.\u201d During the brief, sickening moment of silence after the name had left his lips, Calderwell was conscious of a whimsical realization of the lights, music, and laughter all about him. \u201cWell, I chose as safe a place as I could!\u201d he was thinking. Then Arkwright spoke. \u201cHow long since you've been in correspondence with members of my family?\u201d"}, {"size": 632, "text": "Arkwright laughed grimly. \u201cPerhaps you thought of it yourself, then--I'll admit you're capable of it,\u201d he nodded, reaching for a cigar. \u201cBut it so happens you hit upon my family's favorite name for me.\u201d \u201c_Mary Jane!_ You mean they actually _call_ you that?\u201d \u201cYes,\u201d bowed the big fellow, calmly, as he struck a light. \u201cAppropriate!--don't you think?\u201d Calderwell did not answer. He thought he could not. \u201cWell, silence gives consent, they say,\u201d laughed the other. \u201cAnyhow, you must have had _some_ reason for calling me that.\u201d \u201cArkwright, what _does_ 'M. J.' stand for?\u201d demanded Calderwell. \u201cOh, is that it?\u201d smiled the man opposite."}, {"size": 452, "text": "\u201cWell, I'll own those initials have been something of a puzzle to people. One man declares they're 'Merely Jokes'; but another, not so friendly, says they stand for 'Mostly Jealousy' of more fortunate chaps who have real names for a handle. My small brothers and sisters, discovering, with the usual perspicacity of one's family on such matters, that I never signed, or called myself anything but 'M. J.,' dubbed me 'Mary Jane.' And there you have it.\u201d"}, {"size": 621, "text": "Arkwright smiled oddly. \u201cOh, well, what's the difference? Would you deprive them of their innocent amusement? And they do so love that 'Mary Jane'! Besides, what's in a name, anyway?\u201d he went on, eyeing the glowing tip of the cigar between his fingers. \u201c'A rose by any other name--'--you've heard that, probably. Names don't always signify, my dear fellow. For instance, I know a 'Billy'--but he's a girl.\u201d Calderwell gave a sudden start. \u201cYou don't mean Billy--Neilson?\u201d The other turned sharply. \u201cDo _you_ know Billy Neilson?\u201d Calderwell gave his friend a glance from scornful eyes. \u201cDo I know Billy Neilson?\u201d he cried."}, {"size": 670, "text": "\u201cDoes a fellow usually know the girl he's proposed to regularly once in three months? Oh, I know I'm telling tales out of school, of course,\u201d he went on, in response to the look that had come into the brown eyes opposite. \u201cBut what's the use? Everybody knows it--that knows us. Billy herself got so she took it as a matter of course--and refused as a matter of course, too; just as she would refuse a serving of apple pie at dinner, if she hadn't wanted it.\u201d \u201cApple pie!\u201d scouted Arkwright. Calderwell shrugged his shoulders. \u201cMy dear fellow, you don't seem to realize it, but for the last six months you have been assisting at the obsequies of a dead romance.\u201d \u201cIndeed!"}, {"size": 600, "text": "And is it--buried, yet?\u201d \u201cOh, no,\u201d sighed Calderwell, cheerfully. \u201cI shall go back one of these days, I'll warrant, and begin the same old game again; though I will acknowledge that the last refusal was so very decided that it's been a year, almost, since I received it. I think I was really convinced, for a while, that--that she didn't want that apple pie,\u201d he finished with a whimsical lightness that did not quite coincide with the stern lines that had come to his mouth. For a moment there was silence, then Calderwell spoke again. \u201cWhere did you know--Miss Billy?\u201d \u201cOh, I don't know her at all."}, {"size": 618, "text": "I know of her--through Aunt Hannah.\u201d Calderwell sat suddenly erect. \u201cAunt Hannah! Is she your aunt, too? Jove! This _is_ a little old world, after all; isn't it?\u201d \u201cShe isn't my aunt. She's my mother's third cousin. None of us have seen her for years, but she writes to mother occasionally; and, of course, for some time now, her letters have been running over full of Billy. She lives with her, I believe; doesn't she?\u201d \u201cShe does,\u201d rejoined Calderwell, with an unexpected chuckle. \u201cI wonder if you know how she happened to live with her, at first.\u201d \u201cWhy, no, I reckon not. What do you mean?\u201d Calderwell chuckled again."}, {"size": 295, "text": "\u201cWell, I'll tell you. You, being a 'Mary Jane,' ought to appreciate it. You see, Billy was named for one William Henshaw, her father's chum, who promptly forgot all about her. At eighteen, Billy, being left quite alone in the world, wrote to 'Uncle William' and asked to come and live with him.\u201d"}, {"size": 617, "text": "\u201cBut it wasn't well. William was a forty-year-old widower who lived with two younger brothers, an old butler, and a Chinese cook in one of those funny old Beacon Street houses in Boston. 'The Strata,' Bertram called it. Bright boy--Bertram!\u201d \u201cYes. I wish you could see that house, Arkwright. It's a regular layer cake. Cyril--he's the second brother; must be thirty-four or five now--lives on the top floor in a rugless, curtainless, music-mad existence--just a plain crank. Below him comes William. William collects things--everything from tenpenny nails to teapots, I should say, and they're all there in his rooms."}, {"size": 808, "text": "Farther down somewhere comes Bertram. He's _the_ Bertram Henshaw, you understand; the artist.\u201d \u201cNot the 'Face-of-a-Girl' Henshaw?\u201d \u201cThe same; only of course four years ago he wasn't quite so well known as he is now. Well, to resume and go on. It was into this house, this masculine paradise ruled over by Pete and Dong Ling in the kitchen, that Billy's na\u00efve request for a home came.\u201d \u201cGreat Scott!\u201d breathed Arkwright, appreciatively. \u201cYes. Well, the letter was signed 'Billy.' They took her for a boy, naturally, and after something of a struggle they agreed to let 'him' come. For his particular delectation they fixed up a room next to Bertram with guns and fishing rods, and such ladylike specialties; and William went to the station to meet the boy.\u201d \u201cWith never a suspicion?\u201d \u201cWith never a suspicion.\u201d"}, {"size": 608, "text": "\u201cWell, 'he' came, and 'she' conquered. I guess things were lively for a while, though. Oh, there was a kitten, too, I believe, 'Spunk,' who added to the gayety of nations.\u201d \u201cBut what did the Henshaws do?\u201d \u201cWell, I wasn't there, of course; but Bertram says they spun around like tops gone mad for a time, but finally quieted down enough to summon a married sister for immediate propriety, and to establish Aunt Hannah for permanency the next day.\u201d \u201cSo that's how it happened! Well, by George!\u201d cried Arkwright. \u201cYes,\u201d nodded the other. \u201cSo you see there are untold possibilities just in a name. Remember that."}, {"size": 652, "text": "Just suppose _you_, as Mary Jane, should beg a home in a feminine household--say in Miss Billy's, for instance!\u201d \u201cI'd like to,\u201d retorted Arkwright, with sudden warmth. Calderwell stared a little. The other laughed shamefacedly. \u201cOh, it's only that I happen to have a devouring curiosity to meet that special young lady. I sing her songs (you know she's written some dandies!), I've heard a lot about her, and I've seen her picture.\u201d (He did not add that he had also purloined that same picture from his mother's bureau--the picture being a gift from Aunt Hannah.) \u201cSo you see I would, indeed, like to occupy a corner in the fair Miss Billy's household."}, {"size": 685, "text": "I could write to Aunt Hannah and beg a home with her, you know; eh?\u201d \u201cOf course! Why don't you--'Mary Jane'?\u201d laughed Calderwell. \u201cBilly'd take you all right. She's had a little Miss Hawthorn, a music teacher, there for months. She's always doing stunts of that sort. Belle writes me that she's had a dozen forlornites there all this last summer, two or three at a time-tired widows, lonesome old maids, and crippled kids--just to give them a royal good time. So you see she'd take you, without a doubt. Jove! what a pair you'd make: Miss Billy and Mr. Mary Jane! You'd drive the suffragettes into conniption fits--just by the sound of you!\u201d Arkwright laughed quietly; then he frowned."}, {"size": 665, "text": "\u201cBut how about it?\u201d he asked. \u201cI thought she was keeping house with Aunt Hannah. Didn't she stay at all with the Henshaws?\u201d \u201cOh, yes, a few months. I never knew just why she did leave, but I fancied, from something Billy herself said once, that she discovered she was creating rather too much of an upheaval in the Strata. So she took herself off. She went to school, and travelled considerably. She was over here when I met her first. After that she was with us all one summer on the yacht. A couple of years ago, or so, she went back to Boston, bought a house and settled down with Aunt Hannah.\u201d \u201cAnd she's not married--or even engaged?\u201d \u201cWasn't the last I heard."}, {"size": 660, "text": "I haven't seen her since December, and I've heard from her only indirectly. She corresponds with my sister, and so do I--intermittently. I heard a month ago from Belle, and _she_ had a letter from Billy in August. But I heard nothing of any engagement.\u201d \u201cHow about the Henshaws? I should think there might be a chance there for a romance--a charming girl, and three unattached men.\u201d Calderwell gave a slow shake of the head. \u201cI don't think so. William is--let me see--nearly forty-five, I guess, by this time; and he isn't a marrying man. He buried his heart with his wife and baby years ago. Cyril, according to Bertram, 'hates women and all other confusion,'"}, {"size": 774, "text": "so that ought to let him out. As for Bertram himself--Bertram is 'only Bertram.' He's always been that. Bertram loves girls--to paint; but I can't imagine him making serious love to any one. It would always be the tilt of a chin or the turn of a cheek that he was admiring--to paint. No, there's no chance for a romance there, I'll warrant.\u201d \u201cBut there's--yourself.\u201d Calderwell's eyebrows rose the fraction of an inch. \u201cOh, of course. I presume January or February will find me back there,\u201d he admitted with a sigh and a shrug. Then, a little bitterly, he added: \u201cNo, Arkwright. I shall keep away if I can. I _know_ there's no chance for me--now.\u201d \u201cThen you'll leave me a clear field?\u201d bantered the other. \u201cOf course--'Mary Jane,'\u201d retorted Calderwell, with equal lightness."}, {"size": 658, "text": "\u201cOh, you needn't,\u201d laughed Calderwell. \u201cMy giving you the right of way doesn't insure you a thoroughfare for yourself--there are others, you know. Billy Neilson has had sighing swains about I her, I imagine, since she could walk and talk. She is a wonderfully fascinating little bit of femininity, and she has a heart of pure gold. All is, I envy the man who wins it--for the man who wins that, wins her.\u201d There was no answer. Arkwright sat with his eyes on the moving throng outside the window near them. Perhaps he had not heard. At all events, when he spoke some time later, it was of a matter far removed from Miss Billy Neilson, or the way to her heart."}, {"size": 644, "text": "Nor was the young lady mentioned between them again that day. Long hours later, just before parting for the night, Arkwright said: \u201cCalderwell, I'm sorry, but I believe, after all, I can't take that trip to the lakes with you. I--I'm going home next week.\u201d \u201cHome! Hang it, Arkwright! I'd counted on you. Isn't this rather sudden?\u201d \u201cYes, and no. I'll own I've been drifting about with you contentedly enough for the last six months to make you think mountain-climbing and boat-paddling were the end and aim of my existence. But they aren't, you know, really.\u201d \u201cNonsense! At heart you're as much of a vagabond as I am; and you know it.\u201d \u201cPerhaps."}, {"size": 280, "text": "But unfortunately I don't happen to carry your pocketbook.\u201d \u201cYou may, if you like. I'll hand it over any time,\u201d grinned Calderwell. \u201cThanks. You know well enough what I mean,\u201d shrugged the other. There was a moment's silence; then Calderwell queried: \u201cArkwright, how old are you?\u201d"}, {"size": 674, "text": "\u201cGood! Then you're merely travelling to supplement your education, see?\u201d \u201cOh, yes, I see. But something besides my education has got to be supplemented now, I reckon.\u201d \u201cWhat are you going to do?\u201d There was an almost imperceptible hesitation; then, a little shortly, came the answer: \u201cHit the trail for Grand Opera, and bring up, probably--in vaudeville.\u201d Calderwell smiled appreciatively. \u201cYou _can_ sing like the devil,\u201d he admitted. \u201cThanks,\u201d returned his friend, with uplifted eyebrows. \u201cDo you mind calling it 'an angel'--just for this occasion?\u201d \u201cOh, the matin\u00e9e-girls will do that fast enough. But, I say, Arkwright, what are you going to do with those initials then?\u201d"}, {"size": 686, "text": "\u201cOh, no, you won't. And you won't be 'Mary Jane,' either. Imagine a Mary Jane in Grand Opera! I know what you'll be. You'll be 'Se\u00f1or Martini Johnini Arkwrightino'! By the way, you didn't say what that 'M. J.' really did stand for,\u201d hinted Calderwell, shamelessly. \u201c'Merely Jokes'--in your estimation, evidently,\u201d shrugged the other. \u201cBut my going isn't a joke, Calderwell. I'm really going. And I'm going to work.\u201d \u201cBut--how shall you manage?\u201d Calderwell frowned and stirred restlessly in his chair. \u201cBut, honestly, now, to--to follow that trail of yours will take money. And--er--\u201d a faint red stole to his forehead--\u201cdon't they have--er--patrons for these young and budding geniuses?"}, {"size": 645, "text": "Why can't I have a hand in this trail, too--or maybe you'd call it a foot, eh? I'd be no end glad to, Arkwright.\u201d \u201cThanks, old man.\u201d The red was duplicated this time above the brown silky beard. \u201cThat was mighty kind of you, and I appreciate it; but it won't be necessary. A generous, but perhaps misguided bachelor uncle left me a few thousands a year or so ago; and I'm going to put them all down my throat--or rather, _into_ it--before I give up.\u201d \u201cWhere you going to study? New York?\u201d Again there was an almost imperceptible hesitation before the answer came. \u201cI'm not quite prepared to say.\u201d \u201cWhy not try it here?\u201d Arkwright shook his head."}, {"size": 408, "text": "\u201cI did plan to, when I came over but I've changed my mind. I believe I'd rather work while longer in America.\u201d \u201cHm-m,\u201d murmured Calderwell. There was a brief silence, followed by other questions and other answers; after which the friends said good night. In his own room, as he was dropping off to sleep, Calderwell muttered drowsily: \u201cBy George! I haven't found out yet what that blamed 'M. J.' stands for!\u201d"}, {"size": 620, "text": "CHAPTER II. AUNT HANNAH GETS A LETTER In the cozy living-room at Hillside, Billy Neilson's pretty home on Corey Hill, Billy herself sat writing at the desk.

Then don't let me disturb you.\u201d She turned as if to go. Billy dropped her pen, sprang to her feet, flew to the little woman's side and whirled her half across the room. \u201cThere!\u201d she exclaimed, as she plumped the breathless and scandalized Aunt Hannah into the biggest easy chair. \u201cI feel better.

Wors't you _ever_ grow up?\u201d \u201cHope not,\u201d purred Billy cheerfully, dropping herself on to a low hassock at Aunt Hannah's feet. \u201cBut, my dear, you--you're engaged!\u201d Billy bubbled into a chuckling laugh. \u201cAs if I didn't know that, when I've just written a dozen notes to announce it! And, oh, Aunt Hannah, such a time as I've had, telling what a dear Bertram is, and how I love, love, _love_ him, and what beautiful eyes he has, and _such_ a nose, and--\u201d \u201cBilly!\u201d Aunt Hannah was sitting erect in pale horror."}, {"size": 671, "text": "\u201cEh?\u201d Billy's eyes were roguish. \u201cYou didn't write that in those notes!\u201d \u201cWrite it?

Billy laughed, and tossed the note back on the desk. \u201cI'm writing to Belle Calderwell, now,\u201d she announced musingly, dropping herself again on the hassock. \u201cI suppose she'll tell Hugh.\u201d \u201cPoor boy! He'll be disappointed.\u201d Billy sighed, but she uptilted her chin a little. \u201cHe ought not to be. I told him long, long ago, the very first time, that--that I couldn't.\u201d \u201cI know, dear; but--they don't always understand.\u201d Aunt Hannah sighed in sympathy with the far-away Hugh Calderwell, as she looked down at the bright young face near her."}, {"size": 546, "text": "There was a moment's silence; then Billy gave a little laugh. \u201cHe _will_ be surprised,\u201d she said. \u201cHe told me once that Bertram wouldn't ever care for any girl except to paint.

As if Bertram didn't love me--just _me!_--if he never saw another tube of paint!\u201d \u201cI think he does, my dear.\u201d Again there was silence; then, from Billy's lips there came softly: \u201cJust think; we've been engaged almost four weeks--and to-morrow it'll be announced.

Bertram, right away, now, _everybody_ will know it.\u201d Her voice was tragic. Bertram relaxed visibly.

Oh, never, Bertram! It's only that it won't be ours any longer--that is, it won't belong to just our two selves. Everybody will know it. And they'll bow and smile and say 'How lovely!' to our faces, and 'Did you ever?' to our backs. Oh, no, I'm not sorry, Bertram; but I am--afraid.\u201d Billy sighed, and gazed with pensive eyes into the fire. Across Bertram's face swept surprise, consternation, and dismay.

And they'll come and stand around and stare and lift their lorgnettes and say: 'Is that the one? Dear me!'\u201d Bertram gave a relieved laugh. \u201cNonsense, sweetheart! I should think you were a picture I'd painted and hung on a wall.\u201d \u201cI shall feel as if I were--with all those friends of yours. Bertram, what if they don't like it?\u201d Her voice had grown tragic again."}, {"size": 687, "text": "\u201cYes. The picture--me, I mean.\u201d \u201cThey can't help liking it,\u201d he retorted, with the prompt certainty of an adoring lover. Billy shook her head.

She'd have had it long ago if she hadn't insisted on waiting for this announcement business.\u201d \u201cOh, Bertram, what a beauty!\u201d dimpled Billy, as the flawless diamond in Bertram's fingers caught the light and sent it back in a flash of flame and crimson. \u201cNow you are mine--really mine, sweetheart!\u201d The man's voice and hand shook as he slipped the ring on Billy's outstretched finger."}, {"size": 604, "text": "Billy caught her breath with almost a sob. \u201cAnd I'm so glad to be--yours, dear,\u201d she murmured brokenly. \u201cAnd--and I'll make you proud that I am yours, even if I am just 'Billy,'\u201d she choked. \u201cOh, I know I'll write such beautiful, beautiful songs now.\u201d The man drew her into a close embrace. \u201cAs if I cared for that,\u201d he scoffed lovingly.

Billy blushed the more deeply, but she gave a light laugh. \u201cNothing, only something Hugh Calderwell said to me once. You see, Bertram, I don't think Hugh ever thought you would--marry.\u201d \u201cOh, didn't he?\u201d bridled Bertram. \u201cWell, that only goes to show how much he knows about it.

AT THE SIGN OF THE PINK After a week of beautiful autumn weather, Thursday dawned raw and cold. By noon an east wind had made the temperature still more uncomfortable.

Bertram had been known to say, indeed, that a room, according to Aunt Hannah, was not fully furnished unless it contained from one to four shawls, assorted as to size and warmth. Shawls, certainly, did seem to be a necessity with Aunt Hannah, as she usually wore from one to three at the same time--which again caused Bertram to declare that he always counted Aunt Hannah's shawls when he wished to know what the thermometer was."}, {"size": 660, "text": "\u201cNo, I'm not cold, and I haven't felt a draft,\u201d said Aunt Hannah now. \u201cI put on my thickest gray shawl this morning with the little pink one for down-stairs, and the blue one for breakfast; so you see I've been very careful.

I sha'n't have a bit of trouble. All I'll have to do is to look for a girl alone with a pink. Of course I'll have mine on, too, and she'll be watching for me. So just run along and take your nap, dear, and be all rested and ready to welcome her when she comes,\u201d finished Billy, stooping to give the soft, faintly pink cheek a warm kiss. \u201cWell, thank you, my dear; perhaps I will,\u201d sighed Aunt Hannah, drawing the gray shawl about her as she turned away contentedly.

Her hostess gave a sudden laugh. \u201cLet me see, my dear; if I remember rightly, you've had experience before, meeting at this sign of the pink. At least, I have a very vivid recollection of Mr. William Henshaw's going once to meet a _boy_ with a pink, who turned out to be a girl.

The next minute she drew nearer the gate and regarded with absorbed attention the long line of passengers already sweeping up the narrow aisle between the cars. Hurrying men came first, with long strides, and eyes that looked straight ahead. These Billy let pass with a mere glance. The next group showed a sprinkling of women--women whose trig hats and linen collars spelled promptness as well as certainty of aim and accomplishment. To these, also, Billy paid scant attention. Couples came next--the men anxious-eyed, and usually walking two steps ahead of their companions; the women plainly flustered and hurried, and invariably buttoning gloves or gathering up trailing ends of scarfs or boas."}, {"size": 705, "text": "The crowd was thickening fast, now, and Billy's eyes were alert. Children were appearing, and young women walking alone. One of these wore a bunch of violets. Billy gave her a second glance. Then she saw a pink--but it was on the coat lapel of a tall young fellow with a brown beard; so with a slight frown she looked beyond down the line. Old men came now, and old women; fleshy women, and women with small children and babies. Couples came, too--dawdling couples, plainly newly married: the men were not two steps ahead, and the women's gloves were buttoned and their furs in place. Gradually the line thinned, and soon there were left only an old man with a cane, and a young woman with three children."}, {"size": 652, "text": "Yet nowhere had Billy seen a girl wearing a white carnation, and walking alone. With a deeper frown on her face Billy turned and looked about her. She thought that somewhere in the crowd she had missed Mary Jane, and that she would find her now, standing near.

As she glanced toward him, their eyes met. Then, to Billy's unbounded amazement, the man advanced with uplifted hat. \u201cI beg your pardon, but is not this--Miss Neilson?\u201d Billy drew back with just a touch of hauteur."}, {"size": 604, "text": "\u201cY-yes,\u201d she murmured. \u201cI thought so--yet I was expecting to see you with Aunt Hannah.

The resounding chords and purling runs had become a bell-like melody that wound itself in and out of a maze of exquisite harmonies, now hiding, now coming out clear and unafraid, like a mountain stream emerging into a sunlit meadow from the leafy shadows of its forest home.

You see it was at Worcester that they invented that variation of the transfer printing process that they called bat printing, where they used oil instead of ink, and gelatine instead of paper.

The very evident intimacy of Billy with the Henshaw brothers he accepted as a matter of course, knowing the history of their acquaintance, and the fact that Billy was Mr. William Henshaw's namesake.

Relief in the end conquered, though even yet there was a second hurriedly apprehensive glance toward the door before she spoke."}, {"size": 632, "text": "\u201cThe Lowestoft!

The man rose at once. \u201cBut, madam, perhaps--don't let me--\u201d I he began stammeringly. \u201cOf course--Billy!\u201d he broke off in an entirely different voice. \u201cJove! What a beauty!\u201d Mrs. Greggory had thrown open the door of a small cupboard near the collector's chair, disclosing on one of the shelves a beautifully shaped teapot, creamy in tint, and exquisitely decorated in a rose design.

William Henshaw cleared his throat. \u201cBut, madam, if you do not wish to sell--\u201d He stopped abruptly. His longing eyes had gone back to the enticing bit of china. Mrs. Greggory gave a low cry. \u201cBut I do--that is, I must.

She shut the door quickly and hurried forward. \u201cMother, what is it? Who are these people?\u201d she asked sharply. Billy lifted her chin the least bit.

You see, really, all the time, I suspect, I've been singing it--to you,\u201d she confessed with an endearing blush, as she sprang lightly to her feet and hurried to the piano.It was a bad ten minutes that Bertram Henshaw spent then. How he could love a song and hate it at the same time he did not understand; but he knew that he was doing exactly that. To hear Billy carol \u201cSweetheart, my sweetheart!\u201d with that joyous tenderness was bliss unspeakable--until he remembered that Arkwright wrote the \u201cSweetheart, my sweetheart!\u201d then it was--(Even in his thoughts Bertram bit the word off short."}, {"size": 774, "text": "He was not a swearing man.)

He could not forget that Billy herself had once told him that never would she love any man better than she loved her music; that she was not going to marry. All this had been at the first--the very first. He had boldly scorned the idea then, and had said: \u201cSo it's music--a cold, senseless thing of spidery marks on clean white paper--that is my only rival!\u201d He had said, too, that he was going to win."}, {"size": 646, "text": "And he had won--but not until after long weeks of fearing, hoping, striving, and despairing--this last when Kate's blundering had nearly made her William's wife. Then, on that memorable day in September, Billy had walked straight into his arms; and he knew that he had, indeed, won. That is, he had supposed that he knew--until Arkwright came. Very sharply now, as he listened to Billy's singing, Bertram told himself to be reasonable, to be sensible; that Billy did, indeed, love him. Was she not, according to her own dear assertion, singing that song to him? But it was Arkwright's song. He remembered that, too--and grew faint at the thought."}, {"size": 742, "text": "True, he had won when his rival, music, had been a \u201ccold, senseless thing of spidery marks\u201d on paper; but would that winning stand when \u201cmusic\u201d had become a thing of flesh and blood--a man of undeniable charm, good looks, and winsomeness; a man whose thoughts, aims, and words were the personification of the thing Billy, in the long ago, had declared she loved best of all--music? Bertram shivered as with a sudden chill; then Billy rose from the piano. \u201cThere!\u201d she breathed, her face shyly radiant with the glory of the song. \u201cDid you--like it?\u201d Bertram did his best; but, in his state of mind, the very radiance of her face was only an added torture, and his tongue stumbled over the words of praise and appreciation that he tried to say."}, {"size": 577, "text": "He saw, then, the happy light in Billy's eyes change to troubled questioning and grieved disappointment; and he hated himself for a jealous brute.

SUGARPLUMS Those short December days after Bertram's return from New York were busy ones for everybody. Miss Winthrop was not in town to give sittings for her portrait, it is true; but her absence only afforded Bertram time and opportunity to attend to other work that had been more or less delayed and neglected. He was often at Hillside, however, and the lovers managed to snatch many an hour of quiet happiness from the rush and confusion of the Christmas preparations.

Mrs. Greggory is a lady, Bertram, well-born and well-bred, I'm sure--and that's the pity of it, to have to live in a place like that! They have seen better days, I know. Those pitiful little worn crutches of hers were mahogany, I'm sure, Bertram, and they were silver mounted.\u201d Bertram made a restless movement. \u201cI know, dear; but if you had some one with you!

ALICE GREGGORY Christmas came and went; and in a flurry of snow and sleet January arrived. The holidays over, matters and things seemed to settle down to the winter routine. Miss Winthrop had prolonged her visit in Washington until after Christmas, but she had returned to Boston now--and with her she had brought a brand-new idea for her portrait; an idea that caused her to sweep aside with superb disdain all poses and costumes and sketches to date, and announce herself with disarming winsomeness as \u201call ready now to really begin!\u201dBertram Henshaw was vexed, but helpless. Decidedly he wished to paint Miss Marguerite Winthrop's portrait; but to attempt to paint it when all matters were not to the lady's liking were worse than useless,"}, {"size": 699, "text": "unless he wished to hang this portrait in the gallery of failures along with Anderson's and Fullam's--and that was not the goal he had set for it. As to the sordid money part of the affair--the great J. G. Winthrop himself had come to the artist, and in one terse sentence had doubled the original price and expressed himself as hopeful that Henshaw would put up with \u201cthe child's notions.\u201d It was the old financier's next sentence, however, that put the zest of real determination into Bertram, for because of it, the artist saw what this portrait was going to mean to the stern old man, and how dear was the original of it to a heart that was commonly reported \u201con the street\u201d to be made of stone."}, {"size": 733, "text": "Obviously, then, indeed, there was nothing for Bertram Henshaw to do but to begin the new portrait. And he began it--though still, it must be confessed, with inward questionings. Before a week had passed, however, every trace of irritation had fled, and he was once again the absorbed artist who sees the vision of his desire taking palpable shape at the end of his brush. \u201cIt's all right,\u201d he said to Billy then, one evening. \u201cI'm glad she changed. It's going to be the best, the very best thing I've ever done--I think! by the sketches.\u201d \u201cI'm so glad!\u201d exclaimed Billy. \u201cI'm so glad!\u201d The repetition was so vehement that it sounded almost as if she were trying to convince herself as well as Bertram of something that was not true."}, {"size": 799, "text": "But it was true--Billy told herself very indignantly that it was; indeed it was! Yet the very fact that she had to tell herself this, caused her to know how perilously near she was to being actually jealous of that portrait of Marguerite Winthrop. And it shamed her. Very sternly these days Billy reminded herself of what Kate had said about Bertram's belonging first to his Art. She thought with mortification, too, that it _did_ look as if she were not the proper wife for an artist if she were going to feel like this--always. Very resolutely, then, Billy turned to her music. This was all the more easily done, for, not only did she have her usual concerts and the opera to enjoy, but she had become interested in an operetta her club was about to give; also she had taken up the new song again."}, {"size": 790, "text": "Christmas being over, Mr. Arkwright had been to the house several times. He had changed some of the words and she had improved the melody. The work on the accompaniment was progressing finely now, and Billy was so glad!--when she was absorbed in her music she forgot sometimes that she was ever so unfit an artist's sweetheart as to be--jealous of a portrait. It was quite early in the month that the usually expected \u201cJanuary thaw\u201d came, and it was on a comparatively mild Friday at this time that a matter of business took Billy into the neighborhood of Symphony Hall at about eleven o'clock in the morning. Dismissing John and the car upon her arrival, she said that she would later walk to the home of a friend near by, where she would remain until it was time for the Symphony Concert."}, {"size": 765, "text": "This friend was a girl whom Billy had known at school. She was studying now at the Conservatory of Music; and she had often urged Billy to come and have luncheon with her in her tiny apartment, which she shared with three other girls and a widowed aunt for housekeeper. On this particular Friday it had occurred to Billy that, owing to her business appointment at eleven and the Symphony Concert at half-past two, the intervening time would give her just the opportunity she had been seeking to enable her to accept her friend's invitation. A question asked, and enthusiastically answered in the affirmative, over the telephone that morning, therefore, had speedily completed arrangements, and she had agreed to be at her friend's door by twelve o'clock, or before."}, {"size": 666, "text": "As it happened, business did not take quite so long as she had expected, and half-past eleven found her well on her way to Miss Henderson's home. In spite of the warm sunshine and the slushy snow in the streets, there was a cold, raw wind, and Billy was beginning to feel thankful that she had not far to go when she rounded a corner and came upon a long line of humanity that curved itself back and forth on the wide expanse of steps before Symphony Hall and then stretched itself far up the Avenue. \u201cWhy, what--\u201d she began under her breath; then suddenly she understood. It was Friday. A world-famous pianist was to play with the Symphony Orchestra that afternoon."}, {"size": 689, "text": "This must be the line of patient waiters for the twenty-five-cent balcony seats that Mr. Arkwright had told about. With sympathetic, interested eyes, then, Billy stepped one side to watch the line, for a moment.

If only we hadn't lost that other train!\u201d \u201cWe're too late--you no need to hurry!\u201d the other wailed shrilly to a third girl who was hastening toward them. \u201cThe line is 'way beyond the Children's Hospital and around the corner now--and the ones there _never_ get in!\u201d At the look of tragic disappointment that crossed the third girl's face, Billy's heart ached."}, {"size": 676, "text": "Her first impulse, of course, was to pull her own symphony ticket from her muff and hurry forward with a \u201cHere, take mine!\u201d But that _would_ hardly do, she knew--though she would like to see Aunt Hannah's aghast face if this girl in the red sweater and white tam-o'-shanter should suddenly emerge from among the sumptuous satins and furs and plumes that afternoon and claim the adjacent orchestra chair. But it was out of the question, of course. There was only one seat, and there were three girls, besides all those others. With a sigh, then, Billy turned her eyes back to those others--those many others that made up the long line stretching its weary length up the Avenue."}, {"size": 635, "text": "There were more women than men, yet the men were there: jolly young men who were plainly students; older men whose refined faces and threadbare overcoats hinted at cultured minds and starved bodies; other men who showed no hollows in their cheeks nor near-holes in their garments. It seemed to Billy that women of almost all sorts were there, young, old, and middle-aged; students in tailored suits, widows in crape and veil; girls that were members of a merry party, women that were plainly forlorn and alone. Some in the line shuffled restlessly; some stood rigidly quiet. One had brought a camp stool; many were seated on the steps."}, {"size": 701, "text": "Beyond, where the line passed an open lot, a wooden fence afforded a convenient prop. One read a book, another a paper. Three were studying what was probably the score of the symphony or of the concerto they expected to hear that afternoon. A few did not appear to mind the biting wind, but most of them, by turned-up coat-collars or bent heads, testified to the contrary. Not far from Billy a woman nibbled a sandwich furtively, while beyond her a group of girls were hilariously merry over four triangles of pie which they held up where all might see. Many of the faces were youthful, happy, and alert with anticipation; but others carried a wistfulness and a weariness that made Billy's heart ache."}, {"size": 810, "text": "Her eyes, indeed, filled with quick tears. Later she turned to go, and it was then that she saw in the line a face that she knew--a face that drooped with such a white misery of spent strength that she hurried straight toward it with a low cry. \u201cMiss Greggory!\u201d she exclaimed, when she reached the girl. \u201cYou look actually ill. Are you ill?\u201d For a brief second only dazed questioning stared from the girl's blue-gray eyes. Billy knew when the recognition came, for she saw the painful color stain the white face red. \u201cThank you, no. I am not ill, Miss Neilson,\u201d said the girl, coldly. \u201cBut you look so tired out!\u201d \u201cI have been standing here some time; that is all.\u201d Billy threw a hurried glance down the far-reaching line that she knew had formed since the girl's two tired feet had taken their first position."}, {"size": 661, "text": "\u201cBut you must have come--so early!

How much longer--when will they let you in?\u201d demanded Billy, raising indignant eyes to the huge, gray-pillared building before her, much as if she would pull down the walls if she could, and make way for this tired girl at her side.

I'm keeping her place.\u201d Bertram frowned.

As for the cold--I'm as warm as toast. It won't be long, anyway; she's just gone to get something to eat. Then I'm going to May Henderson's for luncheon.\u201d Bertram sighed impatiently and opened his lips--only to close them with the words unsaid.

He only hoped devoutly that no one in the line knew him ar Billy, and that no one quite knew what had happened. He did not wish to see himself and his fianc\u00e9e the subject of inch-high headlines in some evening paper figuring as: \u201cTalented young composer and her famous artist lover take poor girl's place in a twenty-five-cent ticket line.\u201d He shivered at the thought."}, {"size": 628, "text": "\u201cAre you cold?\u201d worried Billy. \u201cIf you are, don't stand here, please!\u201d He shook his head silently.

The man surmised that it was she, as soon as he saw her, and stepped back at once. He had no wish for introductions. A moment later the girl was in Billy's place, and Billy herself was at his side. \u201cThat was Alice Greggory, Bertram,\u201d she told him, as they walked on swiftly; \u201cand Bertram, she was actually almost _crying_ when she took my place.\u201d \u201cHumph!"}, {"size": 692, "text": "Well, I should think she'd better be,\u201d growled Bertram, perversely. \u201cPooh!

ARKWRIGHT TELLS A STORY Arkwright called Monday afternoon by appointment; and together he and Billy put the finishing touches to the new song.

She was Alice Greggory. I met her with Uncle William first, over a Lowestoft teapot.

Oh, do you know them, really?\u201d \u201cWell, it does look like it,\u201d rejoined Arkwright, showing even deeper interest. \u201cI haven't seen them for four or five years. They used to live in our town. The mother was a little sweet-faced woman with young eyes and prematurely white hair.\u201d \u201cThat describes my Mrs. Greggory exactly,\u201d cried Billy's eager voice. \u201cAnd the daughter?\u201d \u201cAlice?

Now we can know them, and perhaps do something for them. I love that dear little mother already, and I think I should the daughter--if she didn't put out so many prickers that I couldn't get near her! But tell us about them. How did they come here? Why didn't you know they were here?\u201d \u201cAre you good at answering a dozen questions at once?\u201d asked Aunt Hannah, turning smiling eyes from Billy to the man at her side."}, {"size": 695, "text": "\u201cWell, I can try,\u201d he offered. \u201cTo begin with, they are Judge Greggory's widow and daughter. They belong to fine families on both sides, and they used to be well off--really wealthy, for a small town. But the judge was better at money-making than he was at money-keeping, and when he came to die his income stopped, of course, and his estate was found to be in bad shape through reckless loans and worthless investments. That was eight years ago. Things went from bad to worse then, until there was almost nothing left.\u201d \u201cI knew there was some such story as that back of them,\u201d declared Billy. \u201cBut how do you suppose they came here?\u201d \u201cTo get away from--everybody, I suspect,\u201d replied Arkwright."}, {"size": 840, "text": "\u201cThat would be like them.

The Greggorys were that kind. They were morbidly so. From their cheap little cottage, where they did their own work, they stepped out in their shabby garments and old-fashioned hats with heads even more proudly erect than in the old days when their home and their gowns and their doings were the admiration and envy of the town."}, {"size": 893, "text": "You see, they didn't want--that pity.\u201d \u201cI _do_ see,\u201d cried Billy, her face aglow with sudden understanding; \u201cand I don't believe pity would be--nice!\u201d Her own chin was held high as she spoke. \u201cIt must have been hard, indeed,\u201d murmured Aunt Hannah with a sigh, as she set down her teacup. \u201cIt was,\u201d nodded Arkwright. \u201cOf course Mrs. Greggory, with her crippled foot, could do nothing to bring in any money except to sew a little. It all depended on Alice; and when matters got to their worst she began to teach. She was fond of music, and could play the piano well; and of course she had had the best instruction she could get from city teachers only twenty miles away from our home town.

That was too much. Under this last straw their courage broke utterly. Alice dismissed every pupil, sold almost all their remaining goods--they had lots of quite valuable heirlooms; I suspect that's where your Lowestoft teapot came in--and with the money thus gained they left town. Until they could go, they scarcely showed themselves once on the street, they were never at home to callers, and they left without telling one soul where they were going, so far as we could ever learn.\u201d \u201cWhy, the poor dears!\u201d cried Billy."}, {"size": 545, "text": "\u201cHow they must have suffered!

Billy, meanwhile, on her way to the Greggory home, was, as Aunt Hannah had said, \u201cwildly excited.\u201d It seemed so strange and wonderful and delightful--the whole affair: that she should have found them because of a Lowestoft teapot, that Arkwright should know them, and that there should be the chance now that she might help them--in some way; though this last, she knew, could be accomplished only through the exercise of the greatest tact and delicacy."}, {"size": 609, "text": "She had not forgotten that Arkwright had told her of their hatred of pity.

For the first time in years she found herself welcomed into a home of wealth, culture, and refinement as an equal; and the frank cordiality and naturalness of her hostess's evident expectation of meeting a congenial companion was like balm to a sensitive soul rendered morbid by long years of superciliousness and snubbing. No wonder that under the cheery friendliness of it all, Alice Greggory's cold reserve vanished, and that in its place came something very like her old ease and charm of manner."}, {"size": 641, "text": "By the time Aunt Hannah--according to previous agreement--came into the room, the two girls were laughing and chatting over the operetta as if they had known each other for years. Much to Billy's delight, Alice Greggory, as a musician, proved to be eminently satisfactory. She was quick at sight reading, and accurate. She played easily, and with good expression. Particularly was she a good accompanist, possessing to a marked degree that happy faculty of _accompanying_ a singer: which means that she neither led the way nor lagged behind, being always exactly in sympathetic step--than which nothing is more soul-satisfying to the singer."}, {"size": 635, "text": "It was after the music for the operetta had been well-practised and discussed that Alice Greggory chanced to see one of Billy's own songs lying near her.

Billy Neilson is a girl, you know, they say, in spite of--\u201d She stopped abruptly. Her eyes grew wide and questioning. \u201cMiss Neilson--it can't be--you don't mean--is your name--it _is--you!_\u201d she finished joyously, as the telltale color dyed Billy's face.

Come!\u201d--in looking about for a quick something to take her guest's attention, Billy's eyes fell on the manuscript copy of her new song, bearing Arkwright's name. Yielding to a daring impulse, she drew it hastily forward. \u201cHere's a new one--a brand-new one, not even printed yet. Don't you think the words are pretty?\u201d she asked.

Arkwright,\u201d she said with smooth unconcern, but with a covert glance at the other's face. \u201cEver hear of him?\u201d Alice Greggory gave a short little laugh. \u201cProbably not--this one. I used to know an M. J. Arkwright, long ago; but he wasn't--a poet, so far as I know,\u201d she finished, with a little catch in her breath that made Billy long to take her into a warm embrace.

They went directly to their pretty little apartment on Beacon Street, Brookline, within easy walking distance of Billy's own cozy home. Cyril intended to build in a year or two. Meanwhile they had a very pretty, convenient home which was, according to Bertram, \u201celectrified to within an inch of its life, and equipped with everything that was fireless, smokeless, dustless, and laborless.\u201d In it Marie had a spotlessly white kitchen where she might make puddings to her heart's content."}, {"size": 717, "text": "Marie had--again according to Bertram--\u201ca visiting acquaintance with a maid.\u201d In other words, a stout woman was engaged to come two days in the week to wash, iron, and scrub; also to come in each night to wash the dinner dishes, thus leaving Marie's evenings free--\u201cfor the shaded lamp,\u201d Billy said. Marie had not arrived at this--to her, delightful--arrangement of a \u201cvisiting acquaintance\u201d without some opposition from her friends.

Of course, when we have a house--I'm not sure, then, though, that I sha'n't dress up the maid and order her to receive the calls and go to the pink teas, while I make her puddings,\u201d she finished saucily, as Billy began to laugh again.

Though it is safe to say it was not far different from the one Cyril used--in his thoughts. Bertram himself, these days, was more than busy. Besides working on Miss Winthrop's portrait, and on two or three other commissions, he was putting the finishing touches to four pictures which he was to show in the exhibition soon to be held by a prominent Art Club of which he was the acknowledged \u201cstar\u201d member. Naturally, therefore, his time was well occupied. Naturally, too, Billy, knowing this, lashed herself more sternly than ever into a daily reminder of Kate's assertion that he belonged first to his Art."}, {"size": 660, "text": "In pursuance of this idea, Billy was careful to see that no engagement with herself should in any way interfere with the artist's work, and that no word of hers should attempt to keep him at her side when ART called.

That these tactics on her part were beginning to fill her lover with vague alarm and a very definite unrest, she did not once suspect. Eagerly, therefore,--even with conscientious delight--she welcomed the new song-words that Arkwright brought--they would give her something else to take up her time and attention."}, {"size": 683, "text": "She welcomed them, also, for another reason: they would bring Arkwright more often to the house, and this would, of course, lead to that \u201ccasual meeting\u201d between him and Alice Greggory when the rehearsals for the operetta should commence--which would be very soon now. And Billy did so long to bring about that meeting! To Billy, all this was but \u201coccupying her mind,\u201d and playing Cupid's assistant to a worthy young couple torn cruelly apart by an unfeeling fate. To Bertram--to Bertram it was terror, and woe, and all manner of torture; for in it Bertram saw only a growing fondness on the part of Billy for Arkwright, Arkwright's music, Arkwright's words, and Arkwright's friends."}, {"size": 709, "text": "The first rehearsal for the operetta came on Wednesday evening. There would be another on Thursday afternoon. Billy had told Alice Greggory to arrange her pupils so that she could stay Wednesday night at Hillside, if the crippled mother could get along alone--and she could, Alice had said. Thursday forenoon, therefore, Alice Greggory would, in all probability, be at Hillside, specially as there would doubtless be an appointment or two for private rehearsal with some nervous soloist whose part was not progressing well. Such being the case, Billy had a plan she meant to carry out. She was highly pleased, therefore, when Thursday morning came, and everything, apparently, was working exactly to her mind."}, {"size": 642, "text": "Alice was there.

She's writing letters in my room, Now here's a book, and you _may_ read, but I should prefer you to sleep,\u201d she nodded brightly as she went out and shut the door quietly.

And then--What happened next was, in Billy's mind, very vague, but very attractive as a nucleus for one's thoughts, nevertheless. All this was, indeed, a fine plan; but--(If only fine plans would not so often have a \u201cbut\u201d!)

Billy greeted him so eagerly, and at the same time with such evident disappointment at his late arrival, that Arkwright's heart sang with joy. \u201cBut there's a rehearsal at quarter of eleven,\u201d exclaimed Billy, in answer to his hurried explanation of the delay; \u201cand this gives so little time for--for--so little time, you know,\u201d she finished in confusion, casting frantically about in her mind for an excuse to hurry up-stairs and send Alice Greggory down before it should be quite too late."}, {"size": 605, "text": "No wonder that Arkwright, noting the sparkle in her eye, the agitation in her manner, and the embarrassed red in her cheek, took new courage. For so long had this girl held him at the end of a major third or a diminished seventh; for so long had she blithely accepted his every word and act as devotion to music, not herself--for so long had she done all this that he had come to fear that never would she do anything else. No wonder then, that now, in the soft radiance of the strange, new light on her face, his own face glowed ardently, and that he leaned forward with an impetuous rush of eager words."}, {"size": 646, "text": "\u201cBut there is time, Miss Billy--if you'd give me leave--to say--\u201d \u201cI'm afraid I kept you waiting,\u201d interrupted the hurried voice of Alice Greggory from the hall doorway. \u201cI was asleep, I think, when a clock somewhere, striking eleven--Why, Mr.--Arkwright!\u201d Not until Alice Greggory had nearly crossed the room did she see that the man standing by her hostess was--not the tenor she had expected to find--but an old acquaintance. Then it was that the tremulous \u201cMr.-Arkwright!\u201d fell from her lips. Billy and Arkwright had turned at her first words.

I was just trying to think up an excuse to come up and send down Miss Greggory, when Mary Jane began to tell me something--I haven't the faintest idea what--then _she_ appeared, and it was all over.

So he had told it. \u201cBut what shall we do, Miss Greggory?\u201d appealed Billy. \u201cIt _is_ a hard part, you know; but if Mr. Tobey can't take it, I don't know who can. We don't want to hire a singer for it, if we can help it. The profits are to go to the Home for Crippled Children, you know,\u201d she explained, turning to Arkwright, \u201cand we decided to hire only the accompanist.\u201d An odd expression flitted across Miss Greggory's face."}, {"size": 897, "text": "\u201cMr. Arkwright used to sing--tenor,\u201d she observed quietly. \u201cAs if he didn't now--a perfectly glorious tenor,\u201d retorted Billy. \u201cBut as if _he_ would take _this!_\u201d For only a brief moment did Arkwright hesitate; then blandly he suggested: \u201cSuppose you try him, and see.\u201d Billy sat suddenly erect. \u201cWould you, really? _Could_ you--take the time, and all?\u201d she cried. \u201cYes, I think I would--under the circumstances,\u201d he smiled. \u201cI think I could, too, though I might not be able to attend all the rehearsals. Still, if I find I have to ask permission, I'll endeavor to convince the powers-that-be that singing in this operetta will be just the stepping-stone I need to success in Grand Opera.\u201d \u201cOh, if you only would take it,\u201d breathed Billy, \u201cwe'd be so glad!\u201d \u201cWell,\u201d said Arkwright, his eyes on Billy's frankly delighted face, \u201cas I said before--under the circumstances I think I would.\u201d \u201cThank you!"}, {"size": 577, "text": "Then it's all beautifully settled,\u201d rejoiced Billy, with a happy sigh; and unconsciously she gave Alice Greggory's hand near her a little pat.

Billy would have been surprised indeed--and dismayed--had she known that in Arkwright's mind the \u201ccircumstances\u201d were herself, and the fact that she, too, had a part in the operetta, necessitating her presence at rehearsals, and hinting at a delightful comradeship impossible, perhaps, otherwise."}, {"size": 678, "text": "CHAPTER XXIII. THE CAUSE AND BERTRAM February came The operetta, for which Billy was working so hard, was to be given the twentieth.

On the eleventh day of February Mrs. Greggory and her daughter arrived at Hillside for a ten-days' visit.

The pair called each other, ceremoniously, \u201cMr. Arkwright,\u201d and \u201cMiss Greggory\u201d--but then, that, of course, did not \u201csignify,\u201d Billy declared to herself. \u201cI suppose you don't ever call him 'Mary Jane,'\u201d she said to the girl, a little mischievously, one day. \u201c'Mary Jane'? Mr. Arkwright? No, I don't,\u201d rejoined Miss Greggory, with an odd smile.

You'll have to go to him.\u201d \u201cOh, well, I can still call him 'Mary Jane,'\u201d retorted Billy, with airy disdain.

To be sure, Bertram and happiness were supposed to be somewhere in the dim and uncertain future; but between her and them lay all these other woes, chief of which was the unutterable tragedy of to-morrow night. It was to be a failure, of course. Billy had calmly made up her mind to that, now."}, {"size": 601, "text": "But then, she was used to failures, she told herself.

And yet--whenever again could she expect such opportunities to further her Cause as had been hers the past few weeks, through the operetta and its rehearsals? Certainly, never again!

Do you think it's going to rain?--that is, outdoors, of course, I mean.\u201d Arkwright dropped into the seat behind Billy and leaned forward, his eyes striving to read the girl's half-averted face.

Nor was this all that, to Billy, made life worth the living: Arkwright had begged permission that evening to come up the following afternoon to tell her his \u201cstory\u201d; and Billy, who was so joyously confident that this story meant the final crowning of her Cause with victory, had given happy consent."}, {"size": 585, "text": "Bertram was to come up in the evening, and Billy was anticipating that, too, particularly: it had been so long since they had known a really free, comfortable evening together, with nothing to interrupt.

ARKWRIGHT TELLS ANOTHER STORY Promptly at the suggested hour on the day after the operetta, Arkwright rang Billy Neilson's doorbell.

She drew back and would have risen to her feet had the thought not come to her that twice before she had supposed a man was making love to her, when subsequent events proved that she had been mortifyingly mistaken: once when Cyril had told her of his love for Marie; and again when William had asked her to come back as a daughter to the house she had left desolate."}, {"size": 758, "text": "Telling herself sternly now not to be for the third time a \u201cfoolish little simpleton,\u201d she summoned all her wits, forced a cheery smile to her lips, and said: \u201cWell, really, Mr. Arkwright, of course I can't answer for the girl, so I'm not the one to give hope; and--\u201d \u201cBut you are the one,\u201d interrupted the man, passionately. \u201cYou're the only one!

It was as if, by the mere utterance of the word, wife, she had drawn a sacred circle about her and placed herself in sanctuary.

A power quite outside herself kept Billy's eyes on Arkwright's face, and forced her to watch the change there from unbelief to belief, and from belief to set misery. \u201cNo, I did not know,\u201d said the man then, dully, as he turned, rested his arm on the mantel behind him, and half shielded his face with his hand.

Seems to me I have a right to know.\u201d Billy hesitated. To her mind, a girl who would tell of the unrequited love of a man for herself, was unspeakably base. To tell Bertram Arkwright's love story was therefore impossible. Yet, in some way, she must set Bertram's mind at rest. \u201cDearest,\u201d she began slowly, her eyes wistfully pleading, \u201cjust what it is, I can't tell you.

Cousin Jane couldn't sleep nights, because she was always lying awake to find out just what time it was; so Marie had written her about Aunt Hannah's clock. And now this Cousin Jane has fixed _her_ clock, and she sleeps like a top, just because she knows there'll never be but half an hour that she doesn't know what time it is!\u201d Bertram smiled, and murmured a polite \u201cWell, I'm sure that's fine!\u201d; but the words were plainly abstracted, and the frown had not left his brow."}, {"size": 627, "text": "Nor did it quite leave till some time later, when Billy, in answer to a question of his about another operetta, cried, with a shudder: \u201cMercy, I hope not, dear!

Operetta, to Bertram, meant interruptions, interferences, and the constant presence of Arkwright, the Greggorys, and innumerable creatures who wished to rehearse or to change wigs--all of which Bertram abhorred.

Sometimes she seemed like her old self; and he breathed more freely, telling himself that his fears were groundless.

Worse yet, all this seemed to be connected in some strange way with Arkwright."}, {"size": 798, "text": "He found this out by accident one day.

He hasn't been here lately,\u201d murmured Billy, reaching for a book on the table. At a peculiar something in her voice, he had looked up quickly, only to find, to his great surprise, that her face showed a painful flush as she bent over the book in her hand. He had said nothing more at the time, but he had not forgotten. Several times, after that, he had introduced the man's name, and never had it failed to bring a rush of color, a biting of the lip, or a quick change of position followed always by the troubled eyes and nervous manner that he had learned to dread."}, {"size": 655, "text": "He noticed then that never, of her own free will, did she herself mention the man; never did she speak of him with the old frank lightness as \u201cMary Jane.\u201d By casual questions asked from time to time, Bertram had learned that Arkwright never came there now, and that the song-writing together had been given up. Curiously enough, this discovery, which would once have filled Bertram with joy, served now only to deepen his distress.

He knew only that he was frightened, and badly frightened."}, {"size": 647, "text": "Bertram had not forgotten the evening after the operetta, and Billy's tear-stained face on that occasion. He dated the whole thing, in fact, from that evening. He fell to wondering one day if that, too, had anything to do with Arkwright. He determined then to find out. Shamelessly--for the good of the cause--he set a trap for Billy's unwary feet. Very adroitly one day he led the talk straight to Arkwright; then he asked abruptly: \u201cWhere is the chap, I wonder! Why, he hasn't shown up once since the operetta, has he?\u201d Billy, always truthful,--and just now always embarrassed when Arkwright's name was mentioned,--walked straight into the trap."}, {"size": 793, "text": "\u201cOh, yes; well, he was here once--the day after the operetta. I haven't seen him since.\u201d Bertram answered a light something, but his face grew a little white. Now that the trap had been sprung and the victim caught, he almost wished that he had not set any trap at all. He knew now it was true. Arkwright had been with Billy the day after the operetta, and her tears and her distress that evening had been caused by something Arkwright had said. It was Arkwright's secret that she could not tell. It was Arkwright to whom she must be fair. It was Arkwright's sorrow that she \u201ccould not help--now.\u201d Naturally, with these tools in his hands, and aided by days of brooding and nights of sleeplessness, it did not take Bertram long to fashion The Thing that finally loomed before him as The Truth."}, {"size": 752, "text": "He understood it all now.

That was why she could not \u201chelp it-now.\u201d (Bertram writhed in agony at the thought.) Since that meeting Arkwright had not been near the house.

Bertram remembered her face as it had looked all those long summer days while her heart was being slowly broken; and he thought he could see that same look in her eyes now."}, {"size": 754, "text": "All of which only goes to prove with what woeful skill Bertram had fashioned this Thing that was looming before him as The Truth. The exhibition of \u201cThe Bohemian Ten\u201d was to open with a private view on the evening of the twentieth of March. Bertram Henshaw's one contribution was to be his portrait of Miss Marguerite Winthrop--the piece of work that had come to mean so much to him; the piece of work upon which already he felt the focus of multitudes of eyes. Miss Winthrop was in Boston now, and it was during these early March days that Bertram was supposed to be putting in his best work on the portrait; but, unfortunately, it was during these same early March days that he was engaged, also, in fashioning The Thing--and the two did not harmonize."}, {"size": 651, "text": "The Thing, indeed, was a jealous creature, and would brook no rival.

Bertram saw The Thing, and saw, too, the grievous result of her presence. Despairingly he fought against her and her work; but The Thing had become full grown now, and was The Truth. Hence she was not to be banished. She even, in a taunting way, seemed sometimes to be justifying her presence, for she reminded him: \u201cAfter all, what's the difference?"}, {"size": 696, "text": "What do you care for this, or anything again if Billy is lost to you?\u201d But the artist told himself fiercely that he did care--that he must care--for his work; and he struggled--how he struggled!--to ignore the horrid visions and the sickening thoughts, and to pierce the veil of fear so that his hand might be steady and his brush regain its skill. And so he worked. Sometimes he let his work remain. Sometimes one hour saw only the erasing of what the hour before had wrought. Sometimes the elusive something in Marguerite Winthrop's face seemed right at the tip of his brush--on the canvas, even. He saw success then so plainly that for a moment it almost--but not quite--blotted out The Thing."}, {"size": 377, "text": "At other times that elusive something on the high-bred face of his model was a veritable will-o'-the-wisp, refusing to be caught and held, even in his eye.

BILLY TAKES HER TURNIf for Billy those first twenty days of March did not carry quite the tragedy they contained for Bertram, they were, nevertheless, not really happy ones. She was vaguely troubled by a curious something in Bertram's behavior that she could not name; she was grieved over Arkwright's sorrow, and she was constantly probing her own past conduct to see if anywhere she could find that she was to blame for that sorrow.

She was so glad, now, that she had waited. Just once, since Arkwright's last call, she had tried to sing that song. But she had stopped at the end of the first two lines.

Billy had little to say to Alice Greggory of Arkwright. Billy was no longer trying to play Cupid's assistant. The Cause, for which she had so valiantly worked, had been felled by Arkwright's own hand--but that there were still some faint stirrings of life in it was evidenced by Billy's secret delight when one day Alice Greggory chanced to mention that Arkwright had called the night before upon her and her mother."}, {"size": 632, "text": "\u201cHe brought us news of our old home,\u201d she explained a little hurriedly, to Billy. \u201cHe had heard from his mother, and he thought some things she said would be interesting to us.\u201d \u201cOf course,\u201d murmured Billy, carefully excluding from her voice any hint of the delight she felt, but hoping, all the while, that Alice would continue the subject. Alice, however, had nothing more to say; and Billy was left in entire ignorance of what the news was that Arkwright had brought.

But he knew, afterwards, that he did not really know it--till he read the newspapers during the next few days.There was praise--oh, yes; the faint praise that kills. There was some adverse criticism, too; but it was of the light, insincere variety that is given to mediocre work by unimportant artists."}, {"size": 790, "text": "Then, here and there, appeared the signed critiques of the men whose opinion counted--and Bertram knew that he had failed. Neither as a work of art, nor as a likeness, was the portrait the success that Henshaw's former work would seem to indicate that it should have been. Indeed, as one caustic pen put it, if this were to be taken as a sample of what was to follow--then the famous originator of \u201cThe Face of a Girl\u201d had \u201ca most distinguished future behind him.\u201d Seldom, if ever before, had an exhibited portrait attracted so much attention. As Bertram had said, uncounted eyes were watching for it before it was hung, because it was a portrait of the noted beauty, Marguerite Winthrop, and because two other well-known artists had failed where he, Bertram Henshaw, was hoping to succeed."}, {"size": 606, "text": "After it was hung, and the uncounted eyes had seen it--either literally, or through the eyes of the critics--interest seemed rather to grow than to lessen, for other uncounted eyes wanted to see what all the fuss was about, anyway. And when these eyes had seen, their owners talked. Nor did they, by any means, all talk against the portrait. Some were as loud in its praise as were others in its condemnation; all of which, of course, but helped to attract more eyes to the cause of it all. For Bertram and his friends these days were, naturally, trying ones. William finally dreaded to open his newspaper."}, {"size": 745, "text": "(It had become the fashion, when murders and divorces were scarce, occasionally to \u201cfeature\u201d somebody's opinion of the Henshaw portrait, on the first page--something that had almost never been known to happen before.) Cyril, according to Marie, played \u201cperfectly awful things on his piano every day, now.\u201d Aunt Hannah had said \u201cOh, my grief and conscience!\u201d so many times that it melted now into a wordless groan whenever a new unfriendly criticism of the portrait met her indignant eyes. Of all Bertram's friends, Billy, perhaps not unnaturally, was the angriest. Not only did she, after a time, refuse to read the papers, but she refused even to allow certain ones to be brought into the house, foolish and unreasonable as she knew this to be."}, {"size": 700, "text": "As to the artist himself, Bertram's face showed drawn lines and his eyes sombre shadows, but his words and manner carried a stolid indifference that to Billy was at once heartbreaking and maddening. \u201cBut, Bertram, why don't you do something? Why don't you say something? Why don't you act something?\u201d she burst out one day. The artist shrugged his shoulders. \u201cBut, my dear, what can I say, or do, or act?\u201d he asked. \u201cI don't know, of course,\u201d sighed Billy. \u201cBut I know what I'd like to do. I should like to go out and--fight somebody!\u201d So fierce were words and manner, coupled as they were with a pair of gentle eyes ablaze and two soft little hands doubled into menacing fists, that Bertram laughed."}, {"size": 663, "text": "\u201cWhat a fiery little champion it is, to be sure,\u201d he said tenderly. \u201cBut as if fighting could do any good--in this case!\u201d Billy's tense muscles relaxed. Her eyes filled with tears. \u201cNo, I don't suppose it would,\u201d she choked, beginning to cry, so that Bertram had to turn comforter. \u201cCome, come, dear,\u201d he begged; \u201cdon't take it so to heart. It's not so bad, after all. I've still my good right hand left, and we'll hope there's something in it yet--that'll be worth while.\u201d \u201cBut _this_ one isn't bad,\u201d stormed Billy. \u201cIt's splendid! I'm sure, I think it's a b-beautiful portrait, and I don't see _what_ people mean by talking so about it!\u201d Bertram shook his head."}, {"size": 574, "text": "His eyes grew sombre again. \u201cThank you, dear. But I know--and you know, really--that it isn't a splendid portrait. I've done lots better work than that.\u201d \u201cThen why don't they look at those, and let this alone?\u201d wailed Billy, with indignation. \u201cBecause I deliberately put up this for them to see,\u201d smiled the artist, wearily. Billy sighed, and twisted in her chair. \u201cWhat does--Mr. Winthrop say?\u201d she asked at last, in a faint voice. Bertram lifted his head. \u201cMr. Winthrop's been a trump all through, dear. He's already insisted on paying for this--and he's ordered another.\u201d"}, {"size": 632, "text": "\u201cYes. The old fellow never minces his words, as you may know. He came to me one day, put his hand on my shoulder, and said tersely: 'Will you give me another, same terms? Go in, boy, and win. Show 'em! I lost the first ten thousand I made. I didn't the next!' That's all he said. Before I could even choke out an answer he was gone. Gorry! talk about his having a 'heart of stone'! I don't believe another man in the country would have done that--and done it in the way he did--in the face of all this talk,\u201d finished Bertram, his eyes luminous with feeling. \u201cPerhaps--his daughter--influenced him--some.\u201d \u201cPerhaps,\u201d nodded Bertram."}, {"size": 616, "text": "\u201cShe, too, has been very kind, all the way through.\u201d Billy hesitated again. \u201cBut I thought--it was going so splendidly,\u201d she faltered, in a half-stifled voice. \u201cSo it was--at the first.\u201d \u201cThen what--ailed it, at the last, do you suppose?\u201d Billy was holding her breath till he should answer. The man got to his feet. \u201cBilly, don't--don't ask me,\u201d he begged. \u201cPlease don't let's talk of it any more. It can't do any good! I just flunked--that's all. My hand failed me. Maybe I tried too hard. Maybe I was tired. Maybe something--troubled me. Never mind, dear, what it was. It can do no good even to think of that--now."}, {"size": 641, "text": "So just let's--drop it, please, dear,\u201d he finished, his face working with emotion. And Billy dropped it--so far as words were concerned; but she could not drop it from her thoughts--specially after Kate's letter came. Kate's letter was addressed to Billy, and it said, after speaking of various other matters: \u201cAnd now about poor Bertram's failure.\u201d (Billy frowned. In Billy's presence no one was allowed to say \u201cBertram's failure\u201d; but a letter has a most annoying privilege of saying what it pleases without let or hindrance, unless one tears it up--and a letter destroyed unread remains always such a tantalizing mystery of possibilities!"}, {"size": 773, "text": "So Billy let the letter talk.) \u201cOf course we have heard of it away out here. I do wish if Bertram _must_ paint such famous people, he would manage to flatter them up--in the painting, I mean, of course--enough so that it might pass for a success! \u201cThe technical part of all this criticism I don't pretend to understand in the least; but from what I hear and read, he must, indeed, have made a terrible mess of it, and of course I'm very sorry--and some surprised, too, for usually he paints such pretty pictures! \u201cStill, on the other hand, Billy, I'm not surprised. William says that Bertram has been completely out of fix over something, and as gloomy as an owl, for weeks past; and of course, under those circumstances, the poor boy could not be expected to do good work."}, {"size": 772, "text": "Now William, being a man, is not supposed to understand what the trouble is. But I, being a woman, can see through a pane of glass when it's held right up before me; and I can guess, of course, that a woman is at the bottom of it--she always is!--and that you, being his special fancy at the moment\u201d (Billy almost did tear the letter now--but not quite), \u201care that woman. \u201cNow, Billy, you don't like such frank talk, of course; but, on the other hand, I know you do not want to ruin the dear boy's career. So, for heaven's sake, if you two have been having one of those quarrels that lovers so delight in--do, please, for the good of the cause, make up quick, or else quarrel harder and break it off entirely--which, honestly, would be the better way, I think, all around."}, {"size": 832, "text": "\u201cThere, there, my dear child, don't bristle up! I am very fond of you, and would dearly love to have you for a sister--if you'd only take William, as you should! But, as you very well know, I never did approve of this last match at all, for either of your sakes. \u201cHe can't make you happy, my dear, and you can't make him happy. Bertram never was--and never will be--a marrying man. He's too temperamental--too thoroughly wrapped up in his Art. Girls have never meant anything to him but a beautiful picture to paint. And they never will. They can't. He's made that way. Listen! I can prove it to you. Up to this winter he's always been a care-free, happy, jolly fellow, and you _know_ what beautiful work he has done. Never before has he tied himself to any one girl till last fall. Then you two entered into this absurd engagement."}, {"size": 705, "text": "\u201cNow what has it been since? William wrote me himself not a fortnight ago that he'd been worried to death over Bertram for weeks past, he's been so moody, so irritable, so fretted over his work, so unlike himself. And his picture has _failed_ dismally. Of course William doesn't understand; but I do. I know you've probably quarrelled, or something. You know how flighty and unreliable you can be sometimes, Billy, and I don't say that to mean anything against you, either--that's _your_ way. You're just as temperamental in your art, music, as Bertram is in his. You're utterly unsuited to him. If Bertram is to marry _anybody_, it should be some quiet, staid, sensible girl who would be a _help_ to him."}, {"size": 273, "text": "But when I think of you two flyaway flutterbudgets marrying--! \u201cNow, for heaven's sake, Billy, _do_ make up or something--and do it now. Don't, for pity's sake, let Bertram ever put out another such a piece of work to shame us all like this. Do you want to ruin his career?"}, {"size": 778, "text": "\u201cP. S. _I_ think William's the one for you. He's devoted to you, and his quiet, sensible affection is just what your temperament needs. I _always_ thought William was the one for you. Think it over. \u201cP. S. No. 2. You can see by the above that it isn't you I'm objecting to, my dear. It's just _you-and-Bertram_. CHAPTER XXX. \u201cI'VE HINDERED HIM\u201d Billy was shaking with anger and terror by the time she had finished reading Kate's letter. Anger was uppermost at the moment, and with one sweeping wrench of her trembling fingers she tore the closely written sheets straight through the middle, and flung them into the little wicker basket by her desk. Then she went down-stairs and played her noisiest, merriest Tarantella, and tried to see how fast she could make her fingers fly."}, {"size": 600, "text": "But Billy could not, of course, play tarantellas all day; and even while she did play them she could not forget that waste-basket up-stairs, and the horror it contained. The anger was still uppermost, but the terror was prodding her at every turn, and demanding to know just what it was that Kate had written in that letter, anyway. It is not strange then, perhaps, that before two hours passed, Billy went up-stairs, took the letter from the basket, matched together the torn half-sheets and forced her shrinking eyes to read every word again-just to satisfy that terror which would not be silenced."}, {"size": 752, "text": "At the end of the second reading, Billy reminded herself with stern calmness that it was only Kate, after all; that nobody ought to mind what Kate said; that certainly _she_, Billy, ought not--after the experience she had already had with her unpleasant interference! Kate did not know what she was talking about, anyway. This was only another case of her trying \u201cto manage.\u201d She did so love to manage--everything! At this point Billy got out her pen and paper and wrote to Kate. It was a formal, cold little letter, not at all the sort that Billy's friends usually received. It thanked Kate for her advice, and for her \u201ckind willingness\u201d to have Billy for a sister; but it hinted that perhaps Kate did not realize that as long as Billy was the one who"}, {"size": 613, "text": "would have to _live_ with the chosen man, it would be pleasanter to take the one Billy loved, which happened in this case to be Bertram--not William. As for any \u201cquarrel\u201d being the cause of whatever fancied trouble there was with the new picture--the letter scouted that idea in no uncertain terms. There had been no suggestion of a quarrel even once since the engagement. Then Billy signed her name and took the letter out to post immediately. For the first few minutes after the letter had been dropped into the green box at the corner, Billy held her head high, and told herself that the matter was now closed."}, {"size": 758, "text": "She had sent Kate a courteous, dignified, conclusive, effectual answer, and she thought with much satisfaction of the things she had said. Very soon, however, she began to think--not so much of what _she_ had said--but of what Kate had said. Many of Kate's sentences were unpleasantly vivid in her mind. They seemed, indeed, to stand out in letters of flame, and they began to burn, and burn, and burn. These were some of them: \u201cWilliam says that Bertram has been completely out of fix over something, and as gloomy as an owl for weeks past.\u201d \u201cA woman is at the bottom of it--... you are that woman.\u201d \u201cYou can't make him happy.\u201d \u201cBertram never was--and never will be--a marrying man.\u201d \u201cGirls have never meant anything to him but a beautiful picture to paint."}, {"size": 641, "text": "And they never will.\u201d \u201cUp to this winter he's always been a carefree, happy, jolly fellow, and you _know_ what beautiful work he has done. Never before has he tied himself to any one girl until last fall.\u201d \u201cNow what has it been since?\u201d \u201cHe's been so moody, so irritable, so fretted over his work, so unlike himself; and his picture has failed, dismally.\u201d \u201cDo you want to ruin his career?\u201d Billy began to see now that she had not really answered Kate's letter at all. The matter was not closed. Her reply had been, perhaps, courteous and dignified--but it had not been conclusive nor effectual. Billy had reached home now, and she was crying."}, {"size": 576, "text": "Bertram _had_ acted strangely, of late. Bertram _had_ seemed troubled over something. His picture _had_--With a little shudder Billy tossed aside these thoughts, and dug at her teary eyes with a determined hand. Fiercely she told herself that the matter _was_ settled. Very scornfully she declared that it was \u201conly Kate,\u201d after all, and that she _would not_ let Kate make her unhappy again! Forthwith she picked up a current magazine and began to read. As it chanced, however, even here Billy found no peace; for the first article she opened to was headed in huge black type:"}, {"size": 641, "text": "\u201cMARRIAGE AND THE ARTISTIC TEMPERAMENT.\u201d With a little cry Billy flung the magazine far from her, and picked up another. But even \u201cThe Elusiveness of Chopin,\u201d which she found here, could not keep her thoughts nor her eyes from wandering to the discarded thing in the corner, lying ignominiously face down with crumpled, out-flung leaves. Billy knew that in the end she should go over and pick that magazine up, and read that article from beginning to end. She was not surprised, therefore, when she did it--but she was not any the happier for having done it.The writer of the article did not approve of marriage and the artistic temperament."}, {"size": 686, "text": "He said the artist belonged to his Art, and to posterity through his Art. The essay fairly bristled with many-lettered words and high-sounding phrases, few of which Billy really understood. She did understand enough, however, to feel, guiltily, when the thing was finished, that already she had married Bertram, and by so doing had committed a Crime. She had slain Art, stifled Ambition, destroyed Inspiration, and been a nuisance generally. In consequence of which Bertram would henceforth and forevermore be doomed to Littleness. Naturally, in this state of mind, and with this vision before her, Billy was anything but her bright, easy self when she met Bertram an hour or two later."}, {"size": 614, "text": "Naturally, too, Bertram, still the tormented victim of the bugaboo his jealous fears had fashioned, was just in the mood to place the worst possible construction on his sweetheart's very evident unhappiness. With sighs, unspoken questions, and frequently averted eyes, therefore, the wretched evening passed, a pitiful misery to them both. During the days that followed, Billy thought that the world itself must be in league with Kate, so often did she encounter Kate's letter masquerading under some thin disguise. She did not stop to realize that because she was so afraid she _would_ find it, she _did_ find it."}, {"size": 640, "text": "In the books she read, in the plays she saw, in the chance words she heard spoken by friend or stranger--always there was something to feed her fears in one way or another. Even in a yellowed newspaper that had covered the top shelf in her closet she found one day a symposium on whether or not an artist's wife should be an artist; and she shuddered--but she read every opinion given. Some writers said no, and some, yes; and some said it all depended--on the artist and his wife. Billy found much food for thought, some for amusement, and a little that made for peace of mind. On the whole it opened up a new phase of the matter, perhaps."}, {"size": 605, "text": "At all events, upon finishing it she almost sobbed: \u201cOne would think that just because I write a song now and then, I was going to let Bertram starve, and go with holes in his socks and no buttons on his clothes!\u201d It was that afternoon that Billy went to see Marie; but even there she did not escape, for the gentle Marie all unknowingly added her mite to the woeful whole. Billy found Marie in tears. \u201cWhy, Marie!\u201d she cried in dismay. \u201cSh-h!\u201d warned Marie, turning agonized eyes toward the closed door of Cyril's den. \u201cBut, dear, what is it?\u201d begged Billy, with no less dismay, but with greater caution."}, {"size": 612, "text": "\u201cSh-h!\u201d admonished Marie again. On tiptoe, then, she led the way to a room at the other end of the tiny apartment. Once there; she explained in a more natural tone of voice: \u201cCyril's at work on a new piece for the piano.\u201d \u201cWell, what if he is?\u201d demanded Billy. \u201cThat needn't make you cry, need it?\u201d \u201cOh, no--no, indeed,\u201d demurred Marie, in a shocked voice. \u201cWell, then, what is it?\u201d Marie hesitated; then, with the abandon of a hurt child that longs for sympathy, she sobbed: \u201cIt--it's just that I'm afraid, after all, that I'm not good enough for Cyril.\u201d Billy stared frankly. \u201cNot _good_ enough, Marie Henshaw!"}, {"size": 642, "text": "Whatever in the world do you mean?\u201d \u201cWell, not good _for_ him, then. Listen! To-day, I know, in lots of ways I must have disappointed him. First, he put on some socks that I'd darned. They were the first since our marriage that I'd found to darn, and I'd been so proud and--and happy while I _was_ darning them. But--but he took 'em off right after breakfast and threw 'em in a corner. Then he put on a new pair, and said that I--I needn't darn any more; that it made--bunches. Billy, _my darns--bunches!_\u201d Marie's face and voice were tragic. \u201cNonsense, dear! Don't let that fret you,\u201d comforted Billy, promptly, trying not to laugh too hard."}, {"size": 769, "text": "\u201cIt wasn't _your_ darns; it was just darns--anybody's darns. Cyril won't wear darned socks. Aunt Hannah told me so long ago, and I said then there'd be a tragedy when _you_ found it out. So don't worry over that.\u201d \u201cOh, but that isn't all,\u201d moaned Marie. \u201cListen! You know how quiet he must have everything when he's composing--and he ought to have it, too! But I forgot, this morning, and put on some old shoes that didn't have any rubber heels, and I ran the carpet sweeper, and I rattled tins in the kitchen. But I never thought a thing until he opened his door and asked me _please_ to change my shoes and let the--the confounded dirt go, and didn't I have any dishes in the house but what were made of that abominable tin s-stuff,\u201d she finished in a wail of misery."}, {"size": 609, "text": "Billy burst into a ringing laugh, but Marie's aghast face and upraised hand speedily reduced it to a convulsive giggle. \u201cYou dear child! Cyril's always like that when he's composing,\u201d soothed Billy. \u201cI supposed you knew it, dear. Don't you fret! Run along and make him his favorite pudding, and by night both of you will have forgotten there ever were such things in the world as tins and shoes and carpet sweepers that clatter.\u201d Marie shook her head. Her dismal face did not relax. \u201cYou don't understand,\u201d she moaned. \u201cIt's myself. I've _hindered_ him!\u201d She brought out the word with an agony of slow horror."}, {"size": 684, "text": "\u201cAnd only to-day I read-here, look!\u201d she faltered, going to the table and picking up with shaking hands a magazine. Billy recognized it by the cover at once--another like it had been flung not so long ago by her own hand into the corner. She was not surprised, therefore, to see very soon at the end of Marie's trembling finger: \u201cMarriage and the Artistic Temperament.\u201d Billy did not give a ringing laugh this time. She gave an involuntary little shudder, though she tried valiantly to turn it all off with a light word of scorn, and a cheery pat on Marie's heaving shoulders. But she went home very soon; and it was plain to be seen that her visit to Marie had not brought her peace."}, {"size": 714, "text": "Billy knew Kate's letter, by heart, now, both in the original, and in its different versions, and she knew that, despite her struggles, she was being forced straight toward Kate's own verdict: that she, Billy, _was_ the cause, in some way, of the deplorable change in Bertram's appearance, manner, and work. Before she would quite surrender to this heart-sickening belief, however, she determined to ask Bertram himself. Falteringly, but resolutely, therefore, one day, she questioned him. \u201cBertram, once you hinted that the picture did not go right because you were troubled over something; and I've been wondering--was it about--me, in any way, that you were troubled?\u201d Billy had her answer before the man spoke."}, {"size": 693, "text": "She had it in the quick terror that sprang to his eyes, and the dull red that swept from his neck to his forehead. His reply, so far as words went did not count, for it evaded everything and told nothing. But Billy knew without words. She knew, too, what she must do. For the time being she took Bertram's evasive answer as he so evidently wished it to be taken; but that evening, after he had gone, she wrote him a little note and broke the engagement. So heartbroken was she--and so fearful was she that he should suspect this--that her note, when completed, was a cold little thing of few words, which carried no hint that its very coldness was but the heart-break in the disguise of pride."}, {"size": 881, "text": "This was like Billy in all ways. Billy, had she lived in the days of the Christian martyrs, would have been the first to walk with head erect into the Arena of Sacrifice. The arena now was just everyday living, the lions were her own devouring misery, and the cause was Bertram's best good. From Bertram's own self she had it now--that she had been the cause of his being troubled; so she could doubt no longer. The only part that was uncertain was the reason why he had been troubled. Whether his bond to her had become irksome because of his love for another, or because of his love for no girl--except to paint, Billy did not know. But that it was irksome she did not doubt now. Besides, as if she were going to slay his Art, stifle his Ambition, destroy his Inspiration, and be a nuisance generally just so that _she_ might be happy! Indeed, no!

Then there came to her the memory of Bertram's face as it had looked the night before when she had asked him if she were the cause of his being troubled. There came, too, the memory of Kate's scathing \u201cDo you want to ruin his career?\u201d Even the hated magazine article and Marie's tragic \u201cI've _hindered_ him!\u201d added their mite; and Billy knew that she should not go to the telephone, nor summon Bertram."}, {"size": 621, "text": "The one fatal mistake now would be to let Bertram see her own distress. If once he should suspect how she suffered in doing this thing, there would be a scene that Billy felt she had not the courage to face. She must, therefore, manage in some way not to see Bertram--not to let him see her until she felt more sure of her self-control no matter what he said. The easiest way to do this was, of course, to go away. But where? How? She must think. Meanwhile, for these first few hours, she would not tell any one, even Aunt Hannah, what had happened.

When people try to \u201cact exactly as usual,\u201d they generally end in acting quite the opposite; and Billy was no exception to the rule. Hence her attempted cheerfulness became flippantness, and her laughter giggles that rang too frequently to be quite sincere--though from Aunt Hannah it all elicited only an affectionate smile at \u201cthe dear child's high spirits.\u201d A little later, when Aunt Hannah was glancing over the morning paper--now no longer barred from the door--she gave a sudden cry."}, {"size": 756, "text": "\u201cBilly, just listen to this!\u201d she exclaimed, reading from the paper in her hand. \u201c'A new tenor in \u201cThe Girl of the Golden West.\u201d Appearance of Mr. M.

Arkwright is said to have a fine voice, a particularly good stage presence, and a purity of tone and smoothness of execution that few of his age and experience can show.

When you were so troubled that the picture didn't go well, and I found out it was about me you were troubled--I--\u201d \u201cWell?\u201d Bertram's voice was a little strained. \u201cWhy, of--of course,\u201d stammered Billy, \u201cI couldn't help thinking that maybe you had found out you _didn't_ want me.\u201d \u201c_Didn't want you!_\u201d groaned Bertram, his tense muscles relaxing. \u201cMay I ask why?\u201d"}, {"size": 794, "text": "\u201cI wasn't quite sure why,\u201d she faltered; \u201conly, of course, I thought of--of Miss Winthrop, you know, or that maybe it was because you didn't care for _any_ girl, only to paint--oh, oh, Bertram! Pete told us,\u201d she broke off wildly, beginning to sob. \u201cPete told you that I didn't care for any girl, only to paint?\u201d demanded Bertram, angry and mystified. \u201cNo, no,\u201d sobbed Billy, \u201cnot that. It was all the others that told me that! Pete told Aunt Hannah about the accident, you know, and he said--he said--Oh, Bertram, I _can't_ say it! But that's one of the things that made me know I _could_ come now, you see, because I--I wouldn't hinder you, nor slay your Art, nor any other of those dreadful things if--if you couldn't ever--p-paint again,\u201d finished Billy in an uncontrollable burst of grief."}, {"size": 619, "text": "\u201cThere, there, dear,\u201d comforted Bertram, patting the bronze-gold head on his breast. \u201cI haven't the faintest idea what you're talking about--except the last; but I know there _can't_ be anything that ought to make you cry like that. As for my not painting again--you didn't understand Pete, dearie. That was what they were afraid of at first--that I'd lose my arm; but that danger is all past now. I'm loads better. Of course I'm going to paint again--and better than ever before--_now!_\u201d Billy lifted her head. A look that was almost terror came to her eyes.

Oh, no, Bertram--never that!\u201d she faltered, still regarding him with fearful eyes. \u201cIt's only--for _me_, you know. I _can't_ go back now, and not have you--after this!--even if I do hinder you, and--\u201d \u201c_Hinder me!_ What are you talking about, Billy?\u201d Billy drew a quivering sigh. \u201cWell, to begin with, Kate said--\u201d \u201cGood heavens! Is Kate in _this_, too?\u201d Bertram's voice was savage now. \u201cWell, she wrote a letter.\u201d \u201cI'll warrant she did! Great Scott, Billy! Don't you know Kate by this time?\u201d \u201cY-yes, I said so, too."}, {"size": 762, "text": "But, Bertram, what she wrote was true.

Well, dearie, I don't know yet what you found, but I do know you wouldn't have found it at all if it hadn't been for Kate--and I wish I had her here this minute!\u201d Billy giggled hysterically. \u201cI don't--not _right_ here,\u201d she cooed, nestling comfortably against her lover's arm. \u201cBut you see, dear, she never _has_ approved of the marriage.\u201d \u201cWell, who's doing the marrying--she, or I?\u201d \u201cThat's what I said, too--only in another way,\u201d sighed Billy. \u201cBut she called us flyaway flutterbudgets, and she said I'd ruin your career, if I did marry you.\u201d \u201cWell, I can tell you right now, Billy, you will ruin it if you don't!\u201d declared Bertram."}, {"size": 689, "text": "\u201cThat's what ailed me all the time I was painting that miserable portrait.

I was scared blue, Billy, with jealousy of--Arkwright.\u201d Billy laughed gayly--but she shifted her position and did not meet her lover's eyes. \u201cArkwright? Nonsense!\u201d she cried. \u201cWhy, he's going to marry Alice Greggory. I know he is! I can see it as plain as day in her letters. He's there a lot.\u201d \u201cAnd you never did think for a minute, Billy, that you cared for him?\u201d Bertram's gaze searched Billy's face a little fearfully."}, {"size": 602, "text": "He had not been slow to mark that swift lowering of her eyelids.

There's a new law about the license. We've _got_ to wait five days--and maybe more, counting in the notice, and all.\u201d Billy laughed softly. \u201cFive days, indeed, sir!
